"This is quite possible, for I am sure that pensioners - who fill all the markets of the European Union every morning - will be among the first to understand the relationship between the euro and their national currency."
"I believe I can make a small contribution to this effort: I will have posters put up in the areas in Italy in which I was a candidate for the elections, calling upon the Italian Government to raise the minimum pension to EUR 500."
"The poster will not specify exactly what this amount corresponds to in Italian lire, and this will force all the citizens to find out the value of EUR 500 in lire."
"It is a shame that the Government will not accept this proposal, but, at least it will serve to teach the Italian pensioner citizens the value of the euro."
"Mr President, as I and many colleagues have argued for some time, the monetary union project is profoundly dangerous."
"It is economically naive and will do huge macroeconomic damage."
"Politically it is clearly intended to undermine the nation state, and thus it threatens democracy in Europe."
"The proposal before us talks of information on the euro, but we already have all the information we need."
"Every newspaper I open has stories about the euro."
"Banks and accountancy firms are running seminars and briefing clients."
"This is not about information, this is about propaganda."
"I do not trust the Commission to provide unbiased information."
"The very idea is absurd."
"I was particularly horrified by the idea of Mrs Randzio-Plath that we should actually enrol schoolchildren as the stormtroopers of this euro propaganda blitz."
"Now, if the 12 euro countries wish to undertake a propaganda campaign, that is no business of mine."
"But in three countries, Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain, the euro decision is not yet made."
"It would be a gross abuse of the democratic process for the Commission to undertake a euro propaganda campaign in those countries before referenda on the currency take place."
"It would be outrageous to take money from the taxpayer and to use it to influence the voters' decision."
"In Britain, 70% of people are opposed to joining the euro."
"We do not want our money spent on promoting it either in the UK or elsewhere."
"I therefore have two demands to make of the Commission."
"Firstly, please tell us today that no such campaign will be undertaken in Great Britain, Denmark or Sweden."
"Secondly, please assure us that the share of funding which might have been spent on those countries is returned to their national exchequers so that people can see clearly and transparently that their money has not been squandered on objectives they do not support."
"Better still, cancel the whole project and put all the funds into a special account to help defray the enormous costs that will be incurred when the euro is eventually dismantled."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for his report, and all of you for participating in the debate."
"Mr Karas' s report contains many interesting elements, including 38 proposals, which in many cases coincide with the proposal in the Commission' s communication in February and, in other cases - as he has explained very well in his initial statement -, are proposals which fine-tune, improve and even extend some of the initiatives."
"Having made this initial comment, I would like to clarify certain points which I consider to be essential."
"Firstly, the communication is part of a very complex operation, that is, the introduction of the euro, in the form of coins and notes, on 1 January 2002."
"Secondly, in the application of this process of introducing the coins and notes, the principle of subsidiarity plays a fundamental role."
"This means that the Member States, through their governments and central banks, are fundamental to the whole process and also to the operation of providing information."
"Our role as Commission consists, in some cases, of persuading, in others, of acting and, in the majority of cases, of communicating to the Member States ideas which they can or cannot apply, and, in some other cases, of proposing specific actions."
"The main concern at the moment is to determine the level of preparation of Member States, companies and citizens."
"With regard to the Member States, I can tell you that next week I will present the Commission with a report on the practical application of the euro."
"This will contain a summary of the situation of the national plans for the introduction of the euro in each of the Member States."
"Companies are the special objective of the information campaign at the moment."
"According to the latest information available, regarding September, approximately 88% of small and medium-sized businesses assure us that they are prepared for the euro or, at least, are aware of the need to prepare themselves now."
"Nevertheless, this figure would be deceptive if I were not to give two additional figures, or make two additional comments."
"Firstly, of this 88%, only 22% have already implemented the plans necessary for the introduction of the euro."
"As for the rest, there is a certain contradiction between this position, which in theory is so favourable to the companies, and the lack of use of the euro in normal operations at the moment."
"To put it another way, we have the impression that companies view the operation with relative optimism, in the belief that it will be easier than it may turn out to be."
"This is the reason why we believe that we must pay special attention to companies during this period, as well as to citizens."
"The Commission intends to implement certain specific actions, apart from the July communication, regular reports to ECOFIN, a proposal on counterfeiting, which will be presented before the end of the year, and also a series of measures necessary for coordination."
"I would like to make some comments relating to the various points mentioned in the debate."
"On the whole, the proposals in the communication coincide with the proposals which have been made here."
"Nevertheless, there are certain points which deserve additional comment."
"Firstly, what action must we take in the 'pre-in' countries or in third countries?"
"The countries which are not currently members of the Monetary Union have the right, like other Member States, to information campaigns."
"This will clearly happen, as long as those countries want it to happen."
"Two of them, for the moment, Denmark and the United Kingdom, have not shown any interest in implementing these information campaigns."
"Your recommendations include many of the actions which, in our opinion, must be asked of the Member States and, to this end, we will send a communication to the different countries so that they may take account of them."
"I would like to highlight certain very interesting aspects which have been mentioned such as paying special attention to training, schools, women, specific sectors, such as tourism, or the tremendously interesting initiative of the distribution of price tables, or the initial or additional obligations of public administrations."
"We will communicate to the banking sector your proposals on the possibility of using some of the 'savings days' for information purposes, and we will move forward on all aspects relating to charges on the exchange rate."
"The Commission is favourable to the idea that there should not be a differential between the charges made for cross-border operations and for national operations."
"Two additional comments."
"The Commission is absolutely prepared to work with Parliament, with the European Central Bank and with the Member States in order to implement a programme which is more efficient, bearing in mind however that, in accordance with the current model, approximately two thirds of the total expenditure of the programme will be met by the Member States, according to their specific programmes."
"With regard to the possibility of providing more resources or extending the information process, as proposed in the Karas report, the Commission is in favour of both options."
"Of course, we will have to debate them in the future, when we discuss the budgets for the coming years."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Use of certain dangerous substances and preparations"
"The next item is the report (A5-0149/2000) by Mr Arvidsson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the 22nd time Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (phthalates) and amending Council Directive 88/378/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys [COM(1999) 577 - C5-0276/1999 - 1999/0238 (COD)]"
"Mr President, there are two reasons for this report on phthalates in toys: firstly, these substances are a health risk to young children, and secondly several Member States have already adopted their own laws in this area, which is why this report is aimed at reestablishing the common market for toys."
"When we deal with issues relating to the health of young children, the commitment is often strong, wholehearted and sincere."
"According to experts in the World Health Organisation, it is not possible to prove that phthalates are carcinogens."
"However, the WHO thinks that phthalates may cause reproductive damage and hormonal disturbances, mainly amongst young children who are exposed to large amounts of phthalates."
"For scientific reasons, phthalates have, in common with other toxic substances, been assigned limit values which give the highest recommended exposure level based on calculated risk levels."
"I want to emphasise that this handling of phthalates does not deviate from toxicological routine."
"The Commission' s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment has evaluated the risks posed by a number of phthalates and has thereby unanimously established that the two phthalates that are far and away the most common in toys and articles used in childcare are in danger of causing the limit values to be exceeded in the case of young children and of causing health problems."
"In this scientific assessment, it is a concern for young children' s health that is being expressed."
"These are children who are at the teething stage, which is a time when they often bite and suck on all sorts of objects."
"I would like to caution Parliament against making decisions that go far beyond what is justified by the scientific basis for this standpoint."
"I am all in favour of information and informed consumers who can make their own choices, but the labelling that has been proposed by the Commission does not provide information but, rather, a sharp warning."
"People who read this warning will not buy these toys for their children or grandchildren."
"In this way, the warning will constitute an indirect ban."
"In addition, the process of labelling toys is expensive and difficult to carry out in practice."
"Tradesmen and tradesmen's organisations have informed me that staff in shops have neither the time nor the knowledge to answer all the questions that customers are going to ask."
"Introducing this warning system on toys designed for older children is likely to be tantamount to an extended ban."
"The Scientific Committee has identified two phthalates used in toys that may be hazardous to young children' s health."
"A decision in favour of a limited ban on these grounds would not primarily be based on the precautionary principle, but on the routine procedure for dealing with toxic chemical substances."
"To ban all of the 350 or so currently known phthalates is to proceed on the assumption that all phthalates are associated with more or less the same risks."
"However, there is no scientific basis for this assumption."
"Once these phthalates are no longer used in toys, further risk assessments and the proposed review of this directive in two years' time ought to be sufficient."
"In this short presentation of the document, I wanted to stress the fact that decisions ought to be based on scientific grounds and should cover the high-risk group that has been identified, i.e. young children, as well as the fact that the labelling of toys is very difficult to implement."
"There is still no scientifically approved method for migration tests which could partly replace the proposed legislation, and no such method should therefore be alluded to in the legislative text."
"Speakers will also put forward their own assessments of the scientific basis."
"Allow me to anticipate these and state that politicians ought to listen to scientific assessments and conclusions and not try to make their own assessments of the scientific research material."
"It is my hope that this report and tomorrow's decision will make the world a safer place for young children."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs let me state in very clear and simple terms the position of the committee as we voted; (a) to ban all phthalates and (b) as a consequence to delete all labelling, since if you prohibit all phthalates you do not need labelling."
"As the rapporteur, I share the concerns of the Members of Parliament in my committee."
"As elected politicians we clearly cannot afford to play fast and loose with children's health."
"We must ensure that they are not exposed to unnecessary and unacceptable health risks and acknowledge the public concern on this issue."
"In the interests of the single market we must achieve the highest common standards for product safety."
"We also need legislation which cannot be undermined or discredited by legal challenges."
"This debate has unfortunately been clouded by confusion and uncertainty fuelled by comments in Parliament from Scientific Committee members who doubted the need for any ban on phthalates and questioned whether the health risks are serious or immediate enough to warrant a ban."
"As politicians we need clear advice from scientific committees if we are to make rational judgements, take the necessary risk management measures and produce good legislation."
"In this case we have not been able to do that effectively because of the gaps in our knowledge, and so my committee understandably decided to go for a blanket ban."
"Nor do we have any information on substitutes to plasticisers which might have toxic or chronic effects."
"I believe that this legislation shows us that we need action on a number of areas: (a) we urgently need to continue work on migration testing and research into chronic toxicity and the behaviour of children; (b) we need to review and update this legislation periodically and as gaps in knowledge are filled, where necessary add new substances to the ban in the Commission's legislation."
"We need to formalise and accept the permanent ban which the Commission is proposing now and we need stringent health warnings and labelling to inform our consumers of the risks."
"We have to answer to the public on the legislation that we produce in Parliament, and we cannot afford to be complacent about risks to children's health."
"Mr President, the discussion on the harmfulness of phthalates, or plastic softeners, has been dragging on for a long time."
"Today, we in Parliament need to speak out regarding the desirability of a total ban on these substances."
"Let it be clear that no one in our Group disputes the many useful applications that phthalates have, such as cable casings, and also uses in medical equipment."
"The snag is that phthalates are also used to soften children' s toys, many of which end up in their mouths, even if they are not intended for that purpose."
"When, in 1998, reports emerged about the possible harmful effects on children' s health, the European Commission proposed - or tried to propose at any rate - a ban on the application of certain phthalates."
"Intense consultation with industry to establish a ban from within and to introduce self-regulation in the processing of these substances, came to nothing."
"In my opinion, and I say this on behalf of the Group, that was very much a missed opportunity."
"It strikes me as rather odd, though, that the harmfulness of the substances has not been established beyond question."
"Accordingly, in response to the Commission' s action, we have met with a barrage of contradictory research studies."
"Consumer organisations pointed out the harmful potential, while industry tried to demonstrate that things were not all that bad."
"The chairman of the scientific committee too was dragged into the debate, which was certainly not an ideal situation."
"It is now up to us to assess the proposals."
"I have not seen a proposal as ridiculous and complex as this one for a long time."
"I do not know how harmful these phthalates are, but if I do not know, then I need to at least ban a number of these phthalates in line with the precautionary principle, because, in my view, this is also what the internal market wants."
"Consequently, I hope that the plenary opts in favour of safety, in line with the precautionary principle. Research, however, should not grind to a halt, but rather come up with alternatives to these softeners."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the proposal for a directive we have here as an inadequate attempt to ban the use of six phthalates in toys for infants under three years old on the basis of the opinion of the Scientific Committee."
"As I see it, this goes no further than accepting the inevitable, and the proposal does not comply with the precautionary principle, which it is particularly important to apply when it comes to small children."
"Until it has been proved that all phthalates are harmless, there is no place for plasticisers in toys for children under three."
"Children in this age group will put any toy in their mouths."
"They learn about the shape of toys and the materials used to make them by putting toys in their mouths, and these children should be able to suck toys like this without any risk to their health."
"This can only be achieved by a ban on all phthalates in toys."
"We also need labelling for the three to six age group."
"This is not only because there are smaller children who play with toys produced for older children, but also because there are also children in this age group who still suck things."
"In addition, we want to help parents in deciding what to buy and in sorting out what toys are unsuitable for their children."
"The amendments before us, which call for a review after two years, for the evaluation of new test methods and for scientific studies on the dangers of PVC products, are helpful in maximising health protection for us all in the long term, not just for small children."
"To sum up then, it is for us to decide whether to opt for the precautionary principle and a high degree of protection, or whether we intend to hide behind scientific reports, which can, however, never relieve us of the responsibility of taking the necessary political decisions."
"Mr President, I cannot deny that this issue is extremely tricky for the Liberal Group."
"The problem of phthalates in children' s toys is receiving wide public attention and the campaign which focuses on this problem, largely in the hands of Greenpeace, can be termed extremely successful."
"This is only natural and right, of course, because children are helpless and are entitled to protection."
"We know that phthalates in animal trials - in itself not a very pleasant thought - proved harmful, and we can therefore assume that they will be harmful to people, too."
"But we do not know to what extent they would be harmful, or in what dosage. Neither do we know for which application they are harmful or whether there are alternatives, and how harmful these would be and in what form."
"As there is no usable test, the question arises as to the basis on which we pursue our policy?"
"As far as this is concerned, we cannot shake off the impression that this decision is premature in a way."
"But anyway, it is now before us."
"Phthalates are intended to soften PVC toys, but the substances leach out, certainly if the toys are chewed, as they in fact are by small children, of course."
"As far as we know, not many alternatives appear viable either."
"We value the assertive course which our rapporteur has taken and we therefore back the thrust of his proposal, that is to say we endorse a ban on this type of toy for children under the age of three, provided it is extensive."
"If we go for this option, then we should at least be consistent."
"In our view, therefore, this ban should apply to all toys, not just those intended for sucking and chewing."
"We also believe that we should look into toys for older children, although we should still have this option available once the test methods are there."
"I am interested to see what the European Commission' s opinion would be on this."
"What do you think of these test methods and what is your view on revising these regulations once they are there?"
"We are in favour of a ban on the six tested phthalates, but are as yet unable to ban all the other phthalates and softeners, which may indeed be harmful."
"This may well be possible at the time when we have more data available that demonstrates that they are actually harmful."
"We have insufficient data available at this stage to establish this."
"On a final note, how far do we take the precautionary principle at the end of the day?"
"As far as we are concerned, the principle should not mean that we simply reject everything we are not completely sure about at the moment."
"Mr President, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left think that this is a very good, clear and precise example of a situation in which the precautionary principal should be applied."
"There are very clear warning signs with regard to the risks associated with phthalates."
"Experiments on animals show that phthalates cause damage to the liver, kidneys and testicles."
"With this in mind, it would be totally absurd to allow these substances to be used in toys, which children can put in their mouths - something children very often do."
"These substances, phthalates, are a very large constituent of the toys concerned -and quite large percentages may be present in them."
"It is clear that these substances will leak out and that children will then ingest them via their mouths."
"It is also completely absurd to believe that a warning label would be sufficient when it comes to young children."
"It is obvious that children who are only a few years old cannot assimilate a warning text."
"Once they have the toy in their hands, it is, as it were, too late."
"Therefore, the only sensible thing to do is to implement as extensive a ban as is possible in this case."
"The Commission's proposal is also completely insufficient for this."
"A ban is already in place in several Member States, as several speakers have already mentioned."
"If the legislation is now too weak in this area, there is a risk that the Member States that have taken steps forward in this area will have legislation forced on them that is worse than what they already have - according to the bizarre logic that exists with regard to the single market, i.e. that the market is always put before considerations relating to health or the environment."
"I consider that this would be extremely unfortunate."
"The rapporteur for this report is a member of the Swedish Moderate Party."
"We are usually clear political opponents - I am a member of the Swedish Left Party."
"Our opinions differ also in this case, but I also know that Mr Arvidsson has been subjected to quite a lot of pressure and harsh criticism from sections of his own Group because he has not been sufficiently industry-friendly."
"I think it says something about him that he has resisted some of this criticism."
"Mr President, this debate again confirms Parliament's commitment to public health and indeed to environmental issues as well, and I welcome the opportunity to make a brief intervention."
"It is well known that PVC may present a risk when used in toys for young children."
"The proposal to amend the original directive on this matter will ban the marketing of toys and childcare articles containing PVC which are designed to be placed in the mouths of children under the age of three."
"I welcome the fact that in future health warnings will have to apply in relation to the manufacture of these products."
"Every time the European Parliament has debated this issue there have been increasing doubts as to the safety of these toys which derive from PVC."
"Another problem is clearly the fact that much of the scientific evidence on these matters is conflicting."
"We know that when there is doubt about a particular measure, the European Parliament must apply the precautionary principle."
"This principle in essence means that safety and health must be put before any conflicting scientific evidence, and I fully support the previous speakers who again referred to the importance of applying the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, last month, we held a debate on tobacco."
"The risks to public health when using tobacco are clear and scientifically proven."
"This is not so for the use of phthalates in toys."
"Although a ban on the use of tobacco was not even entertained as a serious option, a large majority within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection did go along with a ban on phthalates (softeners) in toys."
"Although after 40 years of use, no cases of damage to health are known, the seed of suspicion has nonetheless been sown that softeners are harmful."
"In accordance with the precautionary principle, this possible harmfulness has to be underpinned scientifically."
"The studies included tests on animals, which is common practice with regard to suspected substances."
"These tests resulted in a so-called 'acceptable daily intake' for animals."
"For humans, a further safety margin of a factor of 100 was added on."
"By testing toys, it can be indicated whether or not this 'acceptable daily intake' is exceeded in the case of humans."
"On this basis, toys can be approved or rejected."
"In short, this is a method based on an acceptable margin, taking a generous safety margin into consideration."
"By launching an extensive campaign, spearheaded by Greenpeace, it was possible to convince many policy-makers and politicians of the need to institute an immediate ban."
"I can understand that; emotions run high where children are involved."
"The argument that children are affected, however, is two-sided: children eat and drink all kinds of things which entail a certain health risk."
"Why are these risks accepted and not others?"
"It is my impression that this issue is being played up in order to use this ban as a weapon in the fight against other substances."
"I fear that if we now vote in favour of a ban on phthalates, this will unleash a witch-hunt against all kinds of substances, without any scientific basis."
"Moreover, we do not know what the harmful effects of alternatives will be."
"These reasons also indicate that a ban on phthalates contravenes the correct application of the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, Mr Arvidsson, I fully appreciate the work which you have done on this report."
"I would like to concentrate here on the application of the precautionary principle and on the difficulties in this case of dealing with an issue on which scientific considerations are confused and mixed up with emotional considerations, as well as a long history of disagreements between the industry of PVC and its derivatives and the environmental lobby, which, of course, is also deeply involved with this issue of phthalates."
"We are talking about risks to children' s health."
"This is of interest to all of us, certainly."
"However, we must not forget that we are also talking, with reasonable certainty, about the harmful effects of six phthalates, and also, with a degree of uncertainty, of the other substances belonging to this group."
"To ban all of them, as a precaution, may not be a good decision since this may mean abandoning an area of research which is being pursued at the moment, in order to opt for substitutes whose harmful effects we know even less about."
"In this respect, there is one good example: four years ago, given the opinion that silicon implants may be carcinogenic, several countries adopted an alternative substance for their manufacture based on soya oil."
"A few days ago the United Kingdom banned these implants and is gratuitously withdrawing existing stocks, having discovered that they are carcinogenic."
"The social and health cost of a hasty decision may be medically and economically irreparable."
"The scientific evidence demanded in Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 24 seem to me to be absolutely necessary in any event, but especially in the case of this type of issue where lives are at stake and where we are likely to punish or benefit certain production sectors."
"Mr President, we congratulate Mr Arvidsson for his hard work."
"He is in the unusual position of producing a report on Commission action which has already been taken and it is the way it has been taken that we are to some extent talking about here."
"The ban on a range of identified phthalates was precautionary."
"It attracted broad support and was also in line with the accepted practices of a number of Member States."
"If we were simply balancing the health and safety of children against the needs and priorities of industry there would be no contest, but there are related issues which we should address."
"The first is how the Commission handles the scientific advice available to it."
"Was it done in a balanced way?"
"Does it give us confidence that this powerful and sometimes necessary weapon of a product ban was used correctly?"
"I am not sure about this and I want to return to it in an explanation of vote."
"Secondly, on the wider issue of PVCs in general, how soon will we get the kind of migration testing from which phthalates' safety can be assessed and the review which is called for in one of the amendments?"
"We also need information about when the substitutes which the industry may introduce will be open to equivalent testing."
"It is no good banning something if you are unsure about what will replace it."
"On the issue of labelling, I am sorry to see that there are amendments against this."
"Personally I believe that we have to have it, certainly for children up to the age of six, although some will argue that that leads to another kind de facto ban."
"Essentially, the number of plastic objects which could be put in the mouth and swallowed is increasing."
"This House should be more concerned if it went to bed worried that it had done too much, than if it woke up finding it had done too little."
"The precautionary principle should rule."
"Mr President, the Commission's approach to this whole issue is totally inadequate."
"The fact is that you have accepted a ban on the substance we are speaking about for certain objects, for example teething rings."
"We all know that children under three put toys in their mouths."
"Allowing the sale of objects containing dangerous substances which children will put in their mouths goes completely against the precautionary approach."
"To justify this by saying that we label them is completely ridiculous."
"Children under three years of age cannot read and even children up to the age of six are not really capable of reading and even if they are, are they really competent to make decisions on this?"
"What is happening here is that the Commission and others are bowing to the pressures of industry."
"When we talk about the precautionary approach, Mr Blokland is wrong."
"We should be looking for materials and substances for children's toys where there is no doubt about safety whatsoever."
"In banning some of the objects the Commission recognises that these substances are dangerous."
"It is just not acceptable to turn a blind eye to the others because of pressure from industry."
"Which comes first: children's health or the vested interests of industry?"
"We must take the precautionary approach."
"Mr President, it is high time that a total ban were introduced on phthalates in all toys for children under three years of age, as is already the case in Denmark."
"It is quite unacceptable that we can get into a situation in which we are going to reduce the level of safety for our children."
"I know that the Commission is very busy, but is it acceptable never to have time to attend to one' s own children?"
"Now, I see that the Commissioner is not listening. Perhaps he does not have time to do that, either."
"Anyone who did go to the trouble of observing their children would quickly discover, as has already been said a number of times, that children suck away at anything they get their hands on, and not only on things that are intended to be put into their mouths."
"In Denmark, investigations have been carried out which show that the quality of the semen of young men appearing before army medical boards is 40% poorer than that of the 50 year-olds."
"It can no longer be taken for granted that people can have children, and suspicions are mounting where phthalates are concerned."
"It is only four months since the Commission sent out a communication of just under 30 pages concerning the precautionary principle."
"Is it not only right to put all the fine words into practice now about protecting health and the environment and to make use of this principle in an area we still know very little about?"
"If the precautionary principle is not to be employed in respect of one of the most vulnerable consumer groups - our children - it is very difficult to imagine when, in fact, it is to be employed."
"I should like to know why the Commission only wants the six phthalates which have been investigated to be banned, instead of them all."
"I support Mr Arvidsson' s report which - unlike the Commission' s proposal, which is open to criticism - takes our children' s health seriously."
"I think still further action needs to be taken and a ban imposed with no restriction on age, but I hope at least that Amendment 20 will be adopted."
"Mr President, some speakers in the House today have said somewhat critically that this discussion is dominated by 'emotions' ."
"I think that it is a healthy sign in the House if it really is emotions that are setting the agenda for the discussion when children' s health is at stake."
"It is better for it to be emotions that govern this discussion than for it to be industry!"
"In our private lives, in our own homes, we take all the safety precautions we can in order to take care of our own children."
"We put safety locks on the doors, we put barriers in front of ovens etc. because we know that it is dangerous to be a child."
"I think that we should behave in the same way even when we are in this House."
"We have enough information to make the necessary decisions."
"It is not the children who must prove that toys are dangerous but the producers who must prove that they are in fact safe."
"This is a principle which should apply to all consumer protection, but particularly protection in relation to children."
"Several speakers here have said that we know that these substances can be hazardous to health."
"Several Member States have already imposed a ban on phthalates in toys for children under the age of three."
"The precautionary principle must be applied!"
"Hopefully, more nations and countries may also realise that this is necessary."
"The Commission's proposal is neither sensible nor sufficient."
"I can only imagine a situation at a play school or a nursery school where the nursery teacher has to try to keep a check on which children are under and which are over three years of age as well as which children are allowed to put what in their mouths in accordance with all the experiments the Commission is trying to include."
"It is, of course, possible for the Commission to issue a special directive concerning what nursery school staff, or other adults, should do when they have more than one child to take care of."
"The only sensible solution is a ban, a total ban, when it comes to toys for children under three years of age."
"Our aim must be to limit the occasions on which we subject ourselves and our children to dangerous chemicals."
"In this case it is taking an unnecessary risk to permit the use of chemical substances in toys which affect those that are smallest and most vulnerable in society."
"Mr President, I congratulate my friend and colleague Mr Arvidsson on attempting to make sense of this draft directive."
"Of course, if young children are at risk then it is right to take action to remove that risk."
"The question on PVC softeners in young children's chewing toys is: Who says there is definitely a risk?"
"The answer is no-one."
"Who says there could remotely be a risk?"
"The answer is Mr Suresh Rastogi, a Danish researcher who used the phthalates he happened to have in his laboratory."
"His research has never been confirmed by peer review - indeed it was rejected by the Commission's own scientific committee, the CSTEE."
"Of the six named phthalates to be banned as a result, two are used for flooring and cosmetics but not for children's toys, one is not used at all, one is not made at all, one is not used because of fears it might be carcinogenic (though on 8 February it was totally cleared by the WHO) and that leaves one, DINP that is used to soften PVC in chewing rings and so on."
"So, what does the CSTEE say about this?"
"It said that there was no identifiable risk that could lead to a justified ban, that they were safe if they were used according to existing rules."
"The CSTEE met and decided on 25 November."
"On 22 November, three days earlier, the Commission had imposed a temporary ban, and we have to ask the Commission why."
"It is only justified under the general product safety directive if there is 'immediate and serious risk'."
"If that cannot be shown clearly, then the legality of the temporary ban can and should be questioned in this case."
"Indeed, the case was to be brought to court but was put on hold when the Commission agreed to work to produce validation systems for the test methods by the end of this year; so we can test these and test the alternatives."
"Why is the Commission rushing forward now?"
"Why are the CSTEE minutes not published until April, and why has a statement critical of the Commission's misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the research still not been published?"
"Crying wolf damages the credibility of the precautionary principle."
"I ask the Commission to answer these questions today, and to get its internal scaremongers under control."
"Mr President, I think there is every reason to thank both the Commission and Mr Arvidsson: the Commission because, in spite of criticism, it has come up with a proposal in this area, and Mr Arvidsson because I think that, with his report, we are obtaining a responsible framework for the use of phthalates in toys."
"Phthalates are, of course, a group of chemicals there is every possible reason for being on guard against, not only in connection with toys but also more generally."
"We know that they are suspected of possibly causing cancer, as well as disturbing the balance of hormones."
"I am therefore in favour of banning all phthalates in toys designed for the smallest children."
"If we were not to make use of the precautionary principle in this case, I find it hard to see when the principle might be applied at all."
"There are some who have argued that banning the use of phthalates in toys would have an adverse effect upon the plastics industry and upon employment in that industry."
"We also heard this argument in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I think the argument is completely unacceptable."
"If it were in fact to be accepted, then any restriction at all upon the use of dangerous chemicals, not merely in toys but also in foodstuffs and other products, would be prevented."
"I personally should like to see the ban we are now devising extended to cover toys designed for children of between three and six years of age."
"That would be the ideal situation, but I am inclined to vote in favour of the present proposed compromise whereby, as a first step, there should be a warning label on toys for that group."
"I also think it would be sensible to review the directive in no more than a couple of years' time against the background of new scientific knowledge, including knowledge which can tell us for certain whether we should also intervene in the case of phthalates in products other than toys."
"I think that would be a sensible health policy."
"As other colleagues have said, this is a thoroughly odd proposal."
"It is a very bad proposal and I hope that Mr Liikanen when he speaks will agree to suspend it."
"I do not think it should be withdrawn, I think it should be suspended."
"I am concerned about the precedent that this proposal will set."
"The precautionary principle is very sensibly described in a recent Commission paper."
"There is an obvious danger of applying it too widely because it brings the European Union approach into disrepute."
"For example, a thousand people a year - no doubt some of them small children - die in England and Wales while falling downstairs."
"I do hope that does not mean that we are going to see a European Union regulation restricting us all to living in bungalows."
"This proposal suggests that, on emotive subjects, the Commission is prepared to act on the basis of that emotion, without the kind of sensible assessment of risk that we need here, as we do for example on risks in foodstuffs."
"There has to be, even with the precautionary principle, a substantial link between the assessment of risk and action by the European Union."
"If not, then surely we do not even need a European Food Agency: we can just legislate on the basis of the precautionary principle."
"It is the Commission's task to assess that risk."
"In this case I am not satisfied, as Mr Bowis has said, that the Commission really heeded the advice of its own advisers."
"When the chairman of the scientific committee came to us he most certainly did not convey to us any sense of the urgent need for action."
"The conclusion I draw from this is that in future, to avoid this kind of emotive reaction on an emotive subject, we should have a European Union chemicals agency, which will not be the creature of the Commission, to assess risks."
"I am concerned that the science behind this proposal is incomplete."
"Yes, eight Member States have banned phthalates, but when the Commissioner replies, can he tell us whether those eight Member States have supplied the Commission with the scientific evidence that they based their ban on?"
"We also lack the evidence on migration limits, and that has been mentioned."
"That might have enabled the Commission to bring forward a proposal we could all agree with."
"What we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal."
"Six phthalates are identified, and a system of warnings proposed that makes no sense."
"The Environment Committee has taken the logical step that the Commission avoided."
"If these are dangerous, then they should all be banned and warnings would then be unnecessary."
"The only problem with this is that the action is then quite disproportionate to the risk, and sets a thoroughly bad precedent for future European Union action in relation to the chemicals we use."
"Mr President, the matter under discussion concerns children, and is therefore highly emotive."
"I know that very well, as a mother of three."
"Furthermore, the facts available to us are such that there are very good reasons why people might end up expressing exactly opposite points of view, all of which might be quite valid."
"The person making the decision should look at the issue calmly."
"Parliament has even shown a desire to ban all of the nearly 350 phthalates instead of the six proposed by the Commission."
"However, there is some kind of evidence of the possibility of danger in the case of only two phthalates."
"In addition, a warning was called for on products designed for 3 - 6 year olds, although the risk is likely to be associated with very small children, who like to put things in their mouths, in their discovery of the world."
"Reliable migration tests in respect of phthalates are not available, however."
"It is excellent that the EU is active in this matter, as seven Member States have already introduced national regulations."
"What is even better is that the issue is being dealt with in a consistent way."
"In my opinion, Mr Arvidsson has made a rational and responsible contribution to the issue, and is applying the EU precautionary principle to this problem of toxicity properly."
"The precautionary principle is a very important tool in environmental legislation."
"It should only be used, however, when there is scientific reason to suppose there is a real risk."
"This therefore concerns the existence of a scientifically demonstrable risk and the reaction to it, not the existence of a fear that might surround the substance."
"You can cry wolf once too often."
"Neither is it sufficiently justifiable to resort to the precautionary principle if, for example, some Member States have introduced national legislation in this area."
"Parliament' s struggle to ensure the safety of children is very worthwhile in a Union that often just concentrates on hard values."
"Parliament will be doing the safety of children and everyone else a disservice, however, if it erodes the basis of the precautionary principle, the possibility of a real risk."
"That is what we are in danger of doing in the case of phthalates."
"What sort of repercussions will it have, for example, on food safety?"
"It is at least as important today to make sure we preserve the precautionary principle for future needs as it is to take a decision on the banning of phthalates."
"Finally, I would like to say that not one lobbyist from the chemical industry has come up to me."
"My concern relates solely to the vague application of the precautionary principle."
"If we want to ban PVC, let us do so freely and openly."
"Mr President, this Commission proposal aims for a long-term ban on the use of phthalates in toys as an emergency measure."
"Nevertheless, this emergency measure is already applied in several countries and is renewed every three months."
"Furthermore, the Commission proposal is the result of two opinions issued by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment."
"It appears that the Commission has interpreted these opinions according to criteria which are no doubt very well intentioned, but which can at best be described as hasty, in light of the audience which took place in the Environment Committee with the scientists responsible for the opinions."
"One of the premises for the application of the precautionary principle must be proportionality, which appears not to be the case here."
"In fact, DEHP, the phthalate so far considered the most dangerous to human health, has been declared by the international cancer research association not to be classifiable as a carcinogen in humans."
"Furthermore, we should bear in mind that, in order to establish the toxicity of any product, the dose and the exposure time of that product must be defined."
"It is not sufficient that a product is intrinsically toxic. Even water can be fatal if consumed in an enormous enough quantity to cause drowning."
"A substance as toxic as heparin, a rat poison, turns out to be an effective anticoagulant which has saved many lives."
"Viruses and bacteria, in minimal doses, become vaccines."
"Furthermore, there has been much less research on the substitutes for phthalates than on the phthalates themselves."
"If this ban is adopted - and we can support it, above all if there is a supposed risk to children - we will also support Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 24 because the Commission should amend this directive in the event that the Scientific Committee approves the use of methods of measurements for practical purposes."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Arvidsson, for his excellent work."
"The debate on phthalates can only be fruitful if the arguments are based on scientific evidence, not populist theory."
"More research is needed so that the long-term effects on health of the different phthalates can be accounted for thoroughly."
"I would be very pleased if we could ban tobacco, which we have classified as dangerous."
"As legislators, we cannot use excessive force."
"If a good deal of phthalates were banned with no clear justification, the toy industry would seek refuge in other PVC plastic softeners, about whose long-term effects there is even less knowledge than phthalates."
"Let us now just ban those which have been shown to be dangerous."
"As it is a matter of the most tender age group of all, the under three-year-olds, precaution is really relevant here."
"What the toy is used for cannot in itself be a determining factor in deciding which phthalates can be used and which cannot."
"The labelling of toys alone is not sufficiently safe."
"Everyone understands that small children put everything that is in reach in their mouths first, including dirt."
"In families where there are children of different ages, it is utterly impossible to sort toys for them to play with according to how suitable they are."
"It is best if we simply do not buy these products."
"Mr President, this report requesting banning the use of phthalates in some soft PVC children's toys is flawed in many ways and rests on a dubious legal basis, given that the Chairman of the Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and the Environment, Professor Bridges, when he appeared before this Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on 23 May, stated: ""It is hard to see how it"" - the ban - ""would come under a scientific interpretation of serious and immediate risk"" , which is the required criterion for the ban imposed in December."
"The Commission seems to have ignored its own scientific committee on the basis that some Member States are imposing their own ban."
"They are entirely within their rights, of course."
"Instead I support the development of tests to determine migration limits, and for these to be legislated on in due course, rather than a long-term ban as proposed."
"It is particularly galling that, of the six named phthalates to be banned, five are not even used for children's toys and only two are suspected on the basis of unreplicated tests on rats."
"I too am concerned for the welfare of small children, but based on reasoning and science, not on emotions."
"This whole business contrasts markedly with my request for restrictions to be placed on the use of mobile phones by young children, in a formal question to the Commission under the same precautionary principle."
"This was, of course, refused even though it admitted there was no research evidence on the safety of child use of mobiles and there was some data for adult brain damage in the prolonged use of mobile telephones."
"A recent UK government report has recommended restrictions to child use of mobiles as a developing brain is more sensitive to electromagnetic radiation."
"We have to face the fact that here in the West brain tumours have risen dramatically by some 100% over the last ten years for totally unknown reasons."
"Therefore I call again on the Commission to use the precautionary principle consistently or admit that the whole thing is a politically motivated exercise with powerful commercial interests at play, undermining the precautionary principle and risking turning it into a farce."
"Mr President, so much has gone wrong on the phthalates issue that it is difficult to know where to start."
"The Commission's temporary bans have no legal basis."
"The Commission may introduce an emergency ban where there is a clear and immediate danger, but no such danger exists with phthalates."
"These materials have been in widespread use around the world for forty years, yet there is no evidence of any kind that any damage has ever been done to anyone."
"There was one test on rats in which massive quantities of phthalates appeared to cause problems, but researchers have been unable to replicate this test."
"We are dealing here with little more than media hysteria and ignorance."
"More people have died in Teddy Kennedy's car than have died of phthalates!"
"Compare and contrast our position on phthalates with our position on tobacco."
"Phthalates have never done any harm to anyone, yet we are banning them."
"Tobacco, we are told, kills half a million people each year in the European Union but do we ban it?"
"No, we do not."
"We subsidise it with millions of euros."
"If we ban existing products, alternative products may be even more dangerous."
"As Mrs García-Orcoyen has pointed out, this has already happened, for example, with breast implants, where alternatives to silicon have proved to be more dangerous than the implants they replaced."
"In trying to defend an untenable position the Commission has shamelessly sought to gag its own scientific advisers."
"It has bowdlerised their reports, it has pressured them into changing their positions."
"Honesty and transparency have been sacrificed to expedience."
"I and other colleagues wrote to Commission President Prodi on this point two months ago."
"I understand that his reply has been held for some time 'awaiting signature' , presumably to ensure we should not see it before today's debate."
"Neither the temporary bans nor the permanent ban are justified by the evidence."
"Migration tests for phthalates are currently under development and will probably be available within months."
"We should wait until these tests are available and then, if we must, impose migration limits."
"We hear far too much about the precautionary principle."
"To be meaningful the precautionary principle should be invoked only when there is a clear and demonstrable risk."
"If we continue to invoke it when there is no prime facie risk at all, we make both the precautionary principle and ourselves look ridiculous."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to Members of Parliament for their keen interest in this file, especially to Mr Arvidsson, the rapporteur, for his continuing and constructive efforts to find a solution acceptable to all."
"The Commission has also made extensive efforts to find a solution to the phthalates' question."
"Following discussions about the risks of PVC toys containing phthalates and the opinions of the Scientific Committee on Toxicology, Ecotoxicology and Environment, the Commission took two decisions simultaneously last autumn."
"One was a decision providing for an emergency temporary ban, renewable every three months."
"Second, the Commission decided to propose a directive to restrict the marketing and use of phthalates in soft PVC toys."
"Any interventions here actually concern the first decision, not necessarily this proposal for a directive."
"The Commission's proposed directive consists of two elements."
"The first element is a ban on the use of six phthalates in toys intended to be put in the mouth of small children."
"The ban is based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee that toys containing certain phthalates pose a risk to children's health when held in the mouth for extensive periods of time."
"As it cannot be excluded that children can put other toys in their mouths, although not intended for that purpose, the second element of the proposal is a requirement for a warning label on such other toys that could be put into the mouth."
"The proposal provides not only for the protection of children's health, it also addresses an internal market issue."
"At the present time, the internal market is fragmented, as more than half of the Member States are applying national bans going further than the Commission's emergency ban under the General Product Safety Directive."
"Mrs Jackson asked whether Member States have supplied scientific evidence to the Commission, the reply is: Not to my knowledge."
"The proposed directive would harmonise the rules of Member States."
"I have noted in the discussions today that the Members of Parliament are divided on the Commission's proposal."
"Some consider it too strict, while others consider that it is not at all protective enough."
"The proposal is based on the various opinions of the Scientific Committee, and it is a considered application of the precautionary principle and consequently a proportionate measure."
"It introduces a ban for the products which potentially pose the highest risks, that is for the toys intended to put be in the mouth, and a less stringent measure - labelling - for the products not intended for mouthing but where a risk cannot be excluded."
"The Commission is not able to accept those amendments of Parliament which would widen the scope of the proposed ban to cover plasticisers other than the six named phthalates, or to cover other toys than those intended to be put in the mouth."
"Nor is the Commission able to accept the amendments which would extend the scope to cover toys destined for older children."
"We think that these various proposals cannot be justified on the basis of the risks either defined in the opinions of the Scientific Committee or by the application of the precautionary principle."
"Furthermore, the Commission cannot at this moment accept amendments which would introduce migration limits, but the Commission accepts the amendments which provide for this to be reviewed when testing methods have been approved."
"The Commission can accept in principle the amendments which would prohibit the use of perfumes in toys for children under three years containing the six phthalates."
"It can also accept amendments which would bring forward the review of the directive and widen the scope of that review."
"To summarise our point of view, the Commission can accept, at least in principle, Amendment Nos 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 18, 24 and the Commission rejects Amendment Nos 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, revised 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 25."
"We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament and I am convinced that we can agree on a constructive solution."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Beef and beef products"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report (A5-0193/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 (Rapporteur: Mr Papayannakis)."
"Mr President, the regulation which we are now examining forms part of a series of interventions designed to rectify the situation inherited from the mad cow crisis and introduce a policy to prevent such situations from arising in the future and restore consumer confidence in beef products."
"The regulation therefore introduces a system comprising various techniques for identifying animals in order to guarantee traceability, i.e. the possibility of tracing every piece of meat bought by the consumer to the animal from which it derives."
"It is already a highly technical and unwieldy system."
"Provision is also made for a beef and beef product labelling system."
"The product label will give the consumer rudimentary but crucial and useful information on the meat being purchased."
"This endeavour started four years ago."
"There has been a long delay, which we have frequently criticised."
"We all remember the battles with the other institutions of the Union last December when we suspected that they might postpone and delay application of the regulation yet again."
"We now have a situation which I shall explain in simplified terms."
"After the first reading in Parliament, the Council approved a common position."
"This common position incorporates most of the amendments made by the European Parliament."
"The wording of the regulation has been simplified and its application made easier."
"The monitoring system has been strengthened."
"However, the common position does not include our amendment abolishing the reference on the compulsory label on the meat to the category of animal from which the meat derives."
"We abolished this information in order to simplify the label, give the consumer clearer information and reduce the cost to meat companies."
"The argument for keeping the reference to the category of animal is that this reference responds to consumer needs, habits and preferences, at least in certain countries of the Union."
"The question, therefore, is do we wish to insist on amending the current wording of the regulation?"
"This may take us into a conciliation procedure, thereby delaying application of the regulation and the European Parliament, let me remind you, is in favour of applying the regulation at the earliest possible date and has blamed and continues to blame the other institutions of the European Union for the intolerable delay."
"I refer to the amendment concerning the category of animal, not a second amendment referring to minced meat, because I do not think that it meets any particular need."
"Minced meat is, in any case, already connected to the animal from which it derives with the arrangements which we have in the regulation and the other matters are technical and production matters and we did well not to change the wording of the regulation."
"I should now like to address the matter of the Committee on the Environment, for which I have the honour of acting as rapporteur."
"The Committee on the Environment voted by an adequate majority to insist that the text be amended."
"It approved this basic amendment abolishing the reference to the category of animal."
"Your rapporteur is not convinced of the need, usefulness or advisability of amending the text and feels obliged, to his chagrin, to recommend the opposite approach, i.e. that we refrain from adopting any amendments and accept the common position."
"I trust that the wisdom of the House will find the best and safest way of ensuring that this regulation is applied quickly and solve what I hope is a temporary difference of view between the rapporteur and his committee."
"Mr President, on a point of order: as chairman of the Environment Committee I would just point out that the rapporteur's job is to present the report of the committee."
"If Mr Papayannakis wants to express a personal opinion, he should have the freedom to do so."
"What he cannot do is to confuse the two."
"Mr President, I fully concur with what the chairman of our committee has just said."
"I have presented the entire discussion and the entire dispute surrounding the regulation."
"In the last two lines I expressed my personal opinion, with a great deal of chagrin, so as not to have to take the floor again as a speaker."
"For the rest, I should like to assure our chairman that I have a great deal of respect for procedure, perhaps more than many other fellow members, both on this and other matters."
"Mr President, this legislation on the labelling of beef has two distinct aspects."
"Firstly it ensures traceability of beef products."
"Cases of food poisoning related to beef are rare, and more often than not can be attributed to storage and preparation in the home or catering outlet, rather than to the processors."
"Occasionally, however, there is a problem such as the E-coli outbreak in Scotland."
"In this instance labelling can enable the public to be alerted without inducing panic, and facilitate the tracing back of contaminated beef to the shop, slaughterhouse or farm where the problem started."
"Secondly, labelling will identify the country or countries of origin of beef."
"This is not to assist xenophobic consumers who wish to reject all things foreign - although there is nothing wrong with the desire to support one's own farmers who are facing unprecedented economic pressures."
"The BSE crisis shone a spotlight on the possible health risks associated with beef."
"Some countries, like France, have a whole-herd slaughter policy which may reassure consumers, despite its lack of scientific basis and a risk of underreporting."
"The United Kingdom, on the other hand, which has a higher level of BSE incidence at the moment, removes all animals over 30 months from the food chain, as well as adopting a whole raft of other measures."
"We could argue all day about which beef is the safest, but the fact is that once labelling is in place the consumer will be able to decide."
"There can be no justification for the continuation of the illegal French ban on British beef if it is clearly labelled."
"In fact those in France who have studied the subject in depth may well decide to buy British as the safest and tastiest option."
"I will now comment on the amendments."
"The inclusion of category is unnecessary, costly and potentially confusing to consumers."
"Most housewives do not know the difference between a heifer and a steer. A bony Holstein steer would be in the same category as a champion Charolais but that prime animal's twin sister would be in a different category solely because of its sex."
"Clearly this is a ridiculous situation."
"The listing of category imposes costs on farmers and butchers, and at the same time would give consumers irrelevant or misleading information."
"It could also devalue some categories such as young bulls, as supermarkets rationalise the categories they stock."
"If France wants to continue with its scheme alone, then I would not want to stand in its way."
"This is a subsidiarity issue."
"The amendment on Article 14 would prevent the confusing situation where minced beef - marketed for example, in Austria, Mr Fischler - which was derived from Polish animals imported live into Austria, could be labelled 'prepared in Austria' ."
"I am not sure that Austrian farmers would like that to happen."
"Without this amendment this potentially misleading suggestion could encourage more live imports, with obvious animal welfare implications."
"We are working on a very tight timescale on this legislation, which is due to come into effect on 1 September."
"It would, therefore, be irresponsible of Parliament to adopt amendments which could not be accepted by the Council."
"There is no time for conciliation."
"I do not subscribe to the argument that Parliament should abdicate its constitutional right to improve this proposal because others have failed to initiate the legislative process in time."
"We now have a new French presidency - I do not know if anyone is there representing them - but I commend to the Council the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment with a large majority."
"Could I ask through you, Mr President, that the Council or, failing that, the Commissioner, makes a statement to Parliament?"
"Do you think that you can secure an agreement, based on the five amendments adopted in committee, which will both respect the views of Parliament and deliver this legislation on time as the first major achievement of the French presidency?"
"Mr President, this proposal has a long history."
"I can understand why the rapporteur and Mr Papayannakis are weary of further controversy."
"However, we are almost at the end."
"As the rapporteur, he has quite properly had to tell the House that the Environment Committee voted by a substantial majority - I think 33 votes to 13 - in favour of the excision of the provisions relating to category of animal."
"We have, on the committee, made a number of compromises, as regards both the timetable and the substance."
"The Committee has always kept a clear priority and has insisted upon it both to the Council and to the Commission: namely to have the sharpest, best-defined route of traceability on safety grounds that we can get for mince as well as other forms of beef."
"It was for this reason that it threw out at first reading the superfluous requirements about maturation times, much as chefs might have wanted them, and category of animal, which did nothing for traceability, added cost, and increased the disaffection of many Member States and of those who will have to implement this proposal."
"As a result of that, we thought the matter was resolved."
"Indeed, as Mr Papayannakis has said, there have been counter-concessions from the Commission."
"Now, to our amazement, category of animal is back, and once again the Environment Committee has voted to remove it."
"The Commission knows why."
"It knows we cannot be bullied with threats that our timetable will slip."
"We have made concessions including a full month' s delay on the implementation of the second phase of this proposal already."
"We have done that with a good grace."
"I urge the House to reaffirm its position at first reading and to exclude a form of compulsory category labelling which is entirely optional for Member States, - a form of labelling we should point out which we do not have in detail."
"We have to surrender to the secret harmonies of comitology if we are going to leave it to Commission to advance the precise definitions."
"We are not prepared to do that."
"We want traceability, we want surveillance, we want this proposal and we want it quickly."
"We want the best and most economic route to achieve it and Amendments Nos 3 and 5 do that."
"The various amendments on mince add to surveillance and traceability in the way we propose."
"Conciliation, Mr Papayannakis, does not take very long."
"It consists of two words from the Commissioner this afternoon: 'We accept.'"
"Let us hear them."
"Mr President, there is no need to repeat what my colleagues Mr Goodwill and Mr Whitehead have said regarding the significant agreement that we have reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Allow me nevertheless to say that, after what has happened over the last few days when we have had further cases of BSE in France, it is clear that we still have a long way to go before we have a completely safe market as far as beef is concerned."
"There is only one way to regain the consumers' trust and that is by guaranteeing the quality of the products."
"If we had an ideal world in the EU we would have had a foodstuffs authority which could have checked and ensured that everyone behaved according to the rules."
"Then the quality of the meat would have been to a large extent the same throughout the Union, and it would at least have maintained the EU standard everywhere."
"If we had also been able to ensure that everyone followed the rules regarding transportation, we would not need to run the risk of animals suffering during transit."
"Now, however, we need a system that involves stating where the animals come from, where they were born, where they were reared and where they were slaughtered."
"In this way the consumer is provided with information regarding how the animal may have fared and whether it may have been subjected to long journeys in transit."
"Mr President, in conclusion, the most important thing is that we obtain a system which means that by looking at a label on the meat we can see where it comes from, and that it is then possible to trace back through the complete foodstuffs chain to the original producer."
"This is where we need to get to."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are delighted with the Council' s common position."
"In our opinion, it marks a great step forward and an actual victory for this Parliament."
"However, I would still like to point out the difference between traceability on the one hand and consumer confidence on the other."
"In my opinion, traceability is a technicality which can be identified and demonstrated thanks to the numerical code or bar code, but even consumers cannot possibly decipher or interpret these codes."
"What matters is that traceability is effective and efficient, not only to protect the consumer, but also the whole meat chain."
"After all, in the event of a crisis or scandal, traceability allows you to identify the problem straight away."
"In this way, we can prevent the entire meat industry from going down the drain because of one isolated criminal act or incident of carelessness."
"Consumer confidence however, requires more than traceability."
"In my view, confidence in a product can be instilled by providing the consumer with reliable, but above all comprehensible information on the quality of the product they intend to buy."
"It seems to me that indicating the animal category can most definitely enhance consumer confidence, provided this is done in an understandable manner."
"I therefore regret that a large majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection rejected this component and eventually deleted the category."
"At first reading, my Group also called for labelling the breed and region of origin of the animal involved."
"It saddens me that our request did not survive this hurdle."
"I would, however, urge the meat industry not to adopt a defensive stance in this dossier, but to be proactive instead."
"I believe that this will greatly benefit them and can also boost their returns."
"Mr President, the rules governing the voluntary labelling system provided for in the 1999 EU regulation expire on 31 August."
"The Council regulation before us must be adopted to avoid a legal vacuum arising."
"The agreement reached by the EU Agriculture Ministers on a Europe-wide beef labelling system was not such a major achievement."
"The work in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was in fact much more demanding than the result before us."
"The content of all the measures approved is to be modified so that proof of meat' s origin is valid as a guarantee in order to apply environmental control procedures and if necessary impose sanctions."
"The Community labelling system quite rightly aims to enhance transparency of production and marketing conditions for beef, and in particular to improve certainty as to its origin."
"Higher product costs cannot be ruled out, as the cost of applying the system will be passed on to the consumer."
"The incalculable risk as regards food quality will not be dramatically reduced in this way, as the information provided is not primarily intended for the consumer."
"The last 16 years, since the first outbreak of mad cow disease, have demonstrated the importance of production for consumer confidence."
"The most effective measure is to strengthen production in the region of origin, which is more justifiable both environmentally and economically speaking."
"Mr President, we stressed at first reading what a complete anomaly it is that, 14 years after the emergence of BSE, the European Union still has no labelling system giving consumers the information they need."
"Luckily, some Member States, including France since 1996, have taken unilateral initiatives and responsibility for designing national systems which have proven to be transparent, efficient and flexible and which should have been authenticated."
"Having failed to do the same, the House has, at least, adopted some of their ideas, most of which, we were pleased to see, have been incorporated in the common position."
"The main thing is that consumers need to be able to make sense of it."
"Giving consumers information without confusing them means including important references explicitly, with secondary information accessible at the checkout via the barcode."
"An overloaded label would not promote food safety, it would just represent an additional cost to our SMEs and would really distort competition if there were no equivalent requirement for third country produce."
"We also need to move quickly and, in the interest of producers and consumers alike, ensure that there are not any legal gaps."
"We therefore consider it important not to question the balance which we have reached, as our rapporteur has recommended, unless we want to set off on a long conciliation procedure."
"But not questioning the balance in the regulation also implies that we must be extremely vigilant when it comes to the implementing regulation; most importantly, the categories and list of products and sectors to which this applies must be clearly defined."
"We need to show that we are logical, fair, flexible and that we know where European interests lie."
"We need to take account of all operators of every size, especially small and medium-sized operators, of whom there is an abundance in this sector, scattered throughout our countries, creating jobs and often using animals or cuts from different origins."
"We need to take great care not to impose unnecessary additional costs on these companies."
"For example, the reference to the category makes no sense for prepared products, especially kebabs, and we need to be flexible in our arrangements for meat for the catering trade, otherwise our restaurants will all go out and buy Brazilian meat."
"So let us respect the balance in the regulation and introduce the necessary flexibility in the implementing regulation, so that we can preserve the interests of European producers and inform European consumers at one and the same time."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, having done so on 16 December 1999, we are addressing the problem of identifying cattle and the problem of labelling."
"And all because, for the past 14 years and, officially, for the past 4 years, there has been a zoonosis, i.e. a disease which can be transmitted from cows, in this case British cows, to humans."
"Not knowing how to cure this disease and not having had the will to prevent it when we could have done so from 1989 onwards, we are now reduced to bidding to reassure the consumer."
"Just as the Americans invented happy pills in the 1950s, we have invented consumer sedatives, i.e. labels."
"As soon as consumers are worried, anxious or afraid, we give them a label."
"We put labels on tobacco for them, we put labels on chocolate for them, and when they are upset because they no longer have any cocoa, we put labels on GMOs for them, not that this prevents genetically engineered soya, cotton and tomatoes from arriving by the boatload."
"We put labels on wine for them, not that this prevents bogus port from South Africa from landing in our ports and, finally, we put labels on beef for them!"
"I must admit, Commissioner Fischler, that you have slammed on all the brakes - if I may put it thus - both skilfully and in bad faith in order to delay labelling."
"But unable to delay it all the time, you decided to drown it and the draft regulation has overloaded the label to the point at which it is illegible."
"You have even arranged to add the approval numbers of the slaughterhouse and cutting plant, all of which is incomprehensible to the consumer, of course, who does not have the equipment to read the barcode."
"And in the case of kebabs, stews, sautés and ready meals, pieces of meat may come from the whole of France or the whole of Europe."
"So with a calf born in France, fattened in Italy and slaughtered in Ireland, the label will be a real geography lesson!"
"As a result, the meat wholesalers, the SMEs referred to by Mr Souchet, have denounced the increased costs and, at the same time, compulsory labelling has given us an insight into the curiosities of the meat market: 40% of beef derives from animals which have done the rounds of Europe; when you buy a steak at the butcher's, little do you know that it has travelled 3000 kilometres, taking in 4 countries on the way: the country in which it was born, the country in which it was raised, the country in which it was slaughtered and the country in which it is consumed."
"In my country, 1.5 million animals a year take a trip via Italy and Spain."
"So in that case, what do you put on the label?"
"The whole itinerary?"
"Or just 'Origin: European Union' ?"
"But if we put 'Origin: European Union' , that conceals the fact that the meat may derive from an English cow, riddled from top to bottom with a prion courtesy of their gracious ultraliberal majesties, Adam Smith and David Ricardo."
"So, today, we are offered a compromise."
"We are told that labels will state the origin of the animal and the category: is it a calf, a heifer, a cow or a bull?"
"But what we want is a compromise which will make life easier for SMEs, for small companies, not that any of this need prevent us, Commissioner, fellow members, from taking brief stock."
"It all started with milk quotas back in 1984."
"In order to increase their yield, the British stuffed their cows with bonemeal."
"To save money, they lowered the cooking temperature of the bonemeal and the prion survived and contaminated their cattle."
"Without free movement, it would have stopped there, but with no frontiers, they contaminated Portuguese and French cattle and we have known about it, even here, since 1986."
"José Happart, a Socialist, and I have been warning of the risk of a zoonosis since 1989."
"But the Maastricht Treaty had to be ratified, so nothing was said and the truth was hidden."
"A committee of inquiry chaired by Mr Böge was set up, but the Amsterdam Treaty had to be ratified and nothing was said."
"The Commission was not held to account, Mr Fischler, and for 14 years, nothing was done."
"When five German Länder wanted to protect their consumers, you instituted infringement proceedings against them."
"The moral of this tale, quite apart from the labelling saga, is that it is the nation states that have protected their consumers."
"For its part, the Commission has protected free movement. Real subsidiarity means ensuring that consumers, with the help of their country, can each protect themselves."
"The label only comes along when the fork is poised; but the best solution would be to label when the pitchfork is poised."
"The intermediate solution lies between fork and pitchfork, i.e. at the frontier, the only place where animals can be protected against unreasonable transport and consumers can be protected."
"Mr President, yesterday we heard Mr Chirac set out his objectives for the French presidency."
"In his conclusion he said ""Europe will be dynamic if we make it loved by those it serves"" ."
"This is the sweeping rhetoric that occupies the high ground but the detail of the debate today occupies the low ground."
"It is precisely this sort of detailed, petty interference that drives the people served by Europe to distraction."
"If anything was more calculated to make Europe unloved it is its determination to control every nook and cranny of our lives."
"We all, I am sure, have letters saying that these regulations are impracticable, cumbersome, costly and far too complex."
"Above all, my correspondents tell me that they are fed up with the EU's mania for bombarding the consumer with information."
"Soon labels will no longer suffice."
"If we keep going at this rate, shopkeepers will have to issue owners' manuals with every pound of minced beef - not, of course, that we are allowed to use pounds any more."
"Perhaps even Macdonald's might be forced to protest."
"I know from my short experience here that nothing I say and nothing that involves common sense will have the slightest impact because, like a mad elephant out of control, this legislation will crash on regardless."
"I will make a prediction."
"When this legislation finally goes through we will hear paeans of self-congratulation."
"Everybody involved will tell themselves how jolly hard they worked."
"Well, they may be pleased but they certainly will not be loved by the people of Europe."
"Mr Chirac is going to be disappointed."
"The people are despairing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some of the amendments tabled water down the substance and the objective of the Council' s proposal for a regulation on beef labelling."
"The argument being presented, as we have heard, is that we should not ask too much of consumers."
"An attempt is being made then to withhold information on the grounds that consumers are ostensibly stupid."
"To my mind, that is the wrong approach, and we should assume that consumers have a good grasp of things."
"We should provide consumers with information about the origin of the beef, offer them certainty and take consumer protection seriously."
"The implementing provisions for this regulation are being enacted under the committee procedure."
"That means that tomorrow we will have to vote on a legal text whose precise content is unknown."
"Even the Commission cannot tell us exactly what form these implementing provisions will take."
"I regard this as a very unfortunate procedure, which demonstrates the democratic deficit in the Community decision-making process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in speaking previously to this House I have pointed out that there is a tension in the proposed regulation between ensuring traceability for public health purposes and providing useful consumer information."
"I am grateful for recent assurances from Commissioner Byrne that the new European Food Agency will consider how such information can best be provided."
"Making it compulsory to include the category of animal on the label is not justified on public health grounds, nor is it obvious why it should be obligatory for the consumer to have this information."
"The Environment Committee's amendment makes it clear that it could be provided under the voluntary scheme where there is a demand."
"Further, if the labelling scheme in relation to category were to be implemented, as the Commission has earlier suggested, it could add 8 to 10% to production costs."
"In my own country this would mean GBP 45 - 55 or EUR 70 - 90 per animal without any benefit in return and, as Mr Goodwill has already said, the scheme could have the effect of reducing the market price of certain categories of cattle, particularly of young bulls."
"I very much hope that Parliament will follow the Environment Committee's lead in removing category from the compulsory scheme and that the Commission and Council too will agree not to impose this additional unnecessary burden on producers and consumers alike."
"In previous debates here I have supported the principle of having a clear set of rules for appropriate labelling information on beef and beef products."
"My belief is still that our beef production industry, as well as the consumer, has everything to gain from the customer confidence which a sensible compulsory labelling scheme can provide."
"Of course, we must have clear information permitting full traceability from farm to plate."
"There is no doubt or controversy about that, but controversy has surrounded the proposal that category of animal be included."
"In judging the value of label information, I believe that its relevance to food safety must be foremost in our minds."
"In a recent exchange of views within our political Group here in Strasbourg, Commissioner Byrne and his cabinet officials stated quite clearly that there was no food safety benefit arising from the categorisation proposal."
"I cannot support its inclusion."
"In relation to country or Member State of origin, could I ask Commissioner Fischler to clarify whether, apart from the compulsory information that we are discussing here, information regarding the area of origin, such as Scotland or the Orkney Islands for example, can be displayed prominently on a voluntary basis?"
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to the many negative effects of mad cow disease, one positive effect is the fact that it has induced the European Union and the Member States to adopt more vigilant, detailed legislation to ensure food safety and protect honest producers in the strategically important beef sector."
"It is a pity that it takes scandals such as this or the dioxins in chickens issue to speed up safeguard and prevention initiatives, but better late than never!"
"It has become apparent that the serious difficulties experienced by the entire sector during the periods of greatest crisis caused by mad cow disease were, apart from the direct effects of the disease, primarily due to the lack of confidence between consumers and beef producers and sellers which ensued. The situation was not improved by the dissemination of false information."
"We have learned from this experience that it is essential to promote all initiatives which consolidate a stable relationship of confidence between consumers and producers and those who sell food products in general."
"Although the protection of consumer health is by far the most important criterion, it cannot be our sole objective in establishing an efficient system for the identification and registration of bovine animals during the production and fattening stage and a labelling system based on objective criteria during the marketing stage."
"It is important to understand that all initiatives which protect honest European Community producers - and they are without a doubt the great majority of producers - need to be promoted."
"All the Community producers are calling for well-defined but not oppressive regulations."
"In other words, we must guard against suffocating the healthy part of our agricultural sector with bureaucracy, which is frequently much more damaging than any disease."
"I will conclude by pointing out that there is no point in adopting stringent legislation if it does not provide an efficient supervision system which rewards honest producers and penalises those whose improper conduct jeopardises the future of an entire sector which is of primary importance for the European economy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beef labelling was actually conceived as a quick way of regaining the public' s confidence in beef after a string of crises and scandals."
"But it has since turned into an almost unending saga."
"Whenever the regulation might cease to apply, Parliament is called upon to act quickly to prevent a legal vacuum arising."
"There have been two deadlines, first December 1999 and now the present deadline of 31 August 2000."
"Commissioner, given the time periods involved, you cannot seriously call on Parliament not to adopt any amendments."
"We want a workable system, and we have always said that."
"As the proposal before us does not guarantee that, it is not just our right, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to adopt amendments."
"When I then hear that in Italy, for example, the technical requirements for this system are not even in place yet, and that the same applies in other countries, then I wonder why there is all this rush if the system has not been implemented anyway."
"I would welcome some comments from the Commissioner on that point."
"The Commission' s proposal will lead to our having to deal with the system again before long."
"The Commission perhaps reacted somewhat hastily in the wake of the BSE crisis, and now we are into brinkmanship again."
"I cannot help feeling that the 2003 deadline that was thought up in December 1998 is now occupying the Commission' s thought processes again."
"I believe that you can achieve implementation of this regulation by 1 September if you accept our amendments."
"You will not achieve it if you still insist on including category of animal, which we have already touched upon several times today."
"That has nothing to do with information for the public, it is just a quality issue, and does not belong in this regulation."
"Commissioner, please accept the amendments and we will then have something workable in place by 1 September."
"Mr President, many aspects of the common position we have here reflect Parliament' s position at first reading, and this demonstrates the Council' s willingness to work with Parliament in order to achieve a positive and rapid outcome in this area, which is so important for European consumers."
"I would have liked to simply approve the common position without further ado."
"However, I find one point that has already been mentioned several times enormously difficult - category of animal."
"This comes under compulsory labelling, where it has no place to be."
"Category of animal really does not assist the regulation' s objective of guaranteeing meat traceability."
"I therefore support the adoption of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5."
"The Council will now have to remove the provisions relating to category of animal at its meeting in mid-July if it does not want to risk the regulation not coming into force on 1 September this year."
"Secondly, there is Amendment No 4 on minced beef, which relates to the last part of Article 14, first paragraph, beginning ""and origin"" ."
"I am afraid I cannot follow this either."
"In my view, this amendment lacks precision."
"How is 'origin' to be defined here?"
"Does it refer to where the animal was born or where it was fattened, or both, and who is responsible for labelling here?"
"Exactly how will origin be indicated?"
"None of this is clearly worded and I see a risk that the Council will refuse point blank to accept this amendment, so that we will end up with a conciliation procedure, which will in turn further delay the entry into force of the regulation."
"This is not in the interests of consumers, and I therefore call on the House to reject Amendments Nos 4 and 6."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Council has adopted the European Parliament' s amendments on the labelling of beef products."
"There has been fruitful interinstitutional cooperation, and the codecision procedure has shown its strength."
"The result is a victory for consumers, and not just them, but the whole beef sector chain: the producers, the processing industry and the organisations representing the beef trade."
"This regulation will make it possible to trace the origin of meat, and even according to a reasonable timetable."
"After EU enlargement this sort of system will be vital for consumers and producers."
"To tell the truth, we could not have waited any longer for this system to be put into practice."
"Now it depends on the Member States whether the practice of labelling is adopted in the hoped for manner."
"I also hope consumer organisations will give their strong support to the implementation of the provisions in practice."
"Mr President, the introduction of the EU beef labelling is a further step on the road to traceability and in the present climate a prerequisite for consumer protection and public health."
"As I have said on many previous occasions in this House, farmers are unfortunately the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control."
"I come from a country which exports over 90% of its entire beef production and quality and consumer satisfaction have always been a priority."
"We must take steps to ensure that labelling does not result in a renationalisation of the food sector."
"Already there is some evidence that this is happening."
"I welcome the Commission's assurance that any distortion of trade which might arise as a result of these labelling measures will be dealt with."
"Labelling, however, needs to be sensible."
"Over-description would only lead to confusion and is unnecessary."
"The consumer must be able to see at a glance the certificate of origin which is the assurance of product safety."
"Mr President, that went quicker than I thought."
"The BSE crisis, and later on the dioxin crisis, focused our attention on the safety of our food."
"In addition, the European consumer has become more critical and outspoken over the past decades."
"Politicians need to take this into consideration."
"After all, there are huge interests at stake: the certainty and safety of our primary products, and hence consumer confidence."
"In the coming months, too, we should therefore be looking carefully at the White Paper on food safety."
"Today' s regulations are a direct result of the recommendations of the BSE inquiry at the time, in which integral chain management, i.e. the 'from-stable-to-stable' principle, and with it the ultimate traceability of our primary raw materials, was established."
"The Commission proposal within the context of labelling beef follows on from temporary legislation dating back to 1997."
"It aims to introduce reliable and transparent identification and registration regulations for beef, as well as labelling for beef."
"This should also enhance consumer confidence in the quality of beef and benefit market stability."
"Meat should remain traceable, whether at the production or sales stage."
"An important idea which the Council has adopted from the EP in its common position is to bring forward the date when the labelling regulation comes into effect."
"The label should contain information on the animal' s region of origin, where it is born, fattened up and slaughtered."
"What is new is that the Council now also considers it important to mention the animal category from which the meat originates."
"I admit that making this compulsory could be considered normal from the point of view of the consumer, but this is not yet the case in the Netherlands, where this suggestion is met with a great deal of protest."
"I do not call for compulsory labelling, but for labelling on a voluntary basis. In this context, I am convinced that butchers can meet all the provisions of this proposal in a very simple manner, for example by placing a sign in their shops."
"Mr President, with tomorrow' s vote, Parliament will take an initial step towards defining a legislative framework intended to win back consumer confidence in the quality of foodstuffs on the market in the European Union."
"This goal can only be achieved through a wider strategy such as that outlined in the White Paper on food safety, and we too must make every effort to speed up its practical implementation."
"This directive will ensure not only that the meat on our tables can be traced back to its origins but also that the consumer is provided with clear, essential information."
"The mandatory labelling to be affixed to packaging will provide consumers with the all the information they need in order to be able to make an informed decision about what to buy: therefore, a limited amount of clear, effective information needs to be included if we are to help consumers and not make their life more complicated."
"For this reason and because of the considerable opposition which appears to have arisen to the listing of categories, I have decided to support the amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"In the context of this debate, I feel that I must stress once again the extremely sensitive nature of this proposal, and call upon all the Community institutions to act responsibly in order to make it operative as soon as possible and avoid legal gaps."
"Parliament has done its part and will continue to do so."
"Let the Commission and the Council do theirs!"
"Mr Whitehead has already pointed them in the right direction."
"Mr President, Commissioner, guaranteeing public health is the objective of one of today' s most important areas of legislation."
"This is something to which this regulation will contribute, making traceability from farm to plate as effective as possible, as well as compulsory."
"At the same time, European consumers have the right to clear and easily understandable information, so that they know where the meat they are eating comes from."
"I am certain that the Council and Parliament can reach a good compromise on minced meat, in so far as Parliament adopts Amendments 4 and 6 which guarantee consumers information about where the minced meat comes from and when it was produced."
"I would ask all colleagues to vote in favour of Amendment 6 which Karl Erik Olsson and I have tabled with a view to making it compulsory for minced meat to bear a label stating the date when it was produced."
"Minced meat involves a much greater bacteriological risk for consumers than larger pieces of beef, so the production date is a very important piece of information."
"It is good that categories have been removed."
"The Council' s common position, together with Parliament' s six amendments, constitute legislation of benefit to agriculture and consumers in the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is not the label that counts."
"We all understand that expression, but what counts here really is the label - and I am not talking about haute couture!"
"Beef labelling is an important stage in the process of rebuilding consumer confidence."
"I note that despite the protracted preliminary discussions not all EU Member States have recorded every last animal on their computers."
"Yet the compulsory labelling system is supposed to take force in all Member States as from 1 September 2000, thus finally replacing the voluntary system."
"The question for consumers will be this: what information can we expect?"
"Where was the animal born?"
"In the EU, in a third country, at which farm, in what region?"
"What does country of origin mean, or perhaps even source country?"
"And then there is the debate about categories."
"Should I buy a sucking calf, a normal calf or a heifer today?"
"As I come from a farming background myself and there is nothing I more earnestly want for farmers than stable prices, I believe that we should create legal bases that are underpinned by consensus."
"We should not make the legislation unnecessarily complicated."
"We are all concerned about public health and consumer protection."
"So as from 1 September 2000 we will have labelling, and as from 1 January 2002 it will be extremely comprehensive."
"The beef chain from producer to consumer can be very long, and the supply chains in Member States vary widely."
"Yet I do not think that cattle headed for the slaughterhouse are really such great tourists."
"However, strict criteria must also apply to imports from third countries."
"By way of conclusion, let me say that I once learnt that top athletes' nutrition programmes should include meat."
"Our top athletes' eating habits have a great impact on health and performance."
"I hope that we can rebuild confidence and that people will once more become great meat-eaters."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Papayannakis we are discussing is an important tool to improve consumer protection and increase consumer confidence in food in Europe."
"The committee took an important decision in rejecting the category of animal labelling proposal."
"The category of animal - heifer, cow, bull, bullock, young bull, calf - will not provide the consumer with any extra information, as the differences within categories might be greater than those between them."
"On the other hand, the compulsory labelling of category would increase the production costs of fresh meat products by what could be a large percentage figure, which, of course, would be passed on to the consumer."
"On this there is agreement between beef producers, the meat processing industry, retailers and consumer organisations."
"And now the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has arrived at the same conclusion."
"Category labelling must not be compulsory, but this can happen on a national basis, as, for example, has been the wish in France."
"Perhaps in a country the size of France there is so much beef that it is possible to label products rationally."
"That is not the case in my country."
"Another thorny problem relating to the proposal is labelling showing the origin of the meat."
"The proposal is for the labelling system to be introduced in two stages. In the first stage there would just be slaughter information."
"In cases where the animal was bred and reared in another country, the information might be totally misleading for the consumer, and in countries where stage two is now in force the situation as it is could only deteriorate."
"For example, Finland' s national beef labelling system also now includes information on where the animal was bred and reared."
"It is therefore to be hoped that, on the basis of the current defining implementation regulation, the beef sector could be flexible enough to come round to establishing the two-stage labelling system."
"The basis of this discussion is consumer protection, especially with regard to the BSE crisis we lived through in Europe."
"The matter being discussed is an important tool, but the compulsory labelling of beef products and the gradual switch to labels showing the origin of the meat do not serve this purpose."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure there are still many more questions."
"You can of course always revisit everything, but I think that we now need labelling of beef and beef products as a matter of urgency, by which I mean as from September this year and not as from January next year."
"We have discussed this at length in committee."
"As regards guarantees of origin, great progress has already been made as a result of improved transparency, and it was possible to make a positive impact."
"There are many regional programmes, for example in my home region of Rheinland-Pfalz, and these demonstrate that this is feasible and have led the way here."
"It is not so long since farmers and meat-processing plants were threatened with annihilation, and it has only been through a combination of comprehensive information and strategically sound and effective marketing measures that it has been possible to rebuild consumer confidence to some extent."
"We must not allow this success to be undermined by deferring the introduction of labelling, which would be a step backwards."
"Designation of origin is particularly important for consumers."
"The preparatory work our farmers have done on labelling has been good and clear."
"We have made good progress with beef labelling in Germany."
"In this context I would like to ask you, Commissioner, what progress the other Member States have made."
"We certainly need to keep an eye on products imported from third countries."
"These should be clearly recognisable as such when they are sold."
"But what about those sometimes excessively detailed descriptions?"
"They are confusing."
"For example, how many consumers know what a heifer is, who would be interested in that, and why is it important?"
"The Commission has not yet clearly presented its proposals on category here, but I think it will have to adopt a simple and clear approach."
"Descriptions such as 'veal' or 'beef' are sufficient, and anyone who wants more information should also be able to obtain it."
"Mr President, I fully subscribe to and take as read what has been said so far in relation to the identification and traceability of beef and all beef products."
"Yesterday the Committee on the Environment voted by 37 votes to 13 for the five amendments before us today - a clear, decisive vote right across this House from colleagues in all different groups."
"I would particularly like to mention the category issue here which I suppose effectively means getting back to the first reading position on this."
"I was incensed when, as late as yesterday, the Commission could not advise us as to exactly what would be involved in 'category'."
"We are effectively being asked to buy the bovine equivalent of a pig in a poke."
"This is not acceptable."
"I would say to the Commissioner, please accept our amendments in relation to this area."
"There is no need to confuse and mislead the consumers of Europe on a compulsory basis, because the voluntary labelling system which will be driven by competition, pride in product and consumer demand will add anything that a compulsory category label might otherwise require."
"I am still confused about the situation in relation to mince."
"If we are now going to insist on country of origin for mince, why cannot we have country of origin for the larger pieces of beef from 1 September, or whenever?"
"I am not quite sure where we stand on that but we will be advised."
"The French situation is amazing."
"Only yesterday the services of the French Prime Minister wrote to every French MEP in this House - all 87 of them across the House - telling them to vote against all the amendments."
"What does that tell us about political interference from the top in France?"
"What is that saying about French beef production and protectionism?"
"What is it saying about the Anglo-French beef issue?"
"If the French want to label beef they can do so voluntarily."
"At the moment they only label 50% of their beef, yet they want to insist on compulsory labelling under category for all of us."
"I do not understand the political interference and the real message from France, and we should get to the bottom of it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this proposed regulation and derogation of Regulation (EC) No 820/97 has a first heading, which nobody is talking about, which provides for a system of identification and registration for beef based on earmarks, passports and computerised support which guarantee its traceability."
"The second heading establishes an obligatory system of labelling of meat and two stages for its implementation."
"In the voluntary period for application of Regulation (EC) No 820/97, 36 specifications have been approved in Spain in order to put it into practice, and I can assure you that this has given the consumer confidence and contributed to the recuperation of consumption, which dropped considerably as a result of mad cow disease."
"I am therefore pleased that this Regulation has been adopted."
"However, with regard to the content of the labelling - which let us not forget is directed at the consumer - it must be said that it is frankly excessive and that indications are proposed which provide little in the way of food safety and traceability, since this is guaranteed by the measures proposed in the first heading and, of course, is not what most matters to the consumer."
"The indication of categories is not necessary at all."
"Furthermore, this indication of categories may lead to confusion and problems, with regard to the age of slaughter of animals and the protected geographical indications, registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2081/92, because in this case it is obligatory to introduce categories, and the definitions do not coincide with those which are proposed now. Unless an agreement is reached - a consensus - in the management committee on the 14th."
"What matters most to consumers, particularly in the light of the recent food crises, is to know where the animal was born and where and how it has been fed throughout its life."
"Naturally, the registration number of the slaughterhouse offers them little or nothing in terms of the information they require."
"Furthermore, this Regulation lays down obligatory minimum requirements and there is always the possibility of voluntary optional labelling."
"Mr President, I would also like to concentrate on this issue of category of animal labelling."
"The original proposal called for labelling as steer, heifer or young bull, which would be sexual discrimination."
"But recently I was staggered when the Commission - just as Mrs Doyle has said - reported it had not finally decided on the precise terminology!"
"This effectively means they are asking Parliament to give them a blank cheque to determine what category of animal means after we have voted on whether or not to include it."
"This is very sloppy, very amateur and unacceptable as a way to treat this House."
"It is not even a food safety issue."
"It is extra bureaucracy and red tape - which is probably why my own government in the UK has supported it."
"But it is not in the interests of consumers, nor of the industry and, specifically, it is not in the interest of small abattoirs which would have the greatest difficulty in dealing with it."
"I therefore ask the House to support the deletion of category of animal as a compulsory labelling requirement, just as it did on the first reading."
"If countries wish to include it voluntarily that is a matter for them."
"Assuming we vote for deletion, I would ask the Commission to take note that we shall not be moved on this issue."
"So they know what they have to do."
"Finally I ask the Commission and the Council to take note that we welcome the principle of labelling beef by country of origin and that we call on the French presidency to set an example by making an immediate commitment to accept all beef so labelled from all EU countries and let the consumer decide."
"Mr President, Commissioner, can I first of all say I very much welcome this opportunity to follow the debate on this issue, but quite frankly I think it has tried our patience for a long time and most of us would like to see it resolved as soon as possible."
"We have to ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve and whose fears we are trying to allay."
"There is no doubt that consumers are tremendously concerned and I think we have to be able to allay that concern so that consumers can feel confident that the food they buy, anywhere in the European Union, will be fully traceable and good for whoever purchases it."
"For that we need an effective system of traceability and control that will restore confidence."
"I come from an agricultural background and it seems to me that what you need to control is the whole life span of the animal from the moment it is born to the time it is slaughtered."
"If you can achieve that then you will go a long way to allaying the consumers' fears."
"You can put in controls that will be so bureaucratic that they just will not work, so we have to concentrate on what is workable."
"Categorising beef as steers, bullocks or heifers will not do anything to allay the fears of the consumer."
"This is taking foolishness to the extreme and I ask you to reflect and take on board the views of the committee and the view of this Parliament on this particular point."
"Mr President, since the issue of Regulation 820 in 1997, we have been discussing rebuilding a relationship between the consumer and the production world, and I have to say that a great deal has been achieved on both sides."
"Much work has been done to ensure that the consumer is in possession of the correct information."
"That said, I am briefly going to return to some of the issues raised by my fellow Members, each of which illustrated the situation in their own country."
"In Italy, selling unspecified adult cattle on the market would mean suppressing a sensibility which is linked to our cultural and food traditions, and so we would find ourselves in quite a difficult situation."
"Apart from anything else, considering that the price per kilogram of a cow carcass is considerably lower than that of a bullock carcass and even lower than that of a heifer, it would be difficult to justify the different sales prices to the consumer, who will naturally buy the unspecified adult meat out of ignorance."
"Therefore, we are drawing up a law giving the consumer the right to know what he is buying and at what price, according to principles of transparency, clarity and information."
"The work on the traceability of all the information regarding the animal' s country of provenance and country of birth and, in particular, where the animal was fattened, is therefore excellent."
"Indeed, we would like the traceability criteria to be extended to minced beef, which is becoming a very popular product."
"We feel that a precise reference to the point of slaughter and to the provenance of the minced beef would contribute to maintaining this relationship of trust that we are building between producer and consumer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the second reading in this House is taking place so quickly is a clear sign that all of you, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Papayannakis, regard this subject, a very important one for consumers, as a key priority and that it is indeed your objective that compulsory labelling should come into force on time on 1 September."
"I would therefore first of all like to sincerely thank the rapporteur and everyone who cooperated with him for the excellent and rapid progress that has been made with this."
"Timing has always been vital in this area, and it still is."
"You all know that the introduction of the compulsory labelling system had to be deferred last December because agreement could not be reached within the time frame available."
"This deferral expires on 31 August, which in practice means that it runs out at the end of this month, because Parliament does not sit in August and no further sittings can be called."
"We must all ensure that the pledge we made to all European beef consumers and also to producers and processors is respected."
"In order to avoid further postponement or, even worse, a legal vacuum on labelling, we must therefore come to a final decision this month."
"Before I talk about the amendments tabled for tomorrow' s vote, I would like to make a couple of brief comments about the Council common position approved by the Council on 6 June."
"As you know, I pressed for an informal trialogue on the issue of the legal basis."
"This took place on 3 May."
"The Members participating in that meeting also asked for appropriate explanations regarding the draft of the Council common position."
"Once a number of further changes to the text requested by Parliament had been made, it was possible to reach an agreement based on which the following Agriculture Council approved the Council common position."
"This was then formally transmitted to Parliament in mid-June together with the Commission' s communication."
"This goes to show how well the codecision process could actually function on agricultural matters.Despite the shortage of time, the Council produced what I regard as a workable compromise taking account of the amendments you adopted at first reading. This reconciled the consumer' s right to guaranteed origin with the need for a practical system."
"Like Parliament, the Council also recognised that compulsory labelling needed to be introduced earlier than stipulated in the original proposal."
"Furthermore, the Council even complied with Parliament' s request to delete all references to EU origin."
"Lastly, the Council also took on board the request for stricter labelling requirements for minced beef, and tightened up the wording of the rules proposed by the Commission."
"It was only possible to achieve all these joint solutions between the Council and Parliament because the Member States agreed that no more national beef labelling schemes would apply after 2002."
"The greatest achievement was reaching agreement on a uniform Community-wide labelling scheme for beef."
"We should not therefore jeopardise this common interest and this move towards integration again."
"As we have now heard from the Committee on the Environment, we are not yet out of the woods, politically speaking."
"There are now amendments to be considered in plenary sitting, and approving some of these amendments would have far-reaching consequences, above all in terms of timing and as regards the adoption of the regulation."
"For example, as several speakers have noted, two amendments on labelling minced beef have been tabled."
"This issue has been scrutinised in great detail both here in Parliament and also by the Council."
"You will see that the Council has taken your comments on board and has tightened up the wording of the rules, and has in fact made them even stricter than stipulated in the original Commission proposal."
"One of the two new amendments reiterates the view that producers of minced beef should give precise details of the origin of the beef they have processed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, given the industrial conditions under which minced beef is produced nowadays, this would quite obviously be asking too much."
"Although the industry agrees with watertight guarantees of origin, it is already having great difficulties in giving details about the point of slaughter and of preparation for minced beef products."
"This demonstrates that the regulation will also have a similar impact."
"So it will certainly not be possible to put the new proposal into practice."
"If the worst came to the worst, it could even lead to some companies, especially in the smaller Member States, going bankrupt and the market for minced beef being completely renationalised."
"That is the effect it would have."
"And you cannot convince me that a Polish cow imported into Austria would be a problem for Austrian consumers."
"Because I can tell the honourable Member that if a consumer buys minced beef in a butcher' s shop in Austria, he has the piece of meat minced in front of his own eyes, and in that case there are no problems either with origin or anything else."
"What we are talking about here is really industrial processing of minced beef to make burgers and similar products, and nowadays that is a continuous industrial process."
"If you start interfering in that, then companies like this will use products originating solely in their own country and nothing else."
"And that would result in the opposite of what we are trying to achieve."
"The other amendment proposes making it compulsory to give the date minced beef was produced, and this is not the first time we have debated this idea."
"However, the label already features a more direct and clearer way of giving the consumer such vital information - the use-by date, which shows how long the minced beef can be used for."
"I do not therefore believe that this new proposal would improve or add to information for consumers."
"The common position also provides for such information to be given under the 'simplified procedure' if anyone requires this."
"I therefore suggest that we should stick to the provisions on minced beef as laid down in the common position."
"I am sure that if you take a closer look at the text you will see that the rules stipulated in it are strict enough and that our objective of improving transparency has been achieved."
"I would now like to turn to the much discussed issue of category."
"As you know, this formed part of the original Commission proposal, and I think there is a lot to be said for giving this information."
"It leads to greater transparency and I believe it is important for consumers."
"I can only tell you that where I come from, you pay 50% more for veal than for beef."
"So as a consumer, I would like to know what I am paying 50% more for."
"There is also a price difference of about one third depending on whether I am buying beef from a cow or beef from a young bull."
"In that case it is surely in the interest of consumers to know what they are paying more for and to be given a guarantee that when they pay a higher price, they are actually getting what they paid for."
"Let me explain now what we are actually proposing here."
"Categories have already been compulsory in the Community for 20 years as far as whole carcasses are concerned."
"The existing categories are: calves, young bulls, bullocks, heifers, cows and older bulls."
"This is also intended as the basis for introducing categories in this case."
"We simply want the labelling already applying to whole carcasses to apply to individual cuts as well."
"That is all."
"We are also willing to make distinctions for meat prepared in different ways."
"For example, it is not necessary to make a precise distinction for casserole meat, since as I see it is enough to know if you are buying veal or beef casserole meat."
"That is what this is about, and that alone!"
"If you say that the Commission does not even know what form the final system will take, then I have to reply that this is a typical chicken-and-egg situation."
"We cannot lay down Commission rules and implementing provisions until a Council regulation is in force."
"The category detail is a matter for the implementing provisions."
"So you cannot demand guarantees from the Commission as to exactly how the whole system will operate, because we will have to discuss this with the Member States in the Management Committee first."
"What you are calling for here is not legally possible, unless you want to make the whole system part of the Council regulation itself."
"But that would be another kettle of fish."
"That is why I think that the procedure proposed here is correct."
"But I can give you one assurance, if you wish: the Commission will be backing the categories that I have mentioned, but not anything more complicated."
"We have to be clear about one thing: if we do not introduce these categories, the result will be a return to national labelling systems in this area too."
"That can surely not be in Europe' s interest."
"Of course, politically speaking there is more than one way of looking at this issue."
"Although the Commission, and I think I have made this clear, does not agree with those who think that providing this information is impracticable, pointless or prohibitively expensive, I cannot say that a system without this kind of provision is out of the question."
"But what the Commission wanted to avoid at all costs was a return to national schemes, which in practice would lead to a total renationalisation of markets, thus undermining the common market."
"Surely that is not the idea."
"So I believe that we should adhere to the common position in this respect as well."
"I would now like to make two brief points."
"Mr Hudghton asked if it would be possible to display information regarding the area of origin, such as the Orkney Islands for example, on a voluntary basis."
"Such voluntary information on area of origin is possible, as long as protected designations of origin are not involved, because it logically follows that protected designations of origin must be protected as such."
"That brings me to the last argument put forward by various Members, that is to say the failure to introduce technical requirements."
"If we were to gear our decision-making to when it occurs to the last Member State that it is now ready to establish technical requirements, then we would be gearing the process to those who are dragging their feet on compulsory beef labelling."
"We cannot accept that, it would be counterproductive."
"The market will in fact penalise those who were not prepared to establish the technical requirements for beef labelling promptly."
"I would therefore ask you to bear these considerations in mind when you vote tomorrow."
"I can also assure you that this system will not be as complicated in practice as many of you here imagine."
"This is a mock-up of how one of these labels will look in future."
"And there is still room for the price and any other information consumers specifically require anyway."
"You see, it can work!"
"Commissioner, this debate is going to go on until we have completed the conciliation process."
"Colleagues, I recognise there is a difficulty."
"You should corner Mr Fischler individually if you wish to speak to him."
"I have been involved in the meat industry for a number of years myself."
"The matter is not yet satisfactorily resolved."
"Mrs Jackson, do you have a point of order?"
"I am simply pointing out that the Commissioner should not give the impression that there is no room for conciliation on this."
"We have room for conciliation and the advantage, if we adopt these amendments tomorrow, is that Parliament would be openly engaged in the final form of this proposal, which otherwise we will not be."
"The matter of raising conciliation will be after the vote tomorrow."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"Proposal for a regulation on a Community patent"
"The next item is the Commission communication on the proposal for a regulation on a Community patent."
"Mr President, I am very grateful for this opportunity to inform Parliament about a decision which was taken by the Commission this morning relating to a proposal for a regulation to create a Community patent."
"That is in line with a request from the Lisbon European Council, which called for such a Community patent to be in place by the year 2001."
"Parliament explicitly supported this initiative in its contributions to the extensive consultation process which the Commission launched through its Green Paper on Innovation in Europe in 1997."
"We need a Community patent in order to stimulate innovation, which is a key factor for growth, competitiveness and job creation in Europe."
"Our industry, as well as our research and scientific community, have stressed for some time now the need for a patent which is affordable, valid throughout the Community and which offers legal security."
"That is an ambitious goal."
"Our proposal meets this ambitious goal as it aims at creating just such a patent."
"The Community patent will co-exist with, and complement, existing systems by offering a more attractive alternative for those businesses, both big and small, operating within the internal market."
"Our proposal builds extensively on the existing European patent system which governs the rules and procedures leading to the grant of European patents, and this approach requires that the Community should adhere to the European patent convention."
"By virtue of the Community patent regulation, patents delivered by the European Patent Office in Munich may become Community patents."
"The Community patent as proposed by the Commission will have the following characteristics: a Community patent will have a unitary character, it will be valid throughout the Community and it will be the subject of a single set of rules."
"This will reduce the uncertainty linked to fifteen different national legislations and, of course, after enlargement, many more."
"Legal certainty will be considerably reinforced by the creation of a centralized judicial system which will guarantee the quality and coherence of case law relating to Community patents."
"The creation of such a centralised jurisdiction requires a change to the EC Treaty."
"We now have a window of opportunity with the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference."
"We must not miss that opportunity and I should like to count on the vigorous support of Members of this Parliament in order to ensure that the IGC takes up this issue in all earnest."
"Finally, our proposal will help to reduce considerably the costs of patents in Europe by not requiring supplementary translations of the patent once it has been delivered in one of the three languages of the European Patent Office."
"May I insist on the need for an ambitious approach."
"Previous attempts to create a Community patent, in particular through the Luxembourg convention of 1989, failed because of a lack of ambition on the two key issues: firstly, the cost and secondly, the litigation."
"We must convince Member States of the need to change the Treaty to create a centralised jurisdiction for Community patent litigation."
"When looking at our proposal, one should also anticipate the consequences of enlargement on the costs and litigation in this respect."
"If we are anything less than ambitious in this field, we shall simply not provide our industry, our research and development experts with the modern patent which they need."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a regulation on a Community patent gives us the chance to review cooperation, as you have just said, between the European Patent Office and the Community institutions."
"The patent recently issued to the University of Edinburgh poses the problem of the status of the EPO and how to control it."
"In the light of what has now been referred to as a mistake, it would appear that Directive 98/44 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions is inaccurate and ambiguous, especially Articles 5(1) and 5(2)."
"Should the Commission not propose a revision of this directive in order to preclude the possibility of patenting the discovery of a gene or genetic sequence?"
"We must not skimp on this question, especially now that we are introducing a Community patent."
"I am very happy to hear that the Commission has decided to limit the number of languages that can be used for the Community patent."
"At the moment translation costs are the biggest problem when we try to reduce the costs and speed up the process."
"I warmly welcome the proposal and hope that the IGC is ready to make the necessary changes to the Treaties."
"But I would like to ask a specific question concerning the process in EPO."
"I was under the impression that the process itself would remain more or less the same in the new system."
"Why is it that at the moment the EPO uses the system of many experts instead of the system of one expert, which is in use in Japan and the United States?"
"There the patent is granted when one expert has given their opinion."
"That is also a factor in making the process in Europe more costly and slower than that of our competitors."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the Commissioner."
"I believe that this is a great achievement."
"As he has said, this is probably the most ambitious internal market project we are currently dealing with and I am happy to say this on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and as rapporteur on this issue."
"It is ambitious, Commissioner, because, in addition to what you have said, there is a fundamental reason, based on the principles of the internal market, for having a Community patent."
"If we want our internal market really to be a domestic market for companies and consumers, the current fragmentation suffered by patents, resulting from national borders, makes no sense."
"Having said this, it is an ambitious and difficult project, because, as you have mentioned, it requires a change to the Treaty and to the constitutions of at least four or six Member States."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I pray that there will be excellent cooperation between us, which we are going to need, and the capacity for negotiation so that this project can be taken to its conclusion."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply to the remarks that have just been made."
"May I start by thanking Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for the broad support that she has given the decision by the Commission to promote the Community patent."
"As far as Mrs Kauppi is concerned, may I say that the reason that the European Patent Office in Munich uses not just one but a number of experts is that it wants to ensure that the quality of the patent which is granted by the European Patent Office is of the highest quality."
"Without wishing to be unduly eurocentric, patents granted in other parts of the world, in particular one part which is across the water, if I may put it that way, are not of the same quality as the patents granted by the European Patent Office in Munich."
"So in this case I am afraid that we must continue to place security and quality above purely financial considerations."
"That is the reason why the European Patent Office uses more than one expert."
"On the first question, the Commission is aware of the concerns that have been raised in France and elsewhere about the directive and in particular about possible inconsistencies between two paragraphs of Article 5 of the directive."
"The President of France, Mr Jacques Chirac, has written to President Prodi on this question."
"May I stress that in my opinion there is no contradiction between the first two paragraphs of that article, the wording of which I believe relies heavily on suggestions made by this Parliament."
"The first paragraph provides that the human body at various stages of its formation and development and the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, cannot constitute patentable inventions."
"This paragraph is clearly in line with the basic principle that discoveries are not patentable."
"However the second paragraph of Article 5 states that an element isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process, including the sequence or the partial sequence of a gene, may constitute a patentable invention, even if the structure of that element is identical to that of a natural element."
"Here the invention arises from the isolation of a particular gene from its natural surroundings or by its production by means of a technical process."
"Of course to be patentable, that invention would still need to satisfy the criteria of novelty, inventiveness and industrial applicability."
"In respect of this last requirement, industrial applicability, the directive makes it clear that the industrial application of the gene must be specified in the patent application."
"A note setting out the Commission's position on this issue has been placed on our website."
"Needless to say the Commission will reply to President Chirac's letter and take a position on the issues he has raised."
"Our proposal on a Community patent, which is the subject of the discussion this afternoon, does not affect the existing regime, which is governed by the directive of 1998."
"That directive is due to be implemented by the end of this month and it should also bind the European Patent Office."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is important that you emphasised the coexistence of the national patents, European patents and Community patents."
"I still wonder, however, how decentralised the research regime will be with regard to the Community patents."
"It was expressly mentioned in the reply from Parliament in the Green Paper that you mentioned."
"I am also pleased that we will achieve legal certainty."
"I think, however, that it could have been achieved in a different way and without creating a Community patent."
"One question that is important to deal with here in Parliament, and that will definitely be something that affects the linguistic diversity within the EU, is also whether we will guarantee equality between small and medium-sized enterprises that operate in all parts of our Union."
"I also think it is important that in all parts of the Union we are able to retain the knowledge that is associated with research patents."
"When we recently discussed the research White Paper, we all took the view that it was vital to move forward on this topic because it was important not only to do very good research in Europe, but also to optimise the conditions for its industrial exploitation."
"So on that account I welcome Commissioner Bolkenstein's statement."
"The word 'centralisation' is unfortunate in this context because it suggests a single centre of what is already a polycentric community."
"I take it his real meaning is that there will be one court for the whole Community, not that it will necessarily be in a place which will be geographically central."
"Finally, I gather that it is proposed that software might be patented."
"My Group would be very unhappy about such a proposal."
"It seems to us that copyright is the right way to protect software and that introducing patents in this sphere would be unhelpful and contrary to good legal principle."
"We welcome the fact that this is going to be a great spur to innovation and development and the competitiveness of European industry in the future if it does get through the IGC and onto the statute book."
"Following up Mrs Fraisse's question and your response to that, the borderline must be established as to what is acceptable for patenting and what is not."
"In the biotechnology area there is still this grey area."
"You purported to have reached an absolute decision on this."
"Is there any room for manoeuvre or is that the absolutely determined and settled position of the Commission as you said in your earlier answer?"
"- May I explain that the Commission's proposal, if accepted by Parliament and by the Council, does not take away any possibilities that at present exist."
"So if the Commission's proposal is accepted there will be three ways of getting patents."
"First of all there will be the national patents which will be delivered in the national language and will be granted by the national office for the granting of patents."
"That exists now and will continue to exist."
"The second possibility that will continue to exist is the European patent granted by the European Patent Office."
"The European patent is not to be confused with the Community patent."
"The European patent is a basket of national patents, so an inventor would apply for a patent, for example, for Benelux, France and Germany, five countries out of 15."
"If the application is approved he would get a patent for those five countries, and jurisdiction would be spread over the courts of those five countries."
"That possibility - that is the reality at the moment - will continue to exist."
"The third possibility we are now discussing is one patent of unitary character, in other words it is granted and then it applies to the whole Community."
"That is why it is called the Community patent."
"May I stress that this is an option inventors have, they can go either for a national patent or for a European patent or for a Community patent."
"The Commission does not intend to take away any possibilities that exist at present."
"Let me address Mrs Thors who asked about decentralisation in this field."
"We cannot have it both ways."
"We cannot have our cake and eat it."
"In other words, if we want a Community patent, granted at a single place, namely Munich, which at one go applies to the whole Community, we must have a central jurisdiction to judge litigation for patents."
"That is why the Commission has proposed that a tribunal to judge litigation in the case of intellectual property be set up, and the logical place for that tribunal to exist is in Luxembourg."
"That is also what I would like to say to Mr MacCormick."
"We are not concerned here with any geographical centrality - although I must admit I do not know whether Luxembourg is or is not in the centre of the European Union."
"Certainly with the enlargement of the European Union the geographic centre of the Union would shift eastwards."
"We have chosen the place where the European Court of Justice is located for the Community's tribunal on intellectual property."
"May I come back to Mrs Thors and say that as far as small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned, the Commission proposal does not take away any possibilities for small and medium-sized enterprises to partake of inventions published by the European Patent Office."
"75% of patents are delivered in English, and the current language in the world of intellectual property, in the world of patents, is English."
"Secondly there are national patent offices."
"Let them use their capacity to enlighten small and medium enterprises about what is going on in Munich and what has been published in English, French or German."
"In that way they can stimulate and help the small and medium enterprises existing in those respective countries."
"Lastly, on the matter of patents for biotechnological inventions, which was raised both in the previous round of questions and just now again, may I stress that the decision taken by the Commission this morning does not change anything in the area that was alluded to by both speakers."
"The question then arises: does the Commission have room for manoeuvre in this respect?"
"Only those people who have no ideas never change their ideas, so it would be bizarre if the Commission had no room for manoeuvre."
"We are considering that, we have received the letter from the President of the French Republic, we shall answer that letter obviously, there is already a note which is available on our website and we shall do our best to steer a course which is the most sensible one."
"Mr President, I would like to follow up Mrs Kauppi' s question, in relation to the strategy on the level of invention."
"A high level of invention has the advantage that it is easy to defend in court, because revocation proceedings are of course a huge problem."
"A low level of invention has the advantage that many companies and inventors can submit their inventions and obtain a patent very quickly."
"That is why I believe that the strategic level Europe is to adopt is a vital issue, because the Japanese, for instance, have now adopted the principle of a low level of invention and accordingly have a flood of applications."
"Europe and the European Patent Office in fact have a very high level of inventiveness."
"I believe that this is enormously significant as an instrument of economic policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate you on presenting this proposal."
"Indeed we all hope that in the interests of the competitiveness of the European Union, this unending Community patent saga will now have a happy ending."
"That is why it was right - and I would like to specifically support you here - not to overburden this proposal with sensitive issues such as patent protection for biotechnology products."
"I also entreat my fellow Members not to raise issues of principle on language matters."
"This is a special field subject to special arrangements."
"Commissioner, with regard to jurisdiction, you just mentioned in passing that the relevant jurisdiction would of course be in Luxembourg."
"I hope that was not a reference to a possible location for the European Patent Court."
"It would possibly make more sense for it to be located in Munich together with the European Patent Office, because all the necessary expertise is available there, which would facilitate cooperation."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Bolkestein warmly on the initiative he has shown, the energy he has displayed and the success he has achieved in respect of the European Community patent."
"I would like to ask him four questions."
"As I understand it, some Commissioners, as well as people other than Commissioners, have problems with the proposed language system."
"I am not fanatical about languages, but I do wonder why there should be three languages and not five, as is the case in the Community Trademark Office."
"Would this cause a real problem?"
"Secondly, the decision to convert the office in Munich into an EU agency has to be approved unanimously by fifteen governments."
"Is that a problem?"
"Thirdly, on the position of the European Parliament, we do not really have much of a say."
"Does this mean that the European Parliament, which has worked harder than anyone else to achieve a European Community patent, will not be involved, or at least be updated in good time and on a regular basis?"
"Finally, what is the latest on the future expansion of the Community patent?"
"Six questions have been put by three Members of your assembly."
"Perhaps I may deal with them one by one."
"Firstly, on the matter of thresholds, the only threshold I am aware of is a threshold of quality and we must continue to provide patents which satisfy definite criteria of quality."
"Earlier this afternoon I replied to a question by Mrs Kauppi where she asked why the European Patent Office did not satisfy itself with just one expert and the reason I gave is that we need the highest quality patents and therefore it is sometimes necessary to use more than one expert."
"I do not think we should adulterate the quality of the patents delivered by the European Patent Office and therefore we should maintain the threshold as it is."
"The same Member of Parliament asked about jurisdiction."
"Once again, a Community patent needs a Community jurisdiction and it seems to us that this court which will consist of specialised judges but which of course forms part of the whole court system of the European Union would be best placed in Luxembourg, but that is purely a matter of the location of the court."
"On competitiveness, may I say that is one of the prime considerations why we engaged in this whole exercise."
"Business and the research community want a single patent available at one go for the whole Community and one that is cheap."
"The average cost of European patents is three times the cost of an average Japanese patent and five times the cost of an average American patent."
"Obviously this is to the detriment of European competitiveness."
"As far as the languages are concerned, and here I come to a question put by Mr De Clercq, if we followed the Luxembourg Convention of 1989, which meant that all patents had to be translated into 11 languages, the cost of that translation alone would be EUR 17,000 on average, whereas the system the Commission is now proposing will cost EUR 2,000."
"That is also the reason why the Luxembourg convention was never operative."
"It was concluded but it was not ratified in the Member States required and therefore it never became operative and that is because we were not ambitious enough either in the jurisdiction or in the costs."
"Mr De Clercq says why can we not have five languages."
"The reason is that the construction of the Community patent is such that the European Patent Office grants a patent for the whole Community and therefore we will leave the whole process up to the granting of the patent as it is now."
"After that it becomes valid throughout the Community and then there is a court to sit on litigation, but up to the granting of the patent itself the European Patent Office will continue to work as it does now."
"May I point out that the European Patent Office is not a Community agency."
"There is a European Patent Convention and 15 Member States have signed the Convention but a number of other states have also signed it so the Commission cannot tell the European Patent Office what its language arrangements should be."
"Therefore when Mr De Clercq says why could the European Patent Office not become an agency of the European Union my answer is that the European Union must sign up to the European Patent Convention and should negotiate that but it is no longer realistic to expect the European Patent Office to become a Union agency."
"The penultimate point, raised by Mr De Clercq, was about the codecision procedure."
"That will remain as it normally is and therefore Parliament will play its normal role in considering the mandates and the aims of the Commission when these issues are decided in full this autumn."
"Lastly, when enlargement takes place the Union will become bigger, obviously, and the Community patent will then apply to the countries that have acceded to the European Union."
"There is no other way of keeping and maintaining a Community patent."
"Once again, the two other possibilities will continue to exist, so there will continue to be a Polish National Patent and there will also continue to be a European Patent which may if the applicant wishes, include Poland."
"Let us hope that most European businesses and most European research experts will promote the shift from the European Patent to the Community Patent so that the competitiveness of the European Union is improved as much as possible."
"Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Bolkestein."
"That concludes the Commission' s statement and the subsequent debate."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0532/00). We will examine questions to the Commission."
"First part"
"Question No 25 by (H-0549/00):"
"Subject: Cybercrime Work is in progress to tackle cybercrime (Council of Europe, the G7' s Lyon Group)."
"In addition, the Commission has recently made proposals and is now considering taking new measures at Community level to combat crime."
"Apparently the Commission is discussing a paper with the Member States without even informing Parliament that it is doing so."
"One of the measures under consideration is a requirement for service-providers to gather and store traffic data and, upon request, supply it to the authorities."
"Does the Commission realise that such a measure could present enormous risks to personal data protection and the protection of sensitive commercial data and would facilitate industrial and economic espionage?"
"Does the Commission realise that such a measure might destroy users' confidence in the Internet?"
"Does the Commission realise that such a measure would be inconsistent with the Commission' s recent eEurope initiative, the aim of which was to encourage the use of the Internet both by private individuals and by businesses?"
"Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, Members of Parliament, since December 1999 the Commission has undertaken informal consultations with representatives from Member States' law enforcement and personal data protection authorities and from European industry, mostly Internet service providers and telecommunications operators, with a view to drafting the communication announced in its annual work programme on possible options for further action by the European Union against computer-related crime."
"The Commission considers that any solution to the complex issue of preservation of traffic data should achieve a fair balance between the different needs and interests of those involved, while fully ensuring fundamental human rights with regard to privacy and personal data protection."
"There are quite different, important concerns to be taken into account."
"On the one hand, privacy protection authorities have considered that the most effective means of reducing unacceptable risks to privacy, while recognising the need for effective law enforcement, is that traffic data should in principle not be kept only for law enforcement purposes."
"On the other hand, law enforcement authorities have stated that they consider the preservation of a minimum amount of traffic data for a minimum period of time necessary to facilitate criminal investigations."
"Adequate security of any preserved traffic data will have to be ensured."
"Industry should be helped in the fight against crimes like hacking and computer fraud, but not be confronted with measures that are unreasonably costly."
"Furthermore, industry will have a key role to play in contributing on a voluntary basis to the process of creating a safer information society."
"Users should have confidence in the safety of the information society and feel protected from crime and from infringements of their privacy."
"The e-Europe draft Action Plan, prepared by the Commission and very recently adopted by the Santa Maria da Feira Summit of the European Council, includes the establishment of a coordinated and coherent approach to cyber-crime by the end of 2002 in order to ensure greater cooperation on these key issues."
"In the same context of the e-Europe initiative, as well as in the multiannual action plan on safer use of the Internet, the Commission plans to support a number of actions aimed at stimulating the use of the Internet and promoting security and confidence among the users."
"I would like to say thank you very much for a nice reply, which, however, did not quite answer my questions."
"We perhaps, therefore, need to discuss this in the future in order to get a complete answer."
"We all want to combat cyber crime."
"It is important that it is crime that is curbed and not the new economy."
"To this end, all parties concerned must be involved in this consultation and present their views in good time."
"This not only applies to the EU institutions and Member States, but also to the consumer and industry, so that we do not find ourselves in a situation of inconsistency in which one hand is doing something relating to the eEurope initiative, while at the same time we are doing something else in connection with crime."
"It is a question of creating confidence in development if e-commerce is to work."
"Therefore, the work cannot be carried out in secret."
"Rather, it is important that we obtain analyses in this area of the consequences of the proposals."
"In Feira it is precisely consumer confidence that is being identified as a key factor for the development of e-commerce."
"I would like to conclude with a follow-up question: when will we get an assessment of the consequences for consumers, industry and economic espionage, which may otherwise be in danger of developing?"
"I share the view of the honourable Member in the sense that we cannot conduct this exercise in a secret way."
"It is not the intention of the Commission to do anything in secret generally and more specifically, in this area."
"On the contrary, we are trying to promote broad consultation on this issue, which is a very difficult one."
"Nobody has yet found the right answer."
"We have to follow the discussions that are going on in several international fora, for example the special convention the Council of Europe is preparing on cybercrime and the discussion on OECD."
"We also need to follow very closely the evolution of the legislative amendments that are being introduced in several Member States, dealing with the very sensitive question of retaining traffic data for the purpose of law enforcement."
"As I have said to Mrs Cederschiöld, the e-initiative action plan will also include a list of actions aimed at reinforcing security for the users of the Internet and also on the specific question of e-commerce."
"According to the timetable fixed by the Summit of Santa Maria Da Feira these actions will be implemented in the next few months and we will get the assessment that the honourable Member mentioned in her question."
"I was impressed by the Commissioner's balanced response to this question but it does not fit particularly well with the UK Government's proposal that the secret services - MI5 and MI6 - should perform surveillance of all Internet traffic."
"They intend to demand the surrender of encryption codes and to penalise those who fail to surrender them even if the codes have been lost and are unobtainable."
"Does the Commission consider that this proposal is, firstly, consistent with civil rights, as enunciated for the Community, and, secondly, in the interests of the development of Internet use in the European Union, as rhetorically advocated by everyone, including in particular the British Prime Minister?"
"I share your view that the question of having a strategy for encryption at European level is a key tool in enhancing security in the use of the Internet."
"But as you can imagine, in this new field we have to address the need to reinforce security on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, in the sense that we have to recognise that each Member State is entitled to adopt its own national legislation to guarantee law enforcement at national level."
"What we in the Commission do is to coordinate efforts at European level to guarantee law enforcement."
"Our approach is to guarantee minimum common levels of law enforcement at European level, which does not prevent Member States introducing more stringent or national legislation."
"Nevertheless a comparison of national legislations would be an important factor when we adopt common rules at European level."
"I cannot give you a broad picture at the moment because in several Member States, such as the UK, legislation is still under preparation and has not yet been fully adopted by the national parliaments."
"Question No 26 by Mr Watts will not be replied to since it is included in the agenda of the current part-session."
"Question No 27 by (H-0543/00):"
"Subject: Non-allied status of certain EU Member States At the Feira European Council discussions are being held on the EU' s defence dimension, and the matter is also up for discussion at the IGC."
"Some EU Member States do not belong to the NATO military alliance."
"What is the Commission' s view of the position of these Member States in any future EU defence cooperation?"
"The European Union has made remarkable progress in shaping a European security and defence policy over the past year."
"From Cologne via Helsinki to Feira we have gone from an ambitious vision to concrete targets, first military and now also civilian headline goals and the establishment of new specific structures."
"This very welcome development has given substance to the objectives of the 'Petersberg principles' as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Like their incorporation into the Treaty a few years ago this has only been possible with the full and active support of all Member States."
"It is too early to say whether any further Treaty change in this area is required at this stage."
"There has been no formal discussion of the European Union's defence dimension in the IGC framework so far."
"The presidency report to Feira indicated that the conclusions of Cologne and Helsinki could be implemented without it being legally necessary to amend the Treaty unless the Council's decision-making powers were to be altered or the Treaty's provisions regarding the WEU needed to be amended."
"The presidency has suggested that the issue of a revision of the ESDP provisions in the Treaty should remain open to examination as required before the Nice European Council."
"As for the specific question of the position in any future defence cooperation of EU Member States that do not belong to Nato, this is first and foremost an issue to be addressed by the Member States concerned."
"What is clear is that the military headline goal agreed at the Helsinki European Council will require a concerted and coordinated effort by all Member States."
"As to the shape of individual national military contributions, these will be discussed at the pledging conference to be held in the autumn under the French presidency."
"Again, how non-Nato EU states view their role and what their contribution to the defence dimension of the European Union should be is rightfully for these Member States to say."
"But it may be helpful to distinguish between two component parts of the overall European security and defence equation, the Petersberg tasks of peace-keeping and peace enforcement on the one hand and territorial defence on the other."
"The European Union's stated aim is to be ready to support action within the framework of Petersberg tasks."
"All EU Member States have agreed this and are ready to contribute to it."
"The excellent record of the European neutrals in the field of peacekeeping and crisis management operations has come very much to the fore in the new European security context."
"All four Member States which are not also members of Nato are contributing actively and constructively to the development of CFSB in general and to the European security and defence policy in particular."
"Their contribution to the last IGC was indeed crucial to the inclusion of the Petersberg tasks in the new Treaty."
"Finally, I have no doubt that their contribution in this area - materially as well as in the ongoing discussions shaping the new structures of cooperation will continue to be both active and ambitious, be it in the military or non-military dimensions of conflict prevention, conflict resolution and crisis management."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I thank you for your full reply."
"I would still like to have a more specific idea of those principles that were decided upon at the Feira meeting."
"There the concept of flexibility was adopted for the intergovernmental conference."
"I would ask you whether it is your interpretation that this concept has now been extended to Pillar II issues."
"As I said, I do not think it is necessary to have any treaty change."
"That is my personal view, but I am sure that will be considered by Member States during the course of the next few months."
"One issue which, of course, bears directly on the flexibility under Pillar II to which the honourable gentlemen referred is the whole question of Article 5 of the WEU, which is not being transferred to the EU, and this may of course have been behind the question."
"What is being transferred is the Petersberg tasks alone, with of course the institutional and administrative mechanisms which are at the disposal of the European Union."
"There are various possibilities about what will happen to the collective defence clause but it is not, given my responsibilities, really a question for me."
"Pillar II issues have to be addressed to the Member States but, given our related responsibilities under Pillar I, we take an interest."
"Question No 28 by (H-0555/00):"
"Subject: International Criminal Court The Commission, and particularly the Commissioner for humanitarian aid, played an important role in the setting-up of the new, permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) in June 1998."
"The adoption of the Rome Statute - on which the ICC is founded - was an important step in breaking the tendency towards the systematic use of rape as a strategy of war."
"The Statute is the first international accord to stipulate that rape, sexual slavery and forced pregnancy may be treated as crimes against humanity and war crimes."
"However, to become a reality, the Rome Statute must be ratified by 60 States."
"Although all the EU Member States have signed the Statute, only Italy, unfortunately, has ratified it.."
"What initiatives does the Commission intend to take to ensure that this important Statute is ratified?"
"The Commission is aware that so far two Member States, Italy and France, have ratified the ICC Convention."
"However most Member States will ratify the Convention during this year, including some already this summer such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands."
"Other Member States will shortly present legislation to their parliaments."
"The Commission supports NGO initiatives that promote the establishment of the ICC."
"In 1999 about EUR 1.5 million was allocated to such activities in line with the budgetary comments for budget line B7706 of Chapter B77."
"Mr President, it is, of course, gratifying that several EU countries are about to ratify this agreement."
"It is in fact two years since we adopted the agreement. At the same time it only needs a fifth of the 60 countries to ratify it in order for the treaty to come into effect."
"It is, of course, very doubtful whether it will be done in time for December this year."
"It is, however, extremely important, because the treaty from the Rome Conference is the first international agreement that establishes that rape and forced pregnancy can be treated as war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"Experience from those courts we have set up, namely the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, clearly show that the present system is inadequate for dealing with the type of crimes I have just mentioned."
"However, in order for the ICC to be able to work, broad international support is necessary."
"My question to the Commission is therefore: Have you any plans at all to try to persuade important countries such as the United States, Russia and Japan to also sign the agreement from the Rome Conference?"
"First of all I wholly endorse what the honourable Member has said about the importance of the statute's inclusion of crimes of sexual violence as crimes against humanity when, as has been the case, they are committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population."
"What we have seen in that context and in other criminal activities is of course the most powerful argument for us getting ahead with ratification of the convention by as many countries as possible."
"I think I am right in saying that 160 nations decided to establish the international criminal court and the statute of the court was approved by about 120 states, so there should be no problem in moving from the 50 who have ratified to the 60 figure which we require in order to move things forward."
"We have certainly pursued the importance of ratification with the United States."
"We do not, as the honourable Member will know, accept the US position on the ICC."
"We continue to argue our case with them and we will argue it with Russia and Japan and other countries as well."
"It comes up fairly regularly in our bilateral contacts and I would make sure that it did if that were not the case."
"We think this is potentially an extremely important institution, particularly in view of some of the appalling things that have happened in the last few years."
"The sooner the court can sit, the better for everyone."
"Mr President, does the Commission think it possible that the European Community will be associated with the Rome Convention?"
"If it is, what would be the relation between the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the ICC?"
"There are questions of our judicial personality or lack of judicial personality which have a direct bearing on that."
"What we are concerned about at present, and this is very much where the Commission comes in - is encouraging all our Member States to ratify and encouraging some of our partners and colleagues in the international community to do so as well."
"That has to be our objective in order to make sure that the provisions that were so widely supported in Rome actually lead to the establishment of a functioning court as soon as possible."
"The Commission is fully aware of the environmental problems in the Alpine corridors, but points out that it must act in a balanced way in order to take account of the different interests at play in this kind of situation."
"The Brenner is one of the crucial transit routes via the Alps and is therefore a good example of the need to act in a balanced way, with regard to both railways and roads, in order to protect the environment and, at the same time, guarantee the free movement of goods."
"As regards the railways, the Commission - as the honourable Members know - supports the measures adopted by the Member States to develop and implement the Brenner railway project."
"The Brenner high speed railway line has been included on the list of maximum priority Community projects and has received considerable Community funding via the Trans-European Networks."
"With regard to the roads, we must stress that an increase in road traffic in no way automatically implies more pollution."
"For example, the Eco-point system has shown that the emissions of polluting gases from lorries in transit through Austria have dropped despite the increase in the number of journeys made."
"In general, the Commission will continue to seek solutions to the environmental problems caused by traffic."
"In this respect you should be aware that the Commission has committed itself, in this year' s working programme, to producing a communication on traffic in the sensitive regions of the European Union, which include the Alpine region."
"The result of this communication will have an influence on the future actions envisaged which, according to the initial guidelines, will include a coherent package of supplementary measures to reduce the effect of traffic in sensitive areas: technical standards to improve environmental and safety requirements, instruments for setting tariffs in order to adjust the levels relating to transport to the real cost of transport in all its forms, and an increase in the efficiency of transport, especially by improving intermodality, and increasing the competitivity of rail transport."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her comments and for her willingness, which she expressed several times before this House, to take into due consideration the environmental impact on an alpine area which is made particularly vulnerable by its altitude and its geographical location."
"We have proposed new solutions in draft form, which have also recently been put forward to the Commissioner."
"I consider that this proposal could be a pilot solution for the new projects and the concept of European Union transport as a whole."
"I hope that the willingness hitherto displayed by the Commissioner will be mirrored throughout the rest of the Commission and that her intentions will receive majority backing from the European Commission as well."
"Commission. (ES) Mr President, I simply wish to thank the Member for this intervention and say that, of course, we are going to go ahead with the Brenner project, although, given its technical difficulties, it is not a project which can be carried out overnight."
"However, I hope that, before concluding the period set for the 14 Essen projects, the Brenner project will be under way."
"Mr President, we all know that there is an atmosphere of crisis on the Brenner, and I think that it is imperative to discuss plans for extending it and to look at pricing again, because we simply have to get a hold on the situation."
"My question is this: do you have any actual plans - we have already had the Green Paper - to put efficient transport pricing, particularly on the Brenner model, into practice?"
"Question No 30 by (H-0524/00):"
"Subject: The use of Community funds by Turkey The 22 January 2000 edition of the Turkish 'Hürriyet' newspaper reported that some of the funds provided by the European Union to assist the victims of the earthquake which occurred last year were used to purchase 35 automobiles to a value of TRL 500 billion to facilitate travel by Turkish MPs."
"Can the Commission state what was the total amount of funding granted by the European Union to Turkey following the disastrous earthquake last year and what measures were taken to ensure that the Community funds were properly used? What is the Commission' s position concerning the above allegation contained in the 'Hürriyet' , a Turkish newspaper with a very wide circulation?"
"More specifically, will the Commission demand the return of those funds which were used for purposes other than that for which they were intended, in flagrant violation of Community rules, in order to satisfy consumerist requirements of Turkish MPs rather than providing assistance to the victims of the tragic earthquake?"
"First let me pass on the information that the European Commission via the Humanitarian Aid Office, ECHO, allocated a total amount of EUR 30 million to aid the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey last year."
"The programmes were started in August and are still ongoing."
"As to the specific question relating to an article in a Turkish newspaper on the 22 January, I can say that there is no Community funding involved in what this article relates to. We have received assurances on this from two different sources."
"Written confirmation has been received from the Commission's representation office in Ankara that the article in question makes no reference to European Union or any external source of funds."
"Also there has been confirmation from ECHO's office in Istanbul that the Turkish Parliament Foundation is a private organisation established by, and financed by, the parliament members individually."
"The way the money is being used is decided by the council of the parliament after being voted by the members."
"The background for the newspaper article was that a unilateral decision was made by the head of the Turkish parliament to allocate funds to the earthquake area."
"These funds had earlier been earmarked for the purchase of 35 cars for members of the parliamentary council and the council members objected to this reallocation considering that the original decision to buy new cars should be reinstated in the interest of cost-effectiveness."
"The funds in question actually belong to the Turkish Parliament Foundation and this is financed by the members of parliament in Turkey."
"So we have absolutely nothing to do with this matter and for that reason I cannot promise any kind of follow-up action either."
"My warmest thanks to the Commissioner for his detailed reply to my question and for his reassurance that the funds provided by the European Union were not used to buy cars for use by certain Turkish MPs."
"What bothers me is the fact that the Hürriyet, which is, I believe, the most widely read Turkish newspaper, did not meet with any denial on the part of the Turkish Government and, as we all know, freedom of the press is something of a problem in Turkey."
"Journalists who go off the straight and narrow and report this sort of information are not just reprimanded, they are usually thrown in jail and sometimes even killed."
"But I do want to believe that the reply given by the Commissioner following a thorough investigation by the European Union authorities in Turkey paints the right picture."
"If indeed no such thing has happened, allow me to make a little joke by saying that, in that case, instead of giving these cars to Turkish MPs, they should give them to the MEPs in the regions, who are unable to use their cars and travel by public transport."
"I would ask Members to limit themselves to new questions or supplementary questions."
"I understand the importance of your assessments, but we must abide by the Rules of Procedure."
"Question No 31 by (H-0540/00):"
"Subject: Developing countries and farm animal welfare What steps is the Commission taking, both through the Community' s development programme and its influence on the world stage, to encourage developing countries not to adopt industrial animal husbandry systems, as these pose serious threats to poverty alleviation, the environment, human health and animal welfare in developing countries?"
"The question reads 'Does the Commission coordinate with EU Member States and other international institutions on the problem of industrialisation of animal husbandry' and the answer is yes."
"The Commission participates actively in the Livestock Environment and Development initiative."
"The members of the steering committee here are Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, the UK, the USA, Costa Rica, EFAT, the World Bank, the FAO, Senegal, India, China and Kenya."
"The initiative's targets are the protection and enhancement of natural resources as affected by livestock production while alleviating poverty."
"Earlier work under this initiative has identified on a global scale the consequences of increased pressure on grazing and mixing farming systems, and the dangers of the shift to industrial modes of production."
"It has highlighted the close and complex interaction between government policies and the environmental impact of livestock production, and identified a large number of technologies which are available to mitigate the negative effects in all different production modes, provided the appropriate policy framework is in place."
"So this is something we are giving quite some attention to."
"The problem is that it is very big and it will probably be growing, but we are participating actively in the best international efforts to do something meaningful."
"I thank the Commissioner for that helpful answer and I am very pleased to hear that these issues are being taken seriously."
"I wonder though if the Commissioner would say whether or not he would agree that intensive agriculture is not likely to be the way forward for north or south when we consider that the world population at the end of this century will be 10 billion."
"If they were all to aspire to eat a US diet we would need four planets the size of earth to produce the extra 9 billion tonnes of grain required."
"And, in particular, would he agree, or disagree with the FAO when they say that the trend of further intensification of demand in production is inescapable?"
"I find that a very worrying statement coming out of the Food and Agriculture authority and would like to know very much whether or not the Commissioner agrees that such intensification is inevitable or would he agree that there are other alternatives and that those are alternatives that all of us ought to be promoting and pursuing?"
"The problem is that, as groups of people in even quite poor countries earn a better way of living, their diet changes."
"This is a very clear pattern and demand for more protein is also increasing."
"These statistics, the extrapolation if you will, should be taken quite seriously."
"On the other hand, many projections have been made about where we would be today, which are definitely not being fulfilled."
"We adopted in the Community already in 1989 a directive on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes."
"In addition, a protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam relates to the protection and welfare of animals, and these policies and ideas are of course taken into account in the Community's development aid in the livestock sector."
"We have never supported any husbandry industrialisation project, but we have been supportive of an intensification of traditional farming systems of benefit to smallholders, and environmental conservation has always been taken carefully into account."
"We are using and taking seriously environmental analyses of the consequences of these activities wherever we are supporting agriculture."
"Mr President, what exactly does the Commission consider to be defined, and I quote from the question, as 'industrial animal-husbandry systems'."
"Would it not be unreasonable to discourage developing countries from employing modern, efficient, cost-effective and humane systems of animal husbandry?"
"The distinction is as difficult to make in a developing country environment as it is in Europe."
"This is clear to everybody."
"However, the poverty dimension in what we are trying to support and promote means that more intensified small-scale production is what we are supporting."
"As to the problems related to genuinely industrial-scale activities in this sector, we are working with the group of other donors and countries involved whom I mentioned, in order to do this as sustainably and acceptably as possible."
"Question No 32 by (H-0567/00):"
"Subject: Mr Gavin Howard and the Programme de Développement de la Région Nord (PDRN II) EEC (DG VIII) In a letter dated 2 February 2000 to Commissioner Nielson, I asked the Commission to resolve the compensation problems of a UK national, Mr Gavin Howard, who had previously worked as a technical adviser on an EU-sponsored project in the Central African Republic in 1996."
"As a result of events well beyond his control, much of his equipment and many of his belongings were ransacked while he was working on the project."
"Since 1996, he has sought compensation for the losses that he suffered whilst working for the EU, since he maintains that he was covered by EU insurance."
"Full details of this case have been previously forwarded to Mr Nielson's private office."
"Will the Commission agree to compensate Mr Howard for his losses?"
"The mutiny which took place in 1996 in the Central African Republic caused considerable hardship and personal danger to a number of people working there."
"Thankfully they were safely evacuated."
"Mr Howard was under contract to an association of consultants."
"It is for Mr Howard's employer to consider any payment to him which might be possible or provided for under the terms of the contract."
"Compensation for the loss of personal belongings out of EDF funds is not justifiable in a situation of force majeure."
"Mr Howard was not directly contracted as a staff member by us but was working for a company."
"I regret the delay in providing the honourable Member with the information requested."
"The answer I have given today will be confirmed in writing shortly."
"Well that did not hurt, did it?"
"I have been waiting for that reply since 2 February and I simply cannot understand why it has taken the Commission so long to come up with that negative."
"I accept the negative, but the fact of the matter is that I am a Member of the European Parliament."
"I have been waiting five months for that reply."
"Why?"
"My reaction to this is that I cannot understand it either but from the moment I was directly informed about this we started reacting."
"I would unfortunately have to put this one in the category of cases showing what some of the problems are between the services in the Commission."
"Question No 33 by (H-0573/00):"
"Subject: Humanitarian aid for the Chechen people How much humanitarian aid has the Commission sent to date to the civilian population in Chechnya - including expellees in neighbouring countries - and how has it sent it, and what is the programme for the remainder of the year?"
"- Since the beginning of the present conflict the European Commission, via its humanitarian aid office, has allocated a total of EUR 12.6 million in humanitarian aid to the victims of this on-going emergency."
"This total amount is composed of two decisions taken in the autumn of 1999, one of them relating to EUR 2.4 million, the other for EUR 10.2 million allocated under the 2000 budget."
"A little more than EUR 10 million are currently under implementation."
"ECHO is constantly monitoring the further development of the situation and a contingency of EUR 4.8 million for the northern Caucusus has been set aside within ECHO's annual budget, so financially we are prepared to do more."
"If the evolution of the situation should require, these additional funds then can be mobilised."
"Among ECHO's implementing partners are the UNHCR, the ICRC and several European NGOs."
"During the first months of the crisis, humanitarian operations mainly focused on the important concentrations of internally displaced persons in Ingushetia and to some extent on the limited number of victims who have found refuge in Georgia and Daghestan."
"More recently operations have increasingly been focusing on Chechnya itself."
"Unfortunately humanitarian aid work in some areas of Chechnya strongly affected by the hostilities is still not possible, as lack of security makes these areas inaccessible."
"ECHO programmes in the northern Caucusus cover a broad range of aid sectors, for example, food, medical aid, shelter, water, sanitation, essential relief items and psycho-social assistance."
"Planning of future assistance has to take into account the volatility of the situation on the ground."
"In order to facilitate programming, ECHO carried out a technical assessment mission in Chechnya in May."
"Pending a positive evolution of the general working environment, a further increase in operations inside Chechnya itself will be a major priority."
"Bearing in mind that a quick return of all the displaced persons currently residing in Ingushetia becomes more and more unlikely, it will also be necessary to duly take into consideration an adequate follow-up to the on-going operations in this area."
"Commissioner, thank you very much for your detailed reply."
"I would like to ask a supplementary question: what is the position on funds already spent?"
"What proportion went direct to the Chechens affected and what proportion was channelled via Russian institutions, authorities and organisations?"
"- It all went to the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries, in spite of the fact that I was very careful to announce to Parliament that this would have to be what we call a remote-controlled operation because of the situation there."
"We have been able to do it in a fashion which we are quite happy with. We have not been using Russian organisations in a way that gives any concern."
"So we are quite pleased."
"What we are not pleased with has been the lack of more direct access into Chechnya."
"Thank you very much, Mr Nielson."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commissioner has elapsed, Question No 34 will be replied to in writing."
"Questions to Mr Barnier"
"I should like to give Mr Nogueira Román as accurate an answer as possible on this extremely important question, which he is not the first to raise, i.e. the application of the principle of additionality during the management and implementation of the Structural Funds, for which I am responsible."
"Mr Nogueira Román, I pay close attention to the information which we request and which the Member States send to us on this question."
"I am able to tell you that, to date, the Commission has not identified any Member State which has failed to apply the principle of additionality when implementing the Structural Funds, as defined in the general regulation, especially since Berlin."
"However, to be perfectly objective, I do realise that, since this principle was introduced in 1989, difficulties have arisen as regards the transmission of information to the Commission by a number of Member States, from the point of view both of the methodology used and the regularity and frequency of the reports."
"In view of these problems and in order to solve them, the Council decided, at the Commission's proposal, to simplify the control and application of additionality for the new programming period starting this year and ending in 2006."
"As a result, Mr Nogueira Román, additionality is now only verified three times during the period, rather than annually."
"In the same spirit, each Member State is allowed a certain degree of flexibility in setting the starting point for average expenditure between 1994 and 1999."
"At this stage, I am, objectively-speaking, satisfied with the ex ante verification of additionality prior to the adoption of programming documents for 2000-2006."
"But that does not mean that I shall relax my vigilance, nor does it mean that I shall stop asking questions; as I have reminded several governments, I shall continue to monitor the application of additionality closely."
"Most Member States have sent in appropriate information, especially regarding funding."
"This information indicates, generally speaking, that their own structural public expenditure has been maintained and, in most cases, that there will be an average substantial increase in this expenditure between 2000 and 2006."
"Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, I would like to thank you for your proposal."
"As you will understand, my question - based as it was on the moral conviction that many States, including, I am quite sure, Spain, are not observing the principle of additionality - was in part a rhetorical one designed to elicit a response from you."
"In any case, as it is obvious that failure to observe the principle of additionality has very serious adverse effects in countries which are less economically developed and have higher levels of unemployment, I would like to ask if you are willing to put in place new and much needed conceptual policy administration instruments which would genuinely, and with the full force of the law, prevent a practice which makes a mockery of the use of Community funds and the very objectives of social and territorial cohesion within the European Union for which you are responsible as a member of the Commission."
"Mr Nogueira Román, your question specifically targets the countries or regions with the most difficulties."
"I should like to point out that several of the least developed countries benefit from both regional policy funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"It is true, Mr Nogueira Román, and there is a text with which I must comply, stating that the Cohesion Fund is not subject to additionality requirements."
"It is not subject to this principle because, may I remind you, the Cohesion Fund was and still is there to help less developed Member States catch up and, in numerous cases, accede to monetary union."
"That is one part of my reply."
"Now you are calling on me in your question to use the general regulation at my disposal and really ensure that the principle of additionality is applied."
"I must admit that there is a weakness in the regulation as regards possible sanctions for countries which do not comply with this principle."
"That is why I put in so much effort, in a preventive sense, when we approve the Community support frameworks, when we approve the SPDs, when I meet the ministers who come and see me, when I go and see them in the field, almost every week in some region of Europe, in stating my attachment to a number of principles."
"The principle of additionality, the principle of partnership, compliance with major policies - we shall discuss that later with Mrs Frassoni - and compliance with the major European policies, especially environmental policies."
"It is true that the general regulation for the Structural Funds makes no provision for specific sanctions for Member States which do not apply the principle of additionality."
"However, in application of article 11 of the general regulation, the Commission makes and will continue to make approval of Community support frameworks, SPDs for 2000-2006 and mid-term approval and reprogramming conditional upon our departments being sent information on the principle of additionality and compliance with it by the Member States."
"There you have it; I have been frank with you."
"I admit that there is a weakness from the point of view of sanctions for those who do not comply with additionality."
"At the present time I am being particularly clear and attentive and I can assure you everyone will have an extremely precise mid-term meeting."
"The problem may also be that even where a state formally complies the idea of the structural funds does not make the difference that it should."
"Mr Barnier has said that from 2000 to 2006 there will definitely be an increase in expenditure but nothing guarantees that the state increase in expenditure will be focused on the areas which the Community has taken as targets for structural funding."
"Indeed, Mr Barnier has made it absolutely plain that the Community does not and cannot inquire into that point."
"So it seems to me a little bizarre that we spend ages trying to build up exactly correct structural maps in the full knowledge that nothing under the additionality principle actually guarantees that the Member State will increase expenditure in the region in question."
"That does seem to me to be a radical fault in the concept of additionality and one that needs to be reformed."
"Mr MacCormick, thank you for highlighting this point."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you must expect a Commissioner to implement the policy which you want and to comply with the texts and regulations laid down by you and the Council."
"In this specific case, I said 'a weakness' ."
"When I say 'weakness' , Mr Nogueira, Mr MacCormick, I do not just note that it exists, fold my arms and say: 'That's how it is, there is nothing I can do!'"
"I am not a fatalist."
"So, as soon as we start preparing the new regional policy for 2006 and 2013, I shall ensure that account is taken of these weaknesses and shall submit my proposals."
"There is probably another point which needs revising, as Mr MacCormick has pointed out, and that is that we need to check if the principle of additionality is being applied and we can only do so at national level for both Objective 1 and Objective 2."
"That is our problem."
"We can confirm that the principle is being applied at national level and, at the same time, that it is not being applied in a region where it is needed."
"That is what Mr MacCormick has highlighted."
"Again vigilance is my watchword and has been, especially vis-à-vis the United Kingdom."
"I ask questions, I draw attention to specific cases pointed out to me, as the honourable Member has done."
"Nonetheless, I must also say that the regulation does not allow me, on this precise point, to issue instructions."
"I can do no more than demonstrate that I am keen to enter into dialogue and that I am available, in the case which you have pointed out to me and in every other case, to do so as actively as possible, while at the same time complying with the general regulation of the Structural Funds."
"Question No 36 by (H-0528/00):"
"Subject: New Structural Fund programmes and biodiversity The Commission is negotiating the new 2000-2006 Structural Fund programmes."
"On 16 March 2000 it issued a note on biodiversity and the Structural Funds in the light of the fact that Directive 92/43 and Directive 79/409 have been only partially transposed by the EU Member States and that Structural Fund investment could therefore threaten biodiversity."
"How can the Commission guarantee that biodiversity and the Natura 2000 network are protected and not threatened?"
"Which Member States have caused difficulties in the implementation of what the Commission has requested?"
"What powers does the Commission intend to use in order to ensure that biodiversity is not threatened when the new programmes are implemented?"
"- (FR) I am pleased to have someone to reply to on this extremely important question which touches on the coherence of the policies for which the Commission is responsible, especially the coherent implementation of the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund policies with other Community policies, particularly in the area of environmental protection and improvement."
"Several Member States have yet to send in lists of zones to be protected under Directives 92/43 and 79/409, more generally known as the Natura 2000 Directives."
"The Commission has instituted proceedings before the Court of Justice against the Member States most in arrears."
"On arriving at the Commission, and because I am in charge of regional policy and also because I was Minister for the Environment in my own country and have an irrevocable passion for and commitment to these issues, I decided to take a close look at the problems of coherence, in a continuing bid to prevent and anticipate."
"But our predecessors, Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wulf-Mathies had already worked on this and I and my colleague Margot Wallström decided to get on and regulate this procedure."
"That is why, in agreement with Mrs Wallström, I submitted guidelines to the Commission which were approved on 14 March."
"I personally sent these guidelines to each of the Member States on 28 March."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that these guidelines only apply to the Member States which still have not notified the sites for protection under the Habitat and Birds directives by the time the Commission approves the programming documents for the new period 2000-2006."
"This guideline calls on Member States to take immediate action to present their lists of sites protected under Natura 2000 as quickly as possible and, in addition, to undertake to ensure that sites protected under Natura 2000 are not damaged when projects cofinanced by the Structural Funds are implemented."
"In the event of any irregularities in connection with the conditions of implementation, i.e. if undertakings to submit lists of protected sites are not honoured, the Commission will formally notify the Member State in question of its intention to take any suitable measures immediately, in accordance with the provisions of the general regulation on the Structural Funds or the regulation on the Cohesion Fund."
"Thus, the Commission will be able to have recourse, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, to provisions governing the suspension of payments, unless special circumstances apply."
"Because these guidelines were only recently adopted - when the Community support framework for Portugal was approved on 14 March - and the new programming period 2000-2006 is only just starting, I am honestly not in a position to quote specific examples."
"I am talking about putting these new provisions into practice in specific Member States; let me also tell the honourable member that, to date, the overall situation concerning the submission of lists of Natura 2000 sites to the Commission is unsatisfactory, at least in five Member States: Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium and the United Kingdom."
"These are the countries on which we are keeping a very close watch, as I mentioned earlier in connection with another matter."
"I am totally dissatisfied with the response because it was not out of idle curiosity that I wanted to know which Member States had caused difficulties but in order to get an idea of the extent of the failure to indicate the areas of biodiversity."
"However, the response was satisfactory in the sense that if, out of all the possible measures, that of suspending the money flow is actually implemented, it will be the most effective step that can possibly be imagined."
"A person's wallet is the most sensitive part of their anatomy."
"Question No 37 by (H-0544/00):"
"Subject: Progress of negotiations on the Greek Community support framework Can the Commission say how far the regional development plan (RDP) submitted by the Greek Government differs from the decisions taken to date within the scope of the negotiations between the Commission and the Greek Government (significant amendments), how the negotiations concerning the regional and sectoral programmes are progressing and also what progress has been made on the setting up of managing authorities which, pursuant to Article 9(n) of the framework regulation on the Structural Funds, 1260/1999, are responsible for managing the programmes?"
"Questions to Mrs Wallström"
"In response to the question put to me by Mr Hatzidakis, I should like to stress the Commission's delight at the ambitious scope of Greece's regional development plan for the new period 2000-2006."
"This plan will promote the structural reforms needed so that Greece can honour its commitment within Economic and Monetary Union."
"Negotiations to establish this Community support framework have allowed certain aspects of the strategy for the regional development plan to be strengthened, especially with regard to education, vocational training and environmental protection."
"At the moment, Mr Hatzidakis, the challenge which we must take up together is to genuinely achieve these objectives by ensuring that the Structural Funds and the corresponding national funds are managed efficiently."
"The Commission has drawn the attention of the Greek authorities - I personally have done so twice on two visits to Athens within the space of nine months - to the need to set up efficient administrative structures before Community appropriations are transferred."
"The most important thing is to set up management authorities and, as a matter of priority, the management authority for the Community Support Framework."
"The Commission has welcomed the intention of the Greek authorities to adopt a new specific legal framework by the autumn, to regulate all these matters."
"I personally - since I shall be in Greece for an official visit to Athens and Crete in October - shall have an opportunity to specify and verify this point."
"Negotiations on the adoption of the Community support framework are in the final stages, even though a number of points have yet to be finalised, with regard mainly to the distribution of financial allocations and the definition of the implementation system."
"We expect and we hope, Mr Hatzidakis, that these points will also be quickly finalised."
"Negotiations on the adoption of operational programmes have started in parallel with the final stage of negotiations on the Community support framework."
"These negotiations are progressing normally and I trust that we will be able to approve certain programmes by the end of August."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have before me the development plan for 2000-2006 sent to you by the Ministry of the National Economy last autumn."
"On page 1-119 it says that if the 2nd Community Support Framework had been completed between 1994 and 1999 in accordance with the relevant plan, this would have increased the average annual rate of growth in the Gross National Product for the 1994-1999 period by 0.6%."
"This would have meant additional GNP in the order of GRD 1.6 trillion over and above what we actually had."
"The government accepts this and, between the lines, I think that you accept that there are problems with the public administration in Greece."
"More importantly, I think that you will have problems with the management committees and I should like you to tell me specifically what you intend to do with the Management Organisation Unit and relations with the Ministry of the National Economy, which could be better?"
"What is to be done about outsourcing the external employees whom we need?"
"Will there be incentives and penalties from now on in order to ensure that the Community Support Framework is applied correctly to those who need it?"
"More importantly, what is to be done about the gaping wound in the Social Fund in Greece which, in my view, is no more than a black hole which just swallows up Community funds?"
"Yes, Mr Hatzidakis, even without reading between the lines, I think that, from one period to another, there are always lessons to be learned, progress to be made, mistakes to be corrected and, judging from how the second Community support framework was implemented in Greece, I think there probably are lessons to be learned."
"The Commission is well aware of the problems, especially those which you have just pointed to in connection with the operational nature of the Management Organization Unit."
"We think that Greece, which is now a full member of the Economic and Monetary Union, is more conscious of its administrative weaknesses and of the need to rectify them than it was in the past because all this is essential, as you have quite rightly said, if maximum profit is to be derived from the new third Community support framework now getting under way."
"As far as we are concerned, Mr Hatzidakis, we shall monitor how implementation progresses very closely, both within this framework and within the context of our regulatory powers and I shall not fail, if necessary - let us not talk of sanctions - to do my duty."
"As far as more efficient management is concerned - over and above what has already been done under the previous Community support framework, - I would remind you that the Greek authorities have agreed to draft a bill adapting administrative practice to the rules of the Structural Funds."
"This law is based on the provisions included in the Community Support Framework."
"The same authorities will also need to appoint qualified people, define administrative responsibilities and ensure that there is proper information and training for staff at all levels."
"The computer system for integrated management will also need to be fully operational."
"We have stressed, Mr Hatzidakis, the importance which we attach to translating agreements into an efficient organisation on the ground, well in advance of payment of the first appropriations by the European Union for the new programming period."
"That is the assurance which I wanted to give you."
"Mr President, despite Commissioner Barnier's highly specific and detailed reply and the acknowledgement of the shortcomings of Greek public administration, an acknowledgement which is a common ground and which everyone accepts, including the government, there is another problem: decentralised local authorities administer these funds and it is hard for the central public administration to intervene, resulting in inaction and wastage or in funds being used for the wrong purpose."
"What can he do in this direction?"
"Of course he would need to make representations mainly to the government and focus his efforts on the extent to which the government is able to influence regional local authorities."
"Mr Marinos, not only have I studied this question, but I also intend to go and visit people and see the problems in the regions in every Member State for myself."
"I do not intend to sit ensconced in my office and content myself with receiving ministers passing through Brussels. I want to go and see for myself."
"I spent last week in a region of Finland."
"As I said to Mr Hatzidakis, and at his invitation, I shall be going to Crete, to one of the Greek regions, in October."
"This is the way to accept one' s responsibilities, not by repression and not by sanctions."
"I do not want to point my finger or make a priori judgments."
"I prefer education."
"That is why, for example, I convened a seminar at the beginning of June to which all the management authorities throughout the European Union in charge of Objective 1 appropriations were invited. 500 administrators attended, from all the management authorities, from the whole of Europe."
"And I shall do likewise, in the autumn, with the Objective 2 management authorities."
"We have also invited Mrs Theato, the chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the Court of Auditors, to help with this financial and managerial education programme."
"I referred earlier, during my reply to Mr Hatzidakis, to training."
"Before getting caught up in regional management - I must also respect this notion of decentralisation - I want to check with the Commission's normal contacts, i.e. the Member States, that all the systems really are in place."
"So I shall be checking with the Greek government that everything is in place at the level of this new Community support framework."
"And the framework to be implemented must of course include a proper evaluation system for each region, especially proper management and disciplinary systems, as well as the principle of responsible decentralisation."
"I think that you understand my position on this issue, but I must first work with the national governments, because that is how the Structural Funds need to be managed at this stage, within the framework of the general regulation."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Barnier."
"Question Nos 38, 39 and 40 will be replied to in writing."
"We will proceed, late, to the last 20 minutes of questions to Commissioner Wallström."
"As the author is not present, Question No 41 lapses."
"Question No 42 by (H-0521/00):"
"Subject: Reclamation work in Dublin Bay Reclamation work is taking place in Dublin Bay in an area submitted for designation as an SPA last July under the Wild Birds Directive."
"The boundaries of this extended SPA were altered, following representations by the Dublin Port Company to Duchas, so as to enable the company to carry out its proposal to infill 52 acres of Dublin Bay in order to expand the port, chiefly on economic grounds."
"However, according to documents secured by an NGO, Dublin Bay Watch, following a request under the Freedom of Information Act, it emerged that objections made by a local authority were rejected by Duchas on the grounds that 'the proposals to designate an extension would proceed unless a scientific case was made' ."
"Final designation and submission to the Commission of the altered SPA occurred last February."
"Dublin Bay Watch has complained to the Commission and provided extensive evidence."
"In the light of this information, will the Commission initiate legal proceedings against the Irish Government for altering the boundaries of an SPA, and will it urge the Government to redesignate the entire SPA as it was first advertised in July 1999?"
"Does the Commission intend to withdraw EU funding of such a project and prohibit any work which would seriously affect an SPA?"
"Does it believe that the public consultation process was adequate in this instance and in line with the EIA Directive?"
"As a result of several complaints the Commission is aware of the controversy surrounding this reclamation project for Dublin port."
"In particular, it knows of the concerns about the exclusion of an area of about 20 hectares from the 1999 extension to the Sandymount Strand and Tolka estuary special protection area in Dublin Bay classified under the Community's Wild Birds directive."
"While included in the 1999 proposal for extension of the SPA, the area in question was omitted when the extension was finally adopted at the end of 1999."
"By way of background: the 1999 proposal for extension followed a Commission request to the Irish authorities to enlarge the SPA."
"It was particularly concerned to ensure that major Community investment in sewage treatment for Dublin would take place within the legal framework provided by SPA status."
"The legal deadline for completing Irish SPAs expired in 1981 and the Commission has for some time been concerned that the Irish SPA network remains incomplete."
"In April this year the Commission notified a letter of formal notice to Ireland under Article 226 of the EC Treaty in which it drew attention to the general failure to complete the Irish SPA network."
"Dublin Bay was mentioned as a partially classified important bird area."
"The Commission is not aware of any intention to use Community funds in relation to the port reclamation project."
"As regards public consultation under the environmental impact assessment for the port reclamation project, the Commission would prefer not to comment pending the investigation of the complaints it has received."
"I can understand that you do not want to comment until you have investigated the complaints but I would urge you to put pressure on the Irish government."
"For decades they have ignored their obligations under EU directives."
"As regards the special protection areas they have completely ignored their obligations."
"In this case they have basically done what they want."
"They change the boundaries whenever they feel like it."
"The public consultation, in my mind and in the mind of many of the local people in the Community, is completely and totally inadequate."
"This is just one more example of the way that the Irish government is behaving in relation to its obligations under EU directives."
"I would like to ask you, Commissioner, are you going to push much further with the Irish government and explore every possible avenue."
"I welcome the recent decision on fining Greece and I would like to see the same thing happen with the Irish government if they fail to comply with directives."
"It seems the only thing they are willing to listen to is the threat of fines."
"Unfortunately the taxpayer will have to pay the fines but real pressure has to be put on the government at this stage because they have got away with it for far too long."
"As you know the Commission has taken the first step in a general legal action that includes Dublin Bay."
"I would like to mention that two qualifications need to be made."
"First the 1999 extension to the Sandymount Strand and Tolka estuary SPA clearly includes most of the important areas not included in the original SPA."
"Secondly, while the Commission has until now treated Dublin Bay as still partially classified on the basis of evidence that qualifying inter-tidal areas may still have been omitted it will need to consider any evidence offered by Ireland that the site is sufficiently classified."
"Of course, we will do everything possible to help the Irish or to put pressure on them to live up to the rules and regulations concerning this."
"I am sure that we will have to continue the legal proceedings against Ireland."
"Question No 43 by (H-0529/00):"
"Subject: Management of toxic waste Environmental organisations in Greece have alleged that toxic and hazardous waste is being buried without any controls."
"Of the 264 571 tonnes of hazardous waste produced in 1999, a mere 0.12% was shipped abroad for incineration."
"There are no controls on the disposal of waste produced by the lead-acid accumulator recycling plants."
"Greek Electricity Board (DEI) condensers with substantial amounts of Clophen have been abandoned at Aspropyrgos."
"In Attica there is only one incinerator with a capacity of 0.5 tonnes of hospital waste a day, even though some 20 tonnes of such waste is produced a day."
"As regards PCBs, Greece has no processing facilities and it is unknown what happens to them."
"Over the last ten years no substantial steps have been taken to ensure the proper management of this waste."
"Article 16 of Directive 78/319/EEC states: 'Every three years, and for the first time three years following the notification of this Directive, Member States shall draw up a situation report on the disposal of toxic and dangerous waste in their respective countries and shall forward it to the Commission'."
"Will the Commission say how many such reports has Greece forwarded so far on the basis of the above directive, and what do these reports say?"
"What stage have the relevant Greek authorities reached in implementing Directives 75/442/EEC, 78/319/EEC, 94/67/EEC, 91/157/EEC and 94/62/EEC?"
"Does it intend to impose fines in the event of violations?"
"As the Commission does not have the means to inspect Greek waste management facilities the most important tools for the Commission to check the practical implementation are reports, plans and programmes requested in the different waste directives."
"The Commission has very little information on waste management in Greece."
"Greece did not report on the implementation of waste management legislation between 1989 and 1997."
"However at the end of last year Greece answered four questionnaires regarding the implementation of four waste directives."
"According to that answer 280 000 tonnes of hazardous waste were generated in Greece - the year is not indicated - of which 95 760 tonnes were recycled, though Greece indicated that it has no installation for the processing or disposal of hazardous waste."
"The hazardous wastes are reported to be either temporarily stored or exported for final disposal in other countries."
"The Commission is of the opinion that a number of Community requirements are not being complied with by Greece and has taken action under Article 226."
"The most important aspects concern the absence of management plans according to Article 7 of Directive 75/442 on waste, Article 6 of Directive 91/689 on hazardous waste and Article 14 of Directive 94/62 on packaging and packaging waste, the failure to transpose Directive 94/62 and transmit data according to Article 12 concerning the packaging waste industry, the absence of a programme according to Article 6 of Directive 91/157 on batteries and accumulators containing certain substances and non-compliance with Articles 4 and 11 of Directive 96/59 on the disposal of PCBs and PCTs."
"A first report according to Directive 94/67 on the incineration of hazardous waste has to be provided for the period 1998 to 2000 by the end of September 2001."
"Despite the fact that you did not reply to me in Greek, which I imagine is a bit harder, thank you very much for passing on your findings."
"But the question remains."
"Is there absolutely no way of establishing where these huge quantities of waste go?"
"You yourself referred to some 115 000 or 175 000 tonnes - I cannot find the figures - the final destination of which is unknown."
"Secondly, having identified all these infringements, do you intend to refer this to the Court which, unfortunately for my country - gave us a recent example by finding Greece guilty of another, older infringement?"
"I remind you what action the Commission has taken to address the failure of Greece to correctly transpose and apply Community waste legislation."
"There are two codecisions, one dated 8 July 1999 and one dated 13 April 2000."
"There is an application before the Court."
"There is an additional recent opinion sent on 11 August last year and there is a letter of formal notice sent on 10 April this year for failure to apply a number of articles properly."
"Of course we are worried."
"This is a general problem in Greece, the implementation of Community waste legislation."
"Of course we would also like to know where this waste has gone but we can only ask Greece for those statistics."
"Unfortunately Greece has not done this properly."
"First I should like to say that I have submitted a written question along the same lines as that put by my fellow member Mihail Papayannakis."
"Secondly, I should like to say in all honesty that, as a Greek citizen, I am shocked by what you have said."
"In other words, that we do not know and the Greek Government does not know, no-one knows what has happened to over half our toxic waste."
"From what you have said, I think that my fellow countrymen in Greece should be worried, and with good cause."
"I should like to put two questions to you."
"The first is: what sanctions will be imposed on Greece?"
"Do you think it is sufficient merely to take recourse to the Court, which could take three or four years to reach a verdict?"
"In the meantime, what about public health in Greece?"
"Toxic waste is an extremely important issue."
"My second question is this: assuming that Greece is convicted for the waste, for the waste management in Hania in Crete, can you tell us, in general terms, where you think the problem with the application of environmental legislation in Greece lies?"
"Which specific areas of Community legislation are causing problems?"
"Because I know, for example, that there are also problems with the management of nitric compounds."
"Mr President there is reason to be worried because we know there are problems in some of the Member States with illegal trading and illegal disposal of hazardous wastes."
"Of course the Greek Government and maybe also the local authorities should be asked how this has been handled."
"From the Commission side we can continue the legal proceedings and the legal procedures as they are set out for the Commission, but I think what is most effective in cases like this is open debate in the European Parliament."
"Of course we will keep an eye on this and keep up the pressure on Greece to report to us because that is the instrument we have available."
"Question No 44 by (H-0547/00):"
"Subject: Polluted land Heavily polluted, former industrial land has created a number of severe problems."
"Water spreads the pollution into other parts of the natural environment and, in order to construct housing or other buildings on the land, it must be decontaminated at great expense."
"Does the Commission have any plans for dealing with this problem and is it prepared to put forward a strategy for doing so?"
"Commission. (SV) The pollution of industrial land is a big problem in Europe."
"According to the report from the European Environment Agency on the state of the environment, the Topic Centre on Land Cover 1998 estimated that there are 750 000 polluted or potentially polluted places within the EU."
"Current EU legislation, like that which is proposed, focuses on the prevention of pollution."
"Directive 96/61 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, the IPPC Directive, states that Member States must take all necessary measures that are required in order to restore industrial land that is no longer in use."
"Such measures must already form a part of the operational situation."
"This directive must be enforced completely before November 2007."
"Another instrument which may help to prevent future pollution of land is the directive that we are currently working on in relation to environmental liability. To deal with pollution that occurred in the past, certain Member States have developed special financial instruments - there are taxes or different funds that have been set up for this purpose."
"It is already clear that this type of clean-up costs, or will cost, Member States very large sums of money."
"At EU level, the European Regional Development Fund can contribute a certain amount of support."
"I might also add that I can see how big a problem this is in the candidate countries."
"The Commission is, however, not as yet planning any form of global or European clean-up strategy."
"As far as the past pollution of land is concerned, the proximity principle ought to be applied, because national, regional or local authorities are in the best position to deal with these issues."
"Also, this type of pollution is not a transnational issue, and the problem is not first and foremost an administrative one, but a financial one."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for her reply."
"It could of course be said in actual fact that this type of pollution can be transnational, because we know that water carries pollutants along with it, particularly chemicals and heavy metals."
"The countries, particularly in the central parts of Europe, are so close to each other that it is difficult to say where the pollutants originate from."
"I think that a common strategy would be needed to deal with these issues."
"That is actually what I was after in the question that I raised."
"In her reply, Mrs Wallström has now said that there will not be a strategy in this area."
"The question is now whether the Commission is prepared to support research, further experiments and development in the respective Member States in order for us to cope with these problems, which are immense."
"Commission. (SV) Of course, it is important for the respective Member States to make a list of the existing industrial land that is polluted and the best way to tackle this problem."
"As I have already said, we see this as a very great concern also from an economic point of view for many of the candidate countries, where this is often mentioned as an immense problem."
"Up to now we have mainly regarded this as a local and national issue."
"In order to be able to clean up in the best way possible, we need to consider what sort of pollution is involved and what the local conditions are like."
"We have nothing against creating a strategy, if the Member States also want that, but in that case we must also get hold of the resources to deal with it."
"As it looks so far, this has not been something that we have given the highest priority to, but naturally I think that it is very important for a proper inventory to be made and for a plan to be drawn up by the Member States, and why not also research and development in the area in order to find the best methods for cleaning up polluted industrial land."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has already partly answered a question that has been on my mind, but perhaps I will ask an additional question on the matter."
"This same problem concerns former landfill sites that are later used for housing."
"The Commission may have information on the extent of the problem in the Member States."
"Does the Commission think it possible that some kind of strategy could be found regarding these built-up areas?"
"Commission. (SV) I can only repeat that the Commission is, of course, prepared to take on such a task, but in the present situation, I do not perhaps think it is something that we can do with existing resources and in a sufficiently radical way, because it requires considerable resources."
"It is very evidently a problem that must be dealt with at national, regional and local levels."
"However, if the Member States should so desire, we obviously have nothing against taking on this task."
"I think that we are already doing this when we see that there is great necessity for doing something."
"For example, in connection with the follow-up of the disaster in Baia Mare, we are trying to identify where the hot spots are and to see if we can identify dangerous places where we really need to keep our eyes open to ensure that no new disasters happen."
"When it comes to the pure clean-up work, I certainly think that the proximity principle ought to be applied."
"Question No 45 by (H-0548/00):"
"Subject: Fireworks factories On 2 June 2000 an explosion occurred at the Liborio Fernandes fireworks factory in the Portuguese village of Lanhelas."
"Nine people were injured, and the village was badly damaged."
"A similar explosion has just occurred at the Pyroma de Feugueyrolles factory in France."
"These two explosions, which occurred only a few days after the tragic incident near Amsterdam, not to speak of the persistent explosions in Spain, are a reminder of the danger posed by these factories when they are located in residential areas."
"The manufacture of fireworks has become all the more dangerous since the old craft methods gave way to industrial methods."
"This means both the stockpiling of more explosive substances and greater reactivity."
"What measures does the Commission intend to propose in order to impose or strengthen safety standards aimed at eliminating the risk of explosion in these firms, to prohibit the location of such firms in residential areas, to prevent the transport of explosives from posing a threat both to the transporters and to the inhabitants of the areas through which they pass?"
"The Commission is most concerned about the recent accidents in fireworks storage and production facilities."
"The manufacture and storage of pyrotechnic substances is covered by Council Directive 96/82 of 9 December 1996 on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, the so-called Seveso II directive."
"This directive obliges operators of establishments having dangerous substances within certain threshold limits to establish a major accident prevention policy."
"It also obliges them to set up safety management systems and emergency plans and to demonstrate this to the public inspection authorities by submitting a safety report."
"Moreover, the Seveso II directive contains the new provision recognising that the implications of major accident hazards should be taken into account in the land use planning policies of the Member States."
"These are obliged to pursue the aim of the directive, that is, the prevention of major accidents and the limitation of their consequences for man and the environment."
"This has to be done through controls on the siting of new establishments, modifications to existing establishments and new developments such as transport links, locations frequented by the public and residential areas in the vicinity of existing establishments."
"In the long term land use planning policies shall ensure that appropriate distances between hazardous establishments and residential areas are maintained."
"Member States shall also ensure that all competent authorities and planning authorities responsible for decisions set up appropriate consultation procedures."
"The inclusion of this provision can be regarded as a major step forward in the process of major accident mitigation."
"A review of the Seveso II directive is already under way."
"After a full investigation of the accidents that occurred, the Commission will evaluate the threshold limits assigned to pyrotechnics substances as part of the review."
"A proposal for amendments to the Seveso II directive should be ready by the beginning of next year, that is 2001."
"This can only be done when we have evaluated the experiences following the accident in Enschede as well as the accident in Romania."
"This process will be carried out in close cooperation with the Member States, the European Parliament and other interested parties."
"The transport of explosive materials is covered by Directive 94/55 on the transport of dangerous goods by road."
"This directive makes obligatory the provisions of Annex A and B of the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road for road transport within or between Member States."
"Annex A contains the provisions concerning the packaging and labelling of dangerous goods and Annex B contains the provisions concerning the construction equipment and operation of the vehicle as well as the minimum training requirements for the driver."
"The application of this legislation guarantees a high level of safety for the transport of dangerous goods including explosives."
"You have told me that there are directives, but to our mind they are probably not applied, since accidents are increasing in number and becoming more and more dangerous, now that these factories have replaced old production crafts with industrial methods."
"It appears perfectly obvious to me that factories such as this, companies such as this, really should not be located near residential areas."
"The tragedy in Enschede, in the Netherlands, illustrates this all too clearly and in Portugal, which I referred to in my question, 159 houses in the village of Lanhelas in the province of Minho were hit by the explosion."
"Some were completely destroyed, others were partially destroyed and the victims' protection association that has been set up has estimated the damage at over EUR 1 billion."
"I think that we urgently need to get these directives applied and to introduce others prohibiting firework factories near residential areas."
"Yes, of course, Mr President, we are also extremely worried about what has happened and that is why we are looking at the Seveso II directive in order to see if it is necessary to complement it with new rules to cover establishments like the plants involved in the recent accidents."
"And, of course, we also have to look at the land use planning because the establishments in question were not covered by the Seveso II directive because the thresholds were not the right ones."
"We will be looking at this as soon as we have evaluated all the information about these accidents."
"We will not sit on our hands."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 46 to 78 will be replied to in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)."
"EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5­0165/2000) from Mr García-Orcoyen Tormo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Regulation on the voluntary participation of organisations in a Community Eco-Management and Audit Scheme(EMAS)."
"Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, we thank you for being here at this time in the evening."
"The Community Eco-management and Audit Scheme is not exactly the most popular of the environmental issues but, nevertheless, it is a fantastic instrument for making progress in the field of integrating economic activities and the preservation of the environment."
"By adopting a system of environmental management, companies - whether they be industrial or service companies - learn to integrate environmental considerations into the normal management of the company, discovering the many and significant advantages, not only environmental but also economic, which this offers them, amongst other things, because they improve their competitive position."
"It therefore seems to me very significant that this regulation is currently being reviewed and that new elements are being incorporated into it which are extremely useful for the environmental improvement of processes, services and products."
"The creation of more incentives for European companies to have access to the system, the participation of interested parties - especially workers -, the strengthening of reliability vis-à-vis third parties and an increase in the transparency of information are the main objectives of the amendments which I took up on first reading in Parliament and which were approved unanimously in the Environment Committee."
"Nevertheless, the committee also approved certain amendments which were contrary to the opinion of the rapporteur, and I have continued to disagree with them."
"In this respect, I wish to refer to Amendments Nos 5, 6, 10 and 17, on the controversial issue of the use of the best available technology, as an instrument for environmental improvement, being obligatory for countries which wish to be included in the EMAS register."
"Let us remember that EMAS is a voluntary market instrument."
"Let us remember also that one of the main objectives of the current revision of the regulations is to make the system more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses and also the service sector."
"Let us add that until now the initiative has been relatively successful when compared to the other alternative formula, the ISO 14.001 standard, which is more flexible in many ways than EMAS."
"Let us bear in mind that the best available technology, as defined by the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, is only applicable to large industrial plants and not to the service sector or to small and medium-sized businesses."
"In this light, I believe that you will agree with me when I say that, although I am absolutely in favour of development and progress with regard to the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), this is not the time, and EMAS is not the right instrument, to demand that companies who want to join the scheme adopt the best available technologies."
"In fact, the large plants, as stipulated in the IPPC Directive, will continue to be obliged to be included in the EMAS register, since they will have to abide by the environmental legislation in force - Amendment No 12 - which obviously includes compliance with the IPPC Directive in the cases where companies are affected."
"I would also like to insist on Amendments Nos 41 and 50, which my Group would be prepared to accept as long as it is made clear that the word 'representatives' refers to people chosen as such within each company and in no event to organisations, whose participation would hinder and delay the process of adopting the system."
"I hope that tomorrow other groups will offer oral amendments in this respect."
"There are two other amendments which I would like to comment on: Amendment No 19, for which I have requested a separate vote up to the paragraph which reads ""public structures and public contracts"" , up to this point leaving the Commission' s text intact."
"I believe that the Commission is preparing - and in this sense I would be grateful for a comment from Mrs Wallström - a proposal on the inclusion of the environmental principle as a necessary consideration when awarding public contracts, and I therefore think it appropriate to await the approval of that proposal."
"With regard to Amendment No 22, on the incorporation of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, within a period of four years, into the EMAS system, I have consulted the Commission in writing and I would like the Commissioner to reply to it."
"Lastly, Amendment No 25 refers to the harmonisation of EMAS with the ISO standard, which is very important to the dissemination of each instrument, and we are very happy with the harmonisation agreement relating to them."
"Mr President, our experience of the Community eco-audit scheme has been very mixed."
"In Germany and Austria a great number of businesses have taken part in it, whereas the uptake from businesses in other Member States has been very low."
"The aim of the present revision must therefore be to make the eco-audit scheme more attractive."
"For that reason it is important that there should be scope to involve companies from the service sector and to support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"All that, however, is not enough, in my view."
"More needs to be done, particularly in terms of reducing the administrative burden and establishing ways of projecting the public profile of the service."
"From discussions at various company headquarters it has emerged that EMAS has an internal impact and that workforces are playing a far greater part in protecting the environment, but the time has now come to improve the external impact of the system."
"In all the reflections on how to improve EMAS, one thing has to be remembered, namely that EMAS is a voluntary system which companies can join."
"It must not therefore be encumbered with concepts such as best available technology."
"These are binding specifications which set excessively difficult targets."
"All we shall achieve by adopting them is to make businesses quit the system."
"That surely serves no purpose at all."
"The system has proved useful so far, and we should build on the valuable experience that has been amassed."
"If we cherish certain environmental ideals, I am certainly willing to pursue them too, but that will take us down the road of directives and regulations."
"We cannot realise such ideals by opting for a voluntary system like EMAS."
"One last point that seems important to me if the eco-audit is to be a practicable mechanism is the frequency of its validation."
"The proposal envisages renewal of the validation at yearly intervals."
"That, to my mind, is far too frequent."
"Companies have to spend nine months on the preparation of an environmental report."
"They cannot do that if annual validation is required."
"I therefore propose an interval of two to three years, and I hope you will support this proposal."
"Mr President, EMAS is to be revised, and my Group and I are very much in favour of its scope being extended."
"I do believe, however, that the examples of Austria and Germany to which the previous speaker, Mr Schnellhardt, has already referred, show that it is no coincidence that the countries where participation levels are highest are among the proponents of the tabled position, in which adherence to the existing environmental provisions and the use of the best available technology are seen as key instruments for improving companies' efficiency in the use of natural resources and their protection of the environment."
"Accordingly, I should like to give my wholehearted support to those amendments that call for the use of the best available technology as well as to canvass your support for Amendment No 12, which lays special emphasis on compliance with existing environmental provisions."
"I am well aware, of course, that there must be incentives to encourage wider participation in this scheme."
"For all that, I believe that the credibility of this eco-audit scheme can only be guaranteed if we set our own high standards rather than pursuing the opposite strategy of alignment with the ISO standard."
"My Group also attaches particular importance to the participation of employees and their representatives."
"I accept the rapporteur's proposal - we came to an agreement on this today - that an oral amendment be moved tomorrow in order to make it clear that we also accept the compromise on the involvement of employees and their representatives, in other words the reduction of such involvement to the works level."
"In my view, this will represent a major step forward in the implementation of EMAS, not only in terms of its democratic credentials but also from a managerial point of view."
"I shall waive the remainder of my speaking time, which should certainly put me in the President's good books!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the intention behind EMAS is an excellent one: encouraging companies to have more respect for the environment."
"Seven years after its creation, however, EMAS is a success only in some countries."
"There is still a long way to go, and today we need to identify the reason for this limited result."
"EMAS is complex, too complex."
"The regulation imposes heavy constraints on those companies which do agree, voluntarily, to participate. This complexity is such as to discourage SMEs, which, as we all know, are bending under the weight of bureaucracy."
"Yet they are the engine of Europe' s economy."
"We should be making them our number one priority, hence the importance of the incentives our rapporteur was just talking about."
"In the same spirit, I would also say that some amendments are in danger of erring through excess of ambition."
"I mean Amendments Nos 5, 10 and 17 on the best available technologies, the BATs."
"A requirement like that would mean sometimes insoluble problems for SMEs, which cannot always adapt to these BATs. In any case their very definition is already a problem for some economic sectors."
"So the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will be voting against."
"On the other hand, in the spirit of compromise, we are ready to support Amendments Nos 43, 44 and 45, which link these best available technologies, from the environmental viewpoint, with conditions that are economically and technically viable for businesses."
"Finally, there is the question of workers' participation, which we naturally value highly and which the common position entirely authorises."
"On the other hand, we reject Amendments Nos 41 and 50, because more restrictive measures here again threaten to discourage a large number of candidate firms."
"Finally, I will simply say that quantity must not drive out quality."
"The system is voluntary, so it must be attractive in order to survive. Otherwise EMAS will be no more than a litany of good intentions likely to be impracticable for businesses and therefore completely useless."
"Mr President, a number of speakers tonight have mentioned the issue of the best available technology."
"I cannot understand the reluctance to accept this. It really is an essential instrument."
"If we are genuine about wanting to encourage firms to improve environmental policy and environmental performance, then it is necessary that the best available technology should be encouraged."
"It makes no sense to me whatsoever to be reluctant to promote that."
"If the best available technology is there, then the firm should be encouraged to use it."
"We are never going to make any advances otherwise."
"This is a voluntary scheme, but if firms genuinely want to improve their environmental policy and their environmental performance then any encouragement in that direction should be welcomed."
"So far as the arguments against the best available technology are concerned, they do not stand up to scrutiny."
"It is essential that this element, and the amendments in relation to best available technology, be supported by Parliament."
"I would urge the Commission, too, to take this on board."
"If we are serious about trying to encourage firms in the right direction then we have to encourage the best available technology."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the regulation must be effective because it is a voluntary instrument."
"To that extent, it is only right and fitting that we should try to guarantee the manageability of the system, which is why we have taken pains to reach the present agreement between the two major groups, Mrs Scheele, so that the validation is not limited to one year but can be organised in a pragmatic manner, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses."
"It goes without saying that they cannot be expected to do a validation every year - that would be absurd."
"We must find an effective and manageable solution to that problem."
"But I also believe that we need a rational approach to the question of the best available technology, because it is surely unacceptable that two companies producing at entirely different levels - one to a low technological standard and the other to a high standard - should both be able to operate the eco-management and audit system and should both be certificated."
"That is patently absurd and will ultimately mislead those who are liable to buy products advertised as EMAS-compliant."
"For that reason we need to set a standard."
"Perhaps the amendments we adopted in the Environment Committee go too far."
"For that reason I am pleased that Amendments 43, 44 and 45 have been proposed as a means of covering the available forms of technology in a similar way to another directive and of limiting the initial scope of the regulation to industrial activity, since it is undoubtedly far harder to legislate for the service sector in this domain."
"Accordingly, I would suggest that if we can reach agreement on the frequency of validation, we ought perhaps to be able to reach agreement on this aspect as well."
"So the first thing to do is to establish the verification procedure; the application of that procedure will perhaps reveal various ways in which the system can be improved."
"Mr President, I believe that tomorrow's vote will truly be a litmus test of whether we regard EMAS as an instrument of ecological progress or as a mere sham."
"It must be made clear that EMAS accreditation is intended as a reward for those companies which are the real engines of ecological progress."
"BAT - the best available technology - is the fundamental prerequisite of EMAS, because it would be downright absurd for a company to be regarded as an environmental trailblazer if it did not use the best available technology, and it is surely plain to see that anything else boils down to ISO 14000, in other words to our simply selling EMAS down the river, because it would then be ISO in another guise."
"In that case we could forget the directive altogether, because it would correspond to ISO."
"For that reason I fail to understand the misgivings that have been voiced, particularly with regard to small and medium-sized businesses, because it is precisely those firms which have the least onerous obligations in this respect."
"Conversely, we have seen time and again that many small and medium-sized enterprises are far more innovative than their larger counterparts."
"EMAS is an important voluntary instrument for companies, but paramount importance attaches to its coordination with environmental programmes."
"Studies in Germany have shown that, unfortunately, EMAS organisations have not yet recognised protection of the climate, for example, as a major goal."
"From that point of view I believe that we should not sell ourselves short here by putting EMAS on a par with ISO."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo, for her work on the Commission' s proposal concerning EMAS."
"Before discussing the individual amendments, I want to touch upon three key issues, namely best available technology, the frequency with which the environmental statement is to be validated and the link between participation in EMAS and compliance with the requirements of compulsory environmental legislation."
"The changes proposed by the European Parliament where best available technology is concerned should mean that all organisations which participate in EMAS should be forced to apply best available technology."
"The Commission agrees with the principle that all organisations registered to EMAS ought to try to apply best practice within their areas of activity and work as effectively as possible on issues of technology, materials and organisation."
"The concept of best available technology, which is expressly defined in the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution, is nonetheless only relevant to industry."
"This has also been noted by the European Parliament in some of its amendments."
"In view of the fact that EMAS is now being opened to all economic sectors, the requirement that best available technology must be used is likely to mean in practice that many sectors will be prevented from participating in EMAS."
"For example, the European Parliament itself would not be able to participate because best available technology is not a concept which can be applied to public institutions."
"A requirement of this kind would also be a major obstacle for small and medium-sized companies, which are not covered by the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution."
"If the attempt were made to circumvent this derogation by means of EMAS, which is a voluntary system, this would probably mean that small and medium-sized companies would refrain from participating in EMAS."
"When it comes to those amendments in which best available technology is confined to the area of application of the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution, it ought to be pointed out that it is not EMAS' s task to be an alternative way of ensuring that compulsory legislation is applied."
"We all agree that it is important for organisations to comply with that environmental legislation which affects them."
"It might be said that it is a minimum requirement that environmental legislation should be respected."
"The purpose of EMAS is to help organisations to perform better and to exceed that minimum."
"The objective is not, however, to provide supervisory authorities with absolute proofs that an organisation which is EMAS-registered is complying with all current legislation in all situations."
"In view of EMAS' s systematic structure, organisations will clearly be well placed to comply with the environmental legislation."
"EMAS is, however, a voluntary system."
"If the European Parliament maintains its amendments, the basis of which is that compliance with environmental legislation must be guaranteed, EMAS' s role will be in danger of changing."
"EMAS will instead become a replacement for environmental verifications carried out by the Member States' competent authorities."
"I am convinced that that is not the European Parliament' s intention."
"How frequently is the environmental statement to be validated?"
"The environmental statement is, of course, the visible public result of EMAS being implemented within an organisation."
"That report must therefore correspond to the expectations of those in the surrounding area."
"One such expectation is that the environmental statement should be reliable."
"The simplest way of building up confidence in the conclusions of the statement is to carry out regular, impartial verifications."
"An annual verification of the statement would therefore be more appropriate than a verification every third year, as in the majority of cases."
"I would emphasise that the common position is flexible in this respect."
"Account can, therefore, already be taken of special cases or special problems."
"I am therefore afraid that, by dispensing with the principle of annual reporting in its amendments, the European Parliament may damage EMAS' s credibility, which is a prerequisite if the new EMAS is to be successful."
"Allow me to turn now to the individual amendments."
"The Commission has carefully examined the 50 amendments which have been tabled and is able to approve 11 of these."
"How credible EMAS is and how attractive it is to companies are two crucial considerations if EMAS is to function."
"The Commission is therefore delighted to be able to approve Amendments 1, 2 and 19 (3)."
"Another important question of which the Commission is also aware is that of how it may be ensured that EMAS is rolled out in the candidate States at an early stage."
"The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 3 in principle, provided that the wording is made clearer."
"The Commission is also very pleased to be able to approve Amendment 4 in principle, because it will help ensure that employees are more involved, something which has already been taken into account in the review of EMAS."
"The wording ought, however, to be changed to avoid extra demands being placed upon companies, particularly upon small and medium-sized companies."
"There seems to be a general concern about small and medium-sized companies, which also manifests itself in EMAS."
"The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 19 (4) in principle, provided that it does not lead to the EMAS rules' being watered down for small and medium-sized companies."
"Because EMAS is a voluntary system, it is important that there should be information about it."
"The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 16 in principle, if it is extended to include all information and not only data."
"The Commission is very pleased to see that the European Parliament itself is committed to applying EMAS and urges the other European institutions to do the same."
"However, EMAS' s area of application extends to include more than physical assets, something which must be clearly shown in Amendment 22, which the Commission is able to approve in principle."
"Amendment 25 will contribute considerably to making the EMAS requirements clearer, and the Commission approves this change."
"A small addendum is required, however, so that the Commission is able, in a legally correct manner, to comply with the contractual conditions in the agreement that has been entered into with the European Standardisation Organisation."
"Unanimity and openness are also important principles for EMAS."
"The Commission is able to approve Amendments 30 (1 and 3), 32 and 33 (2)."
"Where the other changes are concerned, I want briefly to explain why the Commission was unable to approve them."
"An important aspect of the proposal is the extension of EMAS' s area of application to include all sectors of trade and industry."
"Those amendments which relate only to the industrial sector cannot, therefore, be approved."
"These are Amendments 5, 6, 10, 17, 43, 44 and 45, according to which organisations must apply best available technology."
"The Commission also considers it important that EMAS should be logically structured, easy to understand and sufficiently flexible to be able to be adapted for the various sectors affected."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, approve Amendments 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33 (1), 34, 35, 37, 41, 42, 47, 48, 49 and 50."
"The additional benefits to the environment entailed by EMAS, compared with ISO14001, are a crucial aspect of the proposal."
"The Commission is unable, therefore, to support Amendments 13, 30 (2), 36, 38 and 46."
"Due to the introduction of longer intervals between verifications of the statements, these amendments would make it more difficult to obtain sight of, and to verify, the information concerning environmental performance."
"Nor can the Commission accept Amendments 39 and 40, because the EMAS logo must be a sign of excellence for organisations, at the same time as it must not lead to confusion on the part of the public."
"Given the way the directives relating to public purchasing look today, Amendment 19 (1) cannot be approved."
"The Commission is pleased to supply information to the European Parliament upon request, but is unable to approve Amendments 18 and 20 because there is a lack of resources for this purpose."
"Finally, the Commission is unable to approve Amendment 24 relating to committee procedures because of the legal changes implemented following the decision on committee procedures, according to which a prescriptive committee is required."
"The Commission is convinced that the European Parliament' s amendments have, in both readings, contributed greatly to this review and increased EMAS' s potential for helping improve the environmental performance of trade and industry throughout the Union."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner."
"May I depart from normal practice by asking you to pay greater attention to the allocated time slots."
"Your colleague Mrs Reding is the very last speaker today."
"She will no doubt be annoyed with me if she has to stay here until one in the morning."
"Would you please therefore be so kind as to keep your remarks somewhat briefer on future occasions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide"
"The next item is the report (A5-0166/2000) by Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive relating to limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, I shall try to be brief, because I do not believe that much of the substance of this directive is contentious within this Parliament."
"The directive before us is the second offshoot of the Directive on ambient air quality assessment and management, and the proposal is part of an integrated package of measures designed to combat atmospheric pollution."
"The essential feature of this second offshoot of the air-quality Directive is that it establishes benzene and carbon monoxide limit values for the first time in the European Union."
"This is a very important step; I would even call it a milestone in the history of air-quality legislation, because it is the first limit value to be imposed for a carcinogenic substance, namely benzene, which can, of course, cause leukaemia."
"We know that petrol and oil are sources of benzene, and in the European Union 80 to 85% of benzene emissions result from petrol combustion in road vehicles."
"There has never been a safety threshold, and so benzene emissions have always posed a health risk."
"The precautionary principle that is enshrined in the EU Treaty, however, makes it imperative to establish a limit value at which the health risk is extremely low."
"It therefore stands to reason that we are particularly supportive of the proposal for a limit value of five micrograms per cubic metre of air."
"The common position is a definite improvement on the Commission's proposal."
"I also very much welcome the fact that it incorporates many of the amendments adopted by this House."
"One amendment in particular was absolutely essential and central in our view, for the Commission had proposed that Member States could be granted derogations almost at will."
"It was effectively a blank cheque that could have been renewed over and over again, and by dropping this provision we have managed to achieve a compromise to which we too can subscribe."
"In the implementation of the directive it will also be important, of course, to respond to the problems faced by the countries of the South and to arrive at an appropriate compromise."
"The proposal also corresponds to the suggestion made by Mrs Schleicher at the first reading in the Environment Committee, namely that a single exception may be made, that it must be duly substantiated, that it need not be restricted to countries but can also apply to particular regions or geographical areas and that a concentration in excess of ten micrograms may not be authorised under any circumstances."
"It is also very important in the light of our forthcoming enlargement to the East that we should emphasise that the European Union does not operate a two-speed environmental policy and that those Member States to which exceptions apply must make every effort to move towards compliance with EU requirements and must furnish proof of progress in this direction."
"The Environment Committee has also tabled a number of other amendments, but these should not be contentious either, because they relate primarily to the obligation to provide information."
"In these we have clearly emphasised that the new instrument of the Internet must be used as a means of improving the flow of information."
"I have no doubt that these amendments will also have answered the question as to how information is to be communicated. Moreover, we have also drawn attention to the fact that indoor pollution is also a major problem which should be addressed by EU research programmes."
"We cannot present a credible case for the improvement of outside air quality unless we demonstrate a clear commitment to improving the quality of indoor air."
"In addition, we have underlined very clearly that the Member States will also have to compile better documentation."
"Another very important point is that the governments of those Member States to which derogations apply should also inform the public of this special dispensation and of the efforts that are being made to achieve our goal of five micrograms by the year 2010."
"I shall close there - my time is up in any case."
"What is important is that this directive should be swiftly implemented, and I believe we have worked hard towards that aim and that we are unlikely to encounter any problems in achieving it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Breyer has just indicated, we are dealing today with the second individual directive deriving from the framework Directive of 1996 on the assessment and management of ambient air quality."
"The main aim of the proposed legislation is to establish limit values for atmospheric concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in order to improve the quality of our air and to avoid, prevent and reduce the adverse effects of these substances on human health and the environment."
"It is true that the main source of emissions of both pollutants is road traffic."
"Other major sources of benzene emissions are fuel distribution, oil refineries and the chemical industry, while all combustion processes emit carbon monoxide."
"This directive is a very important contribution to the maintenance of clean air and to the global climate strategy."
"The proposal was presented by the European Commission in December 1998."
"The Finnish presidency made a determined effort to use the new legal scope offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to have this proposed directive enter into force back in December 1999 after the first reading, with the amendments adopted by the European Parliament."
"Our Group would have warmly welcomed that."
"I need hardly say that our Group supported the amendments which emphasise the danger to certain sections of the population and which regard the proposed environmental measures as surpassable minimum standards."
"The provisions on a single extension of the deadline and on compliance with the limit values that are required for climatic reasons in our southern Member States, provisions which are now contained in the common position, were introduced by ourselves at the time of the first reading, as was the maximum benzene concentration of 10 micrograms per cubic metre."
"Mrs Breyer, of course, has already given some indication of the subsequent harmonious development of the common position."
"This now contains the very wording that we wanted on this point, and its other provisions are consistent and provide for practicable measures to improve air quality in Europe."
"Our Group accepts this common position and can support it as it stands."
"This new regime guarantees that public health will be afforded a high level of protection, and it is flexible enough to be adapted at any time in response to technological progress."
"Mrs Breyer has taken a great deal of trouble and has achieved much of what Parliament wanted at the negotiating table."
"I must say, however, that in our view the amendments which have been reintroduced are superfluous; while they are justifiable, it is not worth putting the directive on ice again for the sake of these amendments, which would only delay the adoption process."
"We consider it far more important - as you yourself said, Mrs Breyer - that, after a delay of half a year, this instrument should now enter into force as quickly as possible, so that it can play its part in improving the quality of the air we breathe in Europe."
"For that reason, our Group does not support the amendments, because we hope that, by withholding our support, we can expedite the process of adopting this directive."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for this highly gratifying report and for her successful work behind the scenes; at the same time, of course, I wish to thank everyone else involved for their fruitful cooperation."
"I am aware of the significance of this directive in terms of the development and enhancement of European environment policy."
"It will be the first legal instrument to set a limit on concentrations of a carcinogenic substance."
"Its significance lies not only in the fact that it is important to have a limit value for this particular carcinogenic substance but also in the fact that it sets a precedent for the future regulation of other carcinogens."
"The main political aim at the first reading was to limit the scope for derogations from the prescribed limit values as far as possible, to make the rules as restrictive as possible, and I believe that we can be more than pleased with this solution, which was the fruit of our joint efforts."
"My Group is also interested, of course, in the rapid implementation of this directive, and we wish to avoid a conciliation procedure."
"I am also aware that the debate on this directive is not the right place to discuss indoor pollution."
"Nevertheless, I do believe that it is appropriate to highlight the dangers of indoor pollution and to call for initiatives in that domain, such as additional research."
"After all, there is evidence that people are exposed to hazardous substances, especially the carcinogen benzene, as a result of indoor pollution too."
"This is why we support the amendments that have been tabled, and we trust that we shall nevertheless be able to avoid a conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, the three previous speakers have already articulated the significance of these proposals."
"We should also like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"She has done extremely well with the lion' s share of her amendments and the amendments which have been adopted by the Commission and Parliament at first reading."
"The question which remains is whether or not we want to go further than what has been accepted in the common position."
"In our opinion, the rapporteur' s arguments are convincing and we will give them our seal of approval."
"In the discussions we have had on this directive, a subject came up which could in fact have come up in other environmental issues as well, but it is important in my view to bring it to the fore in this context."
"The question we always need to ask ourselves as European institutions is: why is this one of our concerns?"
"Why is it the case that a problem which can be very localised - this is, in fact, one of the very problems we are discussing at the moment - why is this something which we need to decide on in Brussels or Strasbourg and cannot delegate to national level?"
"I am not talking about the legal dimension, because, legally, we are bound to deal with this."
"Eventually, it became clear to us that in this case, it would be useful if we, as European citizens, were to deal with this on the basis of a kind of equality before the law, offering the same level of protection to the same citizens."
"But I can imagine that other people would argue against this, saying: no, it is important to be involved in this as a Union."
"I would find it useful if the Commissioner, time-permitting, could comment on this briefly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur and the committee for their good work."
"Mrs Breyer' s report went a long way towards further improving the Commission' s proposal at first reading, which took place in December of last year."
"The limit values which have been set for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air are based upon the World Health Organisation' s latest recommendations and are aimed at achieving a high level of protection of people' s health throughout the Union."
"Adoption of this directive would mean that the Union would take the lead internationally where limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide are concerned."
"I want to begin by explaining the Commission' s views on Amendments 2 and 3."
"These concern the issue of providing information to the public, something which is of the greatest importance."
"As you perhaps know, the Commission has now, in the course of the week, adopted a new directive which will further improve access to environmental information."
"The Commission approves Amendment 2, which expressly mentions the Internet."
"Amendment 3 (1) refers to the fact that the Member States should make a special effort to inform those who are affected by the extensions to the time limits within which the limit values for benzene are to be complied with."
"The Commission agrees in principle with this requirement, but the common position expressed in Article 8.3 of Directive 96/62/EC, that is to say the framework directive on air quality, already obliges the Member States to compile this information and make it available to the public."
"In order for the Commission to be able to approve Amendment 3 (1), the latter must therefore be substantially reworded."
"Amendment 3 (2) contains a demand for free public access to the Member States' documentation concerning the selection of places from which to take samples."
"In spite of the fact that the Member States already have this obligation under the Århus Convention, the Commission approves the Amendment."
"I turn now to Amendments 1 and 4 which both concern the Commission' s review of the Directive in 2004."
"The review will form part of the first report on the new integrated programme for clean air, which the Commission is in the process of drawing up."
"The common position already states that the purpose of the review is to study the latest results and, if need be, further improve protection."
"Because indoor air pollution can cause significant health problems, the Commission will take account of this issue in the review."
"Amendment 1 may therefore be approved in principle, but must be reworded."
"I turn finally to Amendment 4, which concerns an important issue."
"The most difficult point in the negotiations in the Council was the limit value for benzene and the time limit for achieving this."
"Against the background of the results of a current investigation into benzene, mainly the southern Member States considered that they were uncertain of being able to achieve the limit value of 5 g/m3 by 2010."
"Despite this, Article 3.2 of the common position offers only one possibility for extending the time limit by five years under certain conditions."
"Moreover, a concentration of 10 g/m3 must not be exceeded during that period."
"I would emphasise that this is in line with Amendment 22, tabled at Parliament' s first reading."
"Only through an addendum to Article 7.3, in which it is expressly stated that the Commission can propose further extensions in the light of the results of the 2004 review, was it possible for this agreement to come about."
"From a purely legal point of view, this clause does not lead to the Commission' s right of initiative being limited or otherwise affected, but may be seen as an important part of the final compromise in the Council."
"According to Amendment 4, the clause ought not to be there, something which could jeopardise the agreement with the Council."
"The Commission considers that the compromise to which this could lead would involve unnecessary delay in adopting this important directive in which, for the first time ever, limit values are established for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air."
"The Commission is therefore unable to approve Amendment 4."
"Finally, I want to say that I believe the common position constitutes a valuable compromise to which I hope that the whole Parliament will agree, without the need for major changes."
"Thank you, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Environmental inspections"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0164/2000) by Mrs Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States."
"Mr President, the idea that is fundamental to the report that I am bringing forward is that the proposal from the European Commission for a recommendation on this subject should be changed to become a directive and, as you will see from my report, this secured near unanimous backing in the Environment Committee."
"The members of the committee agreed with me that a recommendation is far too weak an instrument in this instance."
"I suppose a recommendation is really rather the equivalent of us all moving down into the centre of Strasbourg and attending the cathedral in order to make an act of collective prayer."
"That really is all that a recommendation is."
"There is no way in which the European Commission can go back to Member States and say that they have not complied with a recommendation because a recommendation merely says that they may do something, it does not say that they must do something."
"The Commission is very worried about this report because it recognises that if we persist in insisting on a directive rather than a recommendation, the whole thing may founder in the Council."
"I recognise the Commission's worries."
"I did faithfully try in the Environment Committee to get the members to agree to a recommendation rather than a directive."
"I got a very rude answer from them which I will not repeat to you but which is basically reflected in my report."
"They want a directive and not a recommendation."
"And, indeed, if the guidelines on environmental inspection which the Commission is so keen to see survive were incorporated in a recommendation, my committee feels that they will simply be ignored."
"We want to see a directive which definitely commits the Member States to introduce environmental inspections operating on broadly similar lines."
"I must underline that what we do not want to see, in case anybody hangs this round my neck, is a supra-national European environment inspectorate: lots of little men and women in blue uniforms with gold stars rushing round the Member States, reporting back to Brussels saying this is wrong or indeed, in the case of Germany, this is right."
"We do not need that kind of supra-national inspectorate."
"I believe, and my committee agrees with me, that the primary responsibility for enforcing European Union environment legislation should be firmly lodged where it belongs, with the Member States."
"We cannot understand the Commission's readiness to propose only the minimum possible."
"Neglect of European Union environment law forms an alarming background to this proposal."
"Yesterday was a historic day in the history of the European Union, not, I hasten to add only because of the visit of President Chirac to Strasbourg, but because it was the day of the first report of a fine levied by the European Court of Justice, an actual fine of EUR 20 000 a day on Greece for failure to comply with a European Union environment directive."
"But it is interesting to note that that case was actually launched thirteen years ago and relates to a directive which dates back even further."
"At the moment there are currently nine other environment cases which have come back to the Court of Justice for a second time because countries have ignored earlier judgments."
"There are no less than 157 cases still pending and I regret to have to say that in many cases the European Commission has not been able to act, to bring cases to the Court of Justice, because it does not know what is happening in Member States as the countries concerned have not reported back to Brussels on what they are doing about legislation."
"One of the reasons that they have not reported is that the countries themselves do not know."
"Why do they not know?"
"Because they do not have systems of environmental inspection which form the essential raft on which the whole edifice of compliance with European environment law is built."
"We need the kind of directive that the Environment Committee would like to see."
"A recommendation will do no good."
"I hope that the European Commission has the courage, and I mean courage, to accept the European Parliament amendments."
"I hope that the European Commission has the courage to go into the conciliation process arm in arm with the Parliament against, and it will be against, the Council."
"I think some members of the Council are really quite wobbly in the direction of a directive rather than a recommendation."
"The tiny concessions so far offered by the Council lodged in the preamble to this proposal are simply not enough."
"Mr President, those of us who survived the conciliation procedure for the water framework directive must be delighted that here we have an issue which is entirely clear-cut and easily understandable."
"The first issue is that we want equal and effective enforcement of environmental legislation across the European Union and we must all agree to that principle."
"The question obviously is why we have not had that before."
"Why have the Commissioner's predecessors not brought forward proposals before now and why are the proposals now introduced so miserably weak?"
"There is also a question for Member States."
"What have they been doing signing up to environmental legislation if in reality they do not have the means to check properly that it has been carried out and have no intention of ensuring that it is properly enforced?"
"I have chemical companies in my constituency in the north-west of England."
"Some of them, I am sorry to say, discharge polluting materials into air and water."
"They get inspected."
"Action is taken."
"They are forced to clean up their act."
"They pay the price for that."
"But they are competing with chemical companies elsewhere in this European Union which are not having to carry out those checks, which are not having to pay the price and they are not able to compete therefore on a level playing field."
"It is simply unfair."
"The second issue is the clear conflict here between the Parliament and the Council."
"Any student who wants to understand conciliation procedure or codecision procedure has a nice straightforward case study here."
"We have codecision powers but we have the threat from the Council that if we do not fall into line then they will abandon the whole legislation."
"Well, they might as well, as Mrs Jackson has said."
"The message for the French Presidency is that we want tangible progress."
"We do not want to see this abandoned."
"There is room for compromise, presumably over the implementation date."
"All the institutions in the European Union want the laws enforced properly."
"It is time to give these warm but rather woolly sentiments some real meaning and action."
"Mr President, may I first of all thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, and the Committee on the Environment for its work on this proposal on environmental inspections."
"I cannot resist the temptation to point out to Mrs Jackson that she reminds me of my promise to the Committee on the Environment not to propose new directives all the time, but rather to concentrate on implementation."
"The bad implementation of environmental rules has nothing to do with the lack of such rules and directives."
"We have a lot of these and we really want to achieve something."
"We want to see results."
"So we came straight to the key issue: was it to be a recommendation or a directive?"
"It will not be a surprise to you that the Commission cannot agree to the proposed change to a directive, for the following reasons. The Commission's 1996 communication on implementing Community environmental law noted a disparity between Member States' inspection systems and recognised the necessity of ensuring that minimum inspection tasks were performed."
"Maybe it is not such a bad idea to have those people in blue uniforms with gold stars to check on what is happening!"
"It recommended that guidelines should be established, leaving to the Member States the choice of structures and mechanisms, fitting in where appropriate with their existing systems."
"A recommendation will achieve something."
"Some Member States already have well-developed inspectorates or agencies, and the guidelines will ensure that they operate them in accordance with common standards without necessarily having to change their systems that much."
"For those Member States which do not, the recommendation will be helpful to enable them in the first instance, with the possibility of Community funding for eligible Member States, to develop their infrastructure and capacity."
"A directive might mean that some Member States will have great difficulty complying with it in its entirety from its coming into force, and this was not deemed to be practically or psychologically desirable by the Commission."
"I am convinced that the 'carrot' rather than the 'stick' approach will achieve a better result at the present state of development of national inspectorates."
"We have already achieved some progress in the area with the IMPEL inspectors' exchange programme and the other work that IMPEL has done on inspections, monitoring frequency of inspections etc."
"This proposal should therefore be viewed as the first step in an ongoing programme, and the experience gained in this operation will help us to consider at subsequent stages how to broaden the nature, scope and application of the minimum requirements."
"The proposal requires Member States to report back on the operation, and I will take a personal interest in this."
"If it transpires that Member States are not applying it in practice then we will not shrink from bringing forward a proposal for a directive."
"The attitude in the Council of the Member States, even those with well-developed inspectorates, was unanimously in favour of non-binding legislation at this stage."
"Being realistic, if Parliament insists on asking for a directive we will end up with no instrument at all."
"In that case we will have failed those Member States most in need of assistance and guidance, and the consequence will be no change in the status quo and no improvement in those Member States' implementation."
"For these reasons the Commission cannot accept any of the proposed amendments relating to changing the form of the proposal from a recommendation to a directive."
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments of substance: Amendment No 5 to help Member States distinguish between national - for example non-EU derived - law and EU law."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 11 which try to change voluntary reporting and advice schemes to mandatory ones."
"Amendment No 12, second part, because it does not add anything."
"The proposal already refers to reports being in a readily accessible database."
"Amendment No 13, second part, relating to reports of site visits being available within two months of inspection because the common position's wording ""as soon as possible"" is preferable."
"And Amendment No 14 which seeks to limit to brief data the compliance information in reports to the Commission, which is not sufficient for the Commission's purposes."
"However, if the proposal is to remain in the form of a recommendation, the Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 10, second part, and 15, second part, in relation to point 9.1."
"They all concern the involvement of the EEA and/or IMPEL in certain activities relating to inspections."
"These were accepted by the Commission at the first reading stage and included in the Commission's revised proposal."
"Thank you, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Protection of forests"
"The next item is the report (A5-0152/2000) by Mrs Redondo Jiménez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the following:"
"I. proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 3258/86 on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution [COM(1999) 379 - C5-0076/1999 - 1999/0159(COD)], and"
"II. proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 on the protection of the Community's forests against fire [COM(1999) 379 - C5-0077/1999 - 1999/0160(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has presented the amendment of two regulations, Regulation (EC) No 3528/86 on the protection of the Community' s forests against atmospheric pollution and Regulation (EC) No 2158/92 on the protection of the Community' s forests against fire, by means of two regulations, 307 and 308 of 1997, on the basis of Article 43 of the former Treaty."
"Parliament queried the regulations with the European Court of Justice on 30 April 1997, and this was resolved on 25 April 1999."
"The judgement of the Court (joint cases C-164/97 and C-165/97) repealed both Regulations and stated that the Council should have used the former Article 130s, now Article 175 of the Treaty as the sole legal basis, but the effects of the repeal were suspended to enable the Council to adopt new Regulations with the same aim within a reasonable time period."
"The European Commission and the Member States committed themselves, on an international level, at the Ministerial Conferences on the protection of the forests in Helsinki, in 1993, and Strasbourg, in 1990, to the continuous monitoring of the damage suffered by the forests."
"Everybody is aware of the important role played by the forests in all respects, both economic as well as ecological and social, and of their role in relation to soil protection, climate, water and flora and fauna, creating balances which are essential to the development of sustainable agriculture and for the management of rural areas."
"The Member States have established networks of systematic monitoring and observation posts for intensive and continuous monitoring of the forest ecosystems."
"These studies require long periods of implementation and their results depend, according to the improvements in the knowledge of the cause-effect relationships between the changes suffered by forest ecosystems and the factors which affect them, on carrying out this work of monitoring, prevention and study over a longer period."
"With regard to fires, work is underway into their causes, prevention measures and the monitoring of the forests."
"As for pollution, work is being done on the establishment of observation networks, on carrying out a periodic inventory of the damage by means of a single methodology, intensive and continuous monitoring of the forest ecosystems and the implementation, by means of pilot projects, of methods of conservation and restoration of the forests affected."
"Furthermore, the Member States must carry out a periodic assessment."
"In the proposal approved unanimously in the Environment Committee, minor amendments are introduced which I would ask the Commission to take into account, since this would prevent us from extending the procedure."
"This proposal asks that the Commission be assisted by a standing committee on forests, as it is in many other areas; that it present an analysis of the application of this regulation with regard to its ecological, economic and social aspects, as well as a cost-benefit evaluation; that an amendment be included on the Mediterranean forests as a specific ecosystem for the southern countries and because of its importance in combating desertification and erosion."
"With regard to the budget for implementation, I have a reasonable doubt: for the previous period of these regulations, the Commission proposed EUR 40 million to fight pollution, for the five years, and EUR 70 million for fire prevention."
"Now, for the next five years, the Commission proposes 34 million to fight pollution and 50 for fire prevention."
"It has just reduced the amount by 6 million for the fight against pollution and 20 million for the prevention of fires, without taking account of the rise in the cost of living index or the incorporation of new countries, Austria, Sweden and Finland, which almost double the area of forest in the Union."
"Therefore, our proposal would be to increase that budget to 44 million and 77 million for pollution and fires respectively."
"I would ask the President, since Mr Cunha is not present, to allow me to use his two minutes, as he told me previously."
"Here we have a proposal by the Committee on Budgets."
"The Committee on Budgets is once again presenting amendments in which it wants no kind of notification to appear with regard to the budget for implementation."
"I believe that the Committee on Budgets is trying to evade the codecision procedure, and I would propose to this House, and also to the Commission, that their amendments not be taken into account..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mrs Redondo, I have to tell you that Mr Cunha has just come in."
"Mrs Redondo almost hijacked your speaking time, Mr Cunha!"
"Mr President, the importance of forests in the European Union is clearly illustrated by the fact that they cover 36% of our territory and employ 2.2 million people."
"In several areas of the European Union, the forests are often the only viable economic option, because of poor soil or the lack of other natural resources. It is also clear that the importance of forests is by no means limited to economic factors."
"They encompass many other dimensions of social and environmental interest, such as the protection of the soil, the fight against erosion, the preservation of water resources, biodiversity, climatic stability etc. Despite all of this, the forests have been a kind of 'poor relation' amongst Community policies."
"It was only after many years, in 1998, with the efforts of the European Parliament, that the European Union finally managed to approve a strategy for the preservation and development of forests."
"However, given forestry' s unquestionable interrelationship with agriculture and its territorial impact, it is extraordinary that the Commission has not been more ambitious in its proposals and that the Council has historically been so short-sighted."
"Despite the fact that the European Union' s forestry strategy is a step forward in terms of ideas, it is yet to have any practical expression."
"On the contrary, in some ways it has moved backwards, as demonstrated by this Community regulation on the protection of forests."
"With regard in particular to the aspect which is of great concern to my country - the regulation on combating fires - it is regrettable that whereas in the period 1992-1996 the European Union benefited from an annual sum of EUR 14 million, this annual sum is now to be reduced to EUR 10 million, that is, by 40%."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would like to suggest to the Council and the Commission that they increase this amount and, if possible, create a Community system for information on forest fires."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask for your cooperation."
"We have calculated that, if we let every speaker overrun for just 20 seconds, we should still be sitting here at one o'clock in the morning."
"We have a lengthy agenda, so I hope you will understand why I must be even stricter than I might otherwise have been on the question of speaking time."
"Thank you very much, Mr President. Mrs Redondo is presenting, under the general heading of forest protection, a report on two proposed regulations."
"One refers to atmospheric pollution affecting forests, and the other refers to the prevention of fires."
"I would like to tell Mrs Redondo that the delegation of Spanish Socialists is going to support her amendments."
"We are going to support them because we agree with all the arguments which Mrs Redondo has put forward, and for other reasons which she has not had time to explain."
"The basic regulations date from 1986 and 1992, and now the budget for implementation is lower, despite the fact that, since the accession of the Nordic countries to the European Union, the area of forest is greater."
"Furthermore, however, atmospheric pollution has worsened as a result of acid rain, and of greater concentrations of dangerous products in the atmosphere."
"We are also in a much worse situation in terms of fire prevention, because of climate change and the drought which we are suffering in many parts of Europe."
"I would like to give just two recent examples."
"This week there has been a Mediterranean forest fire on the border between France and Italy, a fire in the Ostia pine forest, near Rome, a fire in the Region of Valencia, where I live, and furthermore there has been one death, of a farmer who was trying to put out one of the numerous fires which have occurred this week as a result of drought and heat."
"All of these arguments more than justify Mrs Redondo' s amendments, and our support for them."
"I wish to tell the Commission - and I am sorry that Mrs Wällstrom is not here at the moment - that one of the European Union' s priorities with regard to the environment should not only be the fight against pollution and fires, but also, above all, a policy of caring for the forests."
"That is why we are going to support her."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I live in the middle of the Nordic forests, which form part of the enormous area of Europe covered by forests."
"In the Nordic countries, we obviously do not have the same problems as in the Mediterranean area."
"It is therefore incorrect to talk in this context about the forests of Europe."
"The forests of Europe are very, very different from one another."
"I could spend all night and all of tomorrow talking about the history of the forests and about the enormous importance Europe' s forest areas are going to have in a future sustainable Europe."
"However, this report concerns the threats to our forests."
"For the forests in northern and central Europe, the greatest threats are from airborne forms of pollution."
"Unfortunately, we cannot prevent pollution by means of forest policy but only by means of environmental, traffic and agricultural policy, in short through general environmental policy."
"Because most forests are damaged by discharges which come from a long way away, responsibility for the air and climate is global and European."
"Fires do not constitute a problem for the Nordic forests. On the contrary."
"To obtain environmental certification, the owners of the forests have to burn down a certain area of them each year."
"We need more fires."
"We set fires for ecological reasons."
"In the Nordic forests, there are a great many species of plant which have waxed seeds."
"They have to be warmed up by a fire in order to grow."
"In the Nordic countries, there are also insects which need burning ant hills in order to breed."
"I believe that we should support the southern countries' need to fight fires, but that not all forests can be lumped together by talking in this context about European forests."
"Mr President, it is indeed gratifying to note the steady increase in the attention devoted to forests and to the state of their health."
"I do not believe, however, that it will suffice to allocate huge sums of money in the future - huge sums in relation to previous expenditure, but still less than is actually needed."
"The most important thing, to my mind, is the need to change people's perceptions, not simply with a view to loosening purse strings but also with a view to engendering the level of voluntarism that is essential to the protection of our forests."
"In the Alpine regions, for example, the institution of voluntary fire brigades is taken for granted."
"Efforts should also be made to establish such bodies in the Mediterranean Member States, not only as a means of fighting forest fires at their source and creating protective infrastructures but also as a means of fostering public willingness to provide neighbourly assistance and voluntary service."
"In this respect, I believe that people's mentalities will have to change, because money alone is not the answer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, forests play an essential role in preserving the balance of our ecology and are a sustainable resource, albeit in the long term."
"Forests are, furthermore, an imaginary, mythological and symbolic asset, which we should not forget."
"Although there has been a certain recuperation of the area dedicated to forests in the European Union, every year thousands and thousands of hectares fall victim to acidification."
"Year after year, huge areas of forest burn in Europe, annually destroying, on average, around 1% of the total forested area."
"Biodiversity is also affected, and the situation of various plant species is worrying."
"Therefore, the importance of these two regulations is unquestionable, despite the fact that the Community appropriations involved are very modest."
"As has already been pointed out, the regulation establishing an action framework for the prevention of forest fires and the reduction of the area burnt is undoubtedly of particular importance to the south of Europe."
"This regulation is specifically aimed at the cofinancing of systems for the prevention, monitoring and provision of information about fires, as well as for identifying their causes."
"It is therefore extremely important."
"Geographers understand this very well."
"The most southerly part of Mediterranean Europe is threatened by a process of physical desertification, in the literal sense of the word."
"The climatic phenomenon which originated in the Sahara desert has not stopped at the Mediterranean Sea and is spreading to the Iberian, Italian and Balkan peninsulas."
"Mediterranean woodlands, which act as a curtain, reducing the impact of this phenomenon, are being mercilessly destroyed by these fires."
"This issue of forests does not only concern the countries of the south, whose territories are affected, in the same way, of course, that the defence of the Nordic forests is not only of exclusive interest to the Nordic countries."
"The countries of the south, more than any other part of Europe, urgently need a policy for the protection of forests."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and say that I support her proposals and her objectives."
"Mr President, the content of the regulation being discussed here is based on the situation that existed at the end of the 1980s, but since then things have changed greatly."
"More attention must be paid in the protection of forests to the effect of climate change."
"We have succeeded in bringing traditional forms of air pollution under control in the last ten years, thanks also to EU directives, but at the same time, the risk of changes to global weather patterns getting out of hand has grown."
"This development must also be looked at when reviewing the way the forests of the Union are monitored."
"The regulation on the subject of the Community' s forests must be reformed, but Parliament cannot undertake financial commitments until the present regulation expires in 2001."
"In this situation the suggestion that there should be an increase of tens of millions of euros for just a little over a year is not reasonable."
"It is not sufficiently justified by the fact that the Union' s forest area has grown since the last round of enlargement."
"The situation is so different between the north and the south."
"For example, in Finland and Sweden we long ago reached the stage where the forest is used as it grows."
"Here at Union level at the moment we are discussing many genuine legislative proposals concerning forests, including a common position on the emissions ceiling directive and on the directive relating to large incineration plants."
"They must be supported, so that they are as successful as possible and so that we can do more to protect the forests as a result."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the Commission has presented two proposals for the amendment of the Regulations on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution and against fire."
"The purpose of these proposals is to adjust both Regulations in the light of the judgment of 25 February 1999 in which the European Court of Justice declared that Article 130s of the EC Treaty - which has now been renumbered 175 - was the proper legal basis for these instruments."
"I should firstly like to say thank you very much to the three rapporteurs - Mrs Redondo Jiménez, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Sbarbati - who have been examining the Commission proposals that are under discussion today for their cooperation as well as for the amendments they have put forward."
"This new legal basis automatically means that the codecision procedure under Article 252 applies and that the financial framework laid down in this Regulation becomes binding."
"It was also necessary to bring the annual budgetary framework for these two initiatives into line with the amount of funds actually allocated by the budgetary authority in the period from 1997 to 2000 and with the amounts already earmarked in the preliminary draft budget for the year 2001."
"That is why it is impossible for the Commission to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 12, which would involve an increase in the financial framework."
"Nor can the Commission subscribe to Amendments Nos 5 and 11, which relate to the comitology and provide for the use of the consultation procedure in the case of both Regulations."
"The Commission takes the view that this procedure would be inconsistent with the decision of 28 June 1999 on the comitology."
"The Commission believes that the substance of the relevant amendments should be discussed again in connection with the revision of both Regulations, which is due to take place in 2001."
"The Commission will present its proposals for their revision before the end of this year."
"It has no problems, however, with Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"You are the first Commissioner today who has not taken up his full allocation of speaking time."
"We note that with gratitude."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"MEDIA/MEDIA Plus"
"The next item is the report (A5-0186/2000) by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, concerning the following:"
"I. proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of a training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programme industry (MEDIA - Training, 2001-2005) [COM(1999) 658 - C5-0059/2000 - 1999/0275(COD)], and"
"II. proposal for a Council Decision on the implementation of a programme to encourage the development, distribution and promotion of European audiovisual works (MEDIA Plus - Development, Distribution and Promotion, 2001-2005 [COM(1999) 658 - C5-0119/2000 - 1999/0276(CNS)]."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my thanks to the Commission, to Commissioner Reding and to the members of all the relevant parliamentary committees for their wholehearted cooperation, and also to the Council under the Portuguese and now the French presidency for their cooperation during this stage of the legislative process."
"We all share a common commitment to the MEDIA programme and its twin aims of strengthening the European film industry and creating sustainable jobs through the audiovisual growth engine."
"That is why it is important to realise that European companies have hitherto been totally underequipped with the audiovisual material that would have enabled them to keep pace with this development."
"The cross-border distribution of European films remains too limited."
"In the cinema industry, American films have cornered some 80% of the European market, while only 7% of the cinema films shown in the countries of Europe have been made in other European countries."
"About 74% of imported television feature films and series are from America, as against 14% from European countries."
"Against this background the MEDIA programme, following on from its predecessors, MEDIA I and MEDIA II, is expressly designed to address this deficit in the circulation of European works and has three main support targets: the training of professionals in the audiovisual programme industry through MEDIA-Training and the development and marketing of audiovisual works through the MEDIA Plus programme."
"What is new about the present programme phase is that it takes account of the online dimension of all audiovisual production and that it has introduced pilot projects on the use of digital technology."
"To that extent, Commissioner, I can speak for all the participating committees and, I hope, for the whole House when I say that we support the proposals you have presented and hope that they all come to fruition."
"I do wish to point out, however, that in some areas we have proposed amendments which we consider to be extremely important."
"The first of these, as so often, concerns the budget."
"The Commission is proposing EUR 400 million for a five-year programme in the audiovisual domain."
"Four hundred million was the budget proposed by the Commission back in 1995, and unfortunately the Council rejected that proposal."
"Whoever wants to grasp the opportunities offered by the digital revolution must be prepared to make the requisite investment."
"That is why the figure of 400 million is too low."
"The increase we are proposing is actually moderate; it would take the total budget to 550 million - 480 million for MEDIA Plus and 70 million for MEDIA- Training."
"This increase alone, however, will not bring spectacular success."
"We need two additional instruments."
"The first is linkage with other EU programmes, and the second is scope to inject venture capital into the private market; this is done as a matter of course in the United States, and we appeal to the Council and the Commission to work with us to ensure that it finally becomes reality in Europe too."
"The mobilisation of private capital is perhaps our key demand along with the pilot project relating to the European Investment Bank."
"The second area is the question of the legal basis."
"We know that this is a difficult question for the Commission, but it is our wish that the audiovisual programme should be based not only on Article 157 of the EC Treaty, the article concerning industry, but also on Article 151, which is devoted to culture."
"This should also be made clear in the programme and be reflected in the legal basis."
"Finally, let me just list some other important requirements."
"The transparency and efficiency of the programmes should be promoted, funds should be concentrated on SMEs, independent producers and the Member States with limited audiovisual production capacities, and they should benefit the smaller linguistic areas."
"Finally, my appeal to the Council and Commission is this: work with Parliament, so that together we can create a resolute lobby for European films."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a very important report here today."
"I should like to begin by saying that this is an exceptionally good maiden report by our new colleague Mrs Hieronymi, who also did a truly first-class job in hammering out compromises in committee with our Socialist colleagues and with the Greens and Liberals."
"So I believe we have cooperated well, even with the representatives of the European United Left."
"Together with the Commission, we have also managed to make a good Commission proposal even better."
"We do, of course, have a good general idea of what MEDIA I and MEDIA II have achieved."
"MEDIA Plus, of course, will surely be even better - the mere addition of the word 'Plus' must tell us that."
"I believe that, at a time when we have been talking about tremendously important educational issues in both Lisbon and Feira, we cannot make cuts in areas in which the products of the education system are supposed to find work."
"That is why I consider it very important that we really do create opportunities in this field, and to that end we must invest more money in the audiovisual industry, especially in the training of professionals."
"What is on offer here is therefore insufficient."
"This is always the case; there is never enough money for culture or for education."
"But at the end of the day we shall always be answerable to those people to whom we have promised the earth in our fine speeches."
"What we find here is not enough to enable us to respond to the audiovisual revolution."
"It will not enable us to develop a genuine European audiovisual policy to challenge the American hegemony in this domain."
"Nor can it really serve to unlock the full potential of the audiovisual industry to create jobs and, of course, to produce a critical mass of cultural content."
"I believe we have a duty to keep emphasising this fact."
"To put it bluntly, a European audiovisual policy has yet to materialise."
"That is why we must make an all-out effort here."
"I believe that, as Mrs Hieronymi has said, we could impart a considerable amount of momentum with a little more money. In the sphere of communications in particular, we can make a great deal of progress, including the creation of new jobs."
"At the same time, I should like to reemphasise that the primary concern of every one of us is of course European culture in all its diversity, as is the need to make it visible beyond our national borders and to portray it universally."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, first of all may I thank Mrs Ruth Hieronymi for the marvellous manner in which she has cooperated with our committee and for the outstanding degree of cooperation in all the committees and across the political spectrum."
"We have concentrated on the key points."
"Everyone has made compromises in order to try and improve still further a programme which was already very good from the outset."
"I speak now for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and wish to focus on two aspects of the programme."
"Like the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with which we reached agreement on these points, we also call for an increase in these limited budgetary resources and an addition to the legal basis - not a change, but an addition!"
"Why do I, or my colleagues in the Legal Affairs Committee, see a connection between these things?"
"I believe that everything is global, that art and culture, like everything else, are subject to these laws."
"One reason why there has to be a European cultural policy is that the nation states are no longer able to pursue their cultural policies alone."
"Where the European Union can intervene, as it is already doing in MEDIA Plus, it should be able to continue doing so with a greater volume of financial resources."
"The Council should be called to account here."
"I believe, Commissioner, that Parliament is actually playing into the hands of the Commission when we say that we want more money in order to be able to guarantee the pursuit of a European cultural policy, and that is also the reason why we should like an addition to the legal basis."
"To prevent any misunderstanding, let me say that our aim here is not to subsidise the film industry but rather to ensure that more European films can be watched in Europe."
"First of all, we have to win over this European territory in its entirety so that we can continue to operate efficiently."
"I do not think that I need speak for my full two minutes if I can focus on these two points."
"We should like more money, and we should like this addition to the legal basis."
"No doubt you will be able to echo these sentiments, Madam Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I associate myself entirely with the words of praise that have been showered on this report and shall come to the point without further ado."
"We are now entering the third round of support programmes for European films, and this support remains absolutely vital, for the European audiovisual industry has undoubtedly been in crisis for quite a long time."
"The following evidence may be added to what we have already heard."
"About one in three of the films made in the EU is never shown in a cinema, and a large percentage of those that do make it into the cinema are watched by a total audience of fewer than 130 000."
"A film will not normally start to yield a return on the initial investment until a million cinemagoers have paid to watch it."
"Only one-fifth of European films ever leave their home country; of those that do, nine-tenths go no further than neighbouring European countries."
"One of the strengths of the European film industry also accounts for its structural weakness."
"Low-budget productions in the tradition of the film d'auteur often cannot be made without the aid of national support funds and frequently appeal to a limited audience of young intellectuals."
"During production and afterwards, an adequate promotion and marketing budget is generally lacking."
"Cultural and linguistic diversity are matchless assets but sadly often stand in the way of widespread distribution."
"Great though the dream of conquering the U.S. film market may be, let us keep our feet on the European ground!"
"We must not neglect to strengthen our national markets, and we need to do more to develop the European market more effectively."
"If some laurels can be reaped along the way, so much the better!"
"Competitiveness and marketability are commendable aims of MEDIA Plus."
"The programme draws on the lessons learned from the experience of the preceding programmes, but although the Council and the Commission are well aware of the present situation, they are still afraid to take the plunge."
"Big cinema needs big money."
"One of the lessons that has been learned is that capping production costs as a condition of support is an obstacle to the creation of good films."
"The funding of support programmes is not the only issue here."
"There is also the question of allowing the provision of venture capital."
"Here we are confronted with a sorry state of affairs."
"European companies and banks do invest considerable sums of money in the programme industry, but they tend to invest in America rather than Europe."
"That is why, back in 1995, the Green Paper on strategy options to strengthen the European programme industry in the context of the audiovisual policy of the European Union proposed the establishment of a European guarantee fund, which the Council stubbornly rejected - the German Government, sad to say, being the foremost opponent of the scheme - without offering an alternative solution."
"This report therefore marks a new attempt to put this financial instrument on the agenda as an accompanying measure."
"In Germany there is a new Government, which will not necessarily feel that it would lose face by reversing the rejectionist stance of its predecessor, so perhaps we can now hope for a more conciliatory response."
"Last but not least, we must not forget the television companies, which act as the driving force of the programme industry by investing large sums of money in audiovisual productions and by providing opportunities for the transmission of audiovisual works."
"A key role attaches to the public corporations in particular."
"They possess a wealth of human and material resources, which are often the prerequisite for successful productions."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party thinks that MEDIA Plus is an extremely commendable and important programme which can help strengthen cultural and linguistic diversity within the EU."
"European film production is an important part of the EU' s cultural and media policy, and the Liberal Group considers that it is important to support the European film industry which is exposed to a very great deal of competition, especially from the American film industry."
"A special effort must be made on behalf of the European film industry, and that is something the Liberal Group supports."
"On one important point, however, we shall be voting against the rapporteur' s recommendation, and that is the budget for the programme."
"We are opposed to increasing the amounts proposed by the Commission, as recommended by the rapporteur."
"It is the European Parliament' s and the EU' s task to establish the correct framework and conditions for a cultural policy of this kind, but it is not a proper part of our remit to spend an exorbitant amount of taxpayers' money on cultural policy."
"We therefore think that the Commission' s proposal for a total overall budget of EUR 400 million over the five years is both realistic and appropriate."
"It is similarly with certain reservations that we shall be voting tomorrow in favour of the proposals to set up a European Guarantee Fund and to broaden the financing options through cooperation with the European Investment Bank."
"If we are still voting in favour of the proposals, it is because they do not automatically mean more expense for European taxpayers."
"Unlike previous media programmes, the MEDIA Plus programme also involves the radio industry and, because we really cannot find any good, sensible reason for this, we have a reservation regarding this area, too."
"The media programmes were previously administered by the Commission in cooperation with the Media Committee as the advisory committee."
"The rapporteur wishes to change the status of the Media Committee from that of an advisory to that of a competent body, but this is something for which we have never obtained a really good explanation."
"I fear that this change will make it still a little more difficult to administer the MEDIA Plus programme, so it is also with a reservation that we shall be voting in favour of the proposals tomorrow."
"In spite of all these reservations, I think we have an extremely good program before us to enable us to strengthen the European film industry. We should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, for the impressive work she has done."
"Commissioner, Mr President, I have good news and bad news about the MEDIA Plus programme."
"The good news is that Mrs Hieronymi has, of course, carried out sterling work and the cooperation which culminated in unanimity within the committee which handled this report was more than excellent."
"The plan is indeed sound."
"In fact, projects which preceded this plan have already proved that this type of plan meets a real need."
"We of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have called for attention to be given to the smaller countries, to the difficulties which smaller producers encounter in smaller countries or in countries which belong to a smaller linguistic group, and we particularly appreciated this being taken into account in the adopted amendments."
"Needless to say, we fully back what the rapporteur has stated with regard to the need for a legal basis."
"Unfortunately I have to give you the bad news too."
"This is not so much related to the Media Plan as it is to the media policy as a whole, as proposed by the European Union."
"Indeed, we may well ask ourselves what Europe' s ambition is."
"I do wonder."
"I was interested to hear Mr Andreasen' s criticism on the budgetary aspect here, but I read in the press that Europe spends EUR 1 billion per annum on helping and encouraging tobacco growers."
"I cannot help but ask myself questions then or, as Mr Perry rightly pointed out: why is it seemingly easier to obtain EU funding in Europe if you manufacture olive oil?"
"This is hardly ever discussed."
"The huge EU budgets which are channelled into agriculture are not really discussed much, rightly so, in fact."
"But I do wonder why it is so difficult to adopt European policy or industrial policy which can match Hollywood."
"In my opinion, all Hollywood wants is a worthy opponent."
"Unfortunately, we are forced to note that this programme cannot even start to offer anything that remotely resembles an opponent."
"This programme does not even take production into account."
"It mentions very important areas, such as distribution or the preliminary stages of production, but when it comes to production, mum is the word."
"Naturally, the intention is not to squander subsidies. Indeed not."
"As the rapporteur rightly stated, it is vital for the European Union to set up a Guarantee Fund at long last, in tandem with the European Investment Bank, and to offer European producers who dare compete with Hollywood the necessary guarantees, so that we can offer those people who really want to invest in European cinema the opportunity to do this."
"And I would like to ask the Commissioner to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in."
"This is not just to safeguard our culture, but it is also an enormous challenge for this new century, because everyone knows that this will be the age of the content industry, and it would be extremely regrettable if we at European level were to hand this over completely to the American content industry."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hyeronymi on the excellent work of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and I would also like to stress the extremely high level of agreement and synergy between the Committees, to the extent - and this is proof - that the main body of the report and those expressing the opinions of the different committees were all approved unanimously."
"From a structural point of view, greater investment was necessary in the audiovisual sector to create fresh job opportunities for young unemployed Europeans and to stem the European Union brain drain to third countries, particularly the United States of America, where greater investment leads not only to better working conditions but also greater job opportunities."
"The issues worked on: we considered it necessary to alter the eligibility arrangements applying to the programme by reducing the number of partners from three to two; we considered it necessary to ensure that the training programmes set out in the proposal include support measures geared to the need to develop innovative content for the production of audiovisual formats other than drama and documentaries; we considered that it was important to change the legal basis to ensure that the component relating to support for the development, distribution, and promotion of European audiovisual works can likewise be brought within the scope of codecision, thus enabling Parliament to wield greater influence on implementation of the programme and its aim of fostering European culture."
"Finally, considering development of investment in the European cinema industry to be extremely important, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy calls upon the Member States to pursue a policy of making sums reinvested for the creation of new jobs tax-deductible, and stresses the importance of establishing a guarantee fund as one of the measures necessary for the development of the independent audiovisual industry which encourages new talent and develops a cultural content of European tradition."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a Europe of economic and monetary union, it could have been an advantage for the MEDIA/MEDIA Plus programme to have Article 157 (industry) of the Treaty as its legal basis."
"Audiovisual media would, of course, be at the heart of European policy, and also of our work."
"Now, reading the preview of this part-session produced by Parliament' s press department, I note that the MEDIA Plus programme is not one of this week' s highlights."
"And I have been really surprised at the low level of interest aroused by one of this year' s most important reports from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - or rather, to tell you the truth, I have not been surprised at all."
"Culture is not paid much attention in this Parliament, as in all the European Institutions."
"That must change."
"It is not just the audiovisual industry or, I should rather say, the audiovisual sector."
"Like others Members who have spoken on this subject, I hope Article 151, on culture, can also be a legal basis for this audiovisual programme."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Hieronymi wholeheartedly for her determination to broaden the basis and the aim, and to develop the resources for this programme, not to mention all the energy she has put into our joint work."
"Audiovisual creation does not account for the whole industry, but creation is indeed involved and the purpose of this programme is to make cultural diversity effective and concrete."
"Cultural diversity is not a slogan. It is a cultural and economic necessity."
"We urgently need to have audiovisual works distributed in every country in Europe."
"Grants to cinemas showing non-national European films should be increased."
"Emphasising the cultural importance of the programme does not mean neglecting its economic importance, of course."
"By 2005, the audiovisual sector should have been responsible for creating over 300 000 highly qualified jobs."
"How can people have so little interest in a market likely to grow so rapidly?"
"It seems that neither cultural necessity nor economic objectives carry any weight in favour of implementing this ambitious programme."
"As always when culture is involved, the budget is minimal, not to mention the fact that it is always gone ten in the evening by the time we get round to culture here."
"People may say the budget has been increased compared with the two previous programmes, MEDIA 1 and MEDIA 2."
"I think not."
"EUR 250 million for twelve countries and EUR 310 million for sixteen countries is no less than the EUR 400 million now proposed for some thirty countries."
"Why is such a derisory budget, with no real increase, allocated to a programme which can combine the two objectives Europe so badly needs - the objective of Europe' s identity and Europe' s own diversified culture, and dynamic economic development?"
"We are told the digital age promises a revolution in the development of content and the distribution of images, and the MEDIA Plus programme devotes space to pilot projects, such as the digital transposition of our audiovisual heritage. Under the circumstances, would it really be responsible not to take the MEDIA Plus programme seriously?"
"Mr President, the MEDIA programmes are designed to strengthen European industry and the audiovisual content through measures providing financial support to specific sectors such as development, the preparation stage of projects, the distribution and marketing of audiovisual works, the promotion of European works and programmes with the aim of facilitating access to European and international markets, and training aimed at improving occupational preparation."
"The adoption of the Media Plus and Training programmes is important; the autonomous role of the promotion sector is important; the significant role of distribution is important for an increasingly wide distribution of works; the complementarity between Media Plus and Media Training should be increased as much as possible."
"The Commission should take Parliament's contribution to heart and accept all the amendments - both those to the training part, which is subject to codecision, and those to the development, distribution and promotion part, which is merely subject to the consultation procedure and which, moreover, receives the greatest share of the budget."
"The amendments are the result of some very clever work, Mrs Hyeronymi, and, as Chairman, I would like to compliment you and reiterate that you have won the unanimous support of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media, Education and Sport and the committees which expressed opinions."
"The latter Committees - the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy - have done something significant in approving the proposal to change the legal basis of Media Plus, inserting Article 157 (industry) and Article 151 (culture) in order to give equal value to industry and the audiovisual sector."
"The Commission has already indicated through press agencies that it opposes this amendment."
"I am sorry but we are not satisfied with the response and we would have preferred to have heard the Commission's position in this debate and not through press statements."
"In any case, we call for an increase in the budget and we hope that Parliament and the Commission will be able to achieve unanimity and an agreement on this issue as well."
"Mr President, I thank Mrs Hieronymi for the work she has put into this report."
"It is important to stress at the outset that this is not just any old report."
"It is something that is very dear not only to the members of this committee and the House but also to members of the industry right across the Union."
"But in putting this before the House we have to ask ourselves two very important questions."
"Firstly, why do we need this programme?"
"Secondly, what is the added value that it is going to bring us?"
"Only by answering those questions as a House can we go forward to the Council and the Commission with a very strong case."
"Why do we need it?"
"We are at the very beginning of an explosion of this industry on this continent."
"We have to put ourselves in the position of being able to compete in the international arena."
"I believe we are able to do that."
"I also believe that this industry will be the spearhead of this century, in the same way as coal, steel and the infrastructure of railways were the impetus for the development of the revolution in the 19th century."
"It is absolutely vital that we do not miss the train on this one."
"It is absolutely vital that we get in there as a series of institutions committed to building this industry."
"The second reason is that we have to, in this increasingly homogenised era of global audio-visual content, get into the area of freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of diversity."
"That is where we in this House have an exemplary responsibility in performing our role in the development of this particular sector."
"My own Group is very committed to the budget that has been laid out in the report."
"We are also very committed to diversifying and looking at different sources of funding as befits our new entrepreneurial era."
"Finally, it is very important to reiterate what Mrs Pack said about having a long term strategy for the audio-visual sector in the European Union, a long term coordinated and integrated strategy that allows us to benefit from each other's strengths in every Member State."
"Madam Commissioner, on a certain occasion in September, you said that we should declare war on Hollywood in order to strengthen the European film industry."
"The only problem there is that our best warriors emigrate to Hollywood. Commissioner, malicious gossip has it that you could be open to challenge, in purely legal terms, for awarding the European Film Prize in Cannes on behalf of MEDIA Plus, since the prize may have been funded from the MEDIA II budget."
"Be that as it may, we shall not criticise you."
"On the contrary, we are grateful for the tremendous vigour with which you have been tackling the entire cultural agenda."
"I have read in the press that we in the European Parliament could possibly upset the timetable because we are pressing for parliamentary codecision."
"I do not think this is the case."
"We have the political will to see that this programme begins on time."
"As directly elected representatives of the people, we also have a legal and moral right to be part of the decision-making process in the field of cultural policy."
"Madam Commissioner, we make an earnest appeal for a constructive dialogue with you and with the Council on this specific issue."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I am pleased with the MEDIA Plus document."
"I believe that it has been very much improved by Parliament."
"Mrs Hieronymi, furthermore, has been very open to all suggestions and it seems to me that, in relation to other programmes, it contains an innovation which the Commission has also contributed to, that is, support for marketing and distribution."
"Nevertheless, I would like a further step to be taken because, in my view, the MEDIA Plus document follows a principle which is rather like that of arts cinema: it supports in particular the script and the production when these days we know that post-production accounts for 60%, 70% or 80% of good films."
"Furthermore, postproduction is the field in which the new technologies are working."
"It is much cheaper to produce special effects by computer than in reality."
"If we do not support post-production, editing, training in editing and the establishment of studios for dubbing, editing and creating sound tracks, in which post-production can be properly carried out, our cinema will lag behind."
"We have European directors who have worked with American companies, who have made fantastic films."
"We have the knowledge, but we do not have the support for the industry to allow us to compete in post-production, because to speak now of script-led cinema is to speak of times past, it is to speak of the theatre-cinema in which the camera follows the actor around."
"That system is completely obsolete."
"We should support this new industry in which, furthermore, there are new vocations, new forms of creativity, a creativity of images, pure cinema, the new cinema for the era we are living in."
"I would therefore ask that, when offering grants, these aspects should be taken into account and the industry should be opened up to the world."
"In the conciliation we should now finally be talking of a cultural industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, technological progress over the last decade has indeed revolutionised the audiovisual sector."
"In any society that respects man and functions to satisfy his diverse material, spiritual and cultural needs, such progress encourages artistic creation to flourish and new forms of expression to develop, making art accessible to all and helping to create a deeper understanding between people from all walks of life."
"In capitalist societies, however, in both the audiovisual and in other sectors, the beneficial consequences of technological progress are being stifled by the forces controlling it; to wit, by monopolies making profits not by improving the quality of artistic creation, but by controlling the markets, subjecting people to misleading advertising, dictating ideological beliefs and creating specific consumer standards, even for culture."
"The problem, honourable members, is not just whether films produced in the US or films produced in Europe dominate the European market; the main problem lies with the content and quality of the films that we and our children watch."
"The European Union treats culture in general and audiovisual media in particular as a commodity, as yet another commercial activity for big business and as a competitive market where the only winners are those who are best equipped to turn the market mechanisms to their advantage, rather than those who have something new or something of a higher quality to offer."
"This approach is quite evident in the proposal for the MEDIA Plus/MEDIA training programme, from the very first paragraph of the introduction and from Article 1 of the proposal for a decision, which aims to allow professionals in the industry to take full advantage of the European and international dimension of the market."
"The whole structure has absolutely nothing to do with the needs of the people of the European Union or with culture; on the contrary it serves those interests which benefit from the commercialisation of culture."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work that she has done."
"There are two simple points I want to make."
"There are some things that the public sector cannot do and some things the market cannot do."
"Certainly the public sector cannot make good films."
"I do not believe it can do much of a job of judging what is a good film."
"Whenever we try it in the United Kingdom, any support from the government tends to mean that the film is going to be a flop."
"We need to very careful about that. Similarly, the market does not have adequate resources or adequate ability to ensure that we have sufficiently skilled and trained people."
"That certainly is an area that is proposed in this report and is a responsibility at a European level."
"I must pay tribute to organisations like, in Britain, the National Film School in Beaconsfield, which needs help to do its work."
"I was pleased to see there are some references to digital radio in this report, but not enough."
"We should not forget the radio sector in audio-visual."
"I hope that will not be forgotten as this report goes through."
"Finally, it is very easy to write a long speech. It is much harder to give a short speech."
"It is easy to spend a large budget, but difficult to spend a small budget."
"We look to the Commission to spend the money that they have efficiently and effectively."
"Mr President, I shall not have the last word; that is the Commissioner's prerogative."
"I wish to subscribe to the thanks that have been expressed to the rapporteur and to emphasise that I have heard from insiders that the programme has so far been an unqualified success."
"I believe that one reason for this has been the way in which the support has been accompanied by intensive consultancy and local networking."
"This needs to be re-emphasised."
"The MEDIA desk and the local MEDIA branches have proved to be very useful instruments."
"It is vital for these accompanying institutional measures to be retained."
"The MEDIA branch offices help to minimise the obstacles to European cooperation, for example."
"On the one hand, MEDIA is about culture and common European cultural traditions in the audiovisual domain."
"This is still a rather tender sapling which needs our undivided attention."
"Moreover, as other speakers have already pointed out, it is also an economic asset that is judged by its success."
"One key criterion of the success of the new MEDIA programme will be its support for the development, marketing and promotion of films that the public wants to see."
"I make no attempt to conceal my own personal view on this matter."
"Hollywood cannot be beaten, in my opinion, by money and quotas but only by quality."
"Recent years have shown that people are interested in many different types of film."
"Europe must not shy away from this window of opportunity."
"We must continue to foster this encouraging development, and to that end the budgetary increase requested in Mrs Hieronymi's report is a logical move."
"Finally, I should like to mention that many of the roots of our European culture lie in Central and Eastern Europe."
"A higher budget will also make it possible to involve the Central and Eastern European countries to a greater extent in these programmes."
"The last word on an increased budget may not yet have been spoken, and we shall perhaps be discussing further increases over the next few years."
"Mr President, first of all, I want to thank you for agreeing to put MEDIA Plus on your already very full agenda, despite the fact that we so often get there late at night."
"But late in the evening is often the time for cultural activities, so we are not really doing anything unusual."
"I also want to thank the Members of Parliament who have worked so intensively on the draft: the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, of course, but also the various committees the report was referred to for an opinion, and I want to mention the draftsmen, Mrs Echerer, Mr Fiori, Mr Rocard and Mr Wynn."
"Above all, I would like to add my voice to all those who have highlighted the contribution of the rapporteur, Ruth Hieronymi."
"We usually do congratulate the rapporteur."
"It is traditional. But this time I think we can say Mrs Hieronymi' s work has been more than exceptional."
"She has been a great rapporteur and it is thanks to her that the draft Parliament is submitting to us today is a draft which improves the Commission' s text."
"We appreciate the rapporteur' s negotiating talent and her personal commitment."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Hieronymi."
"Mr President, as you know, the Commission sets great store by the European Parliament' s opinion, especially with the Culture Council coming up on 20-21 July, because it is my job to let the ministers know the views of the European Parliament."
"In this way, discussions between the Commission and the Council can progress usefully, not just on the basis of the Commission' s proposal, but also on the basis of the position expressed by Parliament."
"Do not expect me to launch into a speech on the importance of European cinema."
"I have done that many times, in many places."
"You know my views on the subject; I share yours, but we are here this evening to produce the best possible draft."
"I have taken note of the 116 amendments presented today with great interest: 48 of them relate to the proposal for a decision on vocational training and 68 to development, distribution and promotion."
"All the amendments bear witness to a broad consensus in Parliament about the way the Commission has approached the MEDIA programme."
"There are many practical proposals for the implementation of the programme and some of Parliament' s concerns shine through these amendments. I must say the Commission broadly shares them, just as I share most of the views expressed this evening, here in the House."
"The first consideration is the acknowledged importance of the audiovisual content sector in Europe' s economy and society, now and in the future, and the need to take account of the new opportunities available, especially thanks to the new technologies, including digital technology. That challenge means that MEDIA Plus must take greater account of the new technologies."
"That is not, however, enough. We must also follow up the Lisbon Summit, by opening up other Community initiatives."
"As you are right to point out, we cannot afford to invest in production."
"Producing a single major film would swallow up the entire MEDIA budget."
"That is why we have tried to use MEDIA to complement what the Member States should be and are doing, but that is not enough either, and some speakers have justifiably mentioned the abortive experiment with a guarantee fund in the past."
"We are working to recreate such a fund."
"Indeed, I have been in touch with the president of the European Investment Bank. We both agreed that, in order to develop the content industry in Europe, risk capital needs to be made more available and instruments established to aid investment in audiovisual content."
"My officers and those of the European Investment Bank are negotiating along these lines, to establish such an investment fund as soon as possible, in the spirit of eEurope as recommended in Lisbon and confirmed in Feira."
"When things start to move along I will certainly come to this House to keep you informed of progress, Mr President."
"I also agree that Community policy on audiovisual media should have a wider scope but should be developed as a complement to national and regional policies in this field, and synergistically with these."
"Secondly, one of the acknowledged successes of the MEDIA programme is its adaptation to the needs of businesses in the sector, especially SMEs, through financial and training support mechanisms suited to their practices and strategies."
"These mechanisms must seek to overcome the obstacles of the national markets and profit fully from an enlarged area of distribution."
"It is therefore essential for the implementation of MEDIA Plus to be based on professional expertise and for the support mechanisms to be accessible to the greatest possible number of businesses, in all the countries and regions making up our Community."
"And that implementation must be properly balanced between the needs of the professionals and the need for transparency, and strict control of public expenditure. In particular, Mr Perry, it must respect the financial regulation."
"Thirdly and finally, I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the Commission' s opinion on the programme' s target sectors, as well as its wish to see transnational synergies developed. I think the future of the content industry in Europe lies in coproductions."
"Transnational synergy between the production and distribution sectors will be something new, with a view to a more competitive industry. But when we talk about the culture industry, we are still talking about culture, of course, and we do want our films to travel, we do want to encourage, emphasise and achieve cultural and linguistic diversity."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, what is the Commission' s position on the proposed amendments?"
"First of all, in the 'vocational training' section, I am in a position to accept in full, or in substance, 37 of the 48 amendments presented today."
"Mr President, I have the list of amendments available."
"In fact the only amendments I have reservations about relate, of course, to the budget."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am really embarrassed to have to stand here and say I cannot accept the figure you propose."
"Personally, if I were not speaking as a Commissioner, I would consider Parliament' s figure far too low for the objectives we want to attain."
"Unfortunately, we have a restrictive budgetary authority, and, unfortunately again, we have our governments, which want far less even than the budgetary authority authorises me to want."
"So you see, I am forced to tell you that your proposals - though not excessive, Mrs Hieronymi - cannot be supported by the Commission."
"Another factor is the exclusion of initial training: Amendments Nos 12, 110, 111 and 112."
"I believe it ought to be possible to support this type of training, but not as a general rule. We should support it as an exception and as a subsidiary activity, when no other support exists at national and European level, and in particular in order to network initial training bodies and give such training a European status."
"Another problem is the exclusion of the training areas to be supported by the economic, financial and commercial management training programme: Amendments Nos 113 and 114."
"You see, if we want to train professionals effectively, it is essential to teach them to understand the European and international dimensions of the market in their fields - and to do so at European level too."
"Setting up international coproduction, marketing and distribution in foreign countries are all things our future audiovisual industry workers need to be taught if we want them to operate on an international scale, and that is our aim."
"So there will be support for economic, financial and commercial management from a European perspective."
"My fourth point is the inclusion of training for technical professions in audiovisual media, Amendment No 18, and radio, Amendment No 33."
"This training is well developed at national level and, as such, it does not require a European dimension like the other proposed training."
"On the other hand, I am in favour of opening up MEDIA training actions to radio professionals, which may constitute a compromise between Amendments Nos 33 and 34."
"Finally, there are two declaratory amendments on encouraging fiscal measures, Amendment No 4, and intellectual property, Amendment No 9."
"Although these amendments are legitimate in spirit, they go beyond the scope of the decision."
"Mr President, I come now to the second part of the proposal for a directive: development, distribution and promotion."
"I am willing to accept 57 amendments, 80% of the amendments tabled by Parliament, literally or in spirit."
"I can make the list of these amendments available, Mr President."
"I am forced to express reservations on eleven of the amendments tabled."
"Four of them, Amendments Nos 53, 65, 69 and 93, are declaratory and outside the scope of the decision."
"Their inclusion, while legitimate in spirit, is not justified in the text of the proposal for a decision."
"It will come as no surprise that my reservations relate, in particular, to Amendments Nos 44 and 54 on the legal basis."
"Article 157(3) is the legal basis proposed by the Commission, and Parliament is seeking to add another legal basis, the article on culture."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I understand your position, but I think Article 157 relating to industry is the appropriate legal basis for this decision - as was already the case for MEDIA 2 - considering its subject matter, its aim and its content."
"Establishing an industrial policy for audiovisual media does not mean we forget about cultural diversity, because the aim of the culture industry is precisely the achievement, on the ground, of cultural diversity."
"But the choice, as legal basis, of the article relating to industry conforms to consistent case law which lays down that in the framework of the system of Community powers, the choice of the legal basis of an act must be founded on objective factors capable of jurisdictional control and such factors notably include the aim and the content of the act."
"MEDIA Plus is a programme intended to strengthen the competitiveness of the audiovisual sector, but I must stress that one recital, recital 11, highlights, if that were still necessary, the cultural dimension of the audiovisual sector, in accordance with Article 151(4) of the Treaty."
"I note your concerns and I really hope that the next revision of the Treaty will offer a new framework, as well measures enabling the European Parliament to be fully involved in decisions on audiovisual policy."
"As regards Amendment No 87 on the budget for the second section, my comment is the same as for the amendment on the budget for the training section."
"So I need not go over it again."
"As regards Amendment No 103 on radio, MEDIA Plus cannot be extended to other sectors given the financial constraints, but I have already made one concession, in the training section, to including radio in the programme."
"On Amendments Nos 115 and 116, regional and minority languages, the Commission is, as you know, very concerned about respect and promotion of linguistic and cultural diversity."
"Moreover, this concern is taken into account throughout the MEDIA Plus programme, primarily through positive discrimination measures in the support mechanisms in favour of professionals operating in countries and regions with low production capacity and with a limited geographic or linguistic scope."
"Amendment No 115 would create a sub-programme within the programme."
"So I do not think we should go that far."
"But Amendment No 116 actually does nothing more than take up and specify the measures which are already scattered throughout the programme."
"So, if Parliament really wants it, and so decides, I will not oppose that amendment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, beyond these few points of disagreement, which are minimal, I want to express my satisfaction at the cooperation and the many points of agreement between the Commission and Parliament."
"The amendments proposed today, which are of a high quality, will undoubtedly make it possible to improve the texts establishing the MEDIA programme."
"They will contribute to achieving our goal: the creation of a strong content industry in Europe."
"With our MEDIA Plus programme we are seeking to complete all the other actions which should restore to the European cinema not its credibility, because that was never lost, but its confidence, because it is by having confidence in the ability of the European cinema that we will succeed in developing it as we all wish."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Quality evaluation in school education"
"The next item is the report (A5-0185/2000) by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, concerning a proposal for a European Parliament and Council recommendation on European cooperation in the domain of quality evaluation in school education (COM(1999) 709 - C5-0053/2000 - 2000/0022(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, one of the EU' s key goals is to promote mobility within the labour market, and this can only be stimulated by high-quality education."
"It is therefore essential to develop tools not only to improve education, but also to ensure that education meets modern-day requirements."
"Quality assessment, self-assessment of schools in particular, is a key element in the development of quality education."
"This is why, all in all, I am delighted with the Commission' s recommendation that is now before us."
"However, I also have some comments with regard to the recommendation, and I included these in my report."
"In my opinion, it is especially important to encourage Member States to develop sound methods for assessment in education, bearing in mind that self-assessment is complementary to external evaluation."
"In addition, it is important for them to exchange good models and experiences and that all those involved in the school are actually involved in the self-assessment process, including parents and students."
"Moreover, it is important to stimulate cooperation between schools and various bodies, also at local and regional level."
"Good examples of this can be found in the trial projects and also, of course, at European level."
"What the Commission needs to do, therefore, is to draw up an inventory of sound existing methods, in order to set up a database which can be used interactively so that activities can be scheduled and regular reports submitted to Parliament by putting the item on the running agenda."
"I have drawn on many ideas from my fellow delegates, but also from many institutions in the sphere I mentioned above. It transpired in the process that the will to turn this project into a success is present on all sides, and the impetus created by the EU has certainly found fertile soil."
"It is therefore all the more unfortunate that repeated attempts on my part to reach agreement with the Council - because you know it was my intention to complete the report at first reading - were thwarted time and again and met with reactions that came too late and insufficient mandate."
"I would therefore call on the Council to come up with a proposal for a common position within the short term."
"We are nearly there, but I would first of all like to clarify the line adopted by our Parliament, so that we can coincide with the line taken by the Council."
"Finally, we reached general agreement in the committee on a large number of amendments."
"I thank you all for your very constructive attitude."
"I would now ask you for your support to deliver on these agreements."
"I would advise you not to pursue the amendments tabled by the PSE."
"It is important to couple education with the labour market."
"This is borne out by the results reached in Lisbon."
"After all, we should not educate people for unemployment, and education needs to pre-empt this."
"This is why this should also be included in this report."
"The other amendments are already more or less reflected in the text or in other amendments."
"Finally, I would like to mention the financial dimension."
"I have not made any changes on purpose, not because I think the budget is generous but because I think that it will appear from the reports whether the budget is too tight."
"That will then be a good time to consider a possible increase in the funding."
"I thank you and look forward to your reactions."
"Mr President, it was late when I made my last speech, it is even later now so I shall be try to be even briefer."
"But education is important and we must make sure it gets the attention it deserves."
"Often education attracts fine words. What it does not always get is the action to match those words."
"We all know the EU has very limited responsibilities as regards education, but there are some places where the European Union can give added value."
"Quality evaluation is one of those."
"When I went into town earlier on this evening I saw young people in the city of Strasbourg looking at leaflets up on a wall."
"What they were looking at were their baccalaureate results."
"So we think nothing about evaluating youngsters."
"What we need to do is evaluate the schools and to make sure that the schools are doing well."
"Since the schools are preparing young people for an education in the single market of Europe, we must make sure that the schools across Europe are all doing their work to prepare people for the single market those young people are going to work in."
"In some parts of the Union - and I am quite willing to cite the United Kingdom - we are not doing as well as we could."
"There are very many bright youngsters who do very well in the schools, but 20% of young people leave British schools without any qualifications at all."
"We cannot afford to allow that to continue to happen."
"There have been estimates that in the next two years we will require half a million extra people in IT jobs."
"Where are those young people going to come from?"
"We have to make sure that the schools can deliver them and I am quite sure that what is contained in this report is one of the ways that we can help raise the standards in schools."
"In English we say ""two heads are better than one"" ."
"I am quite prepared to believe that 15 heads, or 15 sets of data across the Union, will help us achieve better quality in the schools."
"I would just say to the Council - and I hope there is somebody from the Council listening to this - I know we can have confidence in the Commissioner, but let us say to the Council that their fine words at Lisbon were great but they should now deliver on them."
"I am therefore very sorry that the great efforts that the rapporteur made to get full agreement were not actually rewarded."
"So do not be too surprised if this Parliament backs the rapporteur and tries to push the Council to live up to the fine words they were so ready to utter."
"Mr President, building Europe means first and foremost being aware of its diversity and its differences."
"In studying the educational systems of the Member States of the European Union we should draw on a profound knowledge of the practices and acquired rights in our various countries, because each of our countries has its own educational reality."
"Any change to the educational system calls into question the ideology of the society and its economic development."
"Quality in education is a challenge for our society, but education must not become a focus for social operators who want to impose their personal aims upon it."
"If an in-depth reform of the educational system is needed, it must involve all the partners in the system and, above all, it must not be rigid."
"It must be capable of evolving in step with society because educational systems suffer when they are not rooted in life."
"But for all that, we must not forget that the all-round development of the human being is an essential goal of education."
"We must not seek to respond at any price to a constantly developing market. On the contrary, we must let young people acquire the tools of knowledge which allow them to face their future."
"Today, the concern is certainly not to wait for pupils to fail, at the end of their schooling, before showing some imagination."
"They need to be offered appropriate teaching."
"No child is devoid of talent."
"Every system creates its own type of failures."
"The criteria for identifying failure are essentially subjective."
"Success is judged according to pre-established standards."
"What are those standards? How have they been established?"
"Depending on the circumstances, politicians may even find it in their interests to exaggerate or minimise things that are going wrong, especially as the problems of education occupy a growing place in the political debate and the media."
"Any pupil in difficulties is a young person whose future is compromised."
"Any child who is failing is expressing his unease in the educational institution, but also in society."
"A young person who is not recognised as an individual with his own experiences and his own knowledge is a rejected human being."
"In rejection he will give vent to his despair; he will give vent to his hatred."
"The fight against failure at school, in other words, against failure in society, is and must be a major concern for anyone with political responsibility."
"So it is time to regard the young person as a developing being, wishing to train himself rather than being trained."
"Perhaps we should change the way we approach knowledge and review the operation of our educational systems, but we must be careful not to seek uniformity because the multiplicity of cultures is a source of personal enrichment and a condition for successful human development."
"There is no miracle cure, but there are battles to be fought."
"And that means that all those who believe it must combine forces to do so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is almost midnight already, and I do not wish to extend this sitting unnecessarily."
"I agree with what Mrs Roure and Mr Perry have said and, of course, with the content of Mrs Sanders- Ten Holte's report."
"I should like to confine myself to a couple of points, and I shall begin by referring back to Feira and Lisbon."
"This report is really a follow-up to the thoughts of the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira."
"When we contemplate the information society and globalisation, when we consider the speed at which technology is changing our society, it becomes obvious that we must guarantee a school education that enables young people to stay abreast of these developments."
"We must create the basis for the essential establishment of lifelong learning."
"For that reason, I approve of the measures that are proposed here."
"They will probably help us to deal more effectively with this challenge."
"Let me just come back to a point that I raised myself in an amendment."
"It must be possible to work with the existing resources, with the available networks and databases."
"There is no need for us to keep reinventing the wheel."
"We should use what we have, comparing the knowledge we each possess and then operating on the basis of that knowledge."
"I shall move on now to a technical point."
"In recent days we have heard that Mrs Sanders has been trying to make the first reading suffice."
"But of course there is a price to pay for that."
"Whoever wants to shorten the legislative process to one reading by making use of the scope for interinstitutional agreements has to conclude a deal."
"This deal does not involve a decree from the gentlemen of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, who have no say; they must simply declare their acceptance of the sound parliamentary proposals."
"They have not made such a declaration; they did promise us something, but we set no store by promises."
"We shall vote on our report tomorrow."
"Thereafter, if the gentlemen of Coreper feel able to accept our amendments, we are prepared to expedite the matter very swiftly in the autumn - there is no rush."
"We should not buy a pig in a poke; we should vote on our report tomorrow and give these gentlemen the opportunity to think again."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to what has been said already, with which I can only concur, may I reiterate that the foundations for the future prospects of the youth of tomorrow are laid in the classrooms of today and that brainpower will be the key asset of the future."
"Among the basic skills we now have to learn is how to teach young people to cope with the rapid changes that are taking place in the present era."
"These basic skills also include the ability to motivate individuals to engage in lifelong learning, to arouse their curiosity, to foster their willingness to be mobile, flexible and open-minded and to accept responsibility and to train them to be independent."
"Let me just cite one example of this motivation and support."
"In my own country of Austria, this type of benchmarking, in the form of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Pop 3 study, in which we did not perform particularly well, has led to the establishment of a programme known as Qualität in Schulen (Q.I.S - Quality in Schools)."
"At the heart of this project is the school curriculum."
"It contains a model for schools to follow and statements relating to the present situation and enumerates specific aims and measures for the promotion of quality in various areas."
"It is a fixed-term agreement with an impact inside and outside schools, providing guidelines for educational practice as well as information for the public and serving as a planning instrument and a yardstick against which the development of a school can be measured."
"Comparison creates competition, and competition promotes individuality among schools and hence a variety of models for guidance."
"This is the path we must pursue."
"Many thanks, Commissioner Reding, especially for the fact that we shall now be able to go home before midnight."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for staying the course!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, on Monday I made a point of order about President Nicole Fontaine's reported comments in the British press regarding her recent visit with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II."
"A British Labour Member of this House, Mr Miller, repeated what were purported to be the Queen's remarks, not once but three times, on Monday, on Tuesday and on Wednesday."
"He sought to drag the Queen into a political controversy and to use her name to score cheap political points."
"Mr President, it may be that President Fontaine was unfamiliar with the British rules of protocol which obtain in such matters, but Mr Miller has no such excuse."
"He knows perfectly well that ours is a non-political Head of State."
"He knows perfectly well that for nearly fifty years she has scrupulously avoided engaging in controversial political issues."
"He knows perfectly well that she cannot come to this House to set the record straight."
"His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal."
"Mr President, I am proud to be British but today I am ashamed to share my nationality with that man."
"Has he no shame?"
"Has he no respect?"
"Has he no decency or honour at all?"
"Mr President, well, how can I respond to such an attack as that?"
"When I raised the point on Monday, and on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, I asked Mr Helmer for his comments on the euro."
"So far, he has refused to comment."
"Can I also say that when Mrs Fontaine spoke to Her Majesty the Queen and obviously put certain questions to her the Queen, in her response, was representing her government, which is a Labour Government."
"That might not suit Mr Helmer, but I am sorry to say that is the way it goes."
"Can I also say yes, I am Scottish, yes, I am British, but, Mr Helmer, I am European as well and proud to be."
"Mr President, I wish to use this point of order to speak in my capacity as chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico."
"As you will be aware, elections were held in Mexico last Sunday."
"Yesterday the delegation which I chair met and discussed a report drawn up by our fellow Members who had been to Mexico to act as observers at these elections on behalf of this Parliament."
"The first point was to recognise and welcome the dignified and civic-minded conduct of our Mexican friends during these elections. Secondly, we welcomed the election of Mr Fox and expressed our hope that relations between the European Union and Mexico would continue to make progress under the general agreement approved and ratified in March."
"Mr President, I would ask you to see if the President of this Parliament could forward our resolution, the complete text of which you will receive today, to the Mexican authorities."
"Very well, Mr Seguro."
"I will certainly inform President Fontaine."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw your attention to something really annoying in connection with the Minutes."
"The ""Texts Adopted"" also form part of the Minutes."
"I pointed out yesterday during the vote on the directive to combat money laundering the English translation of Article 6(3) needs to be corrected to bring it in line with Amendment No 26, because the English translation is wrong."
"In the middle of the second paragraph of the English version there is only a reference to representation in legal proceedings, but no reference to legal consultants, as there is in the German text."
"That is a key point in this directive and since the Council working group is working on the basis of the English text it is quite crucial to correct this text."
"I had already complained about this in committee vis à vis the language services."
"At the time the committee decided not to table an amendment because the German text is the original version, as drafted by the rapporteur."
"I complained about this yesterday - the situation was not remedied - and today is the third time I am complaining about it!"
"I do think the services of this House should work more carefully on such key questions and it really is intolerable that despite my criticism yesterday the Minutes have got the text wrong again!"
"I would ask you get to the bottom of this matter, to sort out this most important aspect of the directive and to please correct this in the English translation!"
"Certainly, Mr Lehne."
"You gave ample clarification of the matter yesterday. We will certainly ensure that the necessary correction is made."
"Mr President, yesterday we received a communication on yellow paper from the vice-president, with some nuts attached to it."
"This note was about supporting the export of products from Vanuatu, a developing country in the Pacific."
"I think that is a very good idea and quite right."
"And I am quite happy to support it."
"But what rather puzzles me is that in it the vice-president quite explicitly stated that it is illegal to import these nuts into the European Union."
"So I must ask this vice-president to explain how these nuts came to be illegally imported, since it was he who delivered them to us!"
"That in itself is a contradiction so would he please clarify the matter."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Welcome"
"Committee on Petitions - European Ombudsman"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports, tabled on behalf of the Committee on Petitions:"
"(A5-0162/2000) by Mrs Lambert, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 1999-2000;"
"(A5-0181/2000) by Mrs Thors, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 1999."
"Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to address the European Parliament concerning the results of my work as European Ombudsman in the year 1999."
"The Annual Report for 1999 covers the last year of the first mandate of the European Ombudsman."
"Last year the Ombudsman's office received 1,577 new complaints compared to 1,372 in 1998, an increase of nearly 15%."
"The number of inquiries opened rose from 171 in 1998 to 206 in 1999, an increase of over 20%."
"As well as becoming better known, the European Ombudsman is also attracting a higher proportion of serious complaints which require full investigation."
"You may be interested to know that the same trend has continued to the present year."
"During the first six months of this year, the number of new inquiries rose by 32% over the same period in 1999."
"Inquiries are the most resource-intensive aspect of the Ombudsman's work."
"It is therefore a great challenge to deal with this increase, whilst maintaining the quality of our work and meeting our target of closing most inquiries within one year."
"I do hope that the European Parliament will support the Ombudsman in seeking the resources needed to carry out the work effectively."
"During 1999, we continued to receive a quite high proportion of complaints, over 70%, which lay outside the mandate of the European Ombudsman."
"The proportion of the complaints outside the mandate even increased slightly, probably because we received a growing number of complaints by e-mail."
"We gladly accept complaints by e-mail and many of them contain well - presented allegations of maladministration."
"However in all, more of the e-mail complaints are directed against authorities of Member States."
"During the campaign for the election of a European Ombudsman last year, some critical voices suggested that the Ombudsman's mandate should be broadened to include complaints against Member States in cases where a question of European Union law is involved."
"I am not sure whether they understood that this would mean the European Ombudsman carrying out tasks currently belonging to the European Commission as the guardian of the Treaty, and to the European Parliament as the democratic forum to which citizens may address petitions."
"We study carefully all the complaints we receive, especially if they involve rights under European Union law."
"In 1999, we managed to advise the complainant, or transfer the complaint to a competent body, in about half of the cases."
"Of these, we transferred 71 cases to the European Parliament to be dealt with as petitions and advised a further 142 complainants of their rights to petition the European Parliament."
"In many cases, complaints against national, regional or local authorities could be dealt with effectively by an Ombudsman in the Member States concerned."
"In every Member State there should be a non-judicial body which can assist European citizens in conflicts with Member States' administration concerning their rights under European Union law."
"As a believer in subsidiarity, I remain convinced that the most effective way to achieve this result is through the development of a network of cooperation with these Ombudsmen as similar bodies such as petitions committees."
"We organised jointly with the French Ombudsman, Mr Stasi, a seminar for national Ombudsmen and similar bodies."
"In Paris in September 1999, Mr Perry, the first vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions, represented the European Parliament."
"A further seminar is planned to take place in Brussels under the Belgian presidency of the Council in the year 2001 in cooperation with the Commission and with Belgium federal and regional ombudsmen."
"The regional Ombudsmen and similar bodies were invited to a meeting in Florence last year in which Mr Gemelli, the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, also attended."
"The regional Ombudsmen and similar bodies will also be invited to Brussels next year."
"The Ombudsmen and similar bodies in the Member States have shown a positive attitude towards cooperation with the European Ombudsman."
"I strongly believe that cooperation with them on equal terms will achieve the best results for European citizens."
"At the beginning, great doubts were expressed as to whether the European Ombudsman had sufficient powers to achieve anything for the citizen."
"These doubts were unjustified because the Community's institutions and bodies have responded properly to the Ombudsman's work."
"Since the beginning, they have themselves settled the complaint to the satisfaction of the complainant in over 180 cases."
"For example, they have replied to unanswered letters, made payments that are due and reversed previous unfavourable decisions."
"This indicates a spirit of responsiveness and flexibility superior to those national administrations of which I have experience."
"Sixty-two of these settlements occurred last year, reducing the scope for friendly solutions to be proposed by the Ombudsman."
"However, we did achieve one friendly solution in 1999 in a case where the Commission and the Council agreed that the complainant should be paid the amount due him for his work as a European Union regional coordinator monitoring the Palestinian elections."
"If the institution or body concerned will not correct the maladministration itself, the Ombudsman's ultimate weapon is to draft a recommendation followed, if necessary, by a special report to European Parliament."
"Five years ago, there were many people who said that the Community institutions and bodies did not pay much heed to European Parliament."
"Even if they might have been right then, things have clearly changed since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the fall of the Santer Commission."
"In 1999 we made ten draft recommendations."
"In seven cases the institution concerned has accepted a draft recommendation."
"In two cases the Ombudsman has made a special report to the European Parliament."
"One case remains ongoing, since Europol needs more time to comply with the draft recommendation that it should approve some public access to documents."
"I believe that the European Ombudsman's activities have reached the level that one has the right to expect of a body which is new and consists of 25 persons working in a fairly complex legal environment."
"We are achieving results for European citizens, and this is what matters above all."
"I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the Community institutions and bodies for another year of constructive cooperation."
"I would especially like to address the Commission and its responsible Member, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, and thank her for continuing her predecessor's commitment to an honest and constructive attitude towards cooperation with the Ombudsman."
"I would also like to express my warm appreciation for the helpful and cooperative attitude towards the Ombudsman's office shown by the Committee on Petitions and especially its vice-chairman, Mr Gemelli, and also thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Petitions Mrs Thors, for her important work on her comprehensive report."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, the report that I am presenting this morning is effectively a dual report which reflects the work of the committee itself and the work of the office of Parliament's Mediator for Transnationally Abducted Children, Mrs Banotti."
"I should also like to express my personal appreciation of the work of Mr Söderman, the Ombudsman."
"I should also like to thank the secretariat of the committee not least for the statistical break-down which is provided there which, I must confess, is not my own work."
"I would urge Members who are not familiar with the Committee on Petitions to read these reports."
"It might well be of use to them in providing a service for the people they represent."
"I would also draw their attention to the website mentioned, set up under the Europe Direct initiative, which could provide useful information and possibly avoid the need for a petition or indeed confirm it as an appropriate vehicle."
"There is a growing need for such information as people become more aware of the importance and relevance of the European Union level."
"The aim of the Committee on Petitions itself is to provide a good and effective service for individuals within the European Union and for civil society generally."
"Any individual, citizen, resident or group may petition Parliament if they feel that Community law or principles are not being properly applied at whatever level."
"Last year we received 958 petitions of which 492 were considered admissible."
"I will mention just two of them to demonstrate the range of the topics and the potential effectiveness of the mechanism."
"We had one British petitioner who succeeded in getting her years of teaching experience recognised by the French authorities, presumably affecting her salary and promotion prospects."
"In another case a petition from a Spanish citizen, acting for an environmental association resulted in infringement proceedings being brought against the Spanish authorities in relation to the Habitats Directive, a frequent cause of complaint - the directive, not the authorities - with lasting national effect."
"It is such cases which provide valuable feedback to the European Parliament and the other institutions as to how our legislation works to the benefit of the individuals and society, or not, as the case may be."
"We could not do our work effectively on this committee without the support of numerous Commission officials who investigate cases and instigate proceedings where necessary."
"I wish to express our thanks."
"We know we could provide a more rapid and effective service if Member States could provide an equally committed response in replying to requests for information and explanation."
"In one case we are currently dealing with it has taken 14 months to get a reply to a letter."
"That is not unusual."
"That is why we are recommending that the Council or relevant permanent representation should also be represented at our meetings so that they develop a greater understanding of the problems citizens face and respond effectively."
"I would draw the Council's attention to points 8 and 10 of the report - if it was here."
"The aim of the committee is to improve the overall quality of our feedback mechanisms."
"Some of our ideas are mentioned in this report."
"Others will appear in a further report in September from Mr Perry and Mrs Keßler."
"We are proposing, as we did last year, a database mechanism so that petitioners and Members can track the progress of reports and see where the problems lie."
"We trust that the relevant authorities will bear this in mind this year and act on the proposal."
"There are various points concerning our relations with other committees."
"We would ask them to call on the Committee on Petitions more often to express an opinion on certain areas where concern has arisen."
"We would like to be involved in preparing joint reports on areas of particular concern such as the environment, social security, consumer protection and so on."
"We would also wish to use the experience of our committee members through their work on other committees of Parliament to institute a rapporteur-style system for specific topics."
"We are also keen to establish links with petitions committees in other Member States, with a view to exchanging good ideas and understanding."
"We consider as a committee that petitions are a valuable and empowering tool for democracy in what can often feel like a remote and anonymous institution."
"We need to value this mechanism and use the experience of the people we represent, as expressed through their petitions to improve our work as a whole."
"I commend the report to the House."
"Mr President, Commissioner and Mr Söderman, the rapporteur' s and the committee' s understanding of the Ombudsman' s report for 1999 - the year characterised by crises within the EU institutions and by an immense distrust of the administration - is that the citizens will only view European integration as legitimate if they have rights that mean they can actively participate in a political dialogue with the institutions."
"The political dialogue is not, however, a real dialogue if the citizens do not have the right to receive information and to have access to the documents that they ask for and if the opinions they express are not paid attention to, discussed or taken seriously."
"What has all this got to do with the Ombudsman' s task?"
"The Ombudsman' s task is, of course, according to the Treaty, to investigate cases of maladministration within the Community institutions and within the public bodies."
"At the request of the European Parliament, the Ombudsman gave a definition of the term ""maladministration"" in the annual report for 1997."
"These cases occur when a public body fails to act in accordance with a rule or principle that is binding upon it."
"During the Ombudsman' s last period of office, the institutions agreed to apply this definition, and it is now, and will be in the future, the basis for the Ombudsman' s activity."
"In the report, the committee stresses that this jointly approved definition of ""maladministration"" also involves the right to inspect how the institutions have interpreted Community law."
"Irrespective of the legal form the Charter of Fundamental Rights will take, it will, in any case, be an expression of the Member States' common constitutional traditions which, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty, shall be respected by the Union and therefore also by the institutions and public bodies."
"The committee observes, therefore, that the Ombudsman ought to play an important part in implementing a future charter of citizens' rights."
"The committee has also expressed its clear support for the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights ought to contain rules which give citizens the right to expect good administration within the EU."
"""Good administration"" is the opposite of ""maladministration"" ."
"The right to good administration, both with respect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour which Parliament and the Ombudsman have sought, should at least contain: the right to have one' s case heard, the right to inspect documents, the right to prompt answers from the administration and the right to receive replies supported by reasons."
"All these aspects have been central to the Ombudsman' s work."
"These rights are prerequisites for the active citizenship that is necessary if the EU is to regain the confidence of its citizens."
"It is these rights that make citizenship active instead of passive."
"Good administration can create conditions for active citizenship, whereas maladministration can undermine these conditions."
"What are the most common complaints to the Ombudsman and into which categories do they fall?"
"Incomplete or refused information, delays that could have been avoided, discrimination, lack of the right to defence."
"Citizens want to see good administration."
"They want to be active citizens."
"These conclusions can be drawn from the ever increasing number of complaints to the Ombudsman and from the nature of these complaints."
"The Ombudsman has become renowned for his work for the wider public."
"This is something he should receive a lot of praise for."
"An investigation that he completed a few years ago resulted in most of the Community' s institutions and public bodies currently having legislation that allows the public to have access to documents."
"He has tirelessly continued the work for real transparency and for its no longer being possible for data secrecy and personal protection to be used to prevent the public' s scrutiny of the activities of the authorities."
"Step by step, the Ombudsman has developed his work, endeavoured to obtain better administration and gained the trust of the citizens."
"His cooperation with the national ombudsmen is also important, as will be his future cooperation with the corresponding bodies in the candidate countries."
"This is substantial work that Parliament has reason to support."
"It ought to do this by making sufficient financial resources available to the Ombudsman so that he can carry out the necessary investigations which the mandate requires."
"We should in the future also make sure that we support an Ombudsman who is independent in his decision making."
"I would like to address a big thank you to the Ombudsman and his office, as well as to the secretariat at the Committee on Petitions which, as we know, is currently working under difficult conditions."
"Mr President, the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions is a very special body."
"It receives complaints from citizens, as the two previous speakers rightly said, who believe their rights as EU citizens have been restricted."
"As draftsman of an opinion on the right of residence, I would like to make a few comments on the specific problems in this area."
"The free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through European integration."
"Since the Maastricht Treaty there is a general right of residence, provided the individual concerned has adequate means of subsistence and adequate health insurance protection."
"Freedom of movement and right of residence can be restricted only for reasons of law and order, security or health."
"Experience has shown the Committee on Petitions that in practice the right to freedom of movement comes up against a great many problems because: (a) Member State authorities are slow to transpose the rules of Community law, (b) problems arise with the recognition of diplomas and qualifications in the case of specific professions, (c) the rules on social security have not been standardised, e.g. complicated forms for the refund of medical costs."
"An analysis of Treaty infringement proceedings between 1996 and 1999 shows that in 97 cases there was a direct link between the petition and the Treaty infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"Unfortunately, the Council often ignores the communications from the Committee on Petitions about serious violations of Community law by Member State authorities."
"That reflects a negative attitude towards the European citizens' right of petition."
"In future the Council should devote the necessary attention to the rights of EU citizens."
"Mr President, the right to petition and to complain is not some recent invention."
"Even 2000 years ago petitioners could put their concerns before the Roman emperor."
"But this right was always in danger of being changed, restricted or abolished."
"Yesterday' s petitioners have become today' s responsible European citizens."
"No administration or institution is infallible."
"Many petitions point to a discrepancy between the legal provisions and European integration."
"So petitions are a gauge for the relations between the citizens and the legislator and there are many levels of petitions."
"A population of hamsters in an industrial area is of just as much concern to us as the ban on silicon implants or the introduction of a heavy goods tax."
"I turn now to the Ombudsman."
"My group congratulates the Ombudsman on the work he accomplished in 1999."
"It was, and is, to Mr Söderman' s credit that he has done so much to create greater transparency and openness within the European administrations."
"Since most of the complaints in the Ombudsman' s remit relate to the European Commission and concern a lack of transparency, work needs to be done to improve this situation."
"That includes access to documents, not only for the citizens of Europe but also for the Ombudsman."
"New office technologies cannot be used as grounds for the lack of transparency either."
"Comprehensible, substantiated replies to the citizens create trust, the opposite gives rise to distrust and a rising number of complaints that need to be dealt with, which therefore in turn creates costs."
"The Ombudsman' s proposal for a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour is particularly welcome."
"The citizens have a basic right to an open and responsible administration geared to providing services, since after all it is paid for out of their taxes."
"In my view it is most important for the European Ombudsman to play an independent role, which can serve as an example for the introduction of national ombudsmen in the candidate countries and in my Land of Thüringen."
"Mr President, Mr Söderman, we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and myself personally, are proud that our Ombudsman is courageous, enterprising and able to act."
"It is extremely important that we have someone with such integrity who has dared to stand up for openness and transparency and against the culture of underhandedness, secrecy and, unfortunately in certain cases, of cheating and corruption, which also exists in the European institutions."
"Only an open and public administration can win support among those who are working here amongst the politicians and among the citizens whom we represent."
"The line the Ombudsman is pursuing has a lot of support amongst the citizens of all Member States."
"It is an indisputable fact, and there are several international scientific reports to prove it, that there is a crystal-clear connection between a high level of openness and transparency in the administration and a low level of corruption."
"The opposite is also true: a closed and secretive administration tends to foster a higher level of corruption."
"That is, of course, also true in the European institutions."
"That is why it is so important for us to have a completely independent ombudsman who can act independently and without being subject to any lobbying whatsoever or to interested parties attempting to influence him."
"The increasing proportion of complaints coming from citizens also points to the need for our Ombudsman, who really acts in the interests of the citizens."
"The only criticism that can be directed at the Ombudsman is probably that, unfortunately, the institution is still far too little known in many Member States and that far too few citizens are aware of this right."
"This is probably something which I would like to see concentrated on in the future."
"To summarise, the Ombudsman fulfils a very important function."
"I would like to congratulate him on the work he has carried out during the year and wish him luck in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Söderman, it may be well to remember that just a year and a half ago there was a debate in this Chamber over whether we needed a Committee on Petitions in general."
"I am very pleased to be able to say that the Committee on Petitions has again shown its indispensability, especially at a time like this, when we wish to enhance the status of the ordinary citizen in the European Union."
"I genuinely hope that the Commission on Petitions succeeds in establishing good levels of co-operation with the other committees in the coming year."
"I believe that we will be able to draft joint reports on the most important problem areas."
"With regard to the Ombudsman, he has truly established his position and independence."
"The growing number of grievances is an indication that the public have found him, and we members of the European Parliament have often been able to guide people in his direction to have their problems solved."
"Public access to documents is an issue that will occupy us in the future, and we have already had some valuable advice on the matter from the Ombudsman."
"Mr President, in one minute one cannot say much, so I am going to take this opportunity to summarise."
"Firstly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for taking up all our proposals in the debate."
"There are therefore not even any amendments."
"Secondly, I wish to say that at this stage nobody doubts that the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman make an extremely important contribution to compliance with Community law."
"We see this every day in the Committee on Petitions."
"Like Mrs Hautala, I am therefore very happy that the Committee on Petitions has survived the attempts to remove it, since, as well as demanding compliance with Community law, it is the committee which is closest to the citizens."
"It is the committee which makes the institutions most visible to the citizens."
"The greatest problem is probably the long procedure which follows a complaint by a citizen."
"The citizen has to study Community law in order to present a petition, and then any response is delayed month after month."
"The most important petitions deal with social and environmental issues, which are the matters of most concern."
"On some occasions, Mr President - and I will end here - when a complaint involves the eviction of a citizen or the destruction of a natural area, the response arrives when it is too late to deal with the matter."
"The speeding up of the process is therefore an important issue which has been taken up by Mrs Lambert."
"Mr President, the Radical Members of the Bonino List will support the two reports, and they value and support the work of the Ombudsman."
"However, we would like to ask the Ombudsman a very specific question regarding the fact that it is still not possible for complaints to be signed electronically."
"In our opinion, this issue is relevant to all the institutions, having a bearing on Parliament's own work as well."
"However, in particular, precisely because the Ombudsman wishes there to be as much focus as possible on his work, we feel that the possibility for the Ombudsman to attach an electronic signature could be the first step towards introducing the use of this vehicle within the institutions."
"I would just like to comment on an important statement which has not received due attention."
"Seventy-seven per cent of complaints received concern the Commission."
"The Ombudsman has told us that the Commission has made no progress this year in the area of transparency. Transparency is an effective weapon against fraud and corruption."
"In particular, on 7 December last, President Prodi undertook to find and propose legal and organisational solutions to give both internal and external candidates to Commission competitions access to their examination papers."
"Would the Ombudsman please inform us, in the same way that he has informed us that Europol needs more time to comply with the recommendation, whether the commitment made by President Prodi on 7 December to making papers available by 1 July 2000 has already been implemented or not."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I gather from the Ombudsman' s Annual Report that, as we have now heard, the main complaint of the citizens is about lack of transparency."
"But it appears that not everyone concerned is aware of this problem."
"The Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation on public access to documents which you, Mr Söderman, rightly criticised in public as not going far enough."
"Indeed there has been quite a lot written on the subject."
"The spirit underlying this proposal can be gauged from the statement by the Advisory Committee of Independent Experts."
"According to the experts' second report, like all political institutions the Commission needs room to consider, to formulate policy before it becomes public, because policy that is made directly before the public eye is often bad policy."
"As a representative of the European public, I find this approach to questions of transparency and of policy-making in general unacceptable."
"So I firmly support Mr Södermann' s justified criticism!"
"Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations and thanks to the Ombudsman for the report which he has presented this year and also to Mrs Thors and Mrs Lambert for their reports to the Parliament."
"All these reports, particularly that of the Ombudsman, show the very reliable, dependable work that has been done over the year."
"The European citizens undoubtedly need somebody to whom they can turn if they have problems with the administration and in Mr Söderman I know that we have an Ombudsman upon whom we can depend."
"I saw that at first hand when I attended the seminar in Paris."
"It was very good to see the respect in which the European Ombudsman is held by his colleagues, the national ombudsmen."
"On this side of the House we certainly believe the Ombudsman should have all the powers that he needs to discharge his responsibilities."
"On access to documents, we happen to think that the views of the Constitutional Affairs Committee are important, but that should not be taken to mean that we have any doubts at all about the principle that the Ombudsman must have access to documents."
"In that he has our full support."
"It is surprising that last year the Petitions Committee was at some risk and the report by Mrs Lambert shows the very good work that has been down by the Petitions Committee."
"With our chairman Mr Gemelli we are now looking at ways of making the Petitions Committee more effective and more efficient in the work it does on behalf of citizens."
"One of the important things that we will be bringing forward to the Parliament is a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"It is important that citizens and the officials of the institutions know what is reasonable behaviour so that all have a standard to which they can refer."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for the support we have received in the Petitions Committee."
"That has been very good and very effective through the year."
"I hope under the French Presidency we will get the same support from the Council but that unfortunately has been lacking in the past."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their interesting comments."
"With its ever widening circle of activities, covering a broad range of citizens' interests, the European Union is turning into a modern Leviathan, complete with the inevitable high-handedness which accompanies every administrative mechanism; from certain points of view, it is becoming even more dangerous than the equivalent national government services."
"That is because control mechanisms have not kept pace with the increase in activities."
"There are three ways of blocking the dangers which result from this extensive administrative mechanism in the European Union."
"The first is to have more direct and more frequent involvement by European Parliament in controlling the individual activities of the institutions of the European Union."
"The proposal by the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, that the Commission include a section on reports and complaints in the annual report on Community law and the proposed organisational agreement making it easier for complaints to be examined quickly need to be followed up here."
"If the tenet of these proposals is extrapolated, the suggestion is that the European Parliament should, in the future, devote more time to these matters, which are equally important if it is to enhance its status and its right to aspire to codecision with the Council."
"In more general terms, it is time to see parliamentary control exercised on a different footing."
"The second way is to introduce the European Charter of Fundamental Rights as a binding charter guaranteeing European citizens immediate rights, both adjectival and substantive, which protect their interests fairly and which convert to the right to compensation in the event that their interests are attacked."
"The increasingly likely prospect of a Charter which amounts to no more than a declaration will obviously damage the credibility of the European Union which, while abundantly eloquent on the importance of transparency in the operation of its institutions as a basic policy objective and accessibility to European citizens as a basic factor in achieving it, shies from recognising the rudimentary mechanism needed in order to achieve these objectives."
"The third way is to strengthen and improve the role of the ombudsman, mainly by giving him easier access to all the documents needed in order to conduct an efficient investigation."
"At the same time, the wealth of material in his report should be closely studied and taken as the starting point for the changes which need to be made to the modus operandi of the Community institutions."
"I wish the ombudsman courage and good luck for the future."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, the two rapporteurs, Mrs Lambert and Mrs Thors, all the members of the Committee on Petitions and the Secretariat."
"We started from the premise that the purpose of the institutions is to serve the citizens and that, therefore, any breach of the citizens' rights will lead to a loss of confidence in the institutions."
"We are currently required to create a complex, comprehensive, harmonious, functional legal framework, and we must therefore also create judicial mechanisms such as the Charter on Rights, a body of law establishing criminal, civil and administrative law, the agreement procedures for the mutual recognition of judgments passed by Member States, Europol and the sectoral agreements, the establishment of the European Fraud Investigation Office as a tool for investigating abuse of the law, the likely institution of the office of European Public Prosecutor which should be the investigating office of the Court of Justice, the separation of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates, and the separation of criminal, civil and administrative responsibilities: all these are instruments which advance the progress of the European Union."
"Yesterday's framework agreement is a milestone in this sense."
"Finally, we would like to request that, in a similar way to Parliament in the codecision procedure, the Committee on Petitions may be permitted to present its own justification for certain decisions, and we call for amendment of the Treaties in order to streamline the entire legal system and existing legislation."
"Mr President, Mr Söderman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their hard, thorough and excellent work."
"The Ombudsman controls power and solves disputes between those who hold power and those over whom power is exercised, and last year there were almost two thousand such cases."
"I would like to state seven principles."
"The bigger a union is, the greater the need for transparency."
"The newer it is the greater this need is, and the more complex it is, the greater the need for better transparency."
"The more oriented it is towards the information society, the more open it has to be, and the more civilised it is the more public it must be."
"The more multi-cultural it is the greater the transparency, and the more democratic it is the more open it likewise is."
"We are used to reading instructions for use with all equipment, down to how to use the whisk in the kitchen."
"The principles of good administration, which have been worthily established by the Ombudsman, are our citizens' instructions for use with regard to Eurobureaucracy."
"And, goodness me, these instructions certainly are necessary!"
"There is no democracy without good administration, and that is why the Union Charter must contain the principles of good administration."
"I would like to make one more important point."
"Public access to documents in the information society and the principles concerning them must be upgraded in line with the new technology; in other words, a grievance must be able to be made over the Internet and precedents and associated documents must be available in real time."
"My suggestion is that we need an Ombudsman' s portal on the Net."
"Thank you for your work!"
"Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would particularly like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mrs Lambert, on her excellent report and I thank the European Commission for its valuable assistance in handling the petitions we receive."
"Petitions are a recognised right of European citizens and residents of the European Union, enabling them to take advantage of the rights given to them by the Treaties."
"Few citizens, however, are aware that they may submit a petition."
"The files that we handle, moreover, show a lack of understanding of the rights conferred by European citizenship."
"This, unfortunately, results in 50% of petitions being inadmissible."
"Admissible petitions usually raise problems with freedom of movement, setting up businesses, social benefits, recognition of diplomas and qualifications and taxation."
"Furthermore, we are receiving more and more collective petitions concerning subjects relating to the environment, and with the extension of the competence of the European Union, it is conceivable that the number of such petitions and the number of areas handled will increase."
"In order to respond to citizens' expectations, adequate coordination between the Committee on Petitions, the European institutions and national authorities is essential."
"Greater account must also be taken by the other parliamentary committees of the work carried out by our committee."
"The chronic absence of the Council from our committee meetings is detrimental to the correct handling of petitions."
"Indeed, the national authorities are the first to apply Community law and it is indispensable for them to work in coordination with the European institutions, and in particular Parliament and the Commission."
"We are currently waiting too long for responses from the national authorities, sometimes even several years."
"We are fully aware of the extent of this task and the difficulties to be overcome."
"First of all, it cannot be denied that this committee is not very well known, although its work is indispensable in strengthening the link between citizens and the European Union."
"Furthermore, the structures and means of this committee must be strengthened in order to make it more effective, and a closer relationship with the petitions committees of the national authorities would be desirable."
"Finally, one of the strong points of the French Presidency' s programme is a Europe that is closer to the citizens."
"The work of our committee falls within this sphere and it is up to us to make this expectation a reality."
"Mr President, I want to welcome Mr Söderman this morning and to congratulate Mrs Lambert and Mrs Thors for their reports."
"The reality of our society is that if governments and administrations had their way they would never appoint Petitions Committees or Ombudsmen."
"By nature they tend to be secretive."
"They are only there because the citizens and their public representatives demand them and defend them when they are there."
"Therefore, it is important that we continue to demand that the Ombudsman's office and the Petitions Committee of Parliament are adequately resourced."
"One way of choking off the effectiveness of the Ombudsman's office and the Petitions Committee is to deny them adequate resources."
"In Parliament it is disgraceful that the Petitions Committee, the single most important direct contact that the citizen has with this institution and with the other institutions of the European Union, is treated the way it is treated."
"It does not have adequate secretarial assistance."
"It is treated abominably in relation to translations, which are down at the bottom of the list."
"It is simply not good enough."
"I would appeal to the Commission and to the Council if they were here - they ignore the Petitions Committee, as well as ignoring Parliament - to give the resources that are necessary for these bodies to do their job."
"The Petitions Committee in particular is an important mechanism of access for the people of Europe."
"It is important that we ensure that it can do its work effectively."
"The two most important issues that come before the Petitions Committee are the recognition of people's qualifications to work in other Member States and the environmental impact of construction development."
"In particular, people are concerned that environment impact studies, which are required under EU law, are treated as having no more worth than the paper they are written on."
"They are either ignored or they do not address the real issues."
"Mr President, I would personally like to congratulate Jacob Söderman on the good work he has done, which resulted in his re-election on 27 October last year."
"At the same time, I would like to praise the Ombudsman for a model annual report which is easy-to-read and, at the same time, comprehensive."
"It can be seen from the report that it is the Commission that is the subject of the majority of the investigations that have been undertaken, 77 percent to be precise."
"It should certainly be emphasised that this is mainly due to the fact that the Commission is the institution that makes the most decisions directly affecting citizens."
"In the report on individual complaints, it emerges, however, that there is insufficient transparency."
"Insufficient and inadequate information was also the most common cause of complaint."
"Openness is important if citizens are to be able to have more opportunity to influence how the EU operates and if tendencies to corruption, cheating and fraud are to be checked."
"I would like to highlight the fact that this report emphasises that all EU institutions and bodies must establish a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"There is a risk, however, which is also evident from the Ombudsman' s annual report, that the significance of such a code would vary considerably from one institution or body to another."
"The PR side of the Ombudsman' s activities has already been brought up by other speakers and can never be underestimated."
"I would like to close with some questions: What would be the consequences of a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the Ombudsman' s work?"
"Are there sufficient resources for the work to be carried out well?"
"What are the main reasons for the institutions' shortcomings in relation to the citizens?"
"Is there a lack of will, are the resources insufficient or is there unreasonable bureaucracy which is preventing and delaying the handling of this issue?"
"Mr President, on the basis of the Ombudsman' s report and that of Mrs Thors, we may say that the institution of the Ombudsman is well established."
"The Committee acknowledges the work done by Jacob Söderman, and the public too have discovered the Ombudsman."
"The basic pillars of the work of the Ombudsman are independence and transparency."
"It is just as pertinent to emphasise the importance of good administration for the public and for the authority of the EU in the eyes of our citizens."
"It is good that the committee supports the Ombudsman in his efforts to create regulations for good administration."
"The principle of good administration must also be included in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights which is being drafted."
"From the report it appears that only around 30% of the complaints to the Ombudsman fall within his sphere of responsibility."
"For that reason there has to be closer cooperation between the Ombudsman and national and regional ombudsmen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to participate in this debate today, together with Mr Söderman, the Ombudsman, whose work in the service of the citizens of the Union is very important. The Commission takes a very positive view of this work."
"I wish to say that the Commission believes that the citizen should always be the focus of our concerns."
"The citizen is ultimately the beneficiary of our activities and is our raison d' être."
"In this respect, both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman play a key role, on different levels and with different purposes, but they are both nevertheless essential to the improvement of the operation of the institutions."
"The Committee on Petitions deals with the specific concerns of the citizens and, in this respect, as has been pointed out by Mrs Lambert - who I warmly congratulate on her report - the petitions presented to Parliament illustrate the problems of the citizens in relation to European administrations and also, in many cases, national administrations, at the same time highlighting the legislative vacuums which exist on both European and national levels."
"The Ombudsman, as indicated by Mrs Thors - whom I also warmly congratulate on her report - deals with complaints against institutions and bodies of the European Union with regard to the deficiencies of its administrations."
"He urges us to improve the management and quality of services by indicating the weak points to us, the points which need improvement and greater attention."
"However, nobody wants a more effective and transparent administration as much as we do. It is we who are responsible for this administration and to this end any criticisms of our defects are welcome."
"We can only confront our defects if we know what they are."
"I must insist that this is why we give such importance to the work of both the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions; so that the institutions may work properly."
"With regard to Mrs Lambert' s report, I would like to deal with two specific issues."
"One of them, relating to cooperation between institutions, is essential to the improvement of the operation of the Committee on Petitions and its capacity for action."
"In this regard, I would like to express my satisfaction because the report highlights the constructive role of the Commission in the examination of petitions and because it considers it to be satisfactory on the whole."
"It awards us a sort of 'pass' , and I thank you, but we will try to improve."
"We see this is as a stimulus to make a greater effort, to work better and cooperate more."
"Secondly, it proposes a review of the examination procedures of the Committee on Petitions."
"It seems to me a great idea to rearrange the examination of petitions by themes, to give specialised rapporteurs the task of examining these petitions with greater care, and, where necessary, to draw conclusions which will allow the deficiencies to be corrected, take decisions to resolve possible vacuums in legislative texts, or counteract the unwanted effects of these texts."
"Furthermore, the Commission is prepared to consider a review of the interinstitutional agreement on the processing of petitions which would amend the one currently in force, from 1989, with Parliament and the Council, especially with regard to something that seems to me to be essential, which has been pointed out by some of the speakers, that is, the problem of the periods prescribed for reply."
"It is true that we sometimes take a long time to reply."
"It is not always the Commission' s fault."
"There are times when we are relying on responses from national administrations, but it is true that in this respect we have to make an effort to improve and make an even more satisfactory contribution to the work of this committee."
"I would like to highlight the importance of cooperation with other administrations."
"We wish to improve this cooperation as far as possible."
"The Commission is open to dialogue, both with Parliament, and with the Council itself, in order to reduce the time taken to produce replies and increase transparency and communication with Parliament and the Committee on Petitions."
"With regard to the Thors report, I wish to say that we agree with the need to consolidate the independence of the Ombudsman as an institution and support his work towards transparency and openness."
"Clearly, we consider that the principle which motivates decisions affecting the citizens is essential and we try to apply it in a systematic way."
"We also accept the definition of maladministration as being when a public body does not act in accordance with a rule or principle which is binding upon it."
"Nevertheless, I wish to say that, as Mr Söderman has pointed out very well, the Ombudsman is a non-judicial body, and in that sense, it can in no way substitute judicial bodies."
"Its tasks are different from those of law courts."
"I believe that it is very important, in the relations between the Commission, the Ombudsman and other institutions and bodies, to systematically respect the institutional balance laid down in the Treaties."
"It is true that the increasing reality of the institution of the Ombudsman, which in some ways is a younger institution than some of the other European institutions, requires some time to mature so that the citizens may become aware of it."
"The Ombudsman, in his report, has indicated that the number of complaints, investigations and inquiries over the last year have increased considerably, and this is simply the result of greater awareness of the institution on the part of the citizens."
"We also need time for the relations between the Ombudsman and the other institutions to mature in order to establish the desired balances and resolve the obvious tensions which may occur until things are working properly."
"However, I must say that, so far, the cooperation between the Commission and the institution of the Ombudsman, represented, of course, by Mr Söderman, has been wonderful."
"I would like very briefly to point out that these institutions are important because any action by an administration may at some time display a lack of transparency, a lack of efficiency, a violation of basic rights or even corruption."
"However, I wish to say that in no way can we portray the Community administration as particularly laden with defects."
"If we compare it with other administrations, I believe that it compares very favourably and that we score highly in these areas."
"Ladies and gentlemen, finally, I would like once again to congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, on the work which he is doing, on the significant increase in his actions and his work, on his cooperation, although he sometimes makes criticisms, but that is his job and his role, and we in the Commission understand that."
"The drawing up of a code of conduct applicable to the relations between Community officials and the citizens is a priority, and work is being done in that area by Mr Kinnock and the Commission in general."
"With regard to the amendments of the Statute of the Ombudsman, the competent parliamentary committee must issue an opinion in accordance with Article 195 of the Treaty, and when Parliament takes the initiative, we will analyse all the relevant issues."
"I would like once again to congratulate the two rapporteurs, and of course congratulate and thank Mr Söderman for the magnificent work which he is carrying out with independence and rigour."
"Mr President, I am grateful to you for giving me the floor to answer questions."
"Mr Turco asked about the right to complain by e-mail."
"This has been possible with the European Ombudsman's office for some years now, since Mr Dell'Alba made us recognise that this would be important."
"At the moment about 20% of the complaints we receive are by e-mail."
"If you look at our website you will find a form which can be sent directly by e-mail."
"Mr Paasilinna said the website could be developed in that direction."
"We already have direct access to all national or regional ombudsman websites, but this could be further developed."
"Mr Raschhofer spoke about the draft regulation on public access to documents, which has been debated."
"I should like to stress that this draft regulation is now before Parliament."
"The committee work can start."
"In the discussions I have had with Mr Prodi he told me that he is ready to consider favourably all well-founded proposals to improve this regulation."
"This is now before Parliament."
"Mr Malmström mentioned ignorance about the Ombudsman's office in some Member States."
"Our difficulty has been that, if we make too much propaganda about ourselves, we get too many complaints falling outside our mandate."
"So we try to find those citizens who have a problem with the administration and might have reason to complain."
"Members of Parliament are a very important source of information for many citizens."
"I would be very glad if you would take part in the work of making the opportunities for submitting petitions and complaints better known to the citizens."
"Thank you kindly, Mr Söderman."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Single European sky"
"The next item is the report (A5-0141/2000) by Mr Atkins, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the creation of the single European sky [COM(1999) 614 - C5-0085/2000 - 2000/2053(COS)]."
"Mr President, we meet at a time when congestion in our skies has never been greater."
"According to the statistics, the incidence of a 15-minute delay has risen from 12.7% in 1991 to 30.3% in 1999 and is still rising."
"We are worried not only about the effects that congestion has in terms of inconvenience and the implications for the economic stability of our Union, but we are also concerned first and foremost about threats to safety that may result from it."
"It is a fact that there is a shortage of air traffic controllers."
"It is a fact that there has been a lack of investment in air traffic control systems."
"The demand for air transport is rising almost daily because of cheap fares, the desire of people to travel abroad on holiday and on business or even to be able to take a few days' break at the drop of a hat has added to this pressure."
"Whilst this pressure has been growing, we owe it to those working in the system to congratulate them and thank them for what they have done."
"Unfortunately - and this is not entirely their fault - they are not coping with the pressures as well as we would wish: we have all had experience of that only recently, as a result of the delays caused by the strike in France."
"All this, then, has a detrimental effect upon the mobility of our citizens, and in terms of the economic and financial and social costs for our businesses and a wide variety of other people affected on a day-to-day basis by what is going on."
"I would like to congratulate Commissioner Palacio for having the initiative to bring this to our committee in the terms that she did, and with the force and verve that she has shown, initially, in setting up the high level group, and also in the leadership that she has given to addressing this problem."
"What has been produced by the Commission is a major contribution to dealing with the saturation of airspace."
"The Council of Transport Ministers needs to take a political decision to address this."
"We cannot put it off any longer."
"It needs attention now."
"We need a single sky over a single market but at the same time we have to recognise that individual nation states have views about how these matters should be addressed, particularly insofar as they affect the livelihoods of the workforce and also the use of national airspace for military purposes."
"Military airspace and its abuse in some countries is something that we also have to address not just in terms of the space that is taken up by military aircraft, but also on occasions the abuse of the civil air corridors by military aircraft not abiding by civil air procedures."
"This too is an area which need to be addressed."
"In this report I have proposed - and the committee has broadly accepted - a suggestion that Eurocontrol should be a regulatory body with more powers, more effective sanctions and with the right of appeal for those who are affected by it."
"By the same token, we think that the provision of air traffic services should be open to liberalisation, subject to what each individual country decides is appropriate for itself."
"As Members may well know, in the United Kingdom we have addressed the subject by introducing a principle of privatisation."
"That may be right for us."
"It may be wrong for others."
"It is up to individual nation states to decide, but they must decide to address this problem of the division between regulation of their airspace on the one hand and the air service management provision that could be offered by others or other organisations."
"We do believe that there should be objective and independent criteria on how the system is managed, with incentives offered for the achievers and penalties offered for those who do not meet the desired levels."
"We think that passengers should be compensated for unjust delays and that their rights in these cases should be clear and well known."
"But above all we wish Commissioner Palacio, with our support, to press the Council of Ministers and all those associated with this to take urgent decisions."
"If there is one across-the-board criticism of the report from the industry, it is that perhaps it does not go far or fast enough."
"This cannot last any longer."
"We must address this issue now."
"Mr President, I would like, if I may, to deliver very briefly a few comments on this report."
"It seems obvious that we need to completely rethink the organisation of air traffic control in the European sky."
"In this respect, the Commission' s initiative is commendable."
"A re-think is one thing, it is also obvious that everything must be carefully reviewed, but I think we should beware of a certain number of preconceived ideas found in reports, communications and speeches on this topic."
"It also seems obvious that the political division of the European sky no longer corresponds to the technical requirements and market requirements."
"I was extremely surprised to learn that in today' s Europe, political boundaries still prevail when it comes to the organisation of air traffic control."
"A European air traffic control space must be created, but must this area be completely unified, and according to which criteria?"
"I have many doubts as to the conclusions of the report."
"It seems obvious to me that there are a number of advantages to dividing up air traffic control, as air traffic control involves segmenting the territory and technical security limits, but also human limitations mean that each air traffic controller, each control tower can only have a limited territory and a limited number of flights to monitor."
"In this respect, the cellular, segmented organisation of the European territory must be retained and, in a way, improved."
"I am therefore in favour of an increase in the number of air traffic control centres as, not the unification of the whole control system, but the unification of the legal system and also technological unification takes place, as this report, and the research behind the report, have highlighted the absence of European will..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to give very warm thanks to my colleague Robert Atkins for drafting such an excellent report."
"He took great trouble not just to comment on the Commission' s proposals but also to outline them."
"I regard the broad line of separating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one."
"Indeed in paragraphs 4 and 5 we note again that our Parliament has now decided on two occasions that the regulatory function is to be transferred to the European Union."
"That brings me back to the last speaker."
"Of course we have to distinguish between possibly having several or many service providers in the operational field, but the regulatory function must remain with, or more to the point go to the European Union."
"Nor is that in any way a problem."
"Today we have 15 Member States in the European Union, and 12 more have applied to join."
"If we start to proceed according to the EEA system even at this point - defining the common rules and then asking the candidate states their opinion - we can integrate them."
"That is why I also think it is a good idea in the present situation for the European Commission to pool Member States' interests in regard to the regulatory function in the framework of Eurocontrol."
"We do not need multilingualism, we need unanimity on the question of the regulatory function."
"I really would strongly urge the Commissioner to refer the proposals Parliament will be deciding on today back to the High Level Group and to continue ensuring that this working group produces very sound practical results."
"We have great respect for the vice-president, for she set up this group of military and civilian experts and the work is progressing well."
"There may still be some resistance in individual countries."
"We wish the vice-president much luck and success, so that come October we can submit an excellent programme."
"Mr President, can I first of all, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists, welcome the Commissioner's initiative."
"We share her objectives, we support her aims."
"However, we do perhaps regret the lack of integration with other initiatives that she is pursuing, which is apparent if one reads her communication."
"We also note the lack of political will that exists within both the Commission and the Council, although it is worth perhaps reminding ourselves that this initiative started with the Council in June last year when it requested the Commissioner to bring forward this communication."
"Indeed in March of this year, the Council in Lisbon sought further progress, progress which I am sure we would all endorse."
"The Party of European Socialists also supports and indeed welcomes the rapporteur's carefully judged position."
"It is subsidiarity in action: European where necessary, national where possible."
"I would like to thank him personally for taking on board many of our concerns, not least in the area of safety, which I acknowledge is now the number one priority for him in his report."
"The key concerns of the PSE include a regret at the lack of analysis of the real cause of air traffic delays."
"Airports' runway capacity, airline planning, passenger behaviour, airport infrastructure, as well as the shortage of controllers which was mentioned by the rapporteurs."
"A second concern of ours is this key principle, which we support and which needs to be developed further, namely the separation of regulation from service providers."
"That has to be a key building block of our new approach."
"Eurocontrol too must be reformed and revamped and relaunched."
"The third principle we support is liberalisation but not privatisation; and fourth and finally we want to see these proposals developed in conjunction with the proposed European Aviation Safety Authority."
"Indeed, above all, safety first should be our guiding rule, and I am sure it will be our guiding principle in the months to come."
"Between 1986 and 1996 air traffic in Europe doubled."
"It will double again in the coming ten years."
"We need to tackle this issue urgently and swiftly but in a coherent way."
"What we want to hear perhaps from the Commissioner today is a clear timetable from her as to the speed at which she will be acting in the months to come."
"We all know there will be people waiting in airport lounges this summer asking, why their plane is delayed, not for minutes but for hours."
"Hopefully the Commissioner today can bring forward a timetable for when those delays will cease."
"I look forward to her comments, particularly bringing this Parliament up to date on the conclusions last week of the Council which received the interim report of the high level group."
"I urge colleagues to back the rapporteur's proposal and I urge the Commissioner to bring forward a very clear timetable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Sir Robert Atkins has, in my view, compiled a sound report."
"He clearly indicated the direction we need to take, because we find ourselves in an absurd situation where we have a unified market for aviation but over and above that, we have an airspace, which has been divided up in an illogical manner."
"A number of MEPs have already described the effects of that."
"It is obvious that, if we want a single sky, we need to make investments, as the report clearly states."
"Thousands of people need to be recruited and investments made in technical infrastructure."
"As such, it is clear that money has to be earmarked for this."
"It also means, and I believe that this aspect is more complex, that political decisions need to be taken very quickly. And in reality, these can only go in one direction."
"We need to tackle the issue at European level."
"We are all agreed that Member States need to finally decide for themselves what they want do."
"National airline services also need to realise that their time is up, that we need to lift services to European level rather than national, as this is the root of the evil, if I can put it that way."
"Needless to say, services need to come first, because air-traffic control does not exist in isolation. It is a service to airline companies and its customers."
"People sometimes overlook this aspect and only focus on their own patch."
"If we talk about services within a unified market, this means, of course, that monopolies are then a thing of the past, that we need clear European legislation and that we must move away from monopolies in the service industry. We are all agreed on this, and I therefore hope that we can make good progress."
"An important point, as Mr Watts has already pointed out, is safety."
"Nobody should compromise on safety."
"As such, Commissioner, what matters more than anything is that once the high-level group has published its findings in October, we need to receive proposals from yourself as quickly as possible."
"I do not think that this will cause any problems for you. Then, everyone will need to put pressure on the Council of Ministers, Member States will need to take decisions that need to be taken and take the course which we have indicated a few times in the European Parliament and which is once again highlighted in Sir Robert Atkins' report."
"Mr President, the report deals with the problem of increasing air traffic."
"I want to focus on just one aspect of this report or, more specifically, on a major omission from it."
"A number of proposals are put forward but for me the problem with this report is its main thesis that congestion can just be solved with the liberalisation of the air traffic management and control system."
"What the options are doing is focusing on technical fixes, not the underlying trends."
"Certainly a single European sky would increase the efficiency with which European air space is used."
"Improvements in air traffic management would make more space available."
"Restricting the use of military air space would also make a significant difference."
"But none of these technical fixes are going to make a long-term impact unless we address the underlying problem, which is the unsustainable growth of air traffic."
"By failing to link the issue of congestion with air traffic reduction the report misses out on a vital strategy."
"It can be compared to rearranging buckets under the tap to stop a flood without considering the possibility of at least turning down the tap a little to reduce the flow of water."
"Consider the facts."
"The Commission's recent report has already said the growth of the aviation sector is unsustainable and must be reversed and that growth is forecast to double in the next 15 years."
"That causes major congestion problems but it also causes major environmental problems as well - not only the noise and pollution for people living around the airports but also the impact on global climate."
"Air transport is already the world's fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and could account for up to 15% by the year 2050."
"Unfortunately this report fails to make the vital link between congestion and air traffic reduction and therefore misses a vital opportunity to address these problems in a lasting manner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think there is some ambiguity regarding the expression ""single European sky"" , because air traffic control is in fact, as you are well aware, already a European field of activity."
"There is already a European system for controlling the air space with Eurocontrol and there is already a body, the Central Flow Management Unit, based in Brussels."
"This is not perfect, of course, but they do already exist."
"The situation must therefore be improved starting with the statement, which is patently obvious, that delays have increased and that with traffic on the rise, they will become worse."
"It is recognised that there are many causes of delays but, in the end, I find that we are facing an offensive presenting air traffic control as the only reason for delays."
"I believe it would be sensible also to concentrate far more on the problems of types of plane, types of flow, stopovers and of course the continuing defence-related problems."
"I feel as if we are involved in a headlong pursuit to implement solutions that seem obvious, but that do not take account of the specificity of air traffic control."
"Mr Zimeray said this earlier: yes, a plane journey is divided into different areas and the denser the traffic, the more divisions there are."
"Why? Because dividing things into different areas is the human way of controlling or managing a number of aircraft."
"Therefore, in my opinion, thinking that there would be too many control centres is nonsense."
"Why not say in that case that there are too many aircraft?"
"In addition, as far as I know, there are no specific air traffic control hold-ups at borders either."
"The great proposal that is put to us for improving traffic consists of separating regulatory and control functions."
"But what is the value of such a measure?"
"It may well be necessary to consider more relevant divisions, why not?"
"But that is not what is being proposed."
"The separation of functions would lead to the liberalisation of air traffic service provision, establishing, as indeed the Atkins report states, a liberalised internal market."
"Air traffic control is not an airline, nor is it a market sector."
"Let it not be forgotten that its main function is to ensure safety."
"I believe, however, that it is contrary to the interests of safety to subject aircraft control and monitoring bodies to market pressure."
"The ability to invest in new technological tools and training must therefore be safeguarded."
"In France - and I am not trying to make France a model - there is a general directorate that governs everything and, in the past few years, investments have been made and air traffic controllers have been recruited."
"The system is highly effective."
"On what grounds would you want to break..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, this report takes as its starting point an observation which is familiar to all Members of the European Parliament, as frequent users of aircraft as a means of transport: the skies are becoming more and more congested as a result of the growing demand for this form of transport."
"This surfeit of aircraft inevitably goes hand in hand with delays in air traffic, causing frustration for passengers, for companies, for business and for tourism."
"We share the rapporteur' s opinion that air transport must be seen as a coherent system of operators, airports and air traffic control services, the component parts of which are directly interlinked and that only a study of this system as a whole will solve the problems of airspace capacity."
"We therefore welcome the creation of the High Level Working Group, comprising both civilian and military representatives and chaired by Commissioner de Palacio, who has committed herself to studying the issue of flight delays with a view to minimising the problems they cause. She will in due course be submitting a report on this issue to the Council."
"Our hope is that this final report will focus on drawing up viable proposals and practical, realistic and effective solutions to the problem of air traffic delays in Europe. We also hope that this report will abandon controversial suggestions that contribute very little to achieving this, such as advocating unrestricted competition between providers of air traffic management services."
"We fail to see the connection between this so-called liberalisation and the issue of delays, which must be resolved as a matter of urgency."
"Furthermore, any proposed solutions must respect the national sovereignty of the Member States and restrict the centralisation of regulatory action to absolutely essential matters. Any proposed solutions must also safeguard the particular requirements of defence and the specific military needs of each country and honour the commitments that all countries have made in the framework of international organisations."
"This does not mean that those countries are not obliged to make air traffic in high air space as flexible as possible and to seek more efficient ways of linking this with military operational needs."
"The European air management programme, whose purpose is to achieve complete coordination and integration of ATM systems at European level, must also continue to be expanded under Eurocontrol. The programme must be continued, because the problem lies not so much in the way air space is divided up, which could perhaps be justified in terms of ensuring that there is an appropriate number of aircraft and routes for each controller, as in the technical harmonisation of ATM systems."
"Mr President, this is a valuable report: it deals with a very sensitive and, I would say, extremely technical issue, although the problem is essentially political."
"There has been talk of the fact that there are too many aircraft in the sky, that one controller has too many aircraft to deal with, etc., but we need only look at the United States of America, which is the most advanced country in the world in terms of aeronautics, where these problems are dealt with and, although they may not be completely resolved, adequate solutions have been found."
"One basic fact stands out in particular: the United States only operates one central air traffic control system while in Europe there are still 15 separate control systems."
"We also have to take Switzerland into account as well as the border countries."
"All these factors are difficulties which we will have to overcome."
"It is therefore right to call for a single air traffic control system, at least for the whole of the European Union, which clearly needs to include Switzerland for technical reasons."
"This is the basic point and it will enable us to resolve a number of difficulties as well as promote technical development, and here I am referring to the TCAS, GPS and GNNS systems, which clearly facilitate a more even flow of air traffic."
"I would like to finish by expressing some doubts regarding the application of the principle of subsidiarity: it is a fundamental principle but one which is not always easy to apply."
"Along with shipping regulations, air transport and air traffic regulations could genuinely be described as the most international rules in existence, and it is therefore difficult to break the matter down into different areas of responsibility."
"One last thing: I see that the report principally targets the large air carriers and airlines."
"Let us not disregard other air space users such as air-taxis, private companies and private users flying club aircraft."
"Mr President, Commissioner, securing a place in the transport market is an uphill struggle."
"This is certainly true if the competition is fierce, the pressure is on, there are worldwide cooperatives and external cost items are considerable."
"This is the situation which the aviation sector currently faces."
"We need to consider the future of the sector for the reasons set out above."
"In my opinion, we should not accept unlimited growth as a fait accompli."
"It is true that certain freight cannot be transported in a way other than by air, but the vast majority of freight can."
"We should tailor our policy accordingly."
"This, however, requires long-term efforts and specific, effective investments in alternatives."
"We are not that far advanced yet."
"Indeed, the development of the Trans-European Networks has been a mixed success."
"We now need to look for alternative solutions in the short-term."
"In my view, what matters most is using the available space in the most effective way, both in terms of airspace and aircraft, which requires both personnel and organisational measures, as pointed out by the rapporteur."
"By creating one single European sky, we will provisionally have enough airspace to allow us to come up with structural measures to impede the unbridled growth of aviation, based on the current state of affairs."
"After all, this is what needs to be done if we want to realise the ambitions of a sustainable transport policy."
"It is important not only to facilitate, but also to restrict where necessary."
"Although the rapporteur' s initiatives are sound, it is early days and we should not rest on our laurels."
"We should keep thinking about the future of the transport sector and aviation, in particular."
"Mr Atkins' report addresses an issue which is perhaps the most important issue which either Mrs de Palacio or we in the European Parliament will have to deal with over the next four or five years and I must start by congratulating Mr Atkins on his approach in this specific report."
"Despite which, there is clearly a huge problem here."
"Overall delays in flights have risen from 12.7% in 1991 to 30% in 1999."
"By 2010, the number of flights will have more or less doubled, resulting in wasted time, financial loss, saturation and, hence, safety risks."
"Eurocontrol has proven to be inadequate as a mechanism for managing air traffic."
"It is therefore absolutely essential that Vice-President de Palacio take decisive action, as she has done so far, in order to establish a real single European sky."
"The Member States must overcome their perhaps justified anxiety as regards the management of their airspace and, at some point, must take a longer-term view of newly-emerging needs which goes beyond their borders and beyond the present situation."
"We need to take immediate action and to regulate the myriad technical details, such as relations between civil and military aviation."
"In the meantime, however, passengers must be compensated for delays by airlines and must, of course, be apprised of their rights."
"I should like to close my intervention by reminding the House that, when the European Parliament voted on the report for the Intergovernmental Conference, it took view that the regulatory operation of air traffic in Europe, in our Member States, should be taken over by the European Union."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Atkins for his report and also for his willingness to cooperate and work with not only my group but other groups in coming up with this document."
"There is no doubt that air traffic control delays are a problem."
"A visit to any of the major airports at this time of year will make that obvious."
"I hear that the average delay is said to be 20 minutes."
"All I can say from my experience is that somebody must be picking on Manchester very badly because I have not yet flown with Sabena from Brussels to Manchester when we have ever got anywhere near a 20-minute delay."
"I can safely say that the timetable now is just a mere guide, not a definitive object, when planning travel."
"It is a clear problem that we need to address."
"The report must consider all the issues involving air traffic and adopt a twofold approach as proposed by the Commission."
"But not all delays are due to air traffic controls."
"It is the greatest cop-out in the world for airlines to say to passengers that the delay is caused by air traffic."
"There is never anybody from the air traffic controllers in the airport to turn around and say that is not true."
"Frankly, a lot of the delays are caused by the inefficiencies of some of the airlines themselves."
"Passengers go missing."
"It never ceases to amaze me the number of passengers that go missing in airports!"
"What do these people get up to, I ask myself?"
"Invariably they cause delays as much as air traffic."
"The issue of Eurocontrol is important."
"We support the compromise that is made in point 8 with regard to Eurocontrol."
"We also support the need for the military to give up some of their air space."
"Finally, there are some TDI amendments with this."
"I am particularly interested in Amendment No 24."
"I can only assume that the TDI group must..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"Experiences from last Monday reconfirm that this is a very important report indeed."
"Many Members of Parliament had a journey here to Strasbourg of up to fifteen hours."
"Flights were cancelled, and many were severely delayed."
"This situation is absolutely intolerable. Airspace is badly congested, flights are continually late and the rights of air passengers are totally non-existent."
"The report proposes relevant action that must be put into effect right away."
"However, I do not believe that it will be sufficient, as air traffic is expected to double over the next ten years."
"Short flight routes must be withdrawn in favour of rail, leaving room for longer flights, as there are simply no alternatives to these."
"Reports aimed at improving the competitiveness of rail transport are, from this point of view, very important."
"Environmental levies, which are being planned for air traffic, should not constrict long flights unfairly, but should work as an incentive to withdraw short flights in favour of rail."
"Mr President, Commissioner, with globalisation we have discovered with pleasure that, above all, aeroplanes can take us from our own city to any corner of the world, and we have enjoyed this so much that we can no longer live without flying."
"However, just as we discovered the congestion of our cities by motor vehicle, it is now airspace which is becoming clogged too frequently."
"We regularly suffer delays, we lose our luggage and we have suffered all kinds of work-to-rule or trade union strikes."
"We passengers believe that we must establish and defend our rights and manage our airlines, airports, flight timetables and air traffic control better."
"However, we often also think that we have to share the sovereignty of the air more amongst all the Europeans and that there is a large section of the airspace with is reserved which we do not take social advantage of in the way that our times demand."
"Therefore, as well as reforming Eurocontrol, increasing the number of radio communication frequencies and implementing new and better technologies for tracking so that more air corridors and more planes can be fitted in, in these days of normality it is necessary for civil commercial aviation to be able to use the reserved spaces, especially in the highest quotas and highest altitudes, which do not usually have too much military use."
"The citizens demand it and I believe that it is possible to find a solution which is perfectly valid for all, sharing - I insist - sovereignty and the reserved space used by military aircraft."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like the rapporteur and the previous speaker I think we urgently need to take the appropriate measures to tackle and eventually put a stop to the constant increase in delays in European air traffic."
"The discussion in committee and again here in plenary today keeps centring on the best ways and means of changing air traffic management."
"Sir Robert Atkins, for whose expertise I have enormous regard, and a majority in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism believe the prime way to achieve this objective is through liberalisation measures."
"Liberalisation will without doubt increase the number of providers, but it will not resolve certain problems and will even create new ones."
"Firstly, so long as the Member States give precedence to their justified national interests over the general European interest in regard to the coordination and use of European airspace, we will see no radical changes."
"Secondly, that is another reason for Eurocontrol' s poor efficiency. No matter whether the regulatory and control bodies are separated or not, whether you liberalise or privatise, so long as there is no political will to accept that European airspace issues can only be approached on a pan-European basis, another ten reports will not help either!"
"Thirdly, priority must be given to the civil use of airspace."
"In a peaceful and united Europe there is not one logical reason for reserving a large part of airspace for the military."
"Fourthly, do you not agree that if we make a kind of fetish out of liberalisation, it is highly likely that there will be fewer and fewer service providers for less lucrative routes and that there cannot be fair competition unless we lay down binding, uniform, social and security standards?"
"Fifthly, we do not need the Commission to use its influence on national governments in the event of domestic industrial disputes, as called for in paragraph 14 of the report; we need a smoothly running social dialogue between all the players involved in air traffic!"
"Mr President, Mr Atkins' report raises a number of real problems in the development of the air travel system in Europe."
"First of all, the matter of safety."
"The strikes that sometimes disrupt traffic take thousands of passengers hostage without proper warning."
"Increasing numbers of intolerable delays are not, as has already been stated, solely due to overcrowding in the sky, but to also the airlines' attempt, for reasons of cost-effectiveness, to rotate their planes with excessively short, unreasonable and ultimately impossible turnarounds."
"The report, however, omits to bring up one fundamental issue: the issue of traffic rights."
"At the present time, it is extremely difficult for a European company with a line serving, for example, Paris, Houston and San Francisco, to board passengers in California, as this is legally considered as cabotage, whereas an American company serving New York, Madrid or Paris, may board passengers in Spain for disembarkation in Europe."
"It is in the international negotiation of traffic rights that this concept of European air space..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, it has been noted that air transport is increasingly accessible to a greater number of our fellow citizens."
"This democratisation is admittedly welcome, but raises important questions for the future: increased traffic, overcrowded airports, congested skies and lack of respect for the environment, in particular in terms of noise pollution."
"The desire to create optimum air traffic control in Europe is based on good intentions, but why should the Commission challenge the air policies of the Member States and their bilateral agreements through a single air space?"
"Of course, I agree, on the one hand, with the goal of rationalising the movement of aircraft and, on the other hand, with the goal of aiming for improved traffic flow, while fully respecting consumer protection and passenger safety."
"I would like to believe Mrs Palacio when she assures us that, and I quote, there is ""no reference to creating competition between air traffic control services or their privatisation in the works of the Commission"" ."
"But in that case, the staff concerned would have no justifiable need of trade unions?"
"The Commission is demanding the advent of a proper air traffic management authority, a strong regulatory authority."
"I say no."
"No to a complete overhaul of Eurocontrol."
"No to a new regulatory structure - after all, the current system effectively organises, particularly with regard to safety, a balanced flow of traffic while respecting the national systems which all states are entitled to."
"No to the Commission representing the Member States with regard to external States, thereby destroying any political decision-making power in the field of air transport."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, both the Commission' s communication and the rapporteur' s report, which is magnificent, are in line with the European Council of Lisbon, which asked the Commission for a series of specific proposals as soon as possible."
"It is now for the Council to take the necessary and urgent political decisions which will allow the single aviation market to be supplemented with a single air traffic control system."
"The growth in demand currently stands at between 5% and 7% and it seems that it will follow the same trend over the next few years. This makes it even more difficult for the European air management systems to do their work, since they have shown themselves to be incapable of dealing with this development and they are the cause of 50% of delays, although it is true that there are other causes, such as the limitations of the airports and flight schedules which do not take account of the limitations of the infrastructures."
"Another cause which makes the current system ineffective is the different organisation of the civil system and the military system, as well as the different standards of technical equipment on the ground."
"The airspace must be accessible under the same conditions for general, commercial and military aviation, which does not mean that we should not give priority, or indeed exclusive access, to the military in the event of crises."
"However, the mere fact that a crisis may occur does not mean that certain Member States can justify maintaining the conditions which prevailed during the cold war."
"It is necessary for the civil and military controllers in the control centres to work in close cooperation."
"There is a clear need to achieve more effective cooperation between the different users of the airspace, and I believe that that cooperation and a joint approach should be sought at European level."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and the Vice-President of the Commission for the opinions they share on an issue which is so important and so sensitive in the daily lives of our citizens."
"Mr Atkins' report is detailed and balanced, and it presents the current and correct position of this House."
"Lastly, Madam Vice-President, please take note that we are aware of your efforts and we will support you in the line you have taken."
"Mr President, I must express major reservations with regard to the Atkins report as it bears the stamp of commercial interests concealed behind the best of intentions."
"In actual fact, the airlines would like the air traffic control sector to be completely liberalised, not so much for reasons of safety, interoperability or reducing delays as to be able to access a market of air traffic control services that would enable the more powerful among them to purchase more expensive, secure slots and leave the problem of delays to other airlines and private aviation."
"Under cover of a single sky, such liberalisation would actually offer us a multispeed sky."
"I have no other way of explaining the witch hunt undertaken in this report with regard to civil air traffic control alone."
"We all know that this only represents 30% of delays, which admittedly are worth combating, but which essentially depend on military constraints."
"This is a political problem that depends first and foremost on politicians."
"We all know that the considerable increase in air traffic is the main underlying cause of overcrowded and saturated skies."
"We all know that the number of runways and landing platforms would have to be reduced in order to have any chance of a break, a simple break in the saturation."
"Finally, in my country, the airlines have chosen to set up shuttles that send a dozen low-capacity aircraft from each provincial French town every morning between 6.00 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. to Paris alone."
"Is it the fault of air traffic control if they refuse to allow all these flights to land simultaneously in Paris?"
"These are the fundamental causes of air delays."
"Naturally, the single sky must be set up through a reformed Eurocontrol and harmonised control services at European level."
"However, personally I cannot imagine collective safety services that are dictated by profit alone, controlled by shareholders."
"In addition, I cannot imagine tomorrow' s single European sky becoming an sky shared unfairly between airlines."
"Commissioner, I hope that, in preparing the future directive on the single sky, the Commission will be able to handle this matter by taking a calmer and more impartial overall view."
"Mr President, I am acting as the representative of the air traffic controllers protesting against the European Commission proposal which, in the name of the attractive slogan ""single European sky"" , will clear the way for the privatisation of air traffic control."
"The Atkins report clears the way for the monopoly of private groups that have their eye on air traffic control which, with the increase in traffic, is likely to make money."
"This reports mentions delays, which are, apparently, increasingly frequent."
"But how would subjecting air traffic control to the requirements of private profit possibly put an end to delays?"
"It is precisely the airlines' quest for profit that has led them to make the choices that cause these delays."
"It is in the interests of passengers and their safety, and in the interests of employees in this sector for air traffic control to remain a public service, dedicated exclusively to ensuring the smooth running of air traffic."
"Competition and the quest for profit in an area as sensitive as air traffic control will inevitably lead to disaster."
"If it is necessary to put an end to national peculiarities with regard to air traffic management, and if it is legitimate to unify the European air space, this must be achieved by rejecting any idea of privatisation, competition, or quest for profitability, and we will vote against this report."
"Mr President, I really must congratulate my colleague, Sir Robert Atkins of the British Conservative Party, on his most excellent report on the Single European Sky."
"This proves beyond doubt that the overarching ambition of the European Union is a single nation with its single national flag, its single national anthem, its single legal space, its single national borders and now the citizens of Europe will soon be able to breath single European air."
"However, after the failure of the single land policy, known as the CAP, the single sea policy, known as the CFP, we can now look forward to a similar failure of the single sky policy."
"Not least, given the number of strikes in air traffic control, I suppose we can now look forward to the single European strike."
"But you have struck a real blow for the Eurosceptic movement in the UK, Sir Robert, I congratulate you."
"Mr President, It is quite true to say that air traffic delays need to be urgently addressed."
"However, it is also worth noting that 33% of ATM delays recorded between January and June 1999 were mostly due to temporary capacity reductions associated not least with the Kosovo crisis."
"The real problem lies in the sectors straddling areas north and south which include Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, parts of Germany, Maastricht upper-air space and these are responsible for 44% air traffic flow management delays and 30 bottlenecks."
"At one time, Greece was part of that problem."
"However, the impressive results by the Greeks goes to show that the improvements can be made if there is strong action and real cooperation by national governments."
"All too often Eurocontrol is used as the scapegoat and is blamed for the present situation, but the real blame must lie with the inaction of national governments in the areas that I have outlined."
"It is quite clear that the European Transport Council must take immediate action to ensure that the air traffic control decisions are applied by all Member States Europe-wide."
"It should be remembered that Eurocontrol is the only pan-European institution in the air traffic management domain and must be supported."
"Finally, one issue that was raised - the critical shortage of manpower to the tune of 1,000 air traffic controllers throughout Europe - needs to be urgently addressed by national governments."
"That in itself will go a long way to improving flow control."
"In addition, both airports and airlines need to look closely at their practices, as they too are responsible far too often for the high percentage of delays incurred."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by offering my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Atkins, for a powerful presentation, to the Commission for making this issue one of its priorities and to the Commissioner responsible, Mrs De Palacio, for daring to translate words into action."
"This has meant that the question of a single air traffic control has, in a short time, come closer to a solution perhaps than ever before."
"Of course, there still remains much to be done."
"In particular, a number of reluctant Member States need to be convinced, but that is precisely why it is so incredibly important for the European Parliament to give the Commission its full support today for the continuation of the work."
"We are, of course, in the middle of yet another chaotic summer for flights."
"The development we are now seeing will result in a doubling of air traffic in the years following 2010."
"This assumes that we have had the necessary political decisions."
"Otherwise we not only run the risk of congestion in the air leading in the future to 15, 30 or 60 minutes' delay, which we can perhaps put up with, but are also in danger of no longer being certain of ensuring safety."
"This is something we must never put up with."
"It is in this light that Mr Atkins' report and the Commission' s presentation must be seen."
"The EU has spent a considerable amount of time and energy on tearing down borders and creating a single market."
"Everyone who travels a mile up in the air - and we are there quite often - can nevertheless see that there are borders everywhere."
"The report lays down an extremely tight timetable."
"I share this ambition."
"Let us together ensure that the summer of 2000 is the last summer with chaos in the skies over Europe."
"The Commission can actually achieve this with the help of the Atkins report."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there has hardly ever been such a topical report as this one."
"Just in time before the summer break, when everyone goes on holiday and more and more people also travel by plane, today Parliament is considering questions of air traffic."
"A tiresome subject, as we all know, and as every air traveller finds out."
"We all suffer from delays that often last hours."
"It has now become a daily scene at airports to see every passage-way overcrowded with bored, irritable or even aggressive passengers."
"It happens to us MEPs very frequently, as it does to much of the population during the holidays."
"Let me remind you of another aspect."
"When aircraft cannot land on time, that not only creates a great many personal difficulties for people on business trips who have to keep to their schedules but also produces extra costs and environmental pollution."
"So I welcome the fact that the Commission has submitted a report on these important subjects and that a High Level Group was set up to consider the problems of establishing a single European sky."
"I hope we will have the final results of its inquiries before us in good time in the autumn so that we can then really move on to taking concrete measures jointly with the Commission."
"The safety aspect comes top of the list for all passengers, but especially for frequent fliers."
"Safety standards must on no account be endangered."
"That is why we need better airspace control and protection."
"Eurocontrol must satisfy all these safety requirements, but that means we also have to create the necessary framework conditions."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to warmly thank Mr Atkins for his effort and the serious and rigorous work which he has done over the last few months and which, as the rapporteur for the Industry Committee, Mr Zimeray, has pointed out, illustrates the fragmented situation of our air space both with regard to the existing administrative borders as well as technological fragmentation, which is due to the different systems which are applied in different countries."
"On this basis, we have to take account of a fact which is pointed out in the report: the increase in air traffic, the increase in delays."
"Of course, nobody knows better than the honourable Members what a problem this is."
"We must make it very clear that not all delays are due to the management of air traffic; almost half of all delays are due to air companies, airports and sometimes weather conditions."
"However, it is the case that 50%, or perhaps a little more, of delays are due to problems in the management of air traffic."
"I also wish to make it very clear that this does not mean it is the fault of controllers."
"It is not a problem involving the practices of people who carry out their work in conditions of great tension, difficulty and complexity, and who do everything possible to guarantee the highest possible level of safety."
"This is the main problem: how to guarantee the highest possible level of safety."
"I wish to make it very clear that this is not a problem with people, with the controllers, who, I insist, do wonderful work."
"I must say that it is truly impressive to see them at work because they are responsible for everybody' s lives, for the lives of anyone in a plane at any one time."
"As the 'Single European Sky' illustrates , I believe that what is failing is the management system, since it is in a fragmented situation, divided up by administrative barriers, by administrative borders - in a European Union which has been able create so many common elements - and because of the artificial divisions between sky for military use and sky for civil use which persist in many countries, even though we left the cold war behind some time ago. Furthermore, this does not reflect the countries' real defence needs."
"This is because the majority of defence flights take place in low altitude areas of the airspace and not in the high areas."
"Furthermore, these areas of airspace are used for very few hours of the day, not every day, and in many cases just a few times a year."
"What we need to do, ladies and gentlemen, is create a common airspace above a certain height, and manage it jointly - as one speaker said a moment ago - forgetting about borders in that high area of the airspace."
"We should stop talking about British, Spanish, French or Swedish airspace, and simply talk about European airspace in this high area, and leave the area below 29 500 feet, or 31 000 feet - we will have to specify which area - to national management because there are other types of problems there and its military use is more obvious."
"In any event, we must make the military and civil use of airspace more flexible, improve the efficiency of management and provide air traffic controllers, who are currently working in very complicated circumstances, with an easier environment which will allow them to do their work more effectively."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have asked me about timetables."
"In principle, the High Level Group, to which I am going to communicate Parliament' s conclusions at the next meeting on the 14th, will finish its work by October."
"Therefore, the resulting specific proposals will be presented during the subsequent months and we hope that the specific proposals will be under way by the next European Council in the Spring, under the Swedish Presidency."
"That is the timetable."
"The 'Single European Sky' initiative in no way implies the removal of Eurocontrol."
"On the contrary, Eurocontrol is absolutely essential; it is an essential element which must be strengthened and supplemented since, within the European Union, we can go much further than the scope of Eurocontrol."
"Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, we must think in terms of a strong European common regulator and we must forget - because, of course, it is not going to appear in the Commission' s communication or proposals - the controversy, which in my view is artificial, between privatisation and non-privatisation."
"Let us not get into this argument."
"That is not the aim of this initiative."
"Countries may deal with this within their own competences, but it is outside of this 'Single European Sky' initiative."
"This initiative will allow us to guarantee a strong European regulator."
"That is what we are dealing with; creating a common airspace which can be used flexibly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would thank all of you for your work, especially the rapporteur, Mr Atkins, and I would like to say that I hope that between us we will manage to improve the management of air traffic in one of the areas, which is not the only one, which leads to delays."
"We are also working to solve the problem of slots and other problems, but there is a time and a place for everything."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Health and safety of pregnant workers"
"The next item is the report (A5-0155/2000) by Mrs Damião, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the report from the Commission on the implementation of Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding."
"The legislative instrument that we are considering today in the evaluation report referred to us by the Commission has run its course as far as contractual rights and social security systems are concerned."
"Thousands of female workers in various countries in the Union have benefited from it, but it is now out of date."
"It is out of date because the 1952 ILO convention has just been revised and there is an expectation that most countries in the world will substantially improve their maternity protection."
"It was and still is, of course, hoped that the Union will continue to be in the vanguard in social terms, in this area as in others."
"But not everything is out of date, because in terms of organisation of work, there have been shortcomings in transposing the directive and even greater shortcomings in implementing it."
"In most countries, the three stages of job organisation are not being respected. These stages are: the employer should adjust the working conditions and/or hours of the worker to avoid exposure to risk; if that fails, the worker should be moved to another job; only if neither option is possible should the worker be granted leave, as this reduces the worker' s income and also her career opportunities."
"By way of example, I must tell you that in some countries, not even a minimum period of recuperation is allowed for the mother, which the experts say should be around 45 days for a normal birth for a woman working in a normal job."
"Nevertheless, there are countries that are not complying with these rules at all, on the pretext that they are guaranteeing women a choice."
"We think that women must be guaranteed the option of enjoying an appropriate period of maternity leave, which they can share with the father, but that the leave should be assessed and guaranteed according to the risk to her own health."
"Furthermore, this directive does not provide for a link between its own risk assessment provisions and other directives, particularly the framework directive on risk assessment and information for workers."
"Since there is no such link, employment of women is subject to unfair criticism because the costs of maternity-related risks apply exclusively to young women of childbearing age."
"These risks are being underestimated and should not be a matter for the employer or constitute an obligation on the employer only when the woman' s doctor informs the employer of her condition."
"Firstly, because this is too late: risks from radiation, chemically-charged atmospheres and poor working posture are well known now and all have harmful consequences for the health of the woman and her baby, particularly in the first few weeks."
"Secondly, these measures do nothing to protect the reproductive health of men and women. There is a considerable degree of infertility in the Union today: over 11% of European couples suffer from such problems, which result from lifestyles shaped by the economic structures within which we live, and also by the fact that measures are not in place to provide protection against these dangers."
"An example of this is the extreme temperatures that cause infertility in women and men. The Union, which is today in a position to do so, should draw up and implement legislation to this end."
"With regard to maternity leave, we are aware of the costs to economic activity of proposals to extend this leave."
"We also know that these costs are much higher when employing women, but health specialists recommend that a baby should remain at home for at least five months, protected from the outside world and, above all, growing up in a suitable psychological and emotional environment, which will provide it with the necessary balance for growing up with a sense of security, because it needs its parents."
"Parental leave should therefore be extended, and, if healthily divided between the parents, will benefit them both."
"The directive should also take the informal economy and atypical employment contracts into consideration."
"Finally, I hope that the Commission will tell us what it is intending to do in this area, now that it has an extended legal basis, which includes Article 13 and ex Article 118. This means that it can certainly cover other aspects mentioned in the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Damião has drafted a very good report and taken good account in it of my opinion for the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"It is most important to everyone to improve the health and safety protection at the workplace for women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, both to protect the woman and to protect the unborn child."
"This is a general social issue and must be treated with the greatest care."
"The Commission' s report on the 1992 directive is only concerned with the technical transposition of the directive and does not look at the situation at the workplace, which has to some extent changed, or at the changed role of women in society."
"The number of single parents has risen and women are more concerned with achieving economic independence."
"The Commission must submit a proposal for revision of the directive that takes account of all these changes, and it must do so as quickly as possible, this very year."
"There is a considerable need to improve the legislation."
"That applies to preventive health protection measures at the workplace for the mother and for the unborn child."
"Here we must avoid any risks."
"Any activity that puts their health at risk should without exception be prohibited."
"Periods allowed for breastfeeding should be regulated and there should be facilities for breastfeeding at the workplace."
"Maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks."
"There must be clear rules on financial support, both for the period of pregnancy leave and for maternity leave."
"The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified."
"None of these necessary provisions must lead to discrimination against women or to a reduction of their chances of access to the workplace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the implementation of Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992, which is one of the most important directives in the field of the technical and health protection of workers."
"I well remember its genesis and the problems that were discussed at the time."
"A positive aspect is that at that time, irrespective of the dispute about the legal basis, its importance to women workers in the single market was recognised and a first step was taken towards establishing minimum standards for the protection of pregnant workers and new mothers."
"The Commission report before us continues to show up weaknesses in the implementation of the directive, which means we must increase our efforts to establish the protection of women during a special period of their life in law and in practice."
"Really it is very sad for a society to find we have to pay much greater attention to this area in particular."
"So I support the call to revise the directive as soon as possible."
"However, we will not manage it by the end of the year 2000."
"Some of the demands that will have to be incorporated in a proposal for a revision of the directive are set out in the draft amendments before us, and the PPE Group can therefore support at least some of them."
"First and foremost, they include the call for a strict prohibition on dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave, safeguards to ensure that on expiry of their leave the women will be reinstated in their job or given a comparable one and effective penalties for those who infringe that prohibition."
"For women who want to or have to reconcile working life and motherhood, anything else would mean penalising or unjustifiably discriminating against them in their occupational and private life."
"Seen in these terms, the effective protection of pregnant workers and new mothers is one of the most important contributions to an active family policy."
"With a view to eastward enlargement and protection in those countries, let me also point out that the single market must not lead to discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her thorough, responsible and unreserved report."
"This is an extremely sensitive issue which is closely related to other matters which are regularly referred to such as the ageing population, the demographic trend, the low birth rate, the right to health, the right to work, the right to motherhood and the social value of motherhood."
"This matter cannot be viewed as affecting women alone: they must be protected and supported by society."
"The 1992 directive, whose implementation in the Member States we are assessing today, is intended precisely to introduce minimum measures to encourage the improvement of the health and safety of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding."
"The Commission's evaluation report shows that the directive has proved its utility in that it has been of some benefit in a number of Member States in certain areas of the issue, such as leave on grounds of health and safety, etc. However, apart from these points, which are of a general nature, we share the rapporteur's criticism of the Commission's report."
"This report was overdue and limited almost exclusively to dealing with legal and technical transposition."
"There is a lack of concrete statistics and data on vital aspects of the directive, such as the monitoring of workplace risk assessment for pregnant workers and the frequency of work-related accidents and illnesses, and satisfactory information is not provided on the coordination of legislative adaptation of specialist inspection, penalties or scientific research for the detection, prevention, elimination and recuperation of professional hazards relating to pregnancy."
"We feel that there has been a lack of serious monitoring on the part of the Commission."
"There has been a lack of coordination between the health and safety directorate and the equal opportunities unit, and the ambiguity of the directive itself in this area has become apparent."
"The delay in the production of an evaluation report - and I would remind you that, precisely because of the low minimum standards set, Italy was only persuaded to approve the directive on the condition that its implementation would be monitored very soon afterwards - should have led the Commission to put forward a proposal to revise the directive, particularly in relation to certain aspects referred to by the rapporteur: the length of maternity leave, the increase in the duration of maternity leave where risks are involved, a more precise definition of the concept of an adequate allowance, the prohibition of dismissal of women during pregnancy or maternity leave with effective penalties, the prohibition of any form of discrimination with regard to women's careers or the improvement of working conditions, the implementation of all the measures necessary to safeguard the health and safety of woman and unborn child, without prejudice to the woman's right to work or her career and encouraging breastfeeding through diverse measures."
"In addition to taking all the necessary compatibilities into consideration, when they revise the directive, the Commission and the Member States should be motivated by the principle of non-discrimination and the recognition of motherhood and fatherhood as fundamental rights which are essential for a balanced society."
"Mr President, it is important that women have good and secure conditions during pregnancy and childbirth so that mother and child have a good start, and it is important that pregnancy and childbirth do not reduce women' s opportunities in the labour market."
"We have a directive from 1992 which establishes minimum rights for maternity leave and women' s entitlements to financial compensation when they are absent from the labour market due to childbirth."
"The Commission has now investigated the Member States' implementation of this directive and, in her report, Mrs Damião quite correctly points out that the Commission' s report contains only a technical and factual assessment of the directive' s implementation and does not provide an evaluation of whether the directive in practice provides pregnant women or women who have just given birth with better conditions."
"She does not, therefore, think that the Commission' s report provides an adequate basis for carrying out a review of the directive."
"I very much agree with the rapporteur about this."
"I am, therefore, also opposed to our requesting a review of the directive now."
"I do not think we should demand a new draft directive which contains the right to a longer period of leave, together with demands for longer enforced leave, and which lays down more detailed requirements for financial compensation in a way that does not take the necessary account of the differences between the Member States' social systems."
"The existing rules make for great flexibility, and most countries guarantee women better conditions than the common regulations require."
"It might be wondered whether new regulations would mean very much in practice."
"In any case, maternity leave and financial aid ought to be given priority in the individual countries."
"However, I think it would be a good idea to obtain a better overview of what the circumstances are in the different countries so that governments can learn from each other' s good and bad experiences and inspire each other."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission is required to submit a directive proposal on measures for workers during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding by the end of 2000."
"The assessment of the existing measures, which was intended to lead to change, is four years behind schedule and fails to meet the requirements which the European Parliament prescribed at the time."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls for an increase in the level of protection."
"The report mainly focuses on institutional aspects."
"In our opinion, this report should also embrace the right to return back to work to the same or an equivalent job after maternity leave."
"We are asking for the rights of pregnant and breastfeeding women to be extended."
"In practice, women are often discriminated against during this period, despite rights on paper."
"This is why we call for a reversal of the burden of proof."
"Employers will need to demonstrate that any dismissal or change of job is not linked to pregnancy."
"Finally, we would like the Commission to explain why at the recent ILO conference, the Member States failed to adopt the common positions."
"How is it possible that the United Kingdom abstained from the final vote, which, in view of the procedure, is tantamount to voting against?"
"We would like to close by thanking Mrs Damião for the work she has carried out."
"Mr President, at a time when Europe, with the Beijing +5 Conference in New York, is emphasising its pioneering role in the implementation of the principle of equality between men and women, it seems equally important to guarantee their freedom."
"This freedom is achieved through a right to specific protection for women, a right that is always related to their bodies, in particular to maternity and, more specifically, pregnancy."
"We are therefore pleased with Mrs Damião' s excellent report, which highlights the urgent need to revise the 1992 directive."
"Her request for a formal ban on dismissal during pregnancy is essential, and I will dwell only on this point."
"It seems to me to be dangerous to allow employers any leeway in this field, as they will always use it to their advantage."
"Today, with the revision of Convention 103, the ILO is levelling down the protection of pregnant women, by accepting certain dismissals that are said to be unrelated to pregnancy."
"Europe, with Mrs Damião' s report and the revision of the directive, has a duty to be a political reference for women' s rights world-wide."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Damião on the magnificent job she has done on this report. We were happy to contribute to this in committee, not only by giving the report our total support, but also by adding some amendments that were accepted in the final version."
"We consider the approval of this report to be a significant event as we approach the summer recess, for four fundamental reasons."
"Firstly, we think it is unacceptable that women should suffer social prejudice or discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity issues;"
"Secondly, because we must more vigorously tackle risks to the health of mother and child associated with working conditions;"
"Thirdly, the idea of reconciling personal and professional lives, the family and work, in modern society is becoming increasingly important to those of us concerned about people' s day-to-day lives. This is precisely one of those key areas in which a responsible approach to reconciling these interests is called for;"
"Fourthly, because maternity policies must be consistent with family and childbirth policies generally, particularly at a time when the crisis resulting from Europe' s ageing population is increasingly drawing Member States' attention to this issue."
"We shall also be discussing some of the amendments and our position will be based on the balance that we feel has been struck in the report."
"Nevertheless, we will not support all of the amendments, because we feel that this balance is actually preferable to some of the steps suggested in the amendments."
"We shall support the amendments suggested by our British Conservative colleagues, such as Mr Bushill-Matthews, who drew our attention to the issue of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which we feel must be taken into account when legislation is adopted, whether at Community or national level."
"On the other hand, however, we hope that the British Conservatives will back the report, because although it is true that some of the Portuguese Presidency' s conclusions highlight this issue, I must emphasise that paragraph 36 of the final Feira Summit text stresses the importance of companies' sense of social responsibility."
"For us Portuguese Christian-Democrats and Conservatives, this is a very important idea. We believe that companies also have a certain social responsibility, which they should build upon."
"I would just like to add that we wish certain votes to be held separately, as a means of improving the report, some points in which strike us as rather obscure."
"We do not view pregnancy as a social resource and there is one other point on which we would like to see a separate vote in order to improve the report."
"Lastly, I would urge all Christian-Democrat Members to endorse this report by my Socialist colleague."
"Mr President, I wish at this point to express my disappointment at the Commission' s failure to adopt any position on the revision, assessment and notification of Directive 92/85 on maternity protection as yet."
"Nevertheless, although I wish to highlight the considerable harm that this omission has caused to mothers, every cloud has a silver lining, and this report, which has been brilliantly drafted by Mrs Damião, is proof of that such silver linings exist. This report will enable the European Parliament to move ahead now."
"The report clarifies concepts, harmonises legislation at Community level, establishes shared responsibilities, takes account of new risks in the way work is currently organised, looks for incentives to increase the population in an ageing Europe and considers pregnancy to be a natural condition for women, and one which should be respected and protected."
"It specifically notes the rights of women working independently or as teleworkers, and highlights the growing concern about single parents, who are becoming increasingly common in Europe."
"The aim of extending maternity leave to twenty weeks is an ambitious one, which is recommended from a technical point of view, and must gradually be implemented. We must therefore prepare ourselves for this in economic terms, by sharing out responsibilities through cooperation between states and employers' and workers' organisations."
"In order to achieve the aims that are being proposed, it is also crucial for us to encourage greater dialogue, collaboration and coordination between specialists in health, hygiene and safety at work, so that a more suitable working environment can be provided for pregnant women."
"The European Community must strive to gain the support of applicant countries to ensure that awareness is raised as rapidly as possible, so that the measures recommended in this report can be adopted, since there may be greater resistance in those countries, which could be difficult to overcome."
"Lastly, I wish to sound a warning about point 9 of this report, because measures for protecting new mothers, such as very long maternity leave, may have unwanted effects, as it may become disadvantageous for employers to employ women, and they may consequently prefer to take on men."
"The Commission must therefore create a system for detecting fraud and for applying harsh penalties to companies practising this kind of discrimination."
"Mr President, adopting a directive does not necessarily mean that reality is as we would wish it."
"We have a good example of this here."
"According to the Commission' s assessment, the situation regarding the health and safety of pregnant women looks fine, but that is certainly only on paper, for is that also the way it looks in reality?"
"I am not so sure."
"The pace in the labour market is more hectic than ever. Great efficiency is demanded, and women are supposed to work as if they were not pregnant, even if they are."
"It is stressful, and it is unhealthy both for the pregnant woman and the foetus."
"We know this, because investigations have proven this to be the case."
"The European Parliament and ourselves as representatives of the people are entitled to know whether the legislation we adopt also actually works in practice."
"I think we have an example here of the Commission' s doing all too little in this area."
"The message from Parliament to the Commission should therefore be that the work which has been done is not good enough."
"It needs to be re-done."
"We must know whether the legislation is working."
"The Commission' s purely legal analyses now already show that there is a need for further protection."
"I think there is a greater need to discover what suitable protection consists in, and there should be stricter rules governing dismissal during pregnancy."
"The Commission must go back to the drawing board, set to work again and table the necessary proposals."
"The European social model is characterised by the fact that we have a high level of protection."
"This should be an area - and this remark is aimed at the Liberal Group which has adopted a very different view - in which the EU should have a big influence."
"It should not be left to the individual Member States."
"Women' s participation in the labour market is a prerequisite of our achieving the ambitious goals we have set ourselves regarding employment and the modernisation of the European social model. Modernisation and efforts in this area are therefore important."
"They cannot be left to the Member States. Europe as a whole needs to attend to these issues."
"Mr President, many women are discriminated against today in their workplaces."
"We know that many lose their jobs when they become pregnant."
"This is completely unacceptable!"
"The Damião report contains many good proposals, but we in the Swedish Liberal Party still have fundamental objections to the report."
"I would like to say to my predecessor, who spoke just a moment ago, that, in this Parliament, we ought more often to ask ourselves the question: What should the European Parliament actually be doing?"
"How much detail should we go into?"
"We believe in the subsidiarity principle, i.e. that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the people they affect."
"Social policy is an area where the EU ought to have limited jurisdiction, except when it is a question of free movement for citizens within the Union."
"Every Member State should have full responsibility and the right to make its own decisions regarding its social security systems."
"Maternity/paternity leave and maternity/paternity benefit are examples of issues that are not directly transnational."
"We do not believe in detailed common European social legislation."
"This does not, however, prevent Member States from cooperating and sharing ideas concerning social issues."
"The Damião report contains an amalgam of legitimate demands for proper security for women workers throughout Europe, demands for greater freedom of movement and a better functioning single market and demands for the national right of decision on the details of the socio-political system."
"In this connection, the report contains an imbalance."
"My final question is: Why should the European Parliament decide that every woman in the whole of Europe must have eight weeks off work when she has had a child?"
"I know several women who have gone back to work earlier - there must be freedom of choice!"
"Mr President, Mrs Damião, the author of this report, is justified in her criticisms of the Commission as regards the delay in revising the current directive."
"The report quite rightly laments the Commission' s failure to comply with the timetable set by the directive and the fact that there has been no assessment of how effectively the directive has been implemented."
"The report stresses the need for a proposal for an urgent revision of the directive, and suggests inclusion of various measures, which we essentially support and agree with."
"As a matter of fact, in the discussions held in the Parliamentary committees, we tabled various amendments designed to guarantee the statutory right to take breaks from work for breastfeeding, to ensure non-discrimination in the workplace against pregnant women and women who have just given birth or who are breastfeeding, particularly in terms of salary, and to guarantee career progression and employment, with particular emphasis on the situation of working women who have temporary or atypical contracts."
"In general, the amendments were accepted, with the exception of the amendment on the payment of allowances during time off work and maternity leave, which must be equivalent to 100% of the previous salary and be taken into account for the purposes of calculating pension entitlements."
"I hope that Parliament will adopt this amendment."
"Mr President, if the Commission's intention was to improve the effective health and safety of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth, it may be said that it has not achieved its goal."
"The report has two clear shortcomings: firstly, the fact that it is overdue and secondly, its limitations."
"It could have been finished as far back as 1997, but even though it is late, it could at least have clarified the wording of certain articles of the directive and defined the many undefined concepts which have given rise to numerous interpretations. Among the various missing data which would have been useful, it could also have provided the results of the questionnaires sent to the Member States and the results of the coordination of relevant laws and activities by the European Standardisation Centre."
"The European Parliament recognised the need to revise the directive as early as 1992, with the result that now, given the need for a social market economy, it agrees with the objectives of Mrs Damião's report: to link maternity policies to family policy and to remove ambiguity by practically and quantifiably enhancing the rights of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the incorporation of women into the labour market means that at some time their working life will coincide with a pregnancy, which sometimes means that they are obliged to take additional leave so as not to endanger their own health or the health of the unborn child."
"Pregnancy is a natural state for women which society must respect, defend and protect."
"Society must care for working women in particular by ensuring that they remain in their jobs."
"The incorporation of women into the workplace is a reality which cannot be reversed and women cannot be put in a situation of having to chose between having children and keeping their job because of the complications which a pregnancy may entail."
"The ageing of the population, together with the low birth-rate in the European Union, means that this is an issue of enormous importance for all social operators."
"As important as the protection of pregnant women is provision for breast-feeding, which is beneficial to the health of both mother and child."
"The protection of maternity and breast-feeding cannot be considered as a form of unequal treatment between men and women, since maternity is exclusive to women and it is women who must be protected, independently of the fact that some parental leave can be granted to men."
"The Member States must deal with the possible negative effects of this directive by making it easier for companies to employ young women by exempting them from the social costs during parental leave."
"The directive must include a minimum leave of 20 weeks, with an obligatory period of at least eight weeks after giving birth."
"A minimum salary of 80% must be guaranteed, with no loss of pension rights."
"The ban on dismissal during pregnancy must be strictly complied with."
"In no circumstances must pregnancy be a cause for discrimination against women."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities unanimously condemns the delay on the part of the Commission, which is even more serious given that it extends from 1992 to 2000, which is the period in which there have been the most changes in terms of women' s access to work."
"Furthermore, we believe that this deficiency in the legislation may be exacerbating a very serious phenomenon, that is, the rejection by young people of motherhood."
"We ask the Commission, before the end of 2000, to present an amendment of Directive 92/85/EEC and that that directive be applicable to all pregnant workers, in all areas and occupations, with no exceptions or conditions."
"The new legislation must be clear and progressive."
"It must provide for new working situations and also the new family situation of single parent families."
"The pregnant worker must be provided with adequate protection, which is designed for their specific circumstances, but this should not mean discrimination or a reduction in their work opportunities, but quite the opposite."
"We must be able to provide the means for breast-feeding to be compatible with work."
"Mr President, in today' s Europe there is no room for a divorce between women and employment, and much less a divorce between women and maternity."
"Mr President, the Commission report, which I have read in great detail, says: ""In general terms Directive 92/85/EEC has been well implemented by the Member States and this is reflected in the low level of complaints about the rights of pregnant workers received by the Commission""."
"The rapporteur has set this all to one side, effectively saying it is irrelevant, claiming that the original directive just did not go far enough."
"I like some of the suggestions in her report."
"I congratulate her for the enthusiasm with which she has pursued her agenda."
"But in general it is not a health and safety agenda."
"It is very much a traditional socialist agenda."
"Firstly, her report aims to harmonise social policy across the EU rather than leave the detail to Member States - a point made with great force by Mr Olle Schmidt earlier in this debate."
"Secondly, it wants to improve the terms and conditions of employment for pregnant workers and new mothers by way of extra maternity leave and specified minimum pay levels."
"Neither of these are really health and safety issues."
"She is proposing solutions for which there is no health and safety problem."
"As British Conservatives we confirm our concern about health and safety for all workers, especially vulnerable groups."
"We confirm our commitment to subsidiarity regarding terms and conditions of employment."
"But we also confirm our concern to help more women into jobs rather than putting up further barriers to female employment."
"Hence we urge the House to reject the report."
"Mr President, this text is important insofar as the legislation concerned has significant consequences for the well-being of women and also children, that is, the future of our society."
"In this respect, we may well be surprised that the Commission has waited as long as it has to present us with its evaluation report on the implementation of this directive and proposals for improving conditions for maternity leave."
"It seems to me that, in this proposal for a revision of the directive that we are asking the Commission to present quickly, it is essential to preserve the reality of three fundamental principles for women and their well-being: the prohibition of dismissal for pregnant women or women on maternity leave, the right to a mandatory minimum leave and allowance during this leave to be taken into account for the purposes of acquiring pension entitlements."
"Furthermore, it seems to me that this new directive should comprise substantial improvements, in particular all women must be offered the opportunity to take 20 weeks' maternity leave, without necessarily being obliged to take the entire period, but the employer shall be obliged to offer it, and a minimum of 8 weeks after the birth, in order to foster development of the bond between mother and child."
"With regard to high-risk pregnancies and the birth of disabled children, it is obvious that provision must be made for specially adapted proposals offering an extension of the length of maternity leave, taking account of the specifics of the case."
"As far as definition of the allowance is concerned, it seems that the figure to be considered must be at least 80% of the previous salary, and that includes for purposes of acquiring pension entitlements."
"Finally, it is recommended that this text should correlate and reinforce the formal prohibition of dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave."
"Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for her work on protecting women during pregnancy and maternity, a particularly difficult time."
"This report certainly represents progress, not just for women in general but also in that it safeguards family rights and upholds fundamental values."
"The European People's Party has always upheld the concept of the family, the basic unit of society, as the basis for European construction and the Christian values from which it stems require that it be respected."
"At a time when Europe has demographic problems, the institutions need to issue a firm signal to reassure working women, who have to have sufficient peace of mind and the necessary guarantees to be able to opt for motherhood."
"This is why it is necessary to have a sufficiently long period of rest from work before giving birth and even longer afterwards, when there is a child to breastfeed, look after and bring up."
"Therefore, benefits should not be cut considerably during this period and pension funds should not be affected either."
"I would add that, as regards the matter in question, self-employed women should also have a guaranteed right to benefits, which should be funded from contributory national sectoral funds."
"Finally, I would like to express my support for maintaining the prohibition on dismissal of women during this period, and also for the fact that the cost of benefits for workers on maternity leave are not borne directly by the company where the woman works but entirely by the State, in order to avoid discrimination and penalising women in the labour market."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you for silence, not a religious silence, but a parliamentary silence, so that we can listen properly to Commissioner de Palacio."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Damião for her magnificent report, despite the fact that it contains a series of criticisms of the Commission' s actions."
"I must accept these criticisms since they are true and are based on real facts."
"However, I must offer a justification and an explanation."
"In order to produce this text, the Commission has had to rely on documentation provided by the different Member States and, unfortunately, that documentation has not been provided with all the speed and efficiency which the Commission would have liked."
"That is the reason for the delay in presentation."
"The Commission obviously fully shares the Parliament' s interest in improving the protection of pregnant workers and those who have recently given birth."
"The Community legislation and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice still do not offer a sufficient framework although they are undoubtedly key elements to making further progress in this aspect which is essential to safeguarding the rights of pregnant workers."
"Directive 92/85 was adopted before the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We believe that it is now, after the Treaty, that we will be able to go further and take some steps forward."
"That is what we propose and to this end we are going to prepare a supplementary report on the implementation of this directive, which we will present in 2002."
"As the honourable Members know well, the Commission last week approved its new social agenda for 2000-2005 and it is within this framework that we hope to offer an adequate solution, not only to this specific problem, but also to a whole series of other issues."
"Mr President, this is the last time this week that the House will be meeting in such great numbers."
"I would like to draw your attention and the attention of fellow Members to a very sad matter."
"This Parliament' s reputation with the press is excellent, because for the past twenty years, Parliament has managed to issue press releases for the written press twice a day."
"This previous system has now been changed."
"I had a brief look to see how the system worked this week."
"The press release to commemorate former President Pflimlin did not appear until 11.22 p.m. on Monday evening."
"The report on the Feira Summit was issued on Tuesday morning, the report on Tuesday morning' s discharge sitting was issued at 9.12 p.m."
"The report on Zimbabwe, Tuesday afternoon, was issued at 10.55 p.m."
"The report on the European Central Bank on Wednesday morning was issued at 8.00 p.m. the same day."
"This kind of reporting is not really of much use at all to the written press."
"At that time of the day, editorial staff have gone home and we are, in a way, generating old news."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to revert back to the old system and to ensure that the press releases, the daily press releases, not only appear on time, but also afford a general overview - in a decentralised manner - for each language."
"I would ask you to request the Bureau to think about this very carefully and reconsider their decision."
"Mr Staes, your comments will, of course, be passed on to our staff so that we can work as efficiently as possible."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I am sorry to delay the House when I know there is a large amount of voting to go on."
"I have just discovered from my agenda that the vote on my own report is to be taken last."
"I have not been consulted about this."
"Indeed I indicated earlier that this needed to be taken as early as possible in the voting because - and as one of those involved in aviation, I know this better than most - I have only got one flight to get me home. And so I am stuck!"
"So I throw myself upon the mercy of the House and wonder whether it would be possible to vote early, rather than to vote late, on the Atkins report?"
"I have taken note of your request."
"Mr President, if you agree to Sir Robert Atkins' request, then I would actually suggest taking the votes in the order we ended up with yesterday."
"That would be something else!"
"Mr Mombaur, I have not granted Mr Atkins' request: I have simply taken note of it."
"There is a fixed voting order, to which I will adhere, and I am sorry if some of the reports will have to be voted on this afternoon rather than this morning."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Vote"
"Mr President, as you have said, we will be voting on the compromise motions agreed in an informal conciliation procedure with the Commission."
"We referred the report back on 16 May and in the meantime it has been improved."
"By adopting this procedure vis-à-vis the Commission, Parliament has once again expressed our resolve also to achieve full codecision in the Committee on Agriculture and in relation to agriculture."
"We have achieved it by adopting this procedure for the case in point."
"I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation in this regard and I hope the compromises we have reached will also gain the kind of support from the Council and the Commission that means they can only be rejected unanimously."
"So the Commission and Parliament have jointly managed to establish a very strong position and I hope that will also serve as an example to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I really want to give warm thanks, not just to the Commission but also to all those involved, to all my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture, for enabling us jointly to achieve this compromise!"
"I would ask you to adopt this document today, because otherwise the Council would be able to take a decision on 16 and 17 July without having Parliament' s opinion, since we would not be cooperating as faithfully as we should according to a European Court of Justice ruling."
"So I would ask that we adopt this document today."
"Once again, many thanks for your cooperation!"
"Commissioner, would you like to respond to the question?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret having to take the floor in regard to Mr Kuhne' s report, but this concerns a very serious course of events."
"This report, which is about the discharge of Parliament' s 1998 budget, as you all know, contains a paragraph 18 and a sixth indent."
"This sixth indent concerns our group."
"There was an agreement - and all the group chairmen will confirm this - between the group chairmen that we would not address concrete cases relating to individual groups in the report, but that in future we will jointly endeavour to tackle any problems that may arise."
"So in view of the wording in the report, I tabled a compromise amendment on behalf of my group, and it was indicated to me a few days ago that the rapporteur would approve that compromise."
"We thereupon refrained from tabling an amendment that also refers to problems in regard to the Socialist Group."
"I now hear that the Socialist Group evidently will not endorse our Amendment No 10, tabled in my name."
"Let me state quite plainly, in all seriousness and with great regret, that this means the agreement between group chairmen was given up."
"Fair play was given up!"
"Let me also say that our group is disappointed, not just I personally but the entire group."
"If the Socialist Group does not support compromise Amendment No 10 - and that is up to the group - then let me tell you that this will be a very grave decision it is taking here today."
"(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)"
"Mr Poettering, as you are aware, explanations of vote are made after the vote."
"We cannot start a debate now, even if the matter is an extremely sensitive issue."
"Mr President, as rapporteur I would very briefly like to make two or three comments."
"First, a general observation. I think it would be sensible if in future when we discuss discharge procedures in this Parliament, people do not just start showing such sensitivity about the wording of certain passages when their own interests are at stake."
"Secondly, I myself proposed in my original report, which was adopted in committee in March and voted on here in April, to include a problem relating to my group in that report."
"At that time, my group and the Greens voted in committee to resolve that problem."
"It is to do with the payment of party workers out of group resources."
"At the time, the PPE Group and the Liberals voted by a majority to take this proposal out of the report."
"Perhaps Mr Poettering does not even know that yet; I am informing him of it now."
"Let me now make a very fundamental comment as rapporteur for a discharge procedure."
"It was an PPE proposal in April, in the name of Mr Elles, that linked the discharge of Parliament' s budget to the question of group finances."
"That was your proposal, which was carried!"
"That is why this point is incorporated."
"At the time there was an explicit reference to the Court of Auditor' s report."
"No rapporteur for a discharge procedure, in which the groups are involved, can have this discharge taken from him by an agreement between group chairmen, whether or not such an agreement exists."
"To call on the fact that group chairmen discharge themselves is in itself a matter that requires further discussion."
"I have a final comment on compromises. On a number of occasions we have had people declaring that their own amendments are compromises."
"No-one has at any time discussed with me whether or not this was a compromise amendment."
"All I was asked was whether I could live with this amendment, to which I said no."
"That is because this amendment in no way enhances transparency, which is the issue, and that is why I remain, as before, opposed to it."
"(Applause)"
"(Parliament adopted the draft decision)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0193/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer policy, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing an identification and registration system for cattle and on the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing regulation (CE) No 820/97 [8251/1/2000 - C5-0270/2000 - 1999/0204(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Papayannakis)"
"Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 propose deleting the obligation to indicate the category of animal on the labelling."
"There have already been discussions about the definition of the category in the Management Committee and the Commission is confident that solutions will be found that satisfy the majority, if not indeed all of the Member States."
"The Commission therefore believes it is crucial to introduce the provisions on labelling on 1 September."
"To open up the whole debate again would delay their entry into force."
"Then the amendments could not be adopted."
"Regarding Amendment No 4, the Commission has concluded that the draft regulation already calls for full certainty of origin."
"So the Commission sees no reason to adopt that amendment and it is also against adopting Amendment No 6."
"Yet I would point out, on behalf of the Commission, that it is possible even now to indicate the date of the minced meat production under the simplified, voluntary procedure."
"Let me also point out again that Mr Fischler stated yesterday that after the discussions in Parliament at first reading, a large majority of amendments were adopted and have now been incorporated in the text."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"

"It accepts Amendments Nos 32 and 33 (second part) in principle."
"The Commission cannot accept the other amendments."
"Following Amendment No 49"
"Mr President, in order to make this Amendment No 41 acceptable to the PPE Group and the Liberals, I suggest the following oral amendment: replace ""the active involvement of the workers and their representatives"" with ""the involvement of the workers and their representatives in the organisation"" ."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0166/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive relating to limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air [5860/1/2000 - C5-0182/2000 - 1998/0333(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Breyer)"

"Consequently, if we wanted to deal with them all in the same way we would have had to have extended voting time well beyond 2 p.m., and we cannot do that."
"In any case, we usually vote when there is a room available and not when there is not."
"Voting time is suspended."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Mr President, in view of the vote on the Papayannakis report I should like to ask the Commission to convene a conciliation committee next week so that we sort this out before the 1 September deadline."
"Please convey that to the Commissioner please, as she is not listening at the moment."
"Schierhuber report (A5-0124/2000)"
"(EL) There are serious reservations regarding the proposal to amend Regulation EC No 1251/1999 on flax and hemp grown for fibre because of the unfair allocation of quotas between the Member States."
"Countries with an important agricultural sector and a high rate of employment in agriculture, such as Greece, have been given the lowest quota limit, for both flax and hemp."
"We should like to take this opportunity to stress the need for an awareness campaign in the Member States in order to overcome ignorance and educate the public about hemp grown for fibre; in Greece, for example, shops selling hemp fibre have been shut down by the police and small undertakings have gone out of business."
"Stauner report (A5-0182/2000)"
"Mr President, pensioners and elderly people are in favour of innovation, even though it may appear otherwise, and so, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I cannot help but support the inclusion of any rules leading to innovative measures when decisions are taken on the Structural Funds."
"On this occasion, after stating that I voted for the motion, of course, I would call - and I do so willingly - for, in future, the projects to be financed as innovative actions to include projects which are concerned not only with improving working conditions in the strict sense but also with everything which affects pensioners, who, during the period in which they are not working, use the contributions they paid in when they were working, and so this period is, indirectly, a continuation of their working activity."
"Virrankoski report (A5-0192/2000)"
"Mr President, I would just like to say that the Radical Members abstained from the vote on the Virrankoski report because the Council was trying to secure for its own budget the costs arising from missions conducted by military advisers or others within the framework of the CFSP."
"Since Parliament has always taken great care to ensure that that CFSP expenditure is an integral part of the Union budget, with the result that it falls within the scope of the Commission budget, we are concerned at the way the Virrankoski report departs from this practice and at the tendency to include CFSP running and operational expenditure in the Council's budget."
"This is why we abstained from the Virrankoski report."
"We voted against extra money for military advisers because we believe a peace policy needs peace experts and non-violent conflict resolution."
"Stauner Report (A5-0190/2000)"
"Mr President, I do not believe Parliament should feel satisfied with what has been achieved so far."
"In discharging the Commission, it runs the risk of losing credibility in the field of budgetary control and combating fraud."
"Nor am I sure whether people in this House actually realise that giving a discharge means accepting liability for damages."
"It will be hard to explain to the citizens of Europe why EUR 14 million of taxes were squandered on the Fléchard case and why Parliament is letting itself be fobbed off with empty promises."
"So everyone in this House who voted for the discharge to the Commission is assuming quite personal responsibility for it."
"We need hardly wonder why the citizens are increasingly losing faith in Europe."
"On behalf of my group, I therefore want to state that we voted against the discharge to the Commission for that reason."
"- (DA) On 6 July 2000, members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted against giving discharge to the Commission in respect of implementation of the general budget of the European Union for 1998."
"The reason for this is that the present Commission, which has undertaken to implement an extensive administrative reform, is not showing sufficient willingness to implement this reform."
"The many cases of foot-dragging, delay and refusal to hand over documents to the Committee on Budgetary Control, together with the extraordinary fact that crucial reports and minutes are disappearing from the record offices where they belong, are an uncomfortable indication that a form of administration is being maintained which is more suited to the age of absolute monarchy."
"Clearly, the purpose of the secrecy is to protect the Commission' s members and officials from the penalties which are used in every democratic national administration and without which the European Union' s administration will never operate properly."
"In the course of the debate on the report, I have mentioned two matters which are still outstanding, but these are merely isolated symptoms of a general malaise."
"One year after coming into office, the Commission has still not presented any proposal for fundamentally changing the provisions in the regulations for public officials which provide the kind of legal protection for incompetence and dishonesty that is completely absurd in an administration which purports to be democratic."
"The treatment of this report in the Committee on Budgetary Control has also shown that some Members of the European Parliament are more concerned with protecting the Commission against those citizens who pay for the EU' s budget than with attending to the same citizens' demand that their money be administered honestly and efficiently."
"Unacceptable pressure has been placed upon a number of rapporteurs, and the shady operators who have an interest in preventing the serious examples of fraud and deception in the Commission' s administration from coming to light have not held back from making physical threats."
"A number of MEPs have today voted in favour of giving discharge."
"I do not believe that a great many of these MEPs are satisfied with the Commission' s economic administration, but we have reached a point where the majority prefer to close their eyes to what is going on than to run the risk of their electors and fellow citizens becoming fully aware of the scandalous states of affairs which make themselves felt year after year."
"I am convinced that, in the long run, the majority of MEPs will regret having been so indulgent."
"- (DE) On 6 June I as rapporteur recommended to the Committee on Budgetary Control that we give the Commission a discharge for the 1998 financial year."
"Today I voted against that discharge."
"The deciding factor was the way the Commissioner for budgets handled the Fléchard case."
"This firm was suspected of fraud as early as 1992."
"Nonetheless, it was let off a fine to the tune of EUR 14.6 million."
"Nonetheless the Commission continued to do business with it all those years, without asking any questions."
"Now the Italian financial police are investigating and it is said that the firm is involved in shady deals and the black marketeering of butter on a grand scale."
"Of course, we must not prejudge."
"But the Commissioner for budgets does not have the right to refuse to tell us how many millions the Commission has paid to this firm over the past years."
"Mrs Schreyer promised the figures to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 24 May, but has still not produced them."
"She gives one excuse after another."
"On Tuesday, she tried to make this House believe, wrongly, that Regulation 2390/1999 prevented her from presenting the figures."
"The Community budget is not a matter of secrecy."
"If the Commission refuses to render account, our response can only be to refuse the discharge."
". (NL) Granting the European Commission discharge is anything but self-evident."
"In previous years, the financial irregularities were so extensive that the discharge had to be turned down, which led to the fall of the Santer Commission."
"This time, the discharge pertains to the 1998 budget, and it is a particularly hard nut to crack."
"That budget was entirely the responsibility of the previous Commission, but we are discussing it with the present Prodi Commission, which has started to adopt better management and examine incidents of fraud in the past."
"In the spring of this year, the EP was right in postponing the 1999 discharge in order to clarify matters further and make improvements."
"These clarifications have largely been given and improvements made, although a margin of serious error in excess of 5% is still frighteningly high."
"The mislaying of the report relating to the Commission meeting, during which the penalty in the Flèchard case was decimated, is nothing short of a mockery."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control endured an onslaught of harsh criticism by some and was at the same time given the benefit of the doubt by others."
"The circumstances surrounding the rapporteur' s explanation can be called embarrassing and harm the committee' s reputation."
"Faced with the need to finally make a decision on whether or not to grant discharge, we eventually gave the current European Commission the benefit of the doubt for 1998."
"It should, however, realise that this does not create a precedent for the 1999 discharge."
"The European Commission is partly responsible for this discharge and has also had the opportunity in the meantime to put its house in order."
"Mrs Redondo has asked for the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, I would like to ask for the vote on the report on the protection of forests to be postponed until the next sitting, because today, for unavoidable reasons, I must leave this Parliament at 5 p.m."
"Mrs Redondo, we have been unable to vote on a number of legislative reports because there is just not enough time, and so these will be put to the vote this afternoon after the votes on urgent subjects, as usual."
"Mr President, I urgently request you to ensure in future that legislative texts are voted on first in the order of voting."
"For it really is Parliament' s primary task to decide legislation!"
"I do not approve of the fact that we have suspended the vote after only an hour and a half today, but I will have to accept it."
"However, I am absolutely against an order of voting that automatically means that legislative texts are not taken until Thursday evening."
"I ask you to alter the voting order accordingly."
"As you are aware, certain decisions are taken by the Conference of Presidents."
"Usually, when voting time starts at midday it lasts for an hour."
"Today, it started at 12.15 p.m. and ended at approximately 1.30 p.m."
"The votes on certain resolutions, such as the European Council of Feira, Zimbabwe and the trafficking of human beings took a relatively short time."
"The votes on the legislative drafts take up rather a lot of time."
"In any case, this is not the appropriate time to discuss this subject."
"We will take note of your comment and pass it on to the Conference of Presidents, for, in the order of voting, according to the procedure we have been following, out of all the recommendations for second reading - which engage our capacity as a legislative House - priority is given to the drafts which engage our power of colegislation."
"I am sorry, Mr President, to continue from where I left off a moment ago and come back to what Mr Swoboda just said."
"Mr President, I understand everything you have said."
"But this week for the first time we did not have a vote at noon on Tuesday."
"That is a decision that was taken."
"We were against; the majority of the House - had they known of it - the rapporteurs - Mrs Redondo Jiménez and Mr Arvidsson and others - would no doubt also have been against it."
"But if we do this, then we must also show some degree of flexibility."
"Among this rather smaller body of people I dare to say this; most of us are experienced parliamentarians and we know that there are different kinds of sittings."
"The Thursday sitting in July is a particularly sensitive one."
"We know that, we may not be happy about it, but that is how it is."
"So I would ask you to check whether the four legislative reports that are still on the agenda, and that do not need long votes, can be carried over to the next part-session."
"Mrs Redondo Jiménez herself asked the same, in the case of her report, and she has my support."
"Mr Arvidsson - all this relates to what I know about - will, I hope, also agree. So I would ask you to contact the rapporteurs and the groups."
"Mr Swoboda has already said it, and I can repeat it for my own group: we will agree to these four legislative reports being carried over to the September part-session or to a part-session in Brussels."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt, as you are aware, a request can be made to postpone a debate either at the start of a sitting in the morning or at the start of voting time."
"Therefore, when voting time is resumed this afternoon, a rapporteur or another member of the Committee will be able to request that the report be put to the vote in September."
"I do not have any objection to this."
"Mr President, you are absolutely right, that is the correct procedure. But if we plan to do that and if it is certain that, let us say, Mr Swoboda or I or others move this proposal, it would be only fair to inform the rapporteurs of this possibility."
"In any case, the presiding President will be informed of the request and will, of course, give the floor to any Member who wishes to speak at that time."
"Rühle report (A5-0167/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted against the Rühle report."
"Firstly, it appears to contain an error, for it mentions a 1998 budget of as much as EUR 10 940 000 million - at least in the Italian version - which seems to me at first sight to be rather too great a sum."
"There has to be an error of at least 3 decimal points."
"Apart from this, I would like to stress that, in addition to the other aspects which are inadequate as the rapporteur himself states in his report - which begs the question of why he does not conclude the report with a recommendation to vote against it - it would be appropriate to give at least part of these funds to voluntary organisations, which include many pensioners and elderly people who are willing to go out into the world and assist developing countries."
". (FR) The European Parliament, during its sitting of 13 April 2000, quite rightly decided to delay the decision giving discharge to the European Commission on the implementation of the budget for the year 1998."
"This decision was legitimate, insofar as the citizens of our nations have the right to be told how the money of the European Union, their money, is being spent."
"Our group is entirely in favour of any vigorous attempts to combat fraud and embezzlement."
"Indeed, the irregularities noted, both those covered in Mrs Stauner' s report on the questionable management of the Commission, and those underlined in Mrs Rühle' s report on the various European Development Funds, cannot leave anyone indifferent, and necessarily damage the image and credibility of the Community as a whole."
"In addition, we must draw the proper conclusions, in terms of sanctioning those responsible, certainly, but also in establishing far more transparent procedures."
"As shown by the votes of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the reports by Mrs Rühle and Mrs Stauner are heading in this direction."
"Mrs Rühle' s report on the various EDFs clearly confronts the Commission with its responsibilities; it demands more clarity for all future aid distributed by the Community for the benefit of developing countries."
"The desire to raise moral standards regarding aid policy and increase the efficacy of the use of aid is a principle which is now clearly defined and our group is pleased with that."
"There is no question, however, of accepting that, on the pretext of better monitoring, in order to achieve a more honest and rational use of the European funds - and I am thinking of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in particular, that our action should be a pretext for also organising the unfounded trial of certain countries of the European Union - incidentally one of the main net contributors (I am talking about France) - by means of a witch hunt which, it is said, targets certain high-ranking civil servants of that nationality."
"Greater transparency is also our primary concern with regard to the finances of political groups within this House; the citizens of Europe, moreover, would not understand if we said otherwise."
"We must also take note of the responses of our institution to the observations of the Court of Auditors, and without delay encourage all relevant reform in accordance with the financial regulation and the principle of transparency."
"In conclusion, I will say - so much is clear - that we should not introduce confusion between the discharge procedure, which represents an overall appreciation of the management of the European Commission as laid down by the Treaty, and the handling of a number of isolated matters which, although clearly serious, are still only isolated cases and represent a low figure with regard to the total budget."
"We must keep a sense of proportion!"
"Equally, as far as our Group is concerned, taking note of the further clarification we asked the Commission for in spring, in the context of the Stauner report, is no reason at all for our institution to then be affected by amnesia when it comes to tracking down unacceptable practice at the expense of our fellow citizens' contributions."
"Our Group congratulates the rapporteurs, Mrs Stauner, Mrs Rühle and Mr Kuhne, on their commendable efforts."
"We should, however, remain alert and be in a position to observe what the European Commission' s attitude will actually be with regard to the commitments it has made."
"Our Group therefore considers it necessary, for the time being, to abstain."
"Kuhne report (A5-0189/2000)"
"- (DE) I voted against giving a discharge to the Secretary-General because he gave misleading information to the political decision-making bodies about the purchase of the ASP building in Brussels."
"This wrongly gave the impression that the Council and the Commission had agreed to the building being financed with the help of the then property developer."
"Furthermore, this wrongly gave the impression that financing the building with the help of the property developer was an indirect form of financing."
"In fact, in 1988 Parliament directly indebted itself to a banking consortium headed by WestLB, for amounts of ECU 472 million and BEF 7 billion, without first publishing an invitation to tender for the contract in the Official Journal."
"The Court of Auditors also found that the relevant financial regulations had been infringed."
"Papayannakis report (A5-0193/2000)"
". (FR) Only after the mad cow scandal did we realise the need to improve the traceability and labelling of foodstuffs."
"Europe was very slow to react and was left far behind in terms of beef."
"Today, on the basis of a unanimous agreement within the Council, we finally have the opportunity to show a little determination."
"Indeed, the common position submitted to us includes a large number of the amendments adopted by this House at first reading."
"Concerning the mandatory statements, indication of origin, implementation dates, minced meat and the optional system, I believe that Parliament should be satisfied: the Council has listened to us."
"This is why I wholeheartedly supported this common position as it stood and did not vote for any amendments."
"The debate has focused on a few specific points and in particular on the indication of the category of animal on the label."
"Certain fellow Members have explained, in good faith, that this statement does nothing to contribute to tracing beef."
"They are correct."
"However, after the series of food scandals, which this House has always vigorously denounced, how could we today omit to take account of the colossal role played by the consumer?"
"Specifically mentioning the category is a response to a demand."
"It contributes to restoring consumer confidence."
"Two types of information must be distinguished:"
"information making it possible to improve traceability, but that is not directly intended to inform the end consumer."
"As it is too specific, it can really only be read by professionals."
"It fulfils a health function."
"It is on the basis of these statements that controls can be carried out."
"We are therefore talking about setting up identification and traceability systems;"
"the second type of information is directly intended for citizens like you and me, who buy their meat every day."
"What do they want to know?"
"They want to be sure that the product they are to consume is safe: the traceability and identification system will make it possible to guarantee the safety and quality of beef."
"But the citizen would also like to know what type of meat it is."
"This type of indication on the label is addressed directly to the end consumer and gives him intelligible information."
"It is a mistake to say that this is pointless."
"On the contrary, this labelling is just as important as establishing health guarantees."
"Europe must give consumers back their confidence, as they have been avoiding beef since the mad cow scandal."
"The implications are significant for the agro-food sector overall, which has been struck squarely by this crisis."
"These two types of information are not in competition; they are complementary and contribute, each at their own level, to restoring the confidence of European consumers."
"The confidence of our consumers cannot be decreed, it must be won."
"Garcia-Orcoyen Tormo report (A5-0165/2000)"
". It is a correct policy objective of the European Union to ensure that businesses carry out their affairs in an environmentally-friendly manner."
"The Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme known as EMAS afforded an opportunity to EU companies to secure accreditation that they are implementing good environmental practices within their operations."
"What we are discussing here today is the revision of the original 1993 regulation which put in place the Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme."
"The criteria for inclusion on the EMAS register are very stringent."
"The fact of the matter is that there is public reporting of the results which are carried out by each national standards authority within every Member State of the European Union."
"Each national standards authority carries out a comprehensive and full review of all the activities of a prospective applicant under the EMAS scheme that may affect the environment."
"Under the new regulation which we are discussing here today easier access will be made for small- and medium-sized enterprises to apply for accreditation under the EMAS scheme."
"For the most part it has only been larger industrial companies which have sought recognition under the Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme to date."
"We must remember that the EMAS scheme is the European version of the International Standard known as ISO14001."
"In essence, this ISO International Standard is the equivalent to the ISO9000 for European companies but with the appropriate environmental slant."
"It is the correct policy of the European Union to ensure that all companies in Europe respect the environment and ensure that the necessary practices are put in place to guarantee their operations do not adversely impact on the environment in any shape or form."
"That is why I fully support proposals to ensure that easier access will be made for small- and medium-sized enterprises to be incorporated under the EMAS framework."
"There must be greater flexibility within this system no matter how stringent the rules are to ensure that all sectors and all businesses in the European Union have an opportunity to secure accreditation under the Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme."
"I fully support this programme and commend this report."
"Recommendation for second reading: Breyer (A5-0166/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the recommendation, which sets limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in the ambient air."
"Of course I am in favour of this, in that whenever there is a danger, pensioners and the elderly are always among the first to be affected, for, understandably, their lungs are often in bad shape."
"Apart from this, I would like to call strongly for there to be focus in the future not only on the air inhaled by the citizens, but also on the air inhaled by those who work with dangerous substances such as benzene and carbon monoxide."
"It would be appropriate for us to concern ourselves with this matter and reduce the working hours of those who work with dangerous substances to less than those of the other workers, to enable them to enjoy an average life span."
"I feel that the European Union should concern itself, in particular, with the conditions and working hours of the citizens who inhale those dangerous substances against which we rightly protect pedestrians."
"Workers should receive even greater protection."
"Recommendation for second reading: Jackson (A5-0164/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the motion and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, who worked so hard to ensure that this recommendation on the practical organisation of environmental inspections becomes a directive."
"There is no point in Parliament adopting hundreds and hundreds of extremely important and useful directives and regulations if adequate, effective, practical monitoring is not then carried out in order to ensure that they are genuinely implemented and are of benefit to all the citizens of the European Union, particularly - as I said a moment ago - when it is a matter of environmental health, as it is in this case, and when failure to observe the rules causes harm, above all, to pensioners and the elderly."
". The principal aim of this recommendation is to strengthen the compliance with and to contribute to a more consistent implementation and enforcement of Community environmental law in the Member States."
"This draft recommendation establishes minimum criteria to be applied in the organising, carrying out, following up and publicising of the results of environmental inspections."
"It provides for environmental inspections of all industrial and other enterprises whose emissions and discharges on the environment are subject to particular authorisations or licensing requirements."
"This would certainly be the case for all companies who receive pollution control licences under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agencies."
"According to the text of this recommendation, environmental inspections will include: site visits; verification of self-monitoring by the operators of the controlled installations; checking the premises, the equipment and the adequacy of the environmental management at the site as well as the records kept by the operators."
"Two types of inspections are foreseen, in particular, routine inspections carried out as part of a planned inspection programme and non-routine inspections as a follow-up to complaints in connection with the issue and renewal or modification of various licences."
"Member States will be required to draw up in advance plans for environmental inspection activities covering all their respective territory and the installations within it."
"These plans shall be available to the public under broader and wider information campaigns which are envisaged under this proposal."
"Under this draft recommendation, each plan should define the geographical area which it covers, cover a defined period of time, include specific provisions for its revision, identify the specific sites or types of installations covered, prescribe the programmes for routine environmental inspections, provide for and outline the procedures for non-routine environmental inspections, provide for coordination between the different inspecting authorities."
"I would like to commend the rapporteur, Caroline Jackson, for her report."
"In her report she is calling for this proposal to be translated into a directive which would have uniform application across the European Union."
"The rapporteur believes that only a directive can force the Member States to introduce these inspection systems."
"As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of the European Parliament, I support the need for Member States to establish harmonised environmental inspections."
"The EU Council must listen to the European Parliament in this regard."
"We must all recall that the European Parliament has the power of codecision on environmental matters as a result of the implementation of the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The European Union also has competence in environmental matters under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty."
"Santa Maria da Feira European Council of 19 and 20 June 2000"
". (EL) There are four important observations to be made on the Portuguese presidency and the presidency's closing summit in Santa Maria da Feira:"
"First, the European Union took another very dangerous step towards militarisation by pushing for an EU military and police force and by developing an Atlantic framework for it to work within."
"By contrast, no positive action was taken to promote peace, as the continuing quagmire in Yugoslavia illustrates."
"Secondly, it is clear from developments at the Intergovernmental Conference that we are moving towards a ""two-speed Europe"" rather than towards democratisation, as continual reference to ""closer cooperation"" and various proposals to reduce the weighting of small countries in both the Council and the Commission illustrate."
"Thirdly, the European Union, under pressure from the United Kingdom in particular, failed to reach a specific agreement and binding timetable on tax information, leaving tax havens free to operate within the Union."
"Fourthly, the Lisbon Summit, midway through the Portuguese presidency, gave another sign in favour of abandoning the European welfare model and changing to the American model."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the resolution concerning the conclusions from the European Council' s summit in Feira on 19-20 June 2000."
"We have done so because we should like to repay a good presidency which has set a commendable and forward-looking agenda for Europe, as is also reflected in the section of the resolution concerning the follow-up to the Lisbon Summit."
"Our overall vote cannot, however, be taken as implying that we support the desire for an extended agenda at the Intergovernmental Conference and the legally binding incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty. In this connection, we would refer to our explanations of vote on these matters, issued in connection with the Helsinki Summit, the calling of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament' s position on the Intergovernmental Conference and preparations for the Feira Summit."
"I was unable to vote in favour of the compromise resolution, mainly because the paragraph on taxation is a little too sparse and casts a biased judgement on what was really decided in Feira."
"Parliament should rather have noted, with satisfaction, of course, the determination of the Heads of State and Government to reach an integral agreement on the taxation package as a whole (taxation of savings income, business taxation, interest and royalties) at the end of 2002 at the latest."
"We should have confirmed the need to preserve the competitiveness of European financial markets by the simultaneous adoption of equivalent measures in key third countries and identical measures in associated or dependent territories."
"We should also have asked to receive the reports that the Commission should present at regular intervals on the application of information exchange systems and systems for taxation at source from savings, as well as the report on the basis of which the adoption and implementation of the directive are to be decided."
"I would remind you that this was not the case."
"I know that opinion on the tax compromise that we just managed to negotiate in Feira is divided."
"This is reflected in all the European press."
"I cannot help but name a few headlines from French language papers, 'Delaying compromise on savings tax' , 'Doubts on Feira tax compromise' , 'Superficial agreement, fundamental disagreement' , 'lame agreement' , 'taxation at source, coexistence, nothing at all?' or from the German language papers, 'Brown the Scot boosts London as a financial centre."
"London leads the way in the EU tax battle' , 'Swiss banks see no need for action' , 'all financial centres must cooperate to do away with banking secrecy' ."
"The observation in the Basler Zeitung of 24 June is also telling, 'We are more likely to see the Matterhorn crumble than the Swiss electorate release bank staff from their confidentiality obligations and the Bern Finance Minister become the tax collector for Brussels.'"
"In this context, the headline in the Écho of 24 June, which accurately notes that 'without sufficient guarantees, Luxembourg will block the taxation directive' and that 'the exchange of information should also be applied by competing markets' , reflects what was really decided in Feira."
"The fact that our resolution complains about the Feira timetable illustrates the ignorance or delusion of the authors of this passage, whom I would like to remind of what the Luxembourg Prime Minister specified in Feira on this subject, that is, that with regard to taxation of savings 'there are still around fifty technical matters which have never been discussed by the Commission' ."
"In this context, complaining that the timetable did not reflect the urgency of the problem is irresponsibly unrealistic."
". (FR) The Lutte ouvrière Members share the indignation expressed by the GUE proposal, which we voted on, at the death of the 58 immigrants in Dover, and of so many others, who attempted to cross external or internal borders of the European Union."
"In order to put an end to a situation where poverty forces thousands of human beings to leave for lands where they hope to have a slightly better life, we must put an end to a social system which, in order to concentrate extraordinary riches in the hands of the few, enforces poverty on the majority of the planet."
"Obviously, a vote in Parliament will not bring about this upheaval, although it is an essential need for humanity."
"It is disgusting that, even in areas where current national and European institutions could actually do something, they do nothing."
"The Dover tragedy happened between two European countries."
"The barbed wire fence we are currently setting up around the European Union exists even within the Union for third country nationals, and these barriers can kill."
"It is not enough to denounce the crooks that make money by trafficking in human beings."
"Immigrants must be guaranteed the rights to which every human being should be entitled."
"We must ensure the free movement of persons."
"We must put an end to immigration policies that turn immigrants into some sort of subhumans with no rights, if not into illegal immigrants preyed on by the police."
"We wish to protest most strongly at the policy of the French Government, which revels in its role as President of the European Union but which refuses to regularise 65 000 immigrant workers who have become illegal immigrants as a result of unfair laws, and we demand that their situation be regularised immediately."
". (PT) The tragedy in the port of Dover involving the death of 58 immigrants is, just like the tragedy which claimed the lives of two boys from Guinea on the landing gear of a Sabena aircraft a few months ago, a terrible indictment of the current ineffective and misguided cooperation and development policies and of the inappropriate immigration and asylum policies being implemented by the European Union and by individual Member States."
"Such occurrences, which show the damaging effects of current globalisation for what they really are, highlight the urgent need to establish guidelines and measures to reduce the gap between industrialised countries and developing countries. They also highlight the great need to implement bold and tolerant legislative measures at national and Community level in the area of migration, with a view in particular to improving reception conditions for immigrants and their integration, and ensuring that their civic, economic, social and cultural rights are fully recognised."
"This was the spirit in which we tabled a motion for a resolution."
"It is precisely because the compromise retreats from this that we did not subscribe to and, in fact, rejected it, since this compromise is marred by the negative concept of building a ""fortress Europe"" . We also rejected the compromise because it aims largely at using policing methods to find the ""solution"" to the problems of migration."
"Mr President, I shall explain my vote in writing."
"However, may I submit a procedural motion?"
"Previously, when Members were present for the vote and an explanation of vote was made in writing, it was possible to leave, as the President used to state that he had received such and such a written explanation of vote on such and such a report."
"Now, we have to wait."
"Yesterday I waited 40 minutes to say that I was submitting my explanation of the vote in writing!"
"It is a waste of time."
"What we are doing is already somewhat inhuman: we vote from 12 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. and then we stay here until 4 p.m. to say that we are submitting a written explanation of vote!"
"The parliamentary services told me that I had to be here."
"Perhaps you would have agreed...nevertheless, could we not clarify things?"
"I understand that Members who are not taking part in the vote on a report or resolution cannot submit a written explanation, but why must those who have taken part in the vote, who are submitting a written explanation, stay here for another half-hour?"
"Could you clarify that?"
"Mrs Lulling, whose fault are you saying it is? Your fellow Members who are giving their explanations of vote?"
"If all the Members here had given their explanations of vote in writing you would have had your chance rather earlier."
"However, your fellow Members have the right to give explanations of vote on all the reports that we put to the vote."
"Mr President, I would like to comment on points 2 and 3, in which it is claimed that the Intergovernmental Conference is the key issue in the run-up to enlargement of the EU."
"This is not the case."
"The key issue is primarily that of how the negotiations with the candidate countries are handled and what result is achieved."
"There is still no final date set, and the candidate countries think that the EU is extremely imprecise regarding its position."
"I would also like to comment on point 10, the contents of which I think involve an unfortunate development in the direction of militarisation of the European Union."
"I am saying this also as a representative of a country that is non-aligned."
"Finally, I would like to comment on point 11, which talks of a positive step towards necessary tax coordination in Europe."
"What sort of a statement is this?"
"In this connection, I would like to quote the Swedish constitution and its words about ""the ancient right of the Swedish people to impose taxes on themselves""."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Mr Maaten has the floor for a point of order."
"Madam President, I would like to take the floor at the beginning of the topical debate, because, in accordance with Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure, this is the right time to do this in my opinion."
"Indeed, the next item on the agenda is a resolution on Euro 2000 and hooligans. And although we are certainly in favour of discussing this matter, there are elements in this resolution which are still under investigation by the legal authorities in the Netherlands."
"In our view, therefore, it would be premature at this stage to pass judgement on this legal investigation."
"I would therefore move, based on Rule 146, to adjourn the debate on this resolution until our part-session in September."
"This Rule also stipulates that such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately."
"First of all, Mr Maaten, the article you are talking about only refers to one Group or 32 Members."
"Secondly, it does not directly concern the question of matters for topical and urgent debate, as the very principle of urgent matters is to discuss them at the beginning of the part-session in order to establish a framework for them."
"This is not like a referral back to committee."
"Consequently, the urgent matter is either accepted or refused."
"If it is accepted, we must follow the procedure through and the debate must take place."
"Madam President, I would ask you to communicate to Mrs Fontaine, so that she may make the relevant representations to the competent institutions, the great concern in the Gulf of Algeciras about the presence, for more than two months now, of the British nuclear submarine, HMS Tireless, which has broken down, apparently with a very serious problem relating to its cooling system."
"According to the latest information, it appears that they intend to repair it there."
"The inhabitants of the area have expressed their complete opposition to its being repaired there, by means of a joint resolution of the political groups which has been approved today."
"From this House, we urgently request that the British Government immediately remove this machine from the bay and repair it in England, where we suppose that they will at least have the appropriate facilities to do so."
"Mr Bautista Ojeda, your speech will be passed on to Mrs Fontaine who I am sure will handle it with the utmost attention."
"Madam President, there are nonetheless groups which support Mr Maaten' s motion."
"He has spoken on behalf of the ELDR Group and I endorse his motion on behalf of the EDD Group."
"I would thus ask you to proceed to the vote in line with the Rules of Procedure."
"No, Mr Blokland, the Rules of Procedure do not lay down that the postponement of an urgent matter can be put to the vote."
"Topical and urgent matters are a very specific case."
"It was voted upon on Monday and this House, by sovereign right, drew up a framework for it."
"As soon as a matter becomes urgent, it cannot be postponed."
"Obviously, the arguments developed by you and Mr Maatten can be considered during the debate, but I am not putting the postponement of this debate to the vote."
"Madam President, you are interpreting the text in a specific way, but I read the text and it does not make any mention of exemptions for urgent debates."
"Every item that is put on Monday' s agenda by the House can be taken off the agenda again in the course of the week, should it transpire that, on reflection, fresh arguments have come to light."
"New arguments have emerged in this instance."
"We now know that the Dutch justice system is launching an inquiry."
"It seems clear to me, therefore, that when we decided to discuss this matter on Monday, we did not have this piece of information at our disposal."
"We now have new information, which we need to take into account."
"I therefore believe that your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure is not according to the letter of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Blokland, I believe my interpretation is in line with the letter and spirit of our Rules of Procedure."
"It is clearly stated that the agenda - as we are talking about establishing the agenda - is established by this House at the beginning of the part-session, which has been done."
"Regardless of this, if new factors come into play, these can be communicated during the debate to provide additional information for our fellow Members when they come to vote."
"However, I stand by this interpretation, which is linked both to the principle of the agenda and the principle of urgent matters."
"Madam President, I simply wish to express my agreement with the words of the Member from the Partido Andalucista, from Andalucia, and suggest, as a place to repair the British nuclear submarine, the gardens of Buckingham Palace. That is where they could take the aforementioned 'beast' ."
"All the arguments have been expressed on the subject of this postponement."
"I maintain my position and I now suggest that we move straight on to the debate on Fiji and the Solomon islands, as that is what our fellow Members are waiting for."
"Fiji and the Solomon Islands"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0607/2000 by Mr Speroni, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members, on Fiji;"
"B5-0616/2000 by Mrs Ludford, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Fiji and the Solomon Islands;"
"B5-0620/2000 by Mr Corrie and Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the situation in Fiji and the Solomon Islands;"
"B5-0629/2000 by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Fiji and the Solomon Islands;"
"B5-0636/2000 by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Fiji;"
"B5-0640/2000 by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in the Solomon Islands;"
"B5-0644/2000 by Mr van den Berg and Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Fiji and the Solomon Islands."
"Madam President, what is happening in Fiji is further evidence that the pathetic dreams of those who believe in a multiethnic and multiracial society are unrealistic."
"Indeed, we can see that the conflict between the indigenous ethnic group and the immigrant ethnic group has flared up dramatically, although it is true that there has been relatively little bloodshed."
"The same thing is happening in the nearby Solomon Islands and all over the world."
"The events in the Great Lakes region in Africa, the events on the island of Timor and the current situation in the Moluccas are all evidence of the fact that peaceful cohabitation of communities with completely different traditions, cultures and histories cannot exist outside the good intentions of those who are for total globalisation."
"Therefore, in my opinion, we need to focus our efforts chiefly on protecting the indigenous ethnic groups, so that the indigenous Fijians do not share the fate of the South American Indians or the indigenous populations of Central and North America, and to ensure that their culture is preserved by controlling illegal immigration, so that what is happening there and has sadly already come about in the Balkans does not occur in Europe as well."
"Madam President, we in Parliament are rightly particularly attentive to areas where ethnic tensions lead to conflict and attempts to overthrow democracy and the rule of law."
"In both Fiji and the Solomon Islands democratic government and law and order have been undermined."
"In Fiji the aim must be to restore the legitimate government elected on the basis of the 1997 multi-racial constitution, which was approved by both ethnic groups - Indo-Fijians and indigenous Fijians."
"Violence against property and people must cease and the hostages released."
"The interim civilian administration installed in Fiji does not meet the constitutional or democratic tests."
"We therefore call on the Commission to begin with determination the procedures to suspend development cooperation with Fiji."
"The beleaguered inhabitants of Fiji are looking to the European Union, which they see as the beacon of democracy and racial equality, to come to their aid."
"We also warn the Solomon Islands that a suspension of aid may be needed there to restore democracy, peace and stability."
"Madam President, I want to concentrate on the Solomon Islands, but first just a word on Fiji."
"My ACP-EU Vice-President is one of those held hostage and I would ask you to send a letter of support to his family."
"The ACP-EU delegation went to the Solomon Islands to study the ethnic tension."
"It was quite clear after talks that a coup was imminent."
"Why did it happen?"
"When we arrived we found a complete vacuum."
"There was no dialogue between the warring parties."
"The parliament was not functioning."
"There was no law and order, as those who were police by day were Malaitan militants by night and they opened their armouries to the Malaitans on the morning of the coup."
"99.9% of Guadalcanal is held by the IMF group and only Honiara City is held by the Malaitans."
"This situation is unsustainable."
"The ethnic conflict is all about the expulsion from Guadalcanal of 40 000 Malaitans back to their own island, to severe hardship, without any compensation."
"As they did all the work, Guadalcanal is now at a standstill in both rural and urban areas."
"The presence of Mrs Kinnock and myself did influence the situation for the better."
"We created dialogue."
"We had the 48-hour resignation demand on the prime minister withdrawn."
"We advised them to recall Parliament and have a debate on the situation and this has now happened."
"Amazingly the leader of the opposition is now the prime minister."
"All this happened because we pointed out the European Union could withdraw aid if the coup took place at the point of a gun."
"That aid is 25% of their GDP."
"But the country is bankrupt and the new prime minister will face the same problems as the last."
"He must make the parliamentary structure more active, work towards a cease-fire and then have talks on compensation with outside assistance."
"Outside help will also be needed to regain law and order."
"I should like to finish by thanking the members of the delegation office there who were so helpful to us."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the Pacific always evokes images of paradise: beaches, coconut palms, sun."
"Today, the reality is far sadder."
"The two coups d' état that have taken place in Fiji recently in fact show unstable States divided by poverty."
"The most incredible thing in this matter, apart from the passivity of our institutions, is that the pretext of interethnic tension is always used to explain such conflicts."
"We are well aware, however, that the true cause is not just that."
"In the Solomon Islands, the vast majority of the population is Melanesian and Christian."
"In Fiji, almost half the population is of Indian origin, but these origins date back to the last century. Moreover, in spite of these differences, all these people are at home in Fiji."
"I believe there are causes other than this ethnic conflict."
"For example, we deny the role played by those who make a profit from these conflicts: multinationals and local politicians."
"For the former, periods of instability mean fewer social, tax and environmental obligations as the State is very weak in these cases and conflicts favour the arms industry as the political groups need to get their weapons from somewhere."
"As far as politicians are concerned, the practice of pitting one group against another, as, for example, the far right does in Europe, allows a political vacuum to be created or power to be maintained."
"This practice is only possible because the population is poor and suffers from a lack of knowledge of other groups."
"In this case, the two conflicts should have enabled some people to take back or gain power that they could not win through the ballot box."
"In Fiji, the coup d' état was fomented by a bankrupt businessman who used his distant Fiji origins to legitimise his actions."
"As for the new Prime Minister, he is also from a business background."
"In the Solomon Islands, a sham parliamentary vote brought a new Prime Minister to power, elected by the power of the gun."
"These two examples support our vision of the conflict."
"The joint resolution, however, is too sanctimonious and effectively wants to restore the previous situation."
"As is all too often the case, it does not refer to the true sources of these conflicts: poverty and the underlying self-interested role of political and economic participants."
"From this point of view, if we want to be really effective, we must prevent further conflicts and to do so, we must genuinely aid the development of education, the local economy and local democracy."
"This is how we might succeed in changing things."
"Madam President, my comments will be on the question of Fiji."
"Some days ago, a number of ethnic Fijian Indians representing that community and the Indian diaspora who are concerned about these conflicts came to the Parliament."
"They expressed their deepest concern about the situation in Fiji, about its symbolism and how it could affect Indian communities in other areas of the world."
"Their concern was not precisely for the ethnic Indian community, it was for Fiji."
"Fiji had a multi-racial constitution in 1997."
"It was designed to solve the ethnic problems in the islands, including the land issue and that constitution was unanimously approved by an ethnic-Fijian-dominated Parliament and blessed by the Great Council Of Chiefs."
"It was a model for a constitution for a multi-racial society and a thriving island."
"Clearly the lawlessness and violence has undermined that constitution but we must look more deeply at the causes of the conflict."
"This House has to ensure that in those countries where we give aid we monitor the breakdown of law and order and look at the interests of those ethnic minorities who are in danger."
"The concerns expressed are very real."
"We have the ability to suspend aid if we believe that there is something going wrong in Fiji."
"Myself and Glenys Kinnock and other colleagues who have met with the ethnic Indian community want to help them find a solution to this conflict."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been observing the events in Fiji since 18 May with growing concern."
"It really is discouraging to see the achievements of an entire decade put at risk."
"Fiji had a constitution that was not based on racism."
"That has been abolished."
"It had a democratically elected government."
"That has fallen and been replaced by an interim government appointed by the military."
"Fiji has already suffered enormous economic damage at this point."
"There is a risk that investors will lose confidence in it."
"Politically, Fiji, which proudly wanted to give its name to the new 20-year partnership agreement between the ACP states and the EU, risks seeing its relations with the international community of states worsen considerably."
"It even risks being expelled from the Commonwealth."
"The Commission is currently preparing a proposal to the Council on the application of Article 366a of the Lomé Convention because, in its the view, the fundamental principles of the Convention - democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights - are no longer guaranteed in Fiji."
"Let me remind you that this proposal initially provides for consultations between the parties."
"Further measures or sanctions will only be decided in a second stage, on the basis of the results of the consultations and how they are assessed."
"So it is too early, at this point in time, to contemplate further measures or sanctions."
"Any response on our part should be well-considered and targeted."
"A trade ban, as called for by unions in Australia and New Zealand, would result in the dismissal of more than 40 000 workers in the clothing and tourist industry, and that should be avoided."
"Turning to the Solomon Islands, here too the Commission has been observing the deteriorating security situation with concern."
"The Commission supports all the efforts made by the mediators to ensure that the parties concerned can discuss the outstanding issues and differences of opinion openly and without the threat of violence."
"The Commission is ready to use its instruments to support the peace process as soon as the political and security situation allows it."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Tibet"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following joint motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0608/2000, by Mr Pannella and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members, on the need to stop Chinese colonisation and adopt a new Statute for Tibet;"
"B5-0610/2000, by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the urgent need for Sino-Tibetan negotiations with a view to the adoption of a new Statute for Tibet;"
"B5-0617/2000, by Mrs Muscardini and Mr Collins, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on Tibet;"
"B5-0621/2000, by Mr Thomas Mann and Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the Western China Poverty Reduction Project and the future of Tibet;"
"B5-0641/2000, by Mr Messner and Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the urgent need for Sino-Tibetan negotiations with a view to the adoption of a new Statute for Tibet;"
"B5-0645/2000, by Mr Sakellariou and Mr Veltroni, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Tibet"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are preparing to vote on an important text on Tibet, and that today we have the opportunity to make a qualitative leap forward in this fundamental battle."
"This is a battle of law, and of international law."
"Tibet is occupied, Tibet was invaded by Chinese troops in 1949 and since then has been occupied and colonised by the Chinese."
"I think that we must, of course, vote en masse in favour of this resolution, but that we must also vote for the amendment tabled by Mr Thomas Mann, by the liberal group and by the Group of the Greens, an amendment which asks our governments to consider the possibility of recognising the exiled Tibetan Government if, within three years, the Chinese authorities and the exiled Tibetan Government have not ultimately signed an agreement on the substantial autonomy of Tibet."
"We can no longer leave the decision not to tackle the problem up to the goodwill, or in this case the ill will, of the authorities of Beijing."
"We must oblige them and, through political action by Parliament, assert our determination to see this matter, which has lasted 50 years, finally resolved."
"I would particularly like to call on my left-wing, socialist and communist friends to stop using double standards!"
"We all remember the great battles to decolonise Africa, the liberation of Algeria and Vietnam."
"Look at the results today: the latter is still in the hands of a totalitarian system, a dictatorship."
"Today, in Tibet, there is a non-violent fight for democracy."
"There is no reason not to do here what we did there, what many of us did in those days."
"Today, the matter of Tibet must become a matter of law, an affirmation of non-violence by the international community."
"China is a large country which has a right to democracy."
"So much is clear, but that cannot be a reason to further sacrifice the right of Tibetans to live with their own culture, in full autonomy in every area that must be governed by the people."
"I therefore sincerely invite my socialist and communist friends to vote for this resolution and this amendment, in order to make sure that, at least this once, Parliament is at the forefront of this battle for freedom, democracy and non-violence."
"Madam President, happy birthday Dalai Lama!"
"But I am not sure that today is such a happy day for him, because after all, the most valuable contribution which the EU can make to the world is standing up for human rights and democracy, and these are still being flouted in Tibet."
"In the light of this, I would like to make the following observations."
"First of all, why is it that there is still no real dialogue at official level between the Chinese Government and the Tibetan Government in exile?"
"All manner of so-called indirect contacts have led to nothing."
"The European Parliament should adopt a harder line in order to support the principle of non-violence. This is why this resolution is necessary."
"Secondly, how can a renowned institution such as the World Bank be on the brink of financing a Chinese programme which is tantamount to a common or garden colonisation of Tibet?"
"This has to be prevented and hence this resolution."
"Thirdly, how can the European Union possibly be one to let economic interests prevail in its relations with China?"
"Surely we cannot offer the Tibetan population attention only when it suits us?"
"In sum, Madam President, I would urge you to ensure that a real dialogue is established according to the Dalai Lama' s five-point peace plan; it will then be a happy day for Tibet' s entire population."
"Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the World Bank will be taking a decision with very serious implications for Tibet."
"The aim is to provide international support to alleviate the poverty in western China, and surely everyone is prepared in principle to help those who cannot do much to help themselves."
"In the framework of this project, however, 58 000 people are to be forcibly resettled in Tibet. Resettlement on that scale might well gradually turn the Tibetans into a minority in their own homeland, after decades of destruction of their culture and their monasteries, of persecution and threat to life and limb!"
"A fortnight ago, the Members of our Intergroup on Tibet and many other MEPs urged the President of the World Bank in Washington not to go against the Bank' s own principles for the protection of endangered peoples."
"We have written to the national parliaments, to the ministries of finance in Europe, the USA and other continents, and of course to Commissioner Chris Patten."
"We have urgently requested the members of the Board of the World Bank to study the report drawn by independent inspectors very carefully first."
"For the inspectors seriously doubt whether the resettlement is environmentally correct or socially acceptable because of an irrigation programme."
"If public monies are spent, the justification for doing so must be made just as public."
"Strengthened by its planned membership of WTO, China, as I myself recently found in Beijing, is becoming increasingly aware of its role as an emerging world power."
"But that also implies an obligation to act more responsibly than before and, for instance, to apply the concept of ""one China - many systems"" ."
"The full autonomy granted to Tibet must finally be guaranteed."
"That includes freedom of religion, freedom of opinion, cultural and social independence."
"Bilateral talks must be held with authorised leaders."
"The Dalai Lama is available for this at any time."
"As my colleague pointed out, this Nobel peace-prize winner, who is accepted worldwide, is celebrating his 65th birthday today and has been the Tibetans' leader for precisely 50 years."
"His five-point peace plan, which reflects his profound belief in non-violence, remains as valid as ever."
"It is high time to hold constructive dialogues on that basis."
"On behalf of the EPP Group and the Intergroup on Tibet, I call on all the Members of the European Parliament to support our resolution."
"Only a worldwide protest shortly before the World Bank' s decision, which is in fact due tomorrow, can prevent things from going seriously off course."
"Tashi delek!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are just about to vote, for the thirteenth time, on a resolution concerning Tibet, and we have to say, if we examine the effect these have had in the past, it is exceptionally poor."
"This is why I am addressing the Commissioner."
"I would like the European Union, with its three powerful institutions, to join forces and appeal to world opinion, the Chinese authorities and especially the World Bank."
"As fellow MEPs have already explained, we need to put a stop to internal colonisation, this brutal murder of the cultural identity of the Tibetan population."
"That is only possible if the World Bank stops financing precisely the opposite, namely the import of Chinese people with a view to destroying Tibet' s original culture."
"How can we justify spending taxpayers' money on this kind of practice?"
"I hope you will help us bring about a U-turn, as requested by my fellow MEPs in the amendment; a U-turn which prescribes that, if there is no change in three years' time, we will eventually decide to recognise Tibet' s provisional government rather than continue to tread water."
"Madam President, naturally, the Group of the Party of European Socialists fully supports this motion for a resolution. The fact that the World Bank is about to make its decision, which has already been mentioned, is conclusive proof of the urgent nature of the resolution."
"If the World Bank finances the programme to combat poverty in Western China, the Chinese Government is likely to transfer large numbers of ethnic Chinese to Tibet, with the risk, or rather the explicit intention, that the Tibetans will be reduced to a minority. In this case, their cultural, linguistic and religious traditions will almost inevitably disappear as a matter of course."
"In our opinion, it is essential for Parliament to speak out against the World Bank's decision."
"We call upon the governments to do everything in their power and use every avenue available to them - economic and otherwise, in view of the fact that China wants to join the WTO etc. to ensure that China respects Tibet's autonomy and that negotiations are resumed as soon as possible between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama with the intention of establishing a new statute for Tibet. This is the first point of our conclusions in this resolution."
"The negotiations must be based on the Dalai Lama's five-point programme, which has our full support."
"We would also like to wish him a happy birthday."
"Madam President, 50 years on we have been celebrating over the last few years the end of the war, the founding of the United Nations, the founding of the World Health Organisation, the return of independence to the Baltic Nations from the Soviet Empire, but sadly also 50 years on we have to commemorate China's illegal occupation of Tibet: fifty years of suppression and oppression of the Tibetan people by the Chinese regime."
"That must never be allowed to become a fait accompli hence the amendment to this resolution to put pressure on China, which I warmly support."
"Hence, also, the overall resolution to demand of the World Bank that it withdraw its support for our so-called project which would mean the movement of some 60,000 Chinese into an area currently populated by 4,000 Tibetans making a living with their herds, and the exploitation of Tibet's natural resources."
"Both actions are immoral, both are against international law, both demand action by this Parliament and this Union on behalf of Tibet and its people."
"Mr President, to begin with, I would like to say that I am speaking today on behalf of the Nordic Green Left Party."
"We think that the Tibetans should have the autonomy that they themselves are striving for."
"We are also concerned about China' s unwillingness to participate in a dialogue."
"I would like to address the Commissioner and say that I hope that the Commission has very good relations with the representatives of the World Bank."
"Decisions must, of course, be made by no later than tomorrow."
"We have therefore only got an extremely short time in which to influence the World Bank, to which this resolution is, of course, primarily directed."
"It is, of course, usually quite difficult to have any influence on the World Bank at all."
"I would therefore like to be told formally whether it is possible for Parliament to wield any influence at all or whether we should try in the course of the night to get hold of our government representatives."
"The Council is, of course, not represented here to any great extent."
"I have had occasion to witness the situation in Tibet personally. It is far more serious, humiliating and painful than it is possible to describe in this Chamber or at any other meeting."
"For the last forty years, the Chinese have forcibly denied the Tibetans their freedom, they have deprived them of their identity and, what is more, trampled on the human rights and dignity of the people."
"That is why it is necessary for a Parliament which is so concerned with human rights and combating xenophobia and racism to call upon China to negotiate another statute recognising the rights of the Tibetans in full and genuinely guaranteeing the full autonomy of the Tibetan people."
"I would like to be totally clear, even at the risk of appearing antagonistic."
"We must guard against hypocrisy. It is, in fact, pointless to adopt a joint resolution full of good principles, fine words and indignation if, for economic and commercial reasons, maybe, we then allow the supreme Chinese authorities to be welcomed with the highest honours by our ministers or the mayors of the various European capitals, as is actually going to happen tomorrow in Rome, when Mr Rutelli, who is Mayor of Rome as well as a Member of the European Parliament, will officially receive the Chinese Prime Minister or, at any rate, a delegation."
"If we continue to sacrifice principles and rights in the name of the economy, apart from making pious declarations of intent in Parliamentary debates it will be extremely difficult to find a genuine solution for the Tibetan people."
"Madam President, the Commission, like Parliament, is deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet."
"We are particularly concerned about respect on the part of the Chinese authorities for the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the autonomous region of Tibet."
"We have raised this issue repeatedly during the bilateral dialogue with China on the subject of human rights."
"In particular, the European Union has called on China to resume the dialogue with the Dalai Lama as soon as possible."
"In our view, a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way of achieving a lasting and peaceful solution to the issue of Tibet."
"With regard to cooperation, the European Union takes the view that it is in the interest of the Tibetan people that we support aid projects in Tibet, provided the group of ethnic Tibetans benefits directly from them and is given priority in the management of the projects."
"That is precisely what happened in the past when the Chinese authorities gave an official assurance to that effect."
"On the question of the World Bank project, I can inform you that the Commission is not involved in that project."
"So I do not believe we have any means of exerting much influence now, at the very last minute."
"If any influence at all can still be brought to bear, it would be up to the Member States to do so."
"Human rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Child soldiers in Uganda"
"B5-0611/2000 by Mrs Ludford, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the abduction of children in the north of Uganda;"
"B5-0622/2000 by Mr Mauro and others, on behalf of the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the abduction of children by the LRA;"
"B5-0630/2000 by Mr Sylla and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on Uganda;"
"B5-0637/2000 by Mrs Maes and Mrs Lambert, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the abduction of children in Uganda;"
"B5-0646/2000 by Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction of children in Uganda;"
"Situation in the Moluccas"
"B5-0609/2000 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the Moluccas;"
"B5-0612/2000 by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the Moluccas;"

"Child soldiers in Uganda"
"Madam President, Commissioner, one could say a lot about this issue."
"Firstly, I hope, in particular, that the Council and the Commission will be active when it comes to also taking up this issue in the Security Council when the action plan concerning children in armed conflicts will be debated at the end of this month."
"Secondly, we have today noted with satisfaction that attempts are being made to reach a common solution to at least one other conflict regarding child soldiers."
"This solution is the so-called diamond resolution in the Security Council."
"Thirdly, we can confirm that we have made a certain amount of general progress with regard to child soldiers."
"We have the voluntary Supplementary Protocol against Child Soldiers and the Activities in Africa."
"I would ask the House to support this resolution."
"I would also like the EU jointly to take up the issue in the Security Council at the end of this month during the follow-up to the general debate on children in armed conflicts."
"Madam President, the situation in Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan is the setting for the drama of the child-soldiers."
"The aim of my speech and of the resolution which has just been tabled is to prompt Parliament and the institutions to adopt ongoing initiatives which do more than just respond to moments of crisis."
"There has been continuous armed conflict in this region for the last 30 years; civil society has been completely destroyed and different groups of rebels have been massacring the peoples of Northern Uganda for over 12 years."
"Their favourite victims are children and adolescents because they are vulnerable and easily influenced."
"To date, approximately 60% of the soldiers in the Lord's Resistance Army are children under the age of 16."
"The strategy is precisely to manipulate the children and subject them to brutal force so that they will in turn be able to kill and torture others."
"Adolescent girls are given to the rebels as wives, but the most noticeable thing is that not even the Nairobi Agreements between Uganda and the Sudan last December have caused the LRA to change its attitude."
"During the last few days, I have had the opportunity to talk to one of the girls who has escaped from the fields of Southern Sudan, who confirmed that the LRA has no intention of changing its position."
"Further evidence of this is the funeral of John Baptista Ochaia, the representative of the Chairman of Kitgum district council, who died the day before yesterday from wounds received during an LRA ambush, which took place today in Uganda."
"It is therefore unacceptable that the European authorities and many commercial entities should maintain an attitude almost of tacit approval of this situation, without making any attempt to break the circle which is robbing a generation of its future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, war is always cruel, and civil war even more so."
"However, we have reached another level of barbarism and abjectness when children are used to fight and kill or be killed."
"In this way, the LRA, the armed resistance, does not hesitate to kidnap seven-year-old boys and subject them to extreme brutality to train them to fight and terrorise villagers."
"Nor does it hesitate to sexually exploit women and girls."
"When these children survive, it must be said, they are in any case scarred for life."
"It takes time, patience and love to restore their hope."
"This is why we must increase aid and support for UNICEF, which has set up an action programme enabling children to return to a normal life."
"Madam President, we must also stop pussyfooting around."
"Sudan must stop supporting the LRA."
"In my opinion, this amounts to collusion, which makes Sudan just as guilty."
"And Parliament must intervene to urge the Ugandan Government to find a peaceful solution to this conflict in the north of Uganda, which, let me remind you, has been the cause of 100 000 deaths in 15 years."
"The whole population is waiting for this solution and all the children are hoping for it."
"The Security Council must hear this plea."
"Madam President, I am really pleased that this resolution has come about."
"I hope that this will encourage the Commission and the Member States to act on this issue."
"Some weeks ago, a documentary from Southern Sudan was shown on Swedish television."
"This documentary claimed that foreign investors and oil companies, including an oil company from my home country, Sweden, are being protected by troops which make use of child soldiers."
"These accusations have also been supported by Amnesty International, which has explained that certain oil revenues are also used to finance the civil war in Southern Sudan."
"There, they use child soldiers from Uganda, who are forced into armed conflict."
"We must put pressure on the international oil companies and on investors."
"We must, as is stated in point 8 of the resolution, strongly urge these companies to cease their activities in Sudan until a peaceful solution to the conflict has been found."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Van Hecke and his wife Els De Temmerman for their efforts in ensuring that the child soldiers issue in Northern Uganda, and anything related to this, is published in an unambiguous manner for the benefit of Europe."
"What is clear is that despite the 1999 Nairobi Agreement, it has not been possible to apply this agreement in an adequate manner."
"This brings us to the question of the EU' s authority and the willingness on the part of the Member States to act as a united front in that region."
"I would ask Commissioner Verheugen specifically whether he is absolutely clear about the point mentioned in the resolution, that of bringing the investments in both oil and oil pipelines in Sudan to a halt for the time being."
"If we exert pressure to bring about peace and make sure we gain control in that northern region, this could lead to very concrete steps within a foreign policy which combines the aid component, the foreign component and the trade component."
"Such action is a matter of great priority."
"At the moment, we only see these figures and examples increase, and at the same time, we notice that we are exerting too little pressure, although we have more clout there than we have made use of to date."
"This brings me to the wider issue of the United Nations."
"The protocol was accepted in the General Assembly in May."
"In July, a debate will be held in the Security Council."
"This would, of course, be a wonderful example of a Europe which does not only hold forth internally, but also takes steps externally. We, all the European Member States together, are very much in favour of the eighteen years, swift conclusion by signature and effective, coordinated action by the different countries where matters such as education and the re-integration of child soldiers are concerned."
"We do a great deal financially in this respect in different countries."
"We have a good reputation there."
"It would be beneficial if we could act under one banner and with one voice."
"I would be interested to find out from Commissioner Verheugen how he rates our chance of success in July."
"Madam President, I was in Uganda in January when some of the abducted little girls who were put into the army by the LRA were released."
"Many of these young girls lose sight of their families and are gone for many years from their own homes."
"As a result of rape and abuse they become mothers themselves, which further alienates them from the communities from which they have been so brutally taken."
"However many finely-worded resolutions we have, as long as we in the Community fail to get to grips with the issues relating to children in our own community, we do not have a strong voice to raise our concerns about this."
"Many of our policies affect children's rights and interests but this week Commissioner Prodi said he did not feel it was necessary to have a dedicated unit looking at children's rights within the Community."
"This will weaken our voice if we attempt to raise it within the context of the UN Special Summit on Children next year, at which the issue of child soldiers will be a significant point."
"Situation in the Moluccas"
"Madam President, the Moluccas require our attention once again."
"After a relatively quiet period, the recent arrival of a few thousand Jihad fighters who aim to enforce the Islam religion on the Moluccan islands has led to renewed escalations of violence."
"The peaceful coexistence of Muslims and Christians, which lasted for years, seems to be broken for good."
"The brave attitude of President Wahid should not go unmentioned."
"Last week, he even dared criticise the position of the members of parliament."
"If it were up to the Indonesian President, there would be hope for a peaceful future on the Moluccas."
"However, the dark forces that still pervade the administrative apparatus, namely within the army, police and government, have a very destabilising effect on the situation."
"It still requires a great deal of effort to identify the fundamentalist elements of whatever religious grouping."
"I would like to make a few specific recommendations to the Indonesian Government."
"Firstly, there must be an all-out effort to discontinue the supply of fighters and weapons by introducing strict border control."
"In addition, the deployment of international peacekeeping forces deserves to be reconsidered."
"The stark differences of opinion within the region' s own army and police seem to sabotage Indonesia' s efforts to end conflict off its own bat."
"Finally, I would like to ask your attention for the victims of these conflicts, namely the ordinary citizens."
"In this conflict, we should not only spend time pointing the finger, we should first and foremost supply adequate aid to the refugees."
"A humanitarian corridor is essential in this respect."
"We wholeheartedly back the request to the Commission and Member States to give generously."
"The lack of political and economic interests in that region should not determine the level of aid."
"This is about relieving the real suffering that is pervading the Moluccas."
"Madam President, I wonder whether history is repeating itself in Indonesia."
"The bloody confrontations between Muslims and Christians are jeopardising safety within the Moluccas."
"Thousands of people have been killed or have taken refuge, and the new fragile democratisation process, which has been initiated so ambitiously by the Wahid government, is under enormous threat."
"This is reminiscent of East Timor only a few months ago. As an MEP visiting with the observation delegation, I saw for myself how harrowing the effects of this can be."
"We need to realise that the violence within the Moluccas is threatening stability within the entire region."
"It is therefore vital that the international community offer immediate financial and moral support in order to solve the problems in Indonesia."
"The international community also has a duty to monitor the situation closely on a permanent basis and help the government there to end this human tragedy in whatever way it can."
"Madam President, as rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy reporting on Indonesia, I did hesitate for a moment before I tabled this resolution because we will certainly be having a huge debate on the relationship between the European Union and Indonesia in the autumn."
"However, the situation on the Moluccas is so critical that we need to treat it as an urgent matter."
"After a few months of peace and quiet in that area, violence has flared up again over the past few weeks, and once again, dozens of people have been killed and once again, thousand of people have fled."
"The tragedy of the boat filled with refugees travelling from Duma on Halmahera has probably claimed the lives of up to five hundred people."
"Only yesterday, the Jihad fighters burnt down two housing estates in Ambon."
"In that area, more than three thousand have now been killed and more than one hundred thousand people have fled."
"This is a catastrophe and many Moluccan families in the Netherlands are either worried sick or plunged in deep mourning."
"Madam President, despite this tragedy, I believe we ought to pledge our support to President Wahid and Vice-President Sukarnoputri."
"It is not they, but the opposition powers working against this government that seem to aggravate the situation within the Moluccas."
"It seems that the Jihad militiamen are being financed and armed by these groups, and sometimes backed by regional military forces, which are, in fact, supposed to protect the population."
"In our opinion, however, the Indonesian government should intervene more powerfully in order to protect the Moluccan population."
"We also believe that international observers, journalists and aid workers should be granted access to the area in order to help the Moluccan citizens."
"But more than anything, the EU should adopt a clear stance, just as the United States has done, and the EU should step up its aid efforts for the victims."
"Madam President, our green colleagues have tabled a number of amendments which may have been compiled with the best of intentions but are to my mind counterproductive, because they might be playing into the hands of the powers working against the government, i.e. those who are helping to stage the violent attacks on the Moluccas."
"I therefore reject the amendment to Article 7 (a) and would ask the MEPs of the other groups to do the same."
"More than anything, however, the Union should be more pro-active."
"This is also the thrust of the resolution and I would like a sound response from the European Commission."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is becoming increasingly clear that the violence on the Moluccas is not a chaotic, spontaneous fight between the local population, between local Muslims and Christians."
"It is a brutal power struggle and well-directed fight between sections of the army, between the government and government opponents, at the expense of the local population."
"On the one hand there is Laskar Jihad, a group of fanatical Muslims backed by sections of the army."
"On the other hand there are special police troops, which back the Christians."
"In other words, the security apparatus which should guarantee stability, is divided over two camps."
"In my opinion, the message which the European Parliament should give President Wahid - and in this sense I hope I can reassure Mrs Maij-Weggen - is that we will remain critical of the progress and speed of reforms, the status of human rights and the way in which the government protects the citizens on the Moluccas. However, we must also let him know that we support him in his fight against those sections of the army which are of course trying to undermine democratic reform, in his battle against people like Amien Rais, the chairman of the People' s Consultative Assembly who, for example, referred to young people devoted to the Laskar Jihad as the heart of the nation."
"In that sense, he deserves our support, but I also want us to remain critical about issues which are not going so well yet in Indonesia."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to endorse what Mrs Maij-Weggen stated."
"It is vital to support the Wahid government at present."
"In plain terms - and I think the European Commission and the Council are taking a sensible stance here- this support entails tracking down specific resources in order to support that government in its attempt to pacify and to actively intervene. This is our urgent request."
"We are also very critical of the situation in that region and very concerned for the Moluccan community in the Netherlands. We particularly empathise with the emotional turmoil and anxiety they are experiencing."
"We are in favour of granting Wahid support, because the moment we involve international observers or commit other forms of aid without Wahid' s knowledge, we will be intervening and undermining his actions."
"In this sense, I clearly endorse the PPE' s stance and would strongly urge this House to show great concern, and great willingness to provide support, but via Wahid, and also prescribe requirements to be met, again via him, because we need to play the game through him for the time being."
"Madam President, I think that Mrs Maij-Weggen is quite right to call the situation catastrophic."
"It is, in fact, a complex situation, in which many people have died. The question that arises is why communities that had been co-existing relatively peacefully should suddenly shift to this level of tension and threats."
"I think that certain forces are at work behind these actions, and there is a significant similarity between a certain type of behaviour that we are now seeing in the Moluccas and the events we recently witnessed in East Timor."
"Behind these actions are forces that wish to sabotage President Wahid' s efforts at democratisation. We need to understand these forces and to combat them."
"From this point of view, I think that the references in the compromise motion for a resolution, which deserves our total support, are most timely."
"Death penalty in the United States"
"Madam President, in our resolution on the death penalty which we agreed with the other groups, we appealed to the Governor of Virginia to spare the life of a person sentenced to death."
"The name of the Governor of Virginia has been missed off the list of recipients of the resolution."
"Please would you ensure that the Governor of Virginia's name is inserted at the end of the text of our resolution, for our appeal is addressed precisely to him."
"Yes, Mr Manisco, you are absolutely right."
"In the text of the resolution, reference was made to this State."
"Technically speaking, it would therefore be appropriate to communicate it to the Governor of Virginia and it will therefore be put to the vote with this amendment."
"Madam President, we can all put our signatures to what is written in the resolution."
"We know that the United Nations' Commission for Human Rights requested a moratorium in April last year."
"This year, this demand was repeated."
"They also requested all the States which still had the death penalty progressively to reduce the number of crimes for which the death penalty is imposed."
"We have many shocking figures relating to the number of people that are still awaiting the death penalty in the United States."
"According to the information that I have, this involves 3 670 people."
"In the resolution, we point to the prevailing legal uncertainty in the present cases."
"There is therefore reason to require that all cases be investigated, that is to say that the cases of those who are awaiting punishment should be gone through and, for example, investigations made into whether they have received fair trials."
"Therefore, a moratorium is necessary in all cases, even those that are not mentioned in the resolution."
"We are also given hope by the fact that the issue of the death penalty in the United States has been given a completely new political importance."
"I also value the work that the human rights organisations have done to bring this issue to the fore."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Thors has already said this, there is unanimity in this House in support of this resolution."
"We must also question the actions of the European Union and its ability to pursue this initiative in favour of the international moratorium alongside the United Nations and the international community."
"We know the difficulties encountered by our institutions, mainly due to their odd nature, in particular with regard to foreign policy, an area under the responsibility of a Commissioner, a High Representative and fifteen Foreign Ministers."
"To avoid repeating last year' s failure at the United Nations, we must urgently coordinate the actions of the European Union."
"To this end, I have presented an amendment asking that this policy within the United Nations in favour of the establishment of a universal moratorium be coordinated by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I therefore urge my fellow Members to support these amendments."
"Mr President, this House is appealing to the Governor of Virginia to spare the life of a man, Derek Rocco Barnabei, sentenced to death, who is in all probability innocent."
"As we debate our resolution, in a death cell in the same State, they are sterilising the needles which will be used to administer the lethal injection which, in a few hours' time, will kill Michael Clagget, probably guilty of multiple murders committed many years ago."
"We have adopted countless resolutions during these last two parliamentary terms in a vain attempt to put an end to the death penalty in the United States and elsewhere."
"What is certain is that many other executions will be performed at an increasingly high rate before August in Virginia and other States, in particular Texas, whose governor - who will almost certainly be the next President of the United States of America - holds the world record of having put 132 human beings to death in the last five years."
"I do not know whether George W. Bush boasts of this record, but I do know - because he told me in a letter he sent me dated 22 March - that he is confident that he will be able to fulfil the highest obligations of a fair and errorless justice."
"The resolution before Parliament notes the fresh debate which is currently in progress in the United States, not on the abolition of the death penalty at all but on a moratorium intended to ensure a more reliable but no less merciless system."
"We may well have done the right thing, but I fear, as the American Herald Tribune said recently, that these endeavours of ours are destined to remain unheeded, a dead letter, and so, the time may well have come - not for boycotts and sanctions, which are abhorrent to us - but, for example, to promote European tourism only in the dozen States of America which do not inflict the death penalty."
"There would be a serious, extremely serious risk of retaliation from the United States: if we stay away from Donald Duck or Disneyworld in Florida the Americans would boycott the Mona Lisa in the Louvre."
"The time has come for us to take this risk in a last attempt to put an end to this barbaric practice which is such an insult to the human family."
"Mr President, the United States, we recall, is the country of the world which has had, for the longest time, an entrenched and justiciable bill of rights."
"It is therefore a horrible irony that the United States is one of the few countries in the developed world which still retains and practises the use of the death penalty."
"We face today a particular case, that of Derek Rockwell Barnabei: each human being is an individual in her or his own right and must be stood up for as such."
"We appeal for his life today, but he is also a symbol of a practice which we find appalling and which we know to be going on in many parts of the United States."
"I am myself a great lover of the United States and many aspects of its way of life."
"I have been a frequent visitor to the law school of the University of Texas and to other law schools in the United States."
"I admire them very much, but I am really sad to see that state and its governor practising this so frequently and boasting of it in presidential campaigns."
"Mr President, the case of Derek Rocco Barnabei makes our resolution all the more urgent."
"In this specific case, there are reasons to suspect that there has been a miscarriage of justice."
"Clearly, where the death penalty is involved a miscarriage of justice is particularly serious; let us not forget that miscarriages of justice in similar cases have subsequently been acknowledged, and it was no coincidence that the defendants in these cases were people who could not afford an expensive attorney."
"I believe that the high quality of the law faculties in the United States is due to the fact that the attorneys are very highly paid, but they are only highly paid by those can afford to employ their services."
"Therefore, we call for a repeal of this sentence and, in consideration of the petition signed by an extremely large number of Members over the last few days, we call upon the Presidency of Parliament to write to the authorities responsible immediately, insisting that they attend to the matter and, of course, insisting too that the death penalty is abolished in the United States, so admirable a country in so many other respects."
"And it is precisely these merits that make the continuation of this barbaric ritual so very shocking."
"Hooliganism"
"Mr President, football is a festival."
"This is the motto under which Belgium and the Netherlands staged Euro 2000 over the past three weeks."
"In sporting terms, it was indeed a festival, except perhaps for our Italian friends."
"However, the festival was, once again, overshadowed by the behaviour of some alleged supporters."
"Serious riots broke out, especially before and after the Germany-England match."
"In total, 173 people ended up in hospital, 1400 arrests were made and 500 English supporters were repatriated by C 130 aircraft."
"Some people, including certain delegates in this House, are trying to trivialise the issue."
"As far as I am concerned, Mr President, there are limits to the high social cost tied in with hooliganism."
"Surely a country cannot take on the appearance of a police state for days on end because of a football championship?"
"In Belgium, an average of 1500 state police troops were deployed for each match, plus hundreds of local police troops."
"It is high time the national governments took preventive measures in order to keep the hooligan hard-core at home."
"Germany set a good example in this respect."
"In concrete terms, so-called football supporters who have been arrested previously on account of involvement in football violence should be issued with a travel ban."
"It is therefore not primarily a case of more or less border control, but of efficient and coherent police cooperation."
"Let us draw the right conclusions from the events in Brussels and Charleroi."
"There has never been a greater need for hard measures and sound cooperation in order to harness this mindless violence."
"Hooliganism has transcended all borders, both literally and figuratively speaking."
"Mr President, too many tragedies have taken place, both inside and outside stadiums: incidents which are evidence of the imbalance and social unease of individuals, a culture where strength is what matters and violence prevails over reason."
"The resolution reiterates Parliament's concern over the spread of hooliganism, and calls for preventive measures which I support."
"However, it is crucial that in this, of all situations, the difficulty of their task does not make the forces of the law lose their heads as well."
"At this point, I would like to protest at the behaviour of the Dutch police towards some Italian journalists who were filming the humiliating treatment of a group of disabled people who were being carried up the steps because there were not enough free seats for them."
"The journalists were prevented from doing their job and were beaten up, thrown to the ground and arrested."
"The film shown this morning here in Parliament contained pictures which leave no doubt as to the express intention of the police to suppress the freedom of the press."
"Different interpretations have been given of the event, and so we call upon the Dutch authorities to hold an inquiry in order to find out who was responsible, and we demand that this sort of incident is never repeated."
"Mr President, this debate is not entitled hooligans but Euro 2000, and this is great."
"The whole of Europe managed to stage a huge festival of football where the Belgian and Dutch authorities were the first to back this idea and which attracted huge numbers of football supporters from Europe."
"Everyone was terribly concerned about violence and trouble and such like. In practice, the festival turned out to be a huge success all-round, and this resolution rightly mentions that we should congratulate the Dutch and Belgian authorities on this achievement."
"There is also a small group of hooligans which has been operating for a while and which clearly aims to spoil this kind of festival."
"They managed to do this to a very limited extent. And they still manage to do this at some level."
"This costs a great deal of money, is a real nuisance and we therefore endorse this resolution."
"We also back the initiative from the Belgian and Dutch Home Affairs Ministers, which attempts to introduce travel bans for this kind of hooligan when high-risk events are due to take place."
"Thirdly, I should like to mention the Italian incident."
"What is clear is that MEPs have received information from a variety of sources about the incident at De Kuip Stadium in Rotterdam and as a result, some have the impression that the situation got out of hand in a big way and that the incident was terrible, and they formed their opinions based on this information."
"Others, who gained their information from other sources, have the impression that the situation got out hand there but not to such a reprehensible extent."
"As a Dutchman, I would have liked to see the Netherlands become the European champions, of course, and I congratulate the French warmly on their victory."
"What I would say though is that if some delegates here got the impression, based on footage they saw, that certain incidents got out of hand, then I do not think - and the same goes for the Netherlands - that we should (a) tar the whole of Euro 2000 with the same brush, and (b) act as if the whole festival was ruined as a result."
"What we should do is recognise that something is wrong and ask for all the facts to be made known."
"I am therefore very much in favour of the Dutch authorities launching a thorough inquiry."
"Fortunately, Prime Minister Kok has assented to this and I would like to pass my final verdict on the basis of these facts."
"I should right away like to express my sympathy and concern for our Italian fellow MEPs at this stage."
"This goes without saying, but I do want to wait until I have all these facts at my fingertips before I pass judgement."
"Mr President, I will start by declaring an interest, because I have been a Class 1 football referee for 18 years now and I am attached to the English FA, and also by congratulating both France for winning the Euro 2000 championship in such a fantastic way, and alas, begrudgingly Germany for winning the World Cup bid for 2006."
"I also want to make sure that we actually condemn hooligans in a very strong way in this House; all hooligans whatever country they come from and whatever their background."
"I note what Mr Van Hecke said about the repatriation of a number of English football fans on C130 planes."
"It was a great shame in fact that the Belgian police overreacted in such a way by clearing bars of decent ordinary football-loving supporters, taking them with the dross that are the football hooligans."
"The question is: what message was sent out by the football authorities going back a number of months before the Euro 2000 championship?"
"We had a problem with two Leeds fans being murdered in a UEFA Cup game in Istanbul against Galatasaray, yet no action was taken against Galatasaray - they were not thrown out of the UEFA Cup."
"In Denmark when Galatasaray played Arsenal, a number of Arsenal fans were arrested yet not charged with hooliganism."
"Then we have the inaction by the British government, which chose not to impose any extra sanctions on stopping people from travelling, even though they knew they might cause trouble."
"So all these factors actually led to a number of people thinking: ""Well this Euro 2000 championship is a soft touch."
"We should be allowed to go there, and we are going to go and have a good fight"", instead of watching the wonderful festival of football that it should have been."
"This Parliament and others on the outside should step back, because we have a breathing space now where we can take a reasoned view of what actions we should realistically take against football hooligans, and compare that with the rights of people to freely move about our continent."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that this resolution is entitled 'Euro 2000', not 'Hooliganism' as it might seem."
"And I would add that we have a great responsibility as politicians and Members of Parliament towards the sporting world, in particular the world of football: the responsibility never to lose sight of the fact that it is a merely a game."
"We must therefore be concerned when the game is unduly weighed down by either economic interests or excessively emotive behaviour, neither of which must be encouraged in any way by the political world."
"In my opinion, we must continually remind our young people, including those who are the most fervent fans, those who are most emotionally involved in these events, that football is a game. I would argue that whenever there is a good match, such as those we have seen during Euro 2000, we have all contributed to its success."
"I also understand why these are particularly difficult events for the authorities to organise - I remember the Heysel stadium tragedy - and we can therefore congratulate ourselves on the organisation of Euro 2000."
"However, against this positive backcloth let us consider the Rotterdam incident, for it took place in the extremely serious context of the provision of access to these events for disabled people."
"This should be carried out calmly and the disabled people made to feel welcome. Moreover, we were astonished by the brutality of the police in beating up journalists who were drawing attention to an extremely serious issue regarding the provision of access and assistance for disabled people."
"I would stress that we are confident that the authorities had in no way encouraged such incidents and that it was the result of seriously inappropriate behaviour on the part of the forces of the law."
"I therefore urge all the Members not to turn this into a national issue, for I consider that the content of the joint resolution is acceptable to all and can be adopted unanimously."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
"Since several of you have made repeated references to the title of the item on the agenda, so that you do not waste any more time on an error, I will waste some time with a clarification."
"The item on the agenda as approved by the House is 'Hooligans' ."
"The title of the resolution may be the one which you have mentioned, of course, but on the agenda it appears as 'Hooligans' , within the section on human rights."
"I will take this opportunity to insist, for the record, that, in Castilian, 'hooligans' is an anglicism for a type of specialised, usually British, troublemaker."
"Mr President, the joint resolution which we are about to put to the vote is, in my opinion, particularly well-balanced."
"Notably, the Rotterdam incident does not alter our view of the human rights record or the quality of democracy in Holland, which I consider to be among the most liberal countries in the world, although it was treated as serious, both in terms of the shameful treatment of the disabled people and because of the violence against the journalists who were merely doing their duty."
"Their nationality is of little importance."
"The European Union, through its highest expression of democracy, the European Parliament, condemns the occurrence of such an incident within its borders."
"This is the best approach to take on the matter."
"Any national aspects will, where necessary, be dealt with by the governments concerned and are nothing to do with us."
"On the other hand, particularly in its urgent resolutions, the European Union does not hold back in expressing stringent positions on the conduct of other countries or events taking place in other parts of the world where human rights are violated."
"Would it not lose all credibility if it did not also criticise similar events within its borders?"
"Mr President, I can be brief about the championship itself: France is a fine European champion and the fear that the situation was going to get out of hand on a massive scale has at any rate been exaggerated despite a number of very regrettable incidents referred to by Mr Van Hecke, involving mainly English supporters"
"After the final - and the entire debate seems to focus on this part of the championship now, but I suppose, unfortunately, this is how it is - a number of incidents occurred which, in my view, are just not on, and I am mainly referring to the rough treatment of the journalists, which at times was too rough."
"As I see it, stressed out police and stewards clearly went beyond their remits."
"But there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to what happened before this and what caused it."
"What exactly happened to the disabled Italian supporters?"
"Were people informed that so many would turn up?"
"I am saying this as a regular visitor to De Kuip Stadium and I know that there is space for disabled supporters at De Kuip, but not for an unlimited number."
"Did these handicapped supporters not want to be filmed or were they not allowed to be filmed?"
"These kinds of questions need to be investigated and the Dutch Government has assented to such an investigation."
"Until such time, until the outcome of the investigation, I will refrain from passing judgement."
"Accordingly, my group will vote against any part of the resolution in which such a judgement has been passed."
"I would strongly urge the Italian delegates, and also the Italian press, but mainly the Italian MEPs to refrain from drawing any comparison with the Heysel tragedy."
"It is absolutely not worth it."
"In this way, serious matters which need to be investigated would be called into question."
"My view is: something happened, which is now being investigated, but I would urge you to keep a sense of perspective."
", Mr President, thank you for reminding us that in fact the title of the item on the agenda that we are examining is hooliganism."
"Two months ago, I addressed Parliament regarding the need to take action against the crimes that hooligans would undoubtedly commit during Euro 2000."
"The measures taken by the Belgian authorities served to limit the clearly racist, xenophobic and homophobic violence of the hooligans."
"It is therefore becoming imperative to consider measures to deal with the instigators of such violent crimes, who are often manipulated by extremist right-wing movements."
"It is still too easy for hooligans to move around with complete impunity within the countries of the European Union."
"Instant sanctions must be taken in the countries where they commit crimes."
"Those who are identified and on file as having committed assault must be banned from entering stadiums during major sporting events."
"Supporters' clubs and football clubs must be made to take greater responsibility, as it must be said that they sometimes fan the flames."
"The campaign by the French Minister for Youth Affairs and Sport, Mrs Marie-Georges Buffet made them take greater responsibility and this action has borne fruit."
"I therefore believe that Parliament can provide a real impetus for the Member States and the UEFA to implement such measures immediately, as the red card, Mr President, must admittedly be applied on the pitch, but must also be applied with regard to hooligans, both in and outside the stadium."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, needless to say, all forms of violence should be denounced, including the outrageous expressions of hooliganism during Euro 2000."
"Despite this, I am still convinced that the reprehensible incidents were blown out of all proportion, partly by the press and partly by politicians."
"Because of this, we have been unable to emphasise sufficiently how extraordinarily well-organised Euro 2000 was, indeed the standard of organisation will turn Euro 2000 into an unforgettable experience for millions of people."
"As representative of one of the host nations, I would like to congratulate everyone who was involved on the organisational side and in the enforcement of law and order."
"The success of Euro 2000 has shown that small nations are capable of great things and this should not be overshadowed by the wanton behaviour of a minority."
"All Member States should, in consultation with each other, take appropriate measures."
"Not only was Euro 2000 a superb festival of football, it was also a festival of solidarity among the citizens of the European Union, whom it brought closer together."
"Mr President, on Monday, the Liberal Group voted against including this item on the agenda and if I now consider the resolution, I believe we were right to do so."
"Extending congratulations in a resolution is very civilised, of course, but hardly the task of this Parliament."
"The issue of hooligans cannot be termed urgent because this phenomenon has been around for years."
"I believe that, nevertheless, Parliament should look into this, but not as a matter of urgency."
"I would now like to say a few words on the events which unfolded in Rotterdam."
"Naturally, an investigation is necessary because the accusations are very serious."
"If a television team was locked up all night, then this needs to be investigated thoroughly and there had better be a very good reason as to why this was done."
"This inquiry is under way."
"The Dutch Public Prosecutor is involved in this matter and so it is completely premature on the part of this Parliament to pass a verdict on the incident at this stage."
"In my opinion, this is a long way off, and it is inappropriate to pass political judgement at a time when a Public Prosecutor is looking into a matter."
"Consequently, I believe that the amendments pertaining to this matter should be rejected."
"We could, of course, come back to them once it has become clear that human rights were violated, but I do think that passing such a verdict would be overstepping the mark at this stage."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to turn to Mr Heaton-Harris who, about a month ago now, thought that the sporting event at Charleroi would have to be cancelled: there would, he claimed, be terrible trouble."
"I would say to him, very sportingly, as he was once a referee, that I was right to blow the whistle on him then."
"Secondly, I believe that we should look at this matter in depth and that if, as the resolution indicates, we could achieve greater cooperation between the various Member States during an event such as Euro 2000, progress would be made."
"If, in future, we could manage to prevent repeat offenders from attending other events, and if, finally, as Mr Fodé Sylla indicated earlier, we were able to monitor a subject such as that in order to develop new teaching on behaviour in stadiums, then sport, and not political concern, would win through."
"I will end, Mr President, by hoping that the content and pace of my speech have been as you requested, that is, on a human scale."
"Iraq"
"Mr President, the United Nations has been emasculated by two members of the Security Council on the issue of sanctions on Iraq."
"Kofi Annan is a good and honourable man."
"However, he should resign in the knowledge that the world is utterly opposed to the disproportionate severity of these sanctions."
"The EU must speak out against sanctions which amount to virtual genocide."
"The alleged purpose of the sanctions is to get rid of Saddam Hussein."
"He is still there ten years later."
"In fact, the real purpose of the sanctions is to control oil and provide a training ground for US and British pilots so they can ensure the survival of the military-industrial complexes in both the US and Britain."
"On my recent visit to Iraq I saw children die of respiratory infections, diarrhoea, leukaemia, gastro-enteritis and malnutrition."
"We must remember that this is a country that has the second largest oil reserve in the world."
"Operating theatres have raw sewage dripping in, and out-of-date equipment."
"We are witnessing the slow strangulation of a wonderful nation and a wonderful people."
"I am a friend of Islam and I think we should stop, in this European Union and the European Parliament, demonising the Arabs and demonising Islam."
"Mr President, we had originally submitted a text on the same subject and with the same purport, but this text gives a far more balanced view than the text of the so-called joint resolution."
"I would have far preferred discussing a text which strikes more of a balance."
"Why is it then that this text has not been published?"
"We have withdrawn our signatures after all."
"In our opinion, the text we submitted originally would have formed a much better base for a discussion."
"Mrs Maes, perhaps we do not understand each other very well, but if you have withdrawn your signature from the joint resolution, or have not signed it, the text remains alive and will be put to the vote in accordance with the rules in force."
"Is this also being distributed?"
"Is it available, because I have noticed that many MEPs have not seen this text?"
"Yes, of course."
"We were not aware that there was the least problem with distribution, but if you say so, we will check and we will have the text distributed."
"Mr President, Iraq was at war with Iran from 1980 to 1989."
"During this time the USA and EU supported Iraq since we perceived Iran as the real threat to the Middle East."
"Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990."
"This was wrong and unacceptable."
"The UN responded by passing Resolution 661 to impose sanctions on Iraq."
"The UN action was justified."
"The USA and Britain imposed a no-fly zone in April 1991."
"In 1994, Iraq recognised the territorial integrity of Kuwait."
"From 1991 to 1997, UN inspectors - UNSCOM - systematically and comprehensively inspected, destroyed and verified Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction."
"The UN representative reported to the UN in 1997 that UNSCOM's work had covered virtually everything about Iraq."
"In 1998 the International Atomic Energy Agency declared that Iraq no longer had a nuclear capacity."
"The oil for food programme started in 1996 has been excessively bureaucratic and incompetent, resulting in long delays in procuring essential medicines and food supplies."
"Of the USD 28 billion worth of oil revenue over three years, only USD 7 billion has been utilised for imports and USD 12 billion remains frozen in a bank in New York."
"If the sanctions were intended to destroy Iraq's military capacity, then they have done the job."
"If the sanctions were intended to dislodge Saddam Hussein, this has not still been achieved after ten years."
"However, ten years of sanctions have caused enormous suffering and hardship for the 22 million people of Iraq."
"High infant mortality, decreasing life expectancy, increased incidence of cancer and treatable diseases, continue to devastate the social fabric of a country that once enjoyed a high standard of living."
"The intellectual embargo has deprived doctors, teachers and other professionals of the advances in science and technology."
"I believe the European Union must reassess its position in helping those suffering acute hardship."
"There are six EU States - Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece - represented diplomatically in Iraq today."
"These diplomats share the view of the UN Office in Iraq, WHO, Red Cross, and other NGOs that the EU can, through its diplomacy, achieve a breakthrough."
"Our parliamentarians and Commission officials should go on fact-finding missions to Iraq to meet members of the Iraqi Parliament, EU diplomats, international agencies and NGOs."
"Such dialogue will help to establish the facts as they are today and help identify how this deadlock can be broken so that sanctions can be lifted for non-military suppliers."
"I hope that this House will vote in favour of this resolution."
"Mr President, if anyone needs any kind of proof that there is something seriously wrong with the continuing sanctions against Iraq, we just have to look at the number of resignations of high-profile people within the United Nations."
"We can also note the words of Mary Robinson who has strongly condemned what is going on in relation to the sanctions."
"What is happening is that victims, innocent people, women and children, people without any power, without any kind of control whatsoever, are being persecuted."
"There is a war against the Iraqi people on which little concern has been focused, and I am glad that some people from Parliament have actually visited Iraq to see for themselves."
"It is extremely important."
"The illegal bombing by the US and Britain, which is not covered by any UN Security Council resolution, has no mandate whatsoever and is absolutely outrageous: it should not be allowed to continue."
"How we can allow illegal bombing like this to continue is just beyond credibility."
"The infrastructure in Iraq has been completely decimated."
"Again, the victims here are innocent people who have no power whatsoever."
"I also have to congratulate here some organisations in our communities who are doing something or are trying to raise awareness, and here I would mention those voices in the wilderness who are the sanction breakers - I think they are playing a major role and I would like to voice my support here for them."
"We also have to look at the fact that in any kind of future measures against Iraq we should focus on the enhancement of human rights and democracy, and we should also look at the protection of the Kurds and in the north and the Shi'ites in the south in terms of guaranteeing them some sort of autonomy."
"We cannot lose sight of them either."
"Mr President, on 15 April this year, following a full debate with the Council and the Commission, we adopted a resolution that was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of this House."
"In that resolution we called on the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to protect the life and health of the Iraqi people and to put an end to its suffering."
"We called for the embargo on food and medicines to be lifted, because it hits the Iraqi people and not Saddam Hussein."
"We called for an immediate stop to the bombing the USA and the United Kingdom is engaged on without a mandate from the UN Security Council, because again this hits and punishes not the culprits but the victims in Iraq."
"At the beginning of that resolution we of course confirmed and underlined the Iraqi Government' s obligation to accept and encourage the United Nations' controls with a view to the destruction of ABC weapons and to trace the disappeared Kuwaiti citizens."
"With today' s debate and this new resolution we are seeking to achieve three further objectives."
"First, we want to address not just the Council and the Commission but also the United Nations Security Council."
"Secondly, we propose that our Parliament should take the initiative in sending a fact-finding mission on the ground."
"Thirdly, we reiterate the need for the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the Red Cross to ensure that the most deprived and vulnerable people in Iraq can benefit from the oil for food programme."
"Mr President, like Mr Andrews I speak this afternoon as one who regards himself as a friend of the Arab and Islamic world."
"This resolution can only be supported if recital A and paragraph 1 are regarded as being at its absolute core."
"We are saying that any relaxation of sanctions must depend upon Iraq respecting United Nations resolutions."
"In particular we must ask Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross on tracing the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal Iraqi occupation of Kuwait."
"If there is to be any EU visit to Iraq it must include a visit to those families in Kuwait who are still waiting to know ten years later what happened to their loved ones."
"Any weaker position on the part of the EU will not help the people of Iraq, but will condemn them to perpetual tyranny."
"Mr President, one minute is a very short time for such a serious topic."
"I say serious, because we are talking about nothing less than the survival of a nation, and what must be called an international attack on immigrants, as it was once termed by Mr Chevènement, a French Defence Minister, against a nation which was trying to escape the new world order."
"This attack does not bode well for the future."
"This new world order, an expression coined by Mr Bush to conceal the interests of the multinationals and in this case the large American oil companies, is becoming increasingly intolerable for us."
"In this respect, the silence of humanitarian organisations in the face of the situation of the Iraqis who are suffering and over a million of whom have already died by our doing is astonishing."
"What a contrast and what hypocrisy between so-called humanitarianism and this holocaust that we are collectively carrying out due to simple cowardice in the face of American power, that great empire that this House in particular and Europe in general are incapable of opposing on any subject, as yesterday' s vote on Echelon showed once again."
"The most serious thing, and I will end here, as there is undoubtedly far too much to be said here, is that for once, a Southern country was managing to develop, and the Northern countries, lined up behind Washington, have been unremitting in destroying it."
"This is immensely dangerous and worrying for the new century."
"Mr President, who could not feel sorry for the sorely tried population of Iraq?"
"I would therefore like to think that it was this sympathy that was the driving force behind those submitting the joint resolution."
"The political ramifications of their intention are, however, a missed opportunity."
"What is more, they are a complete disaster for the liberated Kurdish part of ancient Mesopotamia."
"Allow me to be more specific."
"Contrary to what is assumed in recitals B and C, Saddam Hussein, a latter-day Nebuchadnesar, took it upon himself to raze this old civilisation he admired so much to the ground."
"This is evident from the first and second Gulf War and another five years, the 1991-1996 period, during which Baghdad categorically refused to cooperate in the oil-for-food programme, which led to a completely unnecessary lengthening of human suffering."
"At present, the Iraqi Government is even allowed to export unlimited quantities of oil in order to procure humanitarian aid."
"In other words, what is stopping Saddam from alleviating the suffering of his people?"
"In fact, what will happen with the reserved 13% for the Kurds in the unlikely event that the sanctions are lifted?"
"In my view, the use of the strange term ""intellectual embargo"" in recital D is bizarre."
"After all, the Iraqi intelligentsia has for decades strained under the intellectual embargo of Saddam' s Baath party."
"The tyrant of the Tigris is only interested in one type of scientist: the developer of weapons of mass destruction."
"It is precisely this obsession of Saddam Hussein' s which reveals the very risky naivety of Paragraph 3 of the joint resolution, because the lifting of the no-fly zone in the North of Iraq - remember this is the international guarantee for the Kurds against their arch enemy Saddam - will probably drive millions of Kurds to take flight once again."
"They know all too well what Saddam' s pledges are really worth."
"Those tabling this resolution cannot possibly have it in mind to raise this awful spectre."
"Hence my explicit vote against."
"Mr President, let me say that I am shocked and horrified at the Commission reply on the issue of Iraq and the dismissive way in which they dealt with it."
"Just let me quote to the Commissioner, and to the Commission, the saying of Oscar Wilde that in our dealings with life, destiny never closes her book."
"Iraq deserves better than the Commission reply."
"I am absolutely horrified."
"I wish to express total dissatisfaction with the reply of the Commission."
"That is all."
"If you are going to be fair Mr President, let me say I express total satisfaction with the reply of the Commission."
"Perfect, that is one in favour and one against."
"We thank the Commissioner who does not want to speak."
"Let us be brief and we will all move on."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Venezuela"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0615/2000 by Mr Di Pietro and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Venezuela;"
"B5-0627/2000 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the areas affected by the catastrophic floods of December 1999 in Venezuela;"
"B5-0634/2000 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Venezuela;"
"B5-0642/2000 by Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr-Borràs, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the reconstruction of the areas affected by the floods in Venezuela in December 1999;"
"B5-0652/2000 by Mr Linkohr and Mr Menéndez del Valle, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the reconstruction of the areas affected by the floods in Venezuela in December 1999."
"Mr President, today we have the opportunity to show our solidarity with the Venezuelan people, who last December experienced the consequences of a natural disaster which affected the coasts of the States of Vargas and Miranda and caused the deaths of 50 000 people."
"We therefore insist on the importance of approving this resolution which, in summary, is the logical consequence of the report of the special committee which travelled to Venezuela to get to know the reality on the ground of this natural disaster, and also reflects the coherence of the European Union' s political commitments."
"I hope it will thereby be possible to finance, in a significant way, the programme for recovery of the areas affected and that it will be drawn up according to the models for this type of action."
"Furthermore, we should take account, for the purposes of coordination, of the programmes of financial aid of the Member States and the Community regions."
"Mr President, as Mr Sánchez García has just reminded us, this resolution comes within the scope of the decision taken by the Conference of Presidents to send an ad hoc mission to Venezuela to assess the tragic consequences of December' s floods in that country."
"This issue of Venezuela is serious and urgent."
"It is serious because the losses have not yet been sufficiently quantified - but this tragedy has caused the deaths of more than 30 000 people."
"It is urgent, Mr President, because the European Parliament' s mission took place last February and so far we have not been able to reach any final conclusions."
"I believe this Parliament is stretching the bounds of its credibility."
"I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commission to ask the Commissioner how it has fulfilled the mandate which it received from this Parliament in the resolution adopted in January to assess the Community' s response to the tragedy in Venezuela."
"I hope the Commission is capable of mobilising the necessary human resources to deal with the priorities indicated by this Parliament and I am sure that, if the Commission, as it has proposed in its preliminary draft budget for 2001, is going to be able to spend EUR 815 million in the Balkans, it will also be able to spend EUR 50 million in Venezuela."
"Mr President, this issue raises a problem which goes much further than the resolution on Venezuela."
"The problem involves the preservation of Parliament' s capacity to respond to this type of situation."
"We have to make it very clear what we want. Do we want a real Parliament or do we want a cardboard cut-out Parliament?"
"Do we want a Parliament which fully assumes its duties or do we want a Parliament which simply endorses the priorities of other institutions?"
"Do we want a Parliament which does its duty or do we want a Parliament which simply signs cheques relating to the commitments of other institutions?"
"This is the debate surrounding the 2001 budget and it was the debate surrounding the 2000 budget."
"Mr President, I simply mean that where there is a will there is always a way and that this resolution demonstrates a decisive commitment on the part of this House to show its will to help and cooperate. It aims to show that the European Union wishes to cooperate with the Venezuelan people and society."
"Mr President. I am convinced that, on the basis of this will, we will find in this budget, which consists of EUR 100 000 million this year and will involve a similar amount in subsequent years, a way to provide for the needs of the victims of this tragedy."
"Mr President, the three points which the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left wishes to make on the aid which the European Union can and must give to Venezuela as a result of the terrible flood disaster are: first, we should throw ourselves economically and technically into resolving the consequences suffered, and not reduce this aid, as the Commission intends, in order to fund another catastrophe, this time artificial, caused by us in the Balkans, in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia."
"Secondly, we must ratify and apply the Kyoto commitments in order to reduce the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere, which lead to the greenhouse effect and, therefore, climate change and its adverse consequences."
"Thirdly, the European Union must show solidarity with Venezuela, and with Latin America in general, so that we can counteract the negative effects of the great influence of the north of the continent on the rest of it."
"Mr President, with regard to this resolution which speaks of solidarity with the Venezuelan people, I wish to express my total agreement with certain ideas."
"Firstly, I would ask that aid should reach the people and groups who are most in need of it."
"As a group we are clearly not opposed to this talk of SMBs and industries in general, but this eagerness to talk of these sectors seems excessive while we do not talk of other more needy groups."
"In particular - as Mr Salafranca has pointed out - the effectiveness of the aid measures must not suffer as a result of a lack of human resources."
"Secondly, we denounce the fact that something so essential to our group as incorporating the people affected into the drawing up and application of aid measures has not been accepted. This is necessary so that we do not find that things have been done which are not needed or not wanted."
"Finally, last but not least, we should reflect on our methods of production and our consumption of natural resources, because this lies behind these catastrophes, and we should not be regularly lamenting them."
"Mr President, I do not mean to give the impression that just because there is a particular sensitivity towards Latin America in this House, this should prevent us from also supporting the Commission' s efforts regarding Central and Eastern Europe and the reconstruction of the Balkans."
"What does concern us at the moment is the abandonment of that area, which we have begun to notice over the last year, with the new Commission."
"It seems as if Latin America has suddenly disappeared from the map of the Commission' s concerns."
"Of course, we have had good experiences with the European Union' s contribution to Central America after the Mitch disaster, and we also saw a good initial reaction on the part of the Commission, which quickly allocated EUR 400 000 for emergency humanitarian aid to Venezuela when the disaster mentioned by previous speakers happened."
"At the moment we know that the Commission has the possibility, the means and the resources, to provide more aid."
"This type of disaster is unfortunately happening frequently and I have the impression that Latin America makes good use of Community aid."
"We have the instruments, the means, the good representation and also a European presence in those areas."
"We must remember for example that the European Union is the main foreign investor in Venezuela and that we have many cultural and social ties with those countries."
"Therefore, I hope that the Commission views this Parliament' s requests with the best possible will so that, with the resources available, and with those which can be mobilised quickly, these requests can be granted and that a plan may be drawn up which is not limited to essential humanitarian aid, but which will help this country, which is making a great effort to rebuild itself for its own benefit, and probably also for our benefit, because the development of Latin America probably benefits the continent of Europe more than any other."
"Mr President, more than six months have now passed since the tragic floods in Venezuela."
"As a member of the European Parliament' s ad hoc delegation, I was able to witness the terrible effects of what is considered to be the worst natural disaster that has ever occurred in Latin America."
"It was something that you had to see with your own eyes to believe."
"As striking as the photographs and television pictures in the media were, they merely hinted at the true scale of the disaster."
"We were also able to see the fantastic cooperation work that the NGOs are carrying out with people affected by the floods."
"This emergency humanitarian aid provided by the NGOs could not have occurred without the Commission' s financial support and I therefore wish to praise all those who made it possible."
"However, the priority now must be to reconstruct the whole area affected and to stimulate economic recovery."
"A new plan for the region must include the rebuilding of homes and every kind of infrastructure and the provision of incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises, which were completely destroyed and many of which will have to start again from scratch."
"I am aware that the task of reconstruction is colossal and that is perhaps why it has been so slow. Only a few roads have been cleared."
"Water and electricity supplies have been restored to some extent, but little more has been done, and the people who have been affected are despairing of the delay."
"Thousands of them are still dependent on food aid to survive. It is vital to replace the thousands of jobs destroyed by the floods."
"The Venezuelan Government will need a great deal of support if it is to succeed in this Herculean task."
"With regard to the task of reconstruction, which cannot be delayed, the Commission must offer the same level of support it provided in terms of emergency humanitarian aid for countries affected by Hurricane Mitch, or something similar."
"We therefore urge the Commission to provide a significant financial contribution over the next five years."
"Apart from a basic obligation to show solidarity, the historical ties that bind us to Venezuela and the stability of democracy in that country demand this."
"First, let me stress that quite contrary to what has been suggested here, the Commission is very much aware of the political importance of Latin America and that in fact it has recently taken a number of initiatives that underline its great political importance for Europe."
"Secondly, let me point out that in the case of the disaster in Venezuela, it is still worth considering cause and effect as well as responsibility."
"And the Union did in fact provide extensive aid from the start and will continue to do so in future."
"This aid is directed at two things."
"First, it is aimed at supporting reconstruction in the federal state of Vargas."
"It is already becoming a little easier to identify the needs here, which was not the case in the beginning."
"I can understand people being impatient because progress is so slow in some areas."
"But the Venezuelan Government has not proposed any projects to us."
"That is not meant as some kind of covert criticism."
"It is probably difficult for the Venezuelan Government to decide very quickly what the priorities should be."
"So we first had to send a committee of experts to Venezuela to establish the priorities for ourselves."
"The results are now before us."
"In a few days' time we will forward a communication to the Council on the measures to be supported and the funding to be provided."
"The second aspect - which in my view is even more important than reconstruction aid - is aid for the prevention of disasters. That means we want to play our part in defining and initiating management programmes in relation to the natural risks in the federal states of Falcon Miranda and Jarakui."
"The disaster-prevention measures are very much in need of improvement, as we have indeed learned from this disaster in Venezuela."
"I believe the best way we can help the people in the long term is for us to concentrate on that."
"As for funding these two measures, that is a very difficult question, because it really is a problem for the Commission to be constantly confronted by the Council and Parliament with their wishes as to what it should do and where it should help; but unfortunately no-one tells the Commission where it is to get the money from."
"After all, we cannot print it ourselves, as you know."
"We will find a way to finance these measures too and will make realistic proposals, incidentally also proposals that will take account of what the country itself can contribute in view of the sharp rise in its revenue from oil exports."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5­0628/2000 by Mr Van Velzen, on behalf of the PPE/DE Group, on the controversy involving the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia;"
"B5­0635/2000 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the resignation of Mr Pelinka, the Austrian representative on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia;"
"B5­0651/2000 by Mr Ford and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the resignation of Mr Pelinka, the Austrian representative on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia;"
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Watson, the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, who said in an interview that the urgency tabled by Mr Swoboda was the wrong course to choose and that he expected a rather more mature approach."
"I agree with him because in an explanatory statement, which he presented to the House, Mr Swoboda refers to conflicts between the government in Austria and the head of the Monitoring Centre on racism that date back quite some time."
"It was the time when Viktor Klima, an SPÖ member, was head of the Austrian Government and the government was SPÖ-dominated."
"It is a delicate matter when a Socialist from Austria does this, but by no means urgent."
"I endorse what Mr Watson said because here Mr Swoboda is also confirming to the present government that better relations are now being established with this Monitoring Centre."
"He should be pleased about that, as I and many others are."
"That again is no reason for urgency; and there is even less reason for urgency when I quote you what the head of this Monitoring Centre says in an interview she authorised."
"She specifically praises Austria' s new policy towards foreigners and concedes to the government that there has, of course, not been a single xenophobic initiative, whereas there is much progress."
"She says, much progress, which was not possible under the red-green government; and of course she also says that she is not being hindered in any way in her work."
"So what is the point of all this, Mr Swoboda?"
"As an Austrian Socialist you are obviously just trying to create a platform for polemics against Austrian."
"That is shameful for an Austrian and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms!"
"Mr President, I apologise to the translators if I spoke too quickly earlier on."
"I would like to talk to you about the resignation of Mr Pelinka from the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre, Vienna."
"I believe that what happened to Mr Pelinka, a renowned academic respected by the scientific community, is indicative of the true nature of the coalition in power in Austria."
"The far right, particularly when it is in power, is highly skilled in the art of pushing its opponents to the limit."
"What happened in the case of Mr Pelinka did not come about by chance or coincidence."
"It began with slander, he was persecuted by means of an unfair judgement, given by a court answering to the FPÖ, as the current Justice Minister of the FPÖ was Jörg Haider' s lawyer when he sued Mr Pelinka for libel."
"The work of the Monitoring Centre was then made unbearable by a public pressure campaign against its members."
"I believe that Haider is, and we must recognise this, expressing his contempt for the sanctions that the European Union is currently imposing on him as it was when the Portuguese Presidency took the initiative of proposing the nomination of three wise men that he decided to retaliate by demanding a referendum on lifting sanctions, a completely demagogic, populist and anti-European referendum."
"We are also talking about a challenge issued by Haider to the Community as a whole."
"He reminds us that the Monitoring Centre is a creation of the European Union and that our President attended its inauguration three months ago."
"This is proof, for those who might still have doubts, that we must not negotiate with the far right, as every small victory it achieves strengthens it and makes it more commonplace."
"If the European Union were to relax its position on Austria, this would not miraculously lead Haider and his friends to defend human rights and relinquish their ideology."
"In response, we must give Mr Pelinka our total support."
"We must also help the Monitoring Centre on a human, political and financial level and finally, the Member States must continue to isolate the Austrian Government and, while supporting the Austrian people, isolate the coalition, which is unacceptable and unfair."
"Mr President, I had the honour of representing the European Parliament on the management committee of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and one of my colleagues there was Professor Doctor Anton Pelinka, representing the Austrian government."
"He played an important role in our deliberations, counselling moderation when others wanted to move too far and too fast, resisting cheap easy stereotyping of those we were investigating and imposing fact in preference to fantasy."
"All in all, he was a frustrating friend for those of us who wanted to move further and faster."
"I was therefore shocked to discover that state victimisation has been taking place against Professor Pelinka, first when Haider's lawyer, acting as prosecutor and judge in the case of libel against Mr Haider, whom Professor Pelinka described as responsible for having made National Socialist positions and statements politically acceptable."
"Second, when he was constructively dismissed from his position as vice-president of the management committee of the Monitoring Centre through administrative harassment by sections of the current Austrian government."
"This resolution charges our Committee on Civil Liberties, as Mr Watson requested on Monday, to follow these developments closely."
"Perhaps we should not be surprised at what has happened."
"Mr Haider said in 1992 of Professor Pelinka, after the latter had pointed out the Nazi past of Hans Steinecker, a precursor of the Freedom Party: ""The time is up for falsifiers of history and those who insult Austria."
"Pelinka has a disturbed relationship with Carinthia and his manner of permanently propagating falsehoods is unacceptable."""
"In March this year the Freedom Party said: ""The newspapers were right once again."
"Now he (Häider) is threatening us."""
"But he is not threatening anybody."
"It is quite normal."
"When I feed a dog and it bites me then I will not feed it any more because otherwise it may bite me again."
"The wise men have a hard task in front of them over the coming six months."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I want to firmly reject Mr Sylla' s comment that we have a politically-led judiciary in our country, in the Republic of Austria."
"Secondly I want to note that there are many urgent resolutions that deserve to be discussed in this House."
"The urgency on the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia based in Vienna, tabled by Dr Swoboda, does not deserve any urgent discussion."
"It was prompted by a purely personal matter concerning Professor Pelinka."
"He resigned from the Centre' s Management Board voluntarily."
"The real reason was that he refused to do something which is a matter of course, which is the duty of every Austrian citizen, namely to render account of his activity if he is being paid for it by the Austrian Government."
"Let someone tell me what that has to do with the European Parliament."
"So it is easy to understand why we will not endorse recital A of this motion for a resolution and cannot share the concern about this matter."
"It should also be noted that the Monitoring Centre on racism is based in Vienna, not least thanks to the commitment of the present Chancellor and then Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schüssel, and that we are proud to give a home in Vienna to this kind of institution that keeps a watchful eye on xenophobia and racism in all the European countries. For the Centre' s report indicates that no one country is immune from such tendencies."
"For the rest, Austria has very strict regulations against neo-Nazism and its reactivation."
"Perhaps it needs pointing out that one sad case, the Omufuma case, was a case that a Socialist minister of the interior had to answer for."
"Clearly Dr Swoboda was also aware of the embarrassing nature of his first motion, otherwise the basically reasonable and considerably weaker motion for a resolution we can all support would not have come into being."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I am deliberately refraining from entering into these cheap polemics, especially on the part of Mr Pirker, but want to keep the discussion at a certain level and stick to the facts."
"It is a fact that the Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia did indeed face difficulties in the first weeks, which were politically motivated, and that Mr Pirker in particular grossly insulted the head of the Centre, whom he has cited today as a witness to show how well things are going."
"It is a fact - and I noted that in my first statement today; the ladies and gentlemen who talk so big were not even there on Monday - that things have, thank God, improved because Dr Winkler, the head of the Centre, has endeavoured, as has the new Austrian Government representative, to straighten it all out."
"But it is also a fact that the situation remains precarious; and here I, like Dr Winkler, must also state that unfortunately not just the Austrian Government but also some other governments do not give the Monitoring Centre sufficient support."
"There certainly is an urgent need to call on all the governments - as I propose - to support the Monitoring Centre."
"But it is also a fact that, sad to say, the referendum announced for Austria, which representatives of the European and in particular the Austrian People' s Party who are sitting here in this Chamber opposed only a few days ago, could dangerously aggravate the situation and mood in Austria again; for it is reviving anti-European feelings that will certainly not do the work of this Monitoring Centre any good."
"And that is why I want to state my view here and call on the government, on those responsible in that government, not to hold that referendum, so as not to stir up new hatred, not to reawaken an anti-European mood again - something a party like the Austrian People' s Party, which was always pro-European, is in fact unlikely to want."
"I am firmly against that kind of anti-European mood and I place my hopes in this House."
"Mr President, I will tell you immediately that the ELDR group refused to sign the joint resolution for a very simple reason: we find it a little over-emotional, while not forceful enough, and does not offer the possibility of a more political and more balanced choice in the name of Parliament."
"It is because this resolution is too weak that we will not vote for it."
"We consider that the problem associated with the resignation of Mr Pelinka is important enough not to be tackled by a resolution that is emotional but does not actually say anything and is extremely watered-down."
"Allow me to address a comment to the GUE Group and the PSE Group. I do not understand their agreement on the text in its current form, in relation to the initial text that they themselves introduced."
"Consequently, we within the liberal group would like, and this is the wish of Mr Watson, his committee to be able to effectively take control of the matter and we would like to have very clear information on whether the Austrian Government has infringed Article 10 of the Treaty, that is, whether or not it has fulfilled its obligations with regard to the Monitoring Centre."
"If it has not fulfilled its obligations, it is up to Parliament to take the appropriate action with regard to the Commission and the Council."
"The main thing is to make it clear and today we are not clear."
"Mr President, my group also supports the proposal by the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to treat this whole affair carefully in that committee."
"Nonetheless, we will vote for this resolution because, unlike the earlier ones, it is an extremely moderate and responsible reaction to the statements by the head of the Monitoring Centre to the Committee on Home Affairs"
"The EPP Group also took part in the discussions and decisions on the present resolution."
"So I am extremely surprised that the members of the Austrian People' s Party are unable to endorse this resolution, which merely expresses an initial concern and is an initial call on the Austrian Government, and have chosen instead to give us a taste of the way the Austrian Government treats its government critics."
"Mr Pirker reads out some statements by the head of the Monitoring Centre but keeps silent about the terrible statements she made in committee, where Mr Pirker himself launched violent attacks on her, about the defamation of the Centre in the Austrian Parliament, about the systematic harassment, the lack of security provisions, the lack of support."
"I am sad to see the ÖVP members also giving us a sample here of the way they deal with government critics in their own country; in fact attempting to present them as traitors to their country."
"If you listened to Mr Pirker' s allegations that any criticism is criticism directed against Austria, you will see that this really is an appalling attempt to invent a conflict between the defence of human rights and patriotism."
"That is a disgraceful attitude!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating a motion for a resolution that is lacking in substance."
"It is difficult to identify exactly what the complaints are, which means we do not know precisely what we are discussing."
"Who has actually seen Mr Pelinka' s letter of resignation?"
"Who knows the real circumstances of his resignation?"
"What is known in Austria about Mr Pelinka' s resignation is the fact that various versions are being circulated by various people."
"What I know is the fact that legal proceedings are pending between Mr Pelinka and Mr Haider."
"Under no circumstances is it the business of politics or of any parliament to go so far as to criticise proceedings before an independent court that have not yet concluded."
"Every state governed by the rule of law provides for constitutional legal measures."
"A policy that does not respect the independence of the judiciary does not, in the final analysis, respect the principle of the separation of powers and thus violates a basic principle of democracy."
"Racism and xenophobia are a serious problem throughout the Union and one that must be taken seriously."
"It must be combated by every means available wherever it arises."
"What I expect of the Monitoring Centre is to take stock of the situation objectively and to look at it in comparative terms, so as to allow the policy-makers to react to it."
"What I do not expect of the Monitoring Centre is interference in day-to-day political matters and to exercise its mandate with an ideological bias."
"Because underlying the concept of racism and xenophobia there are people and their destinies, and they should not be used to put on some kind of political show."
"What I oppose is that this simplistic motion for a resolution is also tabled by those Austrian Members who pretend to support my home country."
"Mr President, the Commission is grateful for the valuable contribution Professor Pelinka has made as a member of the Management Board towards setting up the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia."
"Yet it is the Commission' s common practice not to express an opinion on legal proceedings concerning individuals in the Member States."
"That applies particularly to this case, which falls outside the scope of EU legislation."
"Moreover, the Commission cannot express any views on the reasons that led Professor Pelinka to resign from the Monitoring Centre' s Management Board."
"The Commission services have already requested the Austrian authorities to appoint a new member of the Management Board."
"The Commission emphasises the importance of the independence of members of the Management Board, as provided for in the regulation on setting up the Centre."
"I do not believe I need give you an assurance here, since everyone knows that so far, the Commission has done all in its power to support the Monitoring Centre in Vienna and will continue to do so in future."
"We are firmly convinced that the Monitoring Centre plays an important role in combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism."
"Let me specifically underline once again that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to ensuring that the Monitoring Centre will under all circumstances remain an independent body, enjoying the utmost autonomy in the performance of its tasks."
"That concludes the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Before the vote on child soldiers in Uganda:"
"Mr President, we agreed a joint motion for a resolution, on which five groups collaborated."
"Once the document was finished, a sixth group joined in."
"I think it is contrary to our Rules of Procedure for a group to join in signing this motion without asking the others."
"My group regards that as a breach of our Rules of Procedure and I would ask you, Mr President, to examine this matter."
"Given that we collaborated on it, we will in fact vote for this resolution, yet I would ask you to ensure that the sixth group' s signature is deleted from this motion for a resolution."
"We have had a look at this and as far as we are aware there is no rule which stops anybody signing another resolution."
"Therefore the signature can stand."
"But I would suggest that this be looked into for the future."
"Before the vote on Venezuela:"
"Mr President, the same applies here as to the one I just spoke about."
"I insist that you have this checked because it was just during this part-session that a member of our group wanted to add his signature to a motion for a resolution by other groups but first had to obtain written authorisation from the other groups."
"We cannot have two different procedures being applied in the same week."
"So I would ask you to investigate this matter and inform us of the results."
"For the rest, we support this resolution because we helped draft it."
"I fully understand what you are saying."
"We will look into the matter, but there does not appear to be a rule at the present time."
"Mr President, as you say, Mr Sakellariou, at the beginning of the part-session, presented us with four requests for amendments to the agenda which were all rejected, and now he wants to end his part-session with another request which, as you have already said, is completely inadmissible."
"We could carry on this way, but we would be wasting time."
"The President has already replied."
"It seems to me that he is absolutely right."
"I do not want any further debate."
"We will look into this matter."
"Vote"
"Mr President, I simply wish to express our enormous sadness at the news we have just received concerning a horrendous accident on the Spanish roads, in which a lorry has collided with a school bus transporting Catalan school children, with an initial toll of 20 dead and 30 injured, some of whom are very seriously injured."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Following the debates with the Council last night I was wondering whether this report is actually close enough to the original proposal for first reading procedure to be possible."
"There are certainly a number of amendments where we need further clarification."
"If we vote for them would this actually take the report further away from what this House is allowed to vote on?"
"This concerns Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 18, 21, 33, 36, 40, 42 and 46, some of which directly imply policy down to individual schools in Member States."
"I would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now."
"All the amendments have been checked and approved by the services so we will vote on them now."

"President."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, I simply wish to update the information I communicated to the House a few moments ago."
"The accident which has taken place in Spain is really very serious."
"The number of children who have died has risen to 27, and their families, to whom we wish to send our condolences, are from Cerdanyola del Vallés and from Viladecans, in Barcelona."
"I will make sure that the President is fully apprised of that and that is so done."
"Mr President, I do not know the extent of this tragedy, but if children are dead, I would perhaps suggest to the House that we observe a minute' s silence."
"We need to have more information about the full extent of the tragedy."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Redondo Jiménez report (A5-0152/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Redondo report which regulates European Union interventions in the event of fires and atmospheric pollution."
"This is certainly a positive measure."
"I voted for the motion but I would prefer it if, in future, in implementing the proposal, we took into consideration the fact that many pensioners and elderly people live near forests and they are often the only people left in remote and countryside areas."
"Fires are frequent in these areas and it would therefore be a good idea, or rather appropriate to use these people to help prevent fires."
". (PT) This report contains amendments to the current regulations on the protection of Community forests against atmospheric pollution and forest fires."
"The amendments to the regulation on protecting forests against fires are particularly important for Portugal."
"In fact, we must pay considerably greater attention to the Mediterranean woodlands that have been affected by forest fires, and this requires considerable financial resources for reforestation and for the necessary fire prevention measures."
"For Portugal, where fires have destroyed large areas of forest, it is vital to increase appropriations in order to supplement national investment in building infrastructure, for example, and to help local authorities, private landowners' associations or wasteland management bodies to buy fire prevention equipment."
"This is why the increase to EUR 77 million in Community appropriations proposed by the rapporteur as opposed to the EUR 50 million proposed by the Commission is so important."
"It is also important to create a Community information system on forest fires so that the situation at any given time is more widely known. This will enable us to fight more effectively against forest fires and their causes."
"I shall give my own personal view of the report on forests."
"I know the Committee on Agriculture tells us that we are having the wrong debate in defending an increase in the budget in the context of these reports."
"Personally, I consider that we have a political responsibility to send strong political signals to the Commission, the Council and the citizens."
"In December 1999, part of the European Union was hit by terrible storms which devastated a large proportion of the forests in southern and eastern France and created despair among the victims, in particular small-holders."
"I also know that we cannot rob Peter to pay Paul."
"By voting for the rapporteur' s proposals, I wanted to contribute to the implementation of a true forestry policy in the European Union, as despite the vast CAP budget, forests, which are an integral part of agriculture, remain the poor relation."
". (FR) We are discussing the two Council regulations establishing a form of systematic surveillance of forestry ecosystems which is unique in the world."
"Regulation No 3582/86 is about the protection of forests against atmospheric pollution and Regulation No 2158/92 has established a framework for the protection of forests against fires."
"The rapporteur proposes increasing the sums allocated to both of these programmes, whereas the Commission proposal seeks to cut them drastically."
"The rapporteur' s attitude is an appropriate one."
"It does seem logical to take account of the virtual doubling of the Community' s forested surface area since the last round of enlargement in 1998 and to fulfil the requirements of the European Union' s forestry strategy."
"Admittedly, there is no legal basis in the Treaty for a common forestry policy."
"We are not using this report to start up the debate again but simply to point out that the European Union' s forestry strategy is based on subsidiarity."
"In other words, action is only proposed if it offers added value in relation to national action. The problem is identifying whether there actually is added value."
"Subsidiarity works in favour of Community action in this specific context."
"It is true that the issues in all the forests of the Fifteen Member States are not identical."
"So, the Nordic countries, which since 1998 have comprised most of Europe' s forested areas, are affected most of all by atmospheric pollution, stresses due to climatic factors and soil acidification whereas the countries of southern Europe are more subject to the effects of desertification, drought and fires."
"These disparities must not, however, preclude the need to operate a monitoring system of this type at Community level, at this time when the interdependence of the stress factors acting on forestry ecosystems in general and as a whole has been acknowledged."
"Increasing the financial allocation would, moreover, come at an opportune moment, because our forestry areas are threatened by fire following the terrible storms last December, and indeed many outbreaks of fire have already been reported."
"If we are to prevent disasters of this type, then we must improve fire safety."
"Now, when the Commission' s communication of 2 February 2000 advocates resorting to the all-out precautionary principle and a Community action programme in favour of civil protection instituted by the Council Decision of 9 December 1999 is waiting only to be implemented, is not the time to cut off funding for Regulation No 2158/92."
"Combating atmospheric pollution takes on a new dimension in the light of the guidelines established by the Commission regarding climate change, biodiversity and sustainable management."
"Ecosystem surveillance promises to be a multidisciplinary activity."
"If atmospheric pollution has lost something of its extremely topical nature in the face of these priorities, it may be consistently integrated into the list of planet-wide challenges."
"The heart of the problem is political, however."
"Some Member States have expressed doubts as to the importance of forests, even though the forestry industry employs 2.2 million people in Europe, and forests cover 36% of the surface area of the European Union!"
"We have this vicious circle scenario."
"The regulations in question need political support."
"In order to receive political support, however, the networks must be capable of detecting changes and indeed risks, and financial support is needed in order to prove the existence of such risks in scientific terms!"
"While awaiting the matter of extending these programmes beyond 2001, it is our political responsibility to provide them with financial support."
"For the data gathered is intended to be used as technical justification for political decisions in areas where 'nothing to report' means 'no action necessary' ."
"- (EL) Forests play a huge role in maintaining fundamental ecological balances in the ecosystem of life itself."
"Unfortunately, the protection and attention which they are afforded is not commensurate with their importance."
"The major catastrophes which forests have suffered over recent years and the failure to react adequately in dealing with them are seriously jeopardising the ecological balance, as well as health, safety and numerous cultural and social values inextricably bound up with our forest heritage."
"Mountain and forest areas, especially in the Mediterranean, have been seriously damaged by deforestation, fire, erosion desertification, abandonment, abuse and inadequate reforestation, with the result that tens of thousands of acres of forest land have been lost."
"Allow me to bring to your attention the dramatic problem in Greece, which is at the top of the European league in terms of the numbers of acres burnt for every fire."
"Only 10% of the surface area destroyed in Greece is reforested."
"The remaining 90% is either abandoned or, more usually, is swallowed up and developed by economic interests (such as the tourist businesses generally encouraged by the government of the day), which take advantage of the fires - and/or are perhaps guilty of arson in starting them - the unresolved problem of land ownership and the fact that there are no forest land register or records of government-owned forests in order to improve their profits."
"We have a wide variety of forests within the Community (northern, temperate, Mediterranean and tropical) and an equally wide variety of general and specific problems."
"Not only has the EU's forest policy to date failed as a result of fragmented, one-off, inconsistent and incoherent action and the wholly inadequate funds provided; the Commission has now proposed further cuts in the already minimal funds available to protect forests from fire and atmospheric pollution."
"The reason given for the proposed cuts is the reduced take-up of funds during the last period!"
"But the problems have not been solved."
"On the contrary, they have multiplied."
"Such a policy is not merely hypocritical."
"It is aiding and abetting fire."
"We shall not give up."
"We call on the European Parliament to stand by its repeated votes and positions on the need to strengthen measures to prevent and fight fires and protect and enhance the value of our forest heritage in all areas of the Union."
"We believe that the Community funds allocated to forests were and still are totally inadequate and we call for them to be increased in line with real needs and the importance of forests."
"We really must take suitable initiatives in collaboration with national and local authorities and the agencies responsible and set out an efficient forest policy and develop direct and coordinated action so that the forests destroyed can be revived and reforested on the basis of the latest scientific data and methods, taking account of the biological, climatic and ecological conditions in each region and, we repeat, the EU and the national governments must provide the funds needed in order to create the necessary infrastructure and recruit sufficient personnel which, if Greece is anything to go by, are woefully lacking."
"In doing so we shall be helping to ensure that the forests in these countries are protected, developed, restored ecologically and used productively."
"Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the Arvidsson report on restrictions on the use of phthalates."
"I abstained to toe the line of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, but also because I was uncertain for another reason: just before I came into the Chamber to vote I started to wonder what would happen to the firms which produce phthalates if we ban the use of phthalates, not everywhere on Community territory and in all cases, but only when they are used in toys."
"Surely they will not use these phthalates for other purposes?"
"For objects that might be used by pensioners or the elderly?"
"Or for some other purpose?"
"I would be extremely concerned if this were the case."
"I will not continue Mr President, because this is a public debate and I prefer to stop here."
"g. (SV) If Amendment 6 to Article 2 of the directive is adopted, the following explanation of vote from Parliament's Group of the Europe People's Party and European Democrats will apply."
"The members of the Group of the Europe People's Party and European Democrats choose to abstain from voting on the legislative resolution because Amendment 6 to Article 2 has been adopted."
"Reason: Marking toys designed for children between 3 and 6 years of age and childcare articles manufactured completely or partially from soft PVC plastic containing phthalates, and their packaging, with a warning label is very difficult and in reality is likely to be tantamount to an indirect, extended ban."
"The content of the decision on labelling, therefore, goes beyond the scientific grounds for the directive."
". (FR) I have a special interest in the matter of toy safety."
"I was a rapporteur on this subject in 1992 and I am particularly interested in following legislative developments on the subject."
"As for phthalates, the chemical substances used to plasticise PVC, I have always campaigned for proactive measures with a view to protecting, as indeed we ought, this particularly vulnerable group of consumers, i.e. children."
"Experiments on animals have shown the toxic and carcinogenic nature of some phthalates, which can cause liver, kidney and testicular ailments in children that suck or chew on dummies, rattles or teething rings."
"This identification of the risks gave parents legitimate cause for concern, and should have led to firm measures being adopted, meeting the requirements of the precautionary principle."
"The least that can be said, however, is that the Commission' s reaction, albeit relatively prompt (referral to the scientific committee for an opinion, studies into toxicity, ecotoxicity and impact on the environment, the emergency ban decision and proposal to amend the directives concerned), was rather lukewarm in view of the issues at stake and in view of the objective of guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection and protection of human health."
"What has the European Commission proposed?"
"It has proposed banning toys containing one of the six offending phthalates that are intended to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three, and to put a warning on toys containing one of the 6 offending phthalates and likely to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three, and to revise the directive in four years' time."
"This is, of course, completely inadequate."
"It is ridiculous to provide for a ban only on toys and childcare articles intended to be placed in the mouth."
"As every parent knows, young children put absolutely everything in their mouths."
"We must therefore ban toys and objects containing phthalates which are likely to be put either totally or partially into children' s mouths."
"The lack of reliable scientific information on the movement of these chemical substances within the body should lead us to implement the precautionary principle."
"I should also like to point out that we should be particularly vigilant with regard to the substances used as substitutes for phthalates."
"It is essential, furthermore, to bring the labelling of toys and childcare articles containing phthalates which are likely to be put in children' s mouths into general use."
"To avoid encouraging children to suck or chew on their toys, we should add a clause to prevent flavouring substances being added."
"We should envisage revising the directive in order to bring it up to date in the light of developments in scientific knowledge."
"I am convinced that, given the information currently available, we should adopt an approach of the utmost caution."
"I supported the amendments tabled by the Socialist members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I shall conclude by pointing out that, as far as the case of toy safety is concerned, the regulations regarding EC markings are too ambiguous and should be clarified as soon as possible."
"The threat that phthalates may pose to human health has not been proven scientifically."
"For example, according to research undertaken in the United States by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, only rarely, if at all, among children is there a risk of exposure to harmful chemicals, as the quantities of phthalates in toys do not exceed that level which could be considered harmful."
"As the quantity of phthalates that might possibly get into a child' s system from toys is so small, the study group is not recommending that phthalates be banned."
"I myself do not support the principle of 'excessive force' and an extensive ban that is not justifiable in the light of scientific facts."
"The toxic effects of phthalates are insignificant, and they do not irritate the mucous membrane or the skin."
"Although it was found in the 1980s that very large quantities of phthalates caused liver tumours in rats and mice, official agencies in Europe and the United States have not confirmed that phthalates present a risk of cancer in humans."
"In addition, I am sceptical about substituting phthalates with substances whose effects there is no research data on."
"However, I support the idea of further research into those phthalates whose effects we cannot be absolutely sure about."
"In practice the problem is a minor one, however, as the European toy industry has, in the main, stopped using phthalates."
"Hieronymi Report (A5-0186/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the MEDIA report but I feel that, since pensioners and the elderly watch television more than anyone else and are therefore extremely interested in this European Union aid, it would be beneficial if they were able to watch a European television channel broadcasting European programmes."
"This would make us more successful in preserving the culture of our nations, which is well-known in Europe, rather than only ever importing films from other States, especially the United States of America."
"I therefore hope that my proposal will be taken into account when the document is implemented."
"- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have fundamental objections, based on the principle of subsidiarity as laid down in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, to EU funds being used in any way to develop, produce or market what are known as European films and film training."
"These funds would be much better spent on the reconstruction of Kosovo, a European contribution of aid that has still not received its budgetary settlement after a year of internal budgetary opposition within the EU."
"The idea of offsetting American dominance in film and the arts is understandable and lawful."
"However, this is a job for the private film industry and the Member States themselves."
"The European Union must instead resolutely dispense with tasks that do not relate to its key concerns."
"Mr President, I should like to ask if the members could explain their vote in writing if reports are being discussed or, at least, to wait until the end if they are explaining them orally, as they are entitled to do."
"Written explanations of votes at this time are not an expression of respect for the House for any of us."
"We take note of your observation, Mr Mastorakis."
"Sanders-ten Holte Report (A5-0185/2000)"
". (FR) We abstained from the vote on this proposal even though we are firmly convinced that a policy of exchange and cooperation between different countries in the field of education would contribute to improving the quality of education by promoting the intermixing of cultures and exchanges between the peoples living in Europe."
"Such a policy would only be a factor in progress, however, if it were based on an education policy within the various states which aims to earmark greater resources for public education accessible to all."
"At no point in the texts, though, is this priority stated, but more especially, in none of the countries of the European Union is it applied."
"We are concerned that a number of phrases are indicative of a restrictive and utilitarian concept of a form of cooperation whose objectives would be dictated by the constraints of the market and initiatives by firms or private bodies looking for a workforce they could train and qualify according to their requirements."
"Introducing the laws of the market into education, however, means keeping the best quality for a minority and allowing the quality for the majority to deteriorate."
"We therefore voted in favour of the amendments warning against allowing the market to play too great a part in education."
". (PT) It is a well-known fact that defining the quality of education is a very complex political issue that depends specifically on the objectives set, the means to achieve them and the conditions that determine whether they can be achieved."
"Cooperation at European level on quality assessment and on quality indicators should not therefore generate assessment models, since it is essential for us to maintain a variety of methods and approaches, bearing in mind the different national contexts and varying historical, social, cultural and political situations in each country."
"Potential cooperation based on exchanges of experience in assessing the quality of primary and secondary education must therefore take account of the fact that this is a particularly sensitive area. It must fully respect the responsibility of Member States for the content of their education and for organising their education and training systems, as well as their cultural and linguistic diversity."
"Mombaur Report (A5-0180/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the motion partly because one of the recitals states that competition does not prevent the States from imposing public service obligations in the general interest on the parties involved."
"I would like to hope that, when this recital is implemented with regard to the provision of gas for domestic use, there will be a requirement to take into account the many people who have a very low income - including pensioners who do not have enough to live on - and that provision will be made for the free supply of a certain quantity of gas or another type of energy."
". (FR) Overall, and in each of its comments, this report does nothing but extol the virtues of competition and the market economy."
"Its author' s sole concern, under the guise of unifying energy markets in Europe, is to deliver this entire sector into the hands of private profit."
"Or, more exactly, by separating electricity production and management of the distribution network, the author is prepared to allow states to manage all the areas that require a great deal of investment and offer very little profit, on condition that they hand the profitable areas over to the private sector."
"Unification of energy production and distribution throughout the European Union, and the planning and rationalisation of these activities, may represent progress, but only on condition that the whole sector continues to be a public service exclusively concerned with satisfying needs rather than maximising private profit."
"The rapporteur' s attitude is the exact opposite of this."
"Were the 'liberalisation process' he advocates to come into force, this would be tantamount to a step backwards."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
". (FR) As a new Member of the European Parliament, let me say how shocked I am."
"I did not take part in the previous legislature, which experienced the sell-off with regard to the notion of 'French style' public service, and I really do mean a wholesale sell-off similar to what happened to the transport, postal or even the telecommunications sectors."
"In proposing to outline the situation as regards the transposition of the Directive of December 1996, on electricity, and of June 1998, on gas, the Mombaur report is patently expressing the ultraliberal philosophy of the Commission which, under cover of bringing about an internal energy market that is of the greatest advantage to the consumer, is demanding that these markets be opened one hundred percent to competition."
"The process is always the same."
"The Commission puts forward a minimalist directive on the basis of the argument that liberalisation can only be profitable in a context of deregulation."
"Next the supporters of 'ever more Europe' transpose the directive and go even further (at the start of the year, 65% of the European market had been liberalised although the directive required only 30%!) and, finally, the Commission comes back a second time to 'regularise' the de facto situation in a much more restrictive fashion!"
"It is all the more unacceptable, given that there are still problems!"
"What is the point of bringing about a single energy market when electricity and gas are not compatible (in terms of production and distribution, development of the market, or notions of public service)?"
"How can one reasonably ask a service provider to ensure continuity of a public service, which is available on a fair basis, if this is not economically profitable?"
"By the same token, how can we ask the former monopolies to now become totally competitive, when they still have major investments to pay off, the product of yesterday' s political choices?"
"How can one reasonably demand ever lower prices in the sacred name of competition without challenging current requirements regarding nuclear safety?"
"How can the national concept of public service be replaced by the Community concept of a general interest activity, which is far more restrictive?"
"I could carry on like this at great length. Let me point out that it took decades of republican tradition to enable the gradual build-up of our public services."
"Is it only going to take a transition period of four years to demolish them?"
"We were consequently unable to vote in favour of this report which expresses the will of the all-powerful Commission to go ever further and ever faster along the road of liberalisation."
"Liberalism may well be worthwhile, but only gradually, in small doses, without definitively ruling out state interventionism, lest we tomorrow suffer the financial consequences of giving it up!"
"(PT) In the follow-up to the Lisbon European Summit of 23 and 24 March, which decided to speed up liberalisation in areas such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport, the European Commissioner responsible for Energy presented a set of measures seeking to speed up liberalisation in the electricity sector. These included the implementation of mechanisms for cooperation in overcoming problems that might potentially stall liberalisation, and negotiating access to the Community market with third countries."
"As you will be aware, at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council, the Commission was asked to present a report by March 2001 on developments in the energy markets under the Lisbon strategy, so that we could assess progress in the liberalisation of the electricity market at the Stockholm Summit in March 2001. With the support of various governments, mechanisms were strengthened during the Portuguese Presidency with the aim of speeding up the process that was already underway with the December 1996 electricity directive."
"This directive stipulated the gradual opening up of this market by 2003, whereas the 1998 natural gas directive stipulates that the final phase of the opening up of this sector should be completed in 2008. This has serious consequences for Portugal, and specifically for the State Electricity Corporation, its employees and for Portuguese consumers."
"This action sidelines both the issue of employees' jobs in this sector and the interests of individual Member States, including the protection of a high-quality public service that serves the interests of consumers."
"We should therefore totally oppose this report."
". (EL) The purpose of this report is to justify liberalising the energy markets - mainly the electricity but also the natural gas market."
"Basically, this means taking this strategically important industry away from the public sector and giving it to private-sector companies to run so that they can increase their profits."
"The state then merely regulates the private monopolies and ensures that guidelines issued by the European Union are complied with and it is the country's economy and its people that pay the price."
"The whole thrust of the report is geared away from serving the interests of the people - the interests of the man in the street - and growth in the national economy and towards serving the interests of large monopolies."
"The report contains quite a few inaccuracies in its bid to present the liberalisation of the energy market in an attractive light."
"For example, it is not true that competition has reduced prices and created jobs in Great Britain."
"In the 4-5 years since electricity was privatised, prices have increased substantially, jobs have been lost and there is no longer a national, long-term electricity development programme."
"Elsewhere, the same report admits that jobs have been lost as a result of liberalisation, but considers that new jobs will be created in non-productive sectors, on the stock exchange, in advertising, in financial services and so forth"
"According to a study by the Public Power Corporation in Greece, the present staff of 32,000 will be cut to 20,000 and numerous services which are crucial to both the PPC and the economy of Greece, such as the production of new technologies, power station studies etc. will be abolished as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market. Privatisation and liberalisation will push up prices, especially to consumers on the small Aegean islands, who pay a price per kilowatt/hour several times below cost."
"It is also unacceptable that a public-sector corporation should be forced to allow private-sector companies to use its highly valuable transmission and distribution grid in the name of so-called competition."
"If the EU really wanted healthy competition, as it itself understands the term, it would force the private sector to create its own grid and generating stations and compete with public corporations, rather than force the public corporations to ""offer"" their grid to their competitors."
"This is simply a way of making it easier to shift assets to large companies."
"It is for precisely this reason that an attempt is being made to separate sectors, thereby preventing public-sector corporations from operating with a view to optimising vertically integrated activities and become competitive."
"Generating electricity is not the same as producing a simple commodity."
"The energy sector is crucial to the economic development of a country and vital to its defence."
"Consequently, liberalising the energy markets jeopardises both the security of a country and its economic growth."
"This risk can clearly be discerned; as the report stresses, ""In a frontier-free Europe, public utilities must operate in the single market."
"These firms are no longer strictly national; nor are their shareholders""."
"The GUE/NGL MEPs have therefore voted against Mr Mombaur's report."
"It is gratifying that the efforts to create a liberalised energy sector now look seriously as if they are to bear fruit."
"Most countries are by now well under way with implementing extensive changes to the structures of their markets."
"Some countries have already implemented full liberalisation, and I am especially pleased that Denmark is in the vanguard."
"Denmark ought to make use of this favourable position and complete the liberalisation, as has already happened in Sweden, for example."
"It is therefore unfortunate that the Danish Government does not apparently have any plans for the time being to take the final step towards full liberalisation."
"Mr Mombauer' s excellent report hits home regarding several points."
"In particular, it should be emphasised how important it is to take account right now of the candidate States' situation."
"Liberalisation of the energy markets in the countries of Eastern Europe will require special arrangements, and particular account must be taken of the environment."
"It is also important to draw attention to the fact that all electricity production should be transparent, and that special support for this must in no circumstances constitute a distortion of competition."
"Radwan Report (A5-0169/2000)"
"Mr President, the 1999 annual report of the European Central Bank is not terribly forthcoming on the subject of the main question that all observers are asking: why has the euro, which was presented as a strong currency, turned out in the end to be a weak currency?"
"Out of nigh on two hundred pages, the bank devotes just a single page to this subject, plus a tiny graph showing only the observed decline in the strength of the euro."
"The only explanation given is the difference in economic health and structures between Europe and the United States."
"Although that is true, it is not a sufficient reason."
"It should be mentioned, first of all, that Europe is not a single country, with one people, one state, and one economic government and that, consequently, the euro is generally considered to be more vulnerable than a national currency."
"Furthermore, it was launched at too high a level at the outset, precisely because it was evaluated in relation to the existing rates for genuine national currencies, even though it has none of their intrinsic qualities."
"How do European leaders intend to combat this depreciation?"
"Firstly, indirectly, by means of policies to promote growth, an approach we can only endorse."
"At the same time, however, we see the European Central Bank raising interest rates, officially in order to combat a non-existent risk of inflation, but in reality in order to support the parity of the euro."
"It is a double-edged sword, because, if it is used at the wrong moment in the cycle, it may cancel out the growth that they are trying to stimulate by other means."
"The other dubious solution is the headlong rush to strengthen the eleven members of the euro zone, which is supposed to lead gradually to a single European economic government."
"This will not change a great deal in the short term."
"In order to deal with the root of the matter, we should have to deny the nations of Europe any autonomy whatsoever, but this is patently impossible."
"In any event, a deadlock is being imposed on the system at the same time."
"As I explained at a recent symposium of the French National Assembly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is intended to serve, among other things, to put an even greater stranglehold on the peoples of Europe in relation to Community law and hence also in relation to the single currency."
"This venture is helping to take us to a point where we lose our freedoms."
"Mr President, surely you agree that these are not explanations of vote, but simply a continuation of the debate."
"I still do not know how Mr Berthu voted, not that I am interested, but this is not an explanation of vote, this is just a continuation of the debate."
"I voted for the Radwan report despite the fact that point 9 on page 8 calls upon Member States to speed up the structural reforms of the social insurance systems in wording which does not convince me."
"Is it the usual request which, with these words, so often disguises the request to cut down on citizens' pensions in order to reduce the budgetary expenditure of national governments?"
"If this is the aim of the report, I would stress that it should rather be interpreted as rationalisation to avoid wastage in social security benefits, for if they were administered more efficiently it would not be necessary to continually cut benefits and the pensions of the elderly throughout Europe."
"The report we are now considering attempts to defend the monetarist policies of the European Central Bank, particularly on price stability, whilst forgetting that we do not currently have a continually falling interest rate. On the contrary, we are in a phase of constant increases, which have very serious repercussions on the incomes of less well-off families who use bank loans to buy their own homes, which is what happens in Portugal."
"The rapporteur, who is delighted with the conduct of the ECB, considers that what is crucial is strict observation of the nominal convergence criteria in the Stability Pact, for applicant countries too, together with the policies linked with these criteria. These policies include wage moderation, the flexibility of the labour market and of social security systems and speeding up the liberalisation of the services and capital sectors."
"The rapporteur even goes so far as to criticise euro area countries that have reduced working hours since, as he sees it, this attitude contributes to ""rendering labour markets more rigid instead of more flexible"" ."
"The rapporteur therefore puts himself in the position of defending the most refined form of capitalist neo-liberalism, at which we must protest most vehemently by voting against the report."
"Karas Report (A5-0170/2000)"
"Mr President, we are discussing the European Parliament report on the information strategy to be adopted in the final phase of application of monetary union."
"I would like to make it clear to Mrs Peijs that I voted against this report."
"This report reflects the concern felt by many leaders in the face of the public' s virtually total lack of interest in the implementation of the euro."
"We are, however, eighteen months away from a crucial deadline: the withdrawal of national currencies and the start of the physical circulation of euro notes and coins."
"So far, admittedly, progress has been relatively smooth for the euro, as the initial phase has principally involved technical experts, bankers, investment experts and stock market traders, who have all had adequate warning and who, moreover, are favourable to the idea on the whole."
"In such circumstances, it is not surprising that the euro has been easy to establish in this phase."
"From now on, however, progress promises to be a lot less smooth, since the euro is about to come up against the citizens who, more often than not, have not yet fully understood what is going to be expected of them and who are going to find themselves cornered by decisions which have already been taken."
"In order to make up for this omission, the European Parliament is demanding that the information policy be stepped up, increasing appropriations by approximately 30%, to EUR 38 million per annum."
"In order to deal with the complexes of decision-makers who might be experiencing doubts, it adds, somewhat ingenuously, that, to quote the resolution voted on, ""according to Article 37(b) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, information policy is an autonomous action which needs no legal basis"" ."
"In such circumstances, indeed, why should we hold back?"
"Let me mention, incidentally, that we have always challenged the Commission' s option to make expenditure commitments without a legal basis, and we also challenged this interinstitutional agreement which the Council was weak enough to accept in contravention of the customary principles of proper management of public monies."
"Mr President, I will endeavour to comply with Mrs Peijs' wishes and keep my speech short."
"I will simply say that I voted for this report in the hope that, on 31 December 2001, all the pensioners will be presented with a calculator which will convert their own currency into euro."
"Mr President, I am one of those MEPs who has tabled Amendment 7 with the request that the Commission's euro information campaign be restricted to those countries that are part of the area in which the currency is at present being used."
"This means that Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom should remain outside the campaign while the krona and the pound are still the currencies of those countries."
"It is a reasonable request that the EU not carry out tax-funded campaigns in Member States on sensitive internal political issues."
"In the end, it is a question of tolerance for one another and of respect for each nation's democratic process."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mr Karas' s communication strategy for implementing EMU."
"Introduction of the new common notes and coins will have considerable practical significance for individuals and companies, not only because the coins and notes are new but also because the 'new prices' have to be got used to once the present ones have been converted into the common currency."
"Money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence."
"It is therefore important that the necessary information should be made available, and more information should of course be made available than we receive whenever countries at present introduce new designs on notes and coins."
"In our vote, we attached importance to information being provided in the individual countries by the Member States and to special agreements being entered into with the Member States concerning this issue."
"We agree that it is right for the Danish Government not to have entered into such an agreement."
"We look forward to a situation in which Denmark too can enter into such an agreement once the Danish people have hopefully said yes to the common currency in the referendum on 28 September 2000."
"- (NL) My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, has never been in favour of rushing through a common currency within the EU."
"The euro is preventing us from regulating the economy by adjusting interest rates and exchange rates."
"Furthermore, the so-called stability of the euro is financed by large cuts in unemployment benefits and in provisions for education, health care, housing and public transport."
"I am therefore of the opinion that the euro is only convenient for businesspeople, lavish holidaymakers and MEPs, but not for the majority of people."
"Insofar as there was ever faith in the euro, this faith has been eroded extensively since the euro has dropped in value compared to the Danish Kroner, the Swedish Kronor, the British Pound and the currency of many countries outside the European Union."
"I can therefore imagine that those pro-euro now feel the need for a propaganda campaign."
"The Karas report mainly intends to instil more confidence in the euro among the public at large by, inter alia, involving sports associations and education."
"In addition, it intends to denounce the practices of swindlers and those increasing prices who are cashing in on the introduction of the euro."
"I wholeheartedly endorse this part of the report, but I was unable to assent to the proposal as a whole."
"I reject the Karas report in its entirety."
"While the aim of familiarising Europeans with their future currency is a perfectly legitimate one, given that the decision to give up national currencies has already been taken (in conditions which I deplore), I am adamant in rejecting the propaganda this text puts forward in support of what Mr Karas terms ""an essential, identity-building factor in the process of European integration"" ."
"This text at least has the merit of exposing the outrageous untruth to which the supporters of a federal Europe resorted when they asked the French to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in 1992."
"At that time, the single currency was presented as a purely technical instrument to improve the operation of the economy in relation to the dollar and the yen, and as an operation that was perfectly neutral in terms of national sovereignty."
"How far we were then from seeing it as the key element in the process of integration!"
"This text will be an essential weapon, let us have no doubt, for all the people in Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark fighting to safeguard their national democracies."
"The euro, even though its supporters in these countries deny it today, is in fact the instrument of warfare of a federal Europe rejected by the overwhelming majority of its peoples."
"So when the honourable Members reject the amendment tabled by William Abitbol, simply asking that this integrationist objective be clearly stated in the Commission' s communication programmes, they are contributing to a propaganda operation which their voters will most certainly punish them for."
"The resolution of the Karas report claims that women for some reason do not share the general enthusiasm which should have greeted the implementation of the euro."
"This smacks of the unpleasant tones of revolutionary propagandists of every age, seeing reactionary plots between the cloth and the women in every household rejecting the bright revolutionary future."
"It seems not to have occurred to anyone that it is perhaps because of their day-to-day experience of economics that women are more than reluctant about the transition to the euro."
"This is a despicable attitude, which reveals the dictatorship of the orthodox thinking which involves branding the men or women that oppose the euro, or who merely show some reluctance, as ignorant, illiterate or uneducated."
"This is where blind federalism takes us!"
"Lambert Report (A5-0162/2000)"
"(FR) The annual reports from the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions belong to the traditions of this House. Parliament in turn responds to the reports from both these bodies with two reports of its own that do not vary greatly from year to year."
"There is a new feature, however, this year."
"The Thors report, supported in particular by the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr Söderman' s request, is attempting to give the Ombudsman a general right of access to all the documents that need to be consulted when investigating the case for a complaint."
"We are opposed to this proposal, not because we reject supervision of the administration, but because such powers exceed the jurisdiction of an Ombudsman and approximate to those of a judge."
"It is obvious, and we will certainly not deny it, that the frenzied Community administration and the ravages it causes cannot but add to the dissatisfaction of our fellow citizens and, hence, give rise to ever more appeals."
"The proliferation of competencies, the diversification of spheres of intervention and the legislative bulimia of the Commission and the European Parliament will no doubt do nothing to make this phenomenon any better."
"The Ombudsman and his colleagues are not, however, the right people to meet these challenges."
"It is our political responsibility to cut such disputes off at source by giving our work precedence over issuing activist texts to justify our existence, with proper respect for the principle of subsidiarity which will prevent the European Union ruling on subjects that are none of its concern, and by ourselves, if necessary, making use of the authority we have in terms of supervising Community bodies."
"Too often we have seen this House hiding behind expert committees because it refused to accept its own political responsibilities."
"If we have to allow the Ombudsman to monitor administrative problems, we must, for our part, learn how, before and after the fact, to control the insane Community machinery which is running amok."
"The excesses we must fight are often the product of the very nature of the current construction of Europe, something we must tackle at the very root."
"Atkins Report (A5-0162/2000)"
"Mr President, do not tell Mrs Peijs that I am not doing my best to comply with her wishes."
"I voted for the Atkins report because it is extremely important for pensioners, who do not have much time left, to arrive at their destination on time when they travel by air as they are always short of time."
"This part-session has produced a rich crop of reports on transport."
"I must, unfortunately, observe, however, that this sector is examined only from the Liberal point of view."
"Mr Atkins' s report on the European Commission proposal on the single European sky goes along with this rationale of liberalisation at any price."
"This was the cause of the French air traffic controllers' strike last week."
"This was how they expressed their concerns about a purely commercial view of their profession."
"I understand their action, and I can certainly not say as much for Mr Atkins, whose report urges the Commission to encourage Member State governments that currently tolerate a situation where national labour disputes disrupt air traffic to tackle the problem as a matter of urgency"" ."
"It is pathetic!"
"No one can deny that the air traffic situation has deteriorated."
"Air traffic corridors and airports are at saturation point, delays are common, with one in three aircraft behind schedule, and the whole business is accompanied by a trail of environmental and noise pollution."
"I wish therefore to pay tribute to the determination of Mrs de Palacio, the Commissioner responsible for transport, in tackling the problem head-on in order to achieve the creation of a single European sky as soon as possible."
"I disagree entirely, however, with the means she puts forward and with the report' s proposals."
"The report proposes to introduce competition among air traffic control centres, taking away the link between regulatory authorities and operators."
"The supervisory function would be carried out within separate companies whose capital would be open to air companies or private partners."
"Such liberalisation would serve to jeopardise air transport safety, and this, of course, is unacceptable and contradictory to the EC Treaty, according to which improvement of transport safety is one of the chief objectives of common transport policy."
"France would certainly seem to be the odd man out in Europe, where, in most countries, air traffic control is administered by agencies, under state supervision but open to private capital."
"France wishes to keep these activities in the public sector."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be applied here, and each Member State must retain control of the organisation of air traffic control."
"This is essential, especially as the problem with delays is not caused by air traffic control, which is responsible for less than 25% of all delays!"
"In conclusion, I support the proposals to strengthen the role of Eurocontrol, the pan-European agency responsible for the management of the airspace of European states, be they members of the European Union or not, in its capacity as regulatory authority."
"The report is wrong to underestimate this agency' s potential, but I have voted against a report which is completely unacceptable."
". (FR) I voted against Mr Atkins' report because it is totally at odds with the real world and is in keeping with an a priori ideological vision rather than with any concern to meet the real needs of our fellow-citizens and air transport users."
"We cannot, of course, deny that there is a need to improve the situation of regulation and air traffic control in Europe in the spirit of the single European sky."
"It is perfectly obvious that the aircraft in our airspace should not be on the receiving end of inconsistent, uncoordinated and complicated handling of their flight plans."
"And it is true that, although some progress has been made with Eurocontrol, the time has already come to move on to the next phase and to improve the system, bearing in mind one absolute imperative: safety."
"Moreover, the United States have never liberalised their own air traffic control, as this is managed by a single state agency. That just goes to show!"
"The Atkins report, however, is entirely concerned with the goal of opening the service up to competition, even though it is hard to see exactly how it could be a source of private profit or how the profits made could possibly reflect its performance!"
"The pretext for driving forward this liberalisation, furthermore, is delays in flights."
"This is certainly a situation that must be remedied, but, in order to be effective, we should really analyse the actual reasons for delays and the real solutions."
"We should first of all note that there have been positive developments this year as delays have substantially reduced in France."
"This indicates in the first place that we should make a distinction between temporary disruption (use of airspace by the military for Kosovo, the change in the control system, etc.) and structural problems."
"We must also measure the problems due to the air companies or the limited European civil airspace with regard to the number of overflights."
"Air traffic control does not play a very significant part in causing delays, in the final analysis, and, in any case, improvement of the system involves improving the organisation of the coordination of the various Member State control systems, supporting Eurocontrol in this role."
"This should be the priority and the guidelines on the single European sky."
"Unfortunately, the Commission does not appear to be on this track, and the Atkins report is even further off the mark."
"- (NL) The aviation sector has traditionally been organised in a particularly liberal manner."
"The reason for this is that governments compete with each other by building ever more and ever larger airports, and that apart from these airports, there is no need for creating infrastructure comparable to railways or motorways."
"As such, since time immemorial it has been common practice in this sector for different companies to compete with each other for the same route."
"Airfares bear out this freedom too."
"There is no link whatsoever between the distance to be covered and the fare."
"Where passengers are wanted, prices are low; where it is believed that there are more than enough passengers, prices are high."
"There is little left to be liberalised in this sector."
"Despite this, there are people who expect further liberalisation to be a panacea."
"It is supposed to lead to cheaper flights, a wider range of flights and no more delays."
"According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, this consideration is very one-sided and only serves two interests: that of airline companies and that of the consumer, whose only focus is more and ever cheaper flights."
"In our opinion, a number of other aspects take priority over this, such as passenger safety, livelihoods and the working environment of the employees, environmental protection and the protection of the railway industry from price dumping and other forms of unfair competition."
"There is little point in blaming the workers for everything that could cause irritation among passengers. These workers are sometimes obliged to strike out of self-preservation."
"Neither is this the fault of Eurocontrol, which has taken over a number of cross-border state responsibilities."
"Safety should not come second to the pursuit of profit by companies which aim to take over Eurocontrol' s market."
"The problem has far more to do with the excessive growth in aviation and price competition at the expense of long-distance rail transport."
"The current proposals do not address this problem."
"From this critical stance, we tabled 11 amendments."
"Since it has transpired that a majority within Parliament does not support our stance on this, we were unable to assent to the final version of the Atkins report."
"(PT) Although this report deals with certain real situations, such as the increase in air traffic or the delays experienced on various routes, and although it is based on certain correct premises, specifically the need to guarantee and strengthen air transport safety, it nevertheless glosses over the underlying causes of these situations, which are inextricably linked with successive actions to liberalise air transport and with the unbridled competition that has resulted from this. In particular, it draws hasty and mistaken conclusions, which lean markedly towards the liberalisation of airspace and towards the future control of this airspace by the main air transport companies."
"Since it is true that effective cooperation is required and since technical and disciplinary measures are essential in this area, we do not support these guidelines, which are even more radically in favour of liberalisation than those suggested by the Commission."
"If these guidelines were followed, they would exacerbate safety problems and would lead to greater social problems, in addition to raising questions about the sovereignty of each state over its air space. These questions are all the more relevant because this air space is shared by their respective military air forces."
". (FR) On 26 June 2000, French air traffic controllers went on strike to protest against the plans of the European Union to liberalise air traffic control."
"I should like to show my solidarity with this strike and with the demands of the air traffic controllers' unions."
"The responses to the saturation of European airspace are pushing us into a headlong rush, with airports and airstrips proliferating, the working conditions of employees in the sector deteriorating and pollution on the increase."
"We, on the other hand, are in favour of the harmonised development of transport on a European level, prioritising the fulfilment of real social needs, and opting for railways as the best solution for most needs, particularly for distances of less than 500 kilometres."
"Liberalising air traffic control will not solve the problem of delays, since only 20 to 30% of delays can be attributable to air traffic control."
"It is known that today the military have seized, in France for example, 80% of the available airspace."
"Why has this never been challenged?"
"The Commission is using the delays as an excuse to move towards a split between a European regulatory office and the establishment of a privatised internal market for the provision of air traffic services."
"Such measures, undertaken under pressure from lobbying by air companies, can be implemented only to the detriment of safety, especially given that the companies themselves will be able to put themselves forward to provide such services."
"It is for all these reasons that I voted against this report."
"Damião Report (A5-0141/2000)"
"I voted for the Damião report, Mr President, partly because I voted for the amendment which stipulated that women on maternity leave should receive a full allowance."
"Maternity is not an illness."
"This morning, the Italian newspapers contained the news that medical treatment for dogs and cats will be tax deductible."
"If there is enough money to spend on dogs and cats, there ought to be enough for women on maternity leave, who are not ill but people who have the right to a full allowance."
"Mr President, this report on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding is very valid and is a step in the right direction. Point 11 in particular contains many positive proposals."
"At the same time, I would like to warn against a development whereby we in the European Parliament end up devoting ourselves to social policies and social legislation, something which I think is, on all accounts, the duty of the Member States."
"It is a very important part of the cultural and social identity which every nation and every country creates."
"This is one of the most important questions of all in every election campaign in Sweden and in other countries."
"Let this remain a national issue!"
"Mr President, the pregnant mother and her unborn child, mothers who have recently given birth and breastfeeding mothers need as much support as possible during this very important period, which is important not only to the individual mother and child but also to society, remembering the low birth rate and ageing population in Europe today."
"Certainly companies have social responsibilities."
"But surely governments should set an example, especially in those countries like my own where the role of mother and the family is protected in the constitution."
"Unfortunately this does not appear to be the case in Ireland regarding paid maternity leave, facilities for breastfeeding and exemption from night shifts."
"I give these examples to highlight the fact that just because a directive has been agreed it does not mean it has been implemented."
"It is high time we stopped paying lip service to working mothers, their children and their families in our European Community."
". (FR) In this report, we voted in favour of the paragraphs which contributed towards protecting the working women, both in terms of their health and wages and in terms of children' s health."
"It is, however, to be deplored that the report does not even propose to bring the advantages and rights into line with the countries where these are most favourable to pregnant women in work."
"Moreover, we should not like our vote in favour of the specific protection of women night-workers during pregnancy to be interpreted as legitimising women' s working night shifts."
"Quite the contrary, we wish to restate our opposition to night work, if it is not socially useful, not just for women, but also for men."
"The prohibition of night work for women is a right acquired by the working movement in France."
"To revoke this would be a retrograde step in social terms."
"To speak of equality between men and women is hypocrisy."
"This hypocrisy is intended to conceal the fact that the legislator is more concerned to reassure employers that their factories may be operated profitably than to guarantee the health and safety of employees."
". I abstained on Amendment No 2 submitted in the name of Mr Bushill-Matthews which called for the special needs of SMEs to be recognised when implementing Health and Safety legislation."
"I have every sympathy with this desire but the amendment is superfluous as Article 137(2) of the Treaty clearly states that ""directives in the social field including Health and Safety shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of SMEs."""
"I believe therefore that the sentiments expressed in the amendment are already covered and it is unnecessary to repeat this in the report."
". (EL) Here we stand once again under a shower of good intentions which, even if translated into a set of positive proposals, are doomed to remain dead letter because they get nowhere near the nub of the problem and do not touch on the main trend causing the problem."
"The European Parliament's proposal contains numerous positive proposals which are negated by its very inability to set out the problem of negative developments in labour and labour relations as a whole."
"Because no attention is given to the main trend towards restructuring labour relations and reducing and abolishing the fundamental rights acquired by workers or framework labour conditions such as minimal working times and conditions, temporary and part-time employment and cuts in social security and protection, the resultant framework is completely negative and non-conducive to the application of any policy to protect working women during and after pregnancy."
"We wish to point out and highlight the risks inherent in a strict prohibition on dismissal, especially under the present, extended regime of generalised atypical employment contracts and the indirect exclusion of pregnant women from jobs, a regime in which we need not just to maintain and consolidate but to increase maternity leave, define the maternity allowance more clearly and apply strict and more substantive controls on night work by pregnant and breastfeeding working women."
"Not only must we strengthen the legal framework protecting the health and safety of pregnant women and rectify omissions and clarify ambiguities - the ""Trojan horses"" used to bypass and infringe legislation -, we also need to deal with the lack of political will on the part of national governments to apply the directive properly, a lack which is sorely in evidence from the sluggish state of control mechanisms in the Member States during the previous period."
"A typical example is Greece, where there are no controls on employers' obligation to carry out an integrated written assessment of occupational hazards in the workplace, including a specific assessment of the hazards to pregnant and breastfeeding women."
"Experience has demonstrated that reducing employability and ""adaptability"" to guideline Community priorities on employment issues renders any protection basically non-existent and cancels any individual arrangements in practice."
"The problem is: what guidelines are being issued, what sort of employment policy is being applied?"
"And unfortunately, we have confirmation that the EU wants to make more drastic cuts to allowances and social insurance, to amend and downgrade provisions on dismissal and to reduce and abolish provisions to protect working conditions."
"We must not delude ourselves as to the nature of employment policy and the social policy of the EU in general or the interests which it represents, which is why, despite sharing the EU's positive position on the protection of working women, we believe this is nothing more than yet another report of ideas and good intentions."
"We therefore call on working women and men to continue their social fight for an overall change of policy and for a policy which centres on man and respect for his needs and dignity."
"A fight geared primarily to the implementation of the principle of full and stable employment, with full, consolidated social rights for everyone."
"Only such a framework will safeguard the rights of the particularly sensitive category of pregnant women and the rights and respect for life as something other than the raw material of profit, subject to the laws of costs, competition and inexorable market forces."
". (FR) We are in favour of all the amendments to the directive seeking to improve the protection of pregnant employees before, during and after their maternity leave."
"The resolution proposes to remedy some of the omissions in the present directive and to harmonise European legislative systems to align them with those that guarantee the most rights."
"We endorse such proposals in the name of guaranteeing employees' rights to health, especially as the proposed amendment of the ILO Maternity Protection Convention (Convention 103) reveals many retrograde steps, such as the exclusion of certain categories of women from entitlement to maternity leave, the minimum duration of maternity leave and the possibility of making a woman redundant during this leave."
"A strict European framework must be established to protect pregnant women against any form of discrimination during recruitment, regarding issues of their working conditions, access to maternity leave or its duration: 20 weeks including 8 mandatory weeks after the birth."
"Women must be protected against any wrongful dismissal and their former wage must be guaranteed."
"Finally, night work must be prohibited for both men and women in sectors where it is not absolutely essential, rather than seeking to modify the conditions for pregnant women."
"Short sea shipping"
"The next item is the report (A5-0139/2000) by Mr Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the development of short sea shipping in Europe: a dynamic alternative in a sustainable transport chain - Second Two-yearly Progress Report."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, has the floor."
"Mr President, in 1995, the Commission submitted the communication on the development of short sea shipping on the basis of the strategy which was formulated in the White Paper on the common transport policy."
"The second annual progress report on this draft is now before us."
"However, after five years, it has become clear that short shipping is still merely an empty promise which has not been kept, despite the verbal support by the Transport Council of 8 December 1999, which considered short sea shipping as a priority."
"We are not trying to boost the popularity of short sea shipping out of idealistic motives."
"It is a fact that transport shipping will increase by 70% in the next decade."
"It is impossible to meet this growing demand by road transport alone."
"Short sea shipping is therefore not a competitor of road transport, the train or transport using inland waterways, it is one of the modes in the transport chain."
"It is in everyone' s interest to keep the irritation communities are caused by the constant drone of through freight transport to a minimum."
"Transport should also be as clean as possible and in that respect too, short sea shipping meets high requirements."
"Speed might not be the main feature of short sea shipping, safety is."
"Weekend traffic bans and traffic jams are a curse to road transport."
"In many cases, short sea shipping can provide a solution to these problems if it is used in combination with other modes of transport."
"At the same time, I do not want to claim here that it is a panacea."
"We will take the pressure off quite substantially if we try to make the best use of all modes of transport and combine them in the best way we can."
"But in order to do this, a number of conditions do need to be met."
"In its communication, the Commission makes a distinct reference to industry itself."
"This is fine, but as rapporteur, I would like to add another dimension."
"There are some very specific aspects where mainly governments at national, local or regional level can add weight and can give short sea shipping a boost."
"In its communication, the European Commission provided a sound overview of the issue as a whole."
"Parliament and your rapporteur have looked at the Commission plans with a critical eye and tried, in consultation with all parties involved, as befits a Parliament, to compile this report."
"Industry was asked to raise practical issues which could, in their view, obstruct the development of short sea shipping."
"We are still awaiting this report."
"I would like to underline a few aspects."
"Once again, short sea shipping can only take off in Europe if it is considered an integral part of the transport chain."
"Connections with the hinterland in the form of rail, internal waterways and road are essential in this respect."
"As such, it is important that short shipping is integrated with other modes of transport and this means that infrastructure will need to meet certain requirements."
"Short sea shipping is also eminently suited to specialist transport."
"Cars are a good example of this."
"Innovation in the construction of specialist ships will prove decisive here and this could give our shipbuilding industry a shot in the arm."
"The sector' s image is also important and must clearly be cleaned up."
"The sector is suffering from excessive red tape."
"Procedures last forever."
"But increasingly, we can also point to many positive developments within the sector."
"Industry should take its responsibility there, for example, in the setting up of regional promotion and marketing agencies, but the market cannot do this on its own."
"Member States must lift obstructions."
"For example, the road transport monopoly springs to mind, with the impact this has on the levels at which short sea shipping should pitch its prices to tie in with Bilbao' s short sea port."
"At every level, excessive bureaucratic procedures and endless red tape accompany the cargo."
"This puts short sea shipping at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transport."
"Accordingly Parliament calls for this sector to be treated with the necessary flexibility, thus enabling this sector to acquire a better position in terms of affordability."
"For example, we have in mind the introduction of exemptions from pilot service in ports where captains can demonstrate they have a high level of experience."
"By the way, an irritating error has crept in to the erratum, where the experience of the pilot is referred to."
"This should, of course, be the captain, otherwise this is complete nonsense."
"The market is still fragmented at present."
"This is why in its report, Parliament points to the need for a one-stop-shop approach to offering logistical transport services to end users."
"These services should embrace all multi-modal transport services and should, in this way, counteract the fragmentation of the present services."
"In my report, I also call for incentives from the Commission, which are needed to promote short shipping."
"In view of the European connections, I would also ask for investment projects in mainly the Mediterranean Sea area and the ports along the Adriatic Sea."
"Short sea shipping requires destinations."
"You may have wonderful short sea terminals in Rotterdam, but you need to have a destination."
"The setting up of these new lines requires critical mass and it could be one or two years before these resources are available."
"The European Union will need to help out by providing cheap loans from the European Investment Bank in order to overcome this difficulty."
"Furthermore, we are lacking information and statistical data on which industry can base its investments."
"No one knows what we transport in what way, where to and in what quantities."
"I believe that statistical data on what we transport where is one of the things we need as a matter of urgency in order to pursue a policy for transport, which will grow at an amazing rate in the next couple of years."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues Ripoll and Pérez Álvarez, who have worked on this report - but who are not able to be here - I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, on her marvellous report, in particular because it deals with a problem which is important for very real and practical reasons."
"Furthermore, I wish to say that there are two things which I am regretting right now: firstly, that I am not able to hear the opinion of our friend Mr Fatuzzo on how short sea shipping affects the interests of European pensioners, and secondly, that so few Members are present because, considering the egotistical interests of this House, it is probable that one day they will regret not having found out about the issue of short sea shipping, because they will perhaps have to use it one day to travel to and from Strasbourg."
"Turning to the background to the issue, I must tell Mrs Peijs that we have followed with great interest the developments and actions which in recent years, especially on the basis of the creation of the forum for the maritime industries, have been taking place in the European Union with a view to promoting short sea shipping as an alternative to land transport."
"Both the Commission' s report and the rapporteur' s report illustrate the different comparative advantages of each type of transport, of which, in the case of sea transport, I would like to highlight the fact that the infrastructures are less saturated, the fact that they are less expensive, they consume less energy and therefore emit fewer pollutants into the atmosphere and they improve communications with the outermost regions of the European Union."
"We consider - and I think we all agree on this - that the transfer of charges from land to sea transport should be taken as a priority objective of the European Union' s transport policy."
"I would like to highlight the fact that in the last two years there have been a series of actions which have had positive effects on short sea shipping."
"This has made it possible, as the Commission' s report points out, for intra-Community sea transport activity to increase by 23% between 1990 and 1997."
"Nevertheless, this is a relatively modest increase - of only 3% cumulatively per year - and this is less comparatively than the increase over the same period in land transport, which has been 26%."
"Consequently, rather than bringing the relative positions of sea transport and road transport closer together, the difference between them has continued to increase."
"All of this indicates therefore that we not only need more vigorous quantitative measures but that we probably need a different qualitative focus."
"Mrs Peijs' s report seems to us to be very balanced, but we would like to draw your attention to one of the key objectives for the promotion of short sea shipping: the simultaneous reduction of the time and direct cost involved in port operations for ships which provide this type of service."
"In many cases, the port services - both with regard to the ship and the goods - are faced with no effective competition or with very limited competition and this means that there is often abuse of dominant positions, such as the imposition of obligatory services which are not necessary or are not even used, for example, piloting, towing, mooring and port handling, as well as the payment of very high tariffs."
"What is certainly the case is that, apart from very few exceptions, transoceanic services do not have to face competition from roads and, in most cases, air transport does not offer any practical competition to them."
"For all these reasons, we believe that, if the intention is to promote short sea shipping in a realistic and effective way, it is essential to reorganise the current provision of port services, by improving their efficiency and reducing their costs."
"We should also bear in mind what this means for the economies of the areas in which there is a ship-building industry."
"This means a revitalisation of the whole area, as is well known by the people who live in those cities, in those regions, in which the ship-building industry is a very active element in the local economy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was asked: why are we so keen on short sea shipping at European level?"
"The answer is: we have a vision."
"We see large quantities of goods transported round our continent on safe, environmentally-friendly ships."
"The goods are unloaded at the point where they can reach their destination via the shortest possible overland route."
"That takes the burden off overland transport by adding another link to the chain of intermodal transport."
"Of course we are still many sea miles away from making this vision come true, although some progress has been made over the past two years, as the report shows."
"Mrs Peijs' good report describes the existing obstacles and the strategies for realising our visions. There was broad agreement in committee."
"What can we do internally for short sea shipping?"
"I just want to mention a few things."
"In the technical field we can introduce more environmentally-friendly technology for ships' engines and specific terminals for express transhipment."
"In the organisational field, and especially for cross-frontier transport, we can introduce uniform shipping documentation, simplified administrative procedures and fewer pilot services in cases where they are not absolutely necessary."
"What can we do for short sea shipping as a link in the intermodal chain?"
"First, we can improve the interfaces with other modes of transport by introducing modern systems of transhipment - especially to inland shipping - standardising containers, promoting transport logistics services for the entire transport chain and by many other means mentioned in the report."
"I think we should also consider all these matters with a view to our pre-accession strategies."
"Meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables."
"The report says that an exchange of best practice would be useful."
"That is true, for why have we been calling for some time now for a reference centre for intermodal transport."
"It would be sensible to engage in more research and above all to set up demonstration projects in the field of intermodal transport."
"All in all the report offers a whole package of sensible proposals."
"I hope that the next progress report in two years' time will tell us that we have moved a little closer to our vision, our vision of a successful intermodal transport system in Europe."
"Mr President, there are three aspects of Mrs Peijs' excellent report that I would like to highlight and illustrate by way of example."
"Although these come from my own constituency, I know they are representative of many similar regions."
"First, intermodality and the need to optimise infrastructure links to the hinterland."
"This week we have voted for environmentally-friendly measures designed to encourage more freight on to rail."
"Good rail access into ports is vital in this context."
"We have to accept, however, that there are times when it is roads that provide the necessary access into the hinterland."
"I cite the placing on the TENs map of the A75 from Gretna to Stranraer, given its importance for sea transport to and from Northern Ireland."
"Second, the extent to which outlying regions and islands depend on the sea for contacts with their neighbours."
"We often look on the sea as something that separates communities."
"We are better viewing it as a highway that connects them."
"My group endorses Amendments Nos 1 and 4 accordingly."
"I would add, though, that for environmental sustainability we should look upon connections between peninsulas in the same way."
"In the west of Scotland the route from Gourock to Dunoon is twenty times as far by road as it is by sea and that from Tarbert to Portavadie is twenty five times as far."
"Third, it is essential that we continue to recognise the lifeline nature of many short sea shipping routes."
"I am not thinking just in terms of the need to sustain public service obligations in this context."
"We also need to find other permissible ways of reducing the costs associated with transport to island and outlying communities."
"Their economies are invariably fragile ones and it is just not good enough that the farmers on the Isle of Lewis have to pay twice as much for their hay as farmers living near Inverness."
"I hope the Commission will take such points into serious consideration when developing policy in the area."
"Mr President, in this group we welcome the Peijs report and we welcome the Commission's stance to which it is responding."
"It is indeed true that short sea shipping is environmentally friendly and cost-effective, and it is indeed true that it supports the economic development of maritime regions; but we in Scotland call upon the Commission, therefore, to get its act together in respect of the forthcoming liberalisation of sea transport in the west of Scotland."
"As Mrs Attwooll has just pointed out, we not only have island transport there but also important short sea links across what we call sea lochs and the geologists call fjords, where instead of going 150 kilometres up a narrow road over a mountain pass, you can take a boat across a narrow water."
"If we were to interpret the regulation on maritime cabotage sensibly, we would say: Of course these peninsulas are functionally equivalent to islands, and public service obligations apply in these cases as well."
"In that case it would be quite lawful for the state to support the services there."
"In the same way, one could then take a holistic look at the package of routes across the west of Scotland, instead of breaking it up, inviting cherry-picking by private entrepreneurs who come in to take the few paying routes and make it harder to sustain the routes which are not profitable all the year round."
"We want a holistic look at that kind of thing throughout Europe, we want an imaginative approach by the Commission."
"It is six weeks since I put a question to the Commission asking if it would treat the peninsulas as equivalent to islands."
"Earlier it had claimed intimate knowledge of the west of Scotland."
"It still have not replied to that."
"I ask it to reply as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s communication on the development of short sea shipping in Europe and the very good report on it by Mrs Peijs give a realistic picture of the development of this environmentally-friendly mode of transport in Europe over the past two years."
"The development and promotion of short sea shipping are a particularly important step on the way to developing a system of multimodal transport for the European Union and bordering regions."
"Efficiency, cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility and sustainability distinguish this form of transport from road transport and can offer a serious alternative in coastal regions."
"However, it is also most important to improve the cooordination between the various modes of transport so as to bring out the specific strengths of each of them most effectively."
"That is why the public and private sector must adopt a range of European, national and regional aid measures to adapt and develop the ports, which are the nerve centre of the transport chain, and target these measures at the specific requirements."
"Furthermore; it is important to adapt the related technical and organisational aspects, such as administrative formalities and documents, customs and embarkation procedures, to ensure the rapid and smooth change from one mode of transport to another and from one country to another."
"Other support measures should include special incentives for the development of innovative technologies, special pre-embarkation terminals for short sea shipping and integrating the ports in the development strategy for the coastal regions."
"This is an important means of strengthening economic and social cohesion and the links between the centres and the peripheral areas in the European Union."
"The integration of short sea shipping in the logistics chain of door-to-door delivery can be an effective means of sustaining the growing economic cooperation between the EU and its neighbouring states and satisfying the growing need for transport that accompanies it."
"Mr President, I would like to say the following on behalf of Mr van Dam. Transport policy requires choices."
"Sustainable transport policy requires even more, or at least other, choices."
"The task which we in this House have is to facilitate the transport of goods and passengers in such a way as to keep adverse side-effects to a minimum."
"The mode of transport we are discussing here, short sea shipping, has the reputation of being a mode of transport which can counter the negative effects of the transport sector, especially in terms of the space occupied and environmental pollution, in more than one way."
"However, as Mrs Peijs rightly points out, the sector is not taking full advantage of the opportunities at the moment."
"I would like to highlight a number of aspects."
"We often hear that short sea shipping, and transport by sea in general, is an environmentally friendly mode of transport in terms of emissions per transported unit."
"This is certainly true, relatively speaking. However, progress made in this sphere in other sectors, especially road transport, is undermining this position."
"If ports refuse to turn a ship, swift action is most definitely required."
"Given the developments in the road transport sector as a result of new European emission standards for fuels, I am of the opinion that in order to boost the environmental performance of short sea shipping, we need to lay down a European directive concerning maximum permitted emission levels generated by ships' engines."
"Furthermore, unlike certain fellow delegates, I am of the opinion that short sea shipping should not only supplement existing modes of transport, it should also operate as an alternative to intra-Community transport."
"Given the problems surrounding distribution or with regard to reducing ECO points in Austria, we very much welcome an alternative route from North to South and vice versa."
"Short sea shipping can take care of at least part of this."
"A third aspect concerns the situation at ports."
"If we want short sea shipping to become more competitive in terms of speed, we will need measures to simplify customs and (dis)embarkation procedures."
"The rapporteur is right to point this out."
"If the sector then operates more efficiently and according to more up-to-date standards, it is vital to broadcast its potential."
"In a number of countries, including the Netherlands, promotion offices have been set up successfully with this goal in mind."
"It is therefore advisable for national or regional authorities to do their bit in order to develop this sector."
"In short, Mrs Peijs' report is comprehensive and I would like to congratulate her on this."
"If those involved take up their responsibilities, we are bound to conclude in a number of years what the Netherlands already knows: ""Transport by sea, the best route"" !"
"Mr President, to visitors from afar, the sea crossing to the Scottish islands is the stuff of romance, and indeed the beauty never fails to move both native and visitor."
"But for those who live and make their living there, the island shipping services are both an essential lifeline and a costly hurdle to be overcome for their economic and social well-being."
"The costs that impede are not only the fares, difficult as those often are, but also the inconvenience of pre-booking, of waiting in queues, of fitting in with timetables which provide low and variable frequencies; and then there are the risks of delays and cancellation due to weather or mechanical breakdown, or strikes which hold the islands to ransom from time to time."
"There is considerable concern on the Scottish islands at the moment that the EU's competition policy, which requires putting these services out to competitive tender, will undermine these lifeline services even at their present level and add a further upward ratchet to the cost of living and of doing business."
"We need to reassure those who live and work on these vulnerable islands and remote peninsulas that they have nothing to fear from bringing a measure of competition into the process for awarding these contracts."
"Can I ask the Commission to do what it can to reassure the Scottish islands, the Scottish executive that is struggling with this situation at the moment and the Scottish Parliament, that it stands ready to make sure that this process works well, that it does not undermine but improves the shipping services in the Scottish islands."
"Perhaps through Commission Verheugen I can pass an invitation to the Transport Commissioner, his colleague, Mrs de Palacio, to accompany me on a romantic trip to the Scottish islands."
"Mr President, Commissioner, living as I do in a country with an extensive coastline and many islands - in fact I live on an island -, I have first-hand experience of the value of short sea shipping."
"Of course, the basic sector is passenger transport, but the report under discussion focuses on freight transport in response to the Commission's communication."
"It is worth noting that, although the volume of traffic carried by this form of transport has risen over recent years, road transport has fared better, meaning that special attention needs to be given to this more environmentally-friendly form of transport."
"The current situation is still pretty off-putting for the public, which is given the impression that this is a fairly outdated, slow and complicated means of transport."
"The development of maritime transport is further hampered by administrative procedures in need of improvement and delays, an incomplete infrastructure and the obscure fees levied by some ports, together with unnecessary mooring charges."
"But we can still improve its image and turn it into a viable alternative solution for types of freight which can be transported by various methods."
"I refer, of course, to places which are not restricted to maritime transport, such as islands, which must always warrant special attention."
"The private sector has a basic role, but there are aspects of the market which call for intervention by public-sector agencies at regional, national and European level and even financial aid, so that islanders do not feel that they are second-class Europeans."
"Developing cabotage has an immediate impact on social and economic development in our regions and hence on the cohesion of the European Union."
"The rapporteur has obviously approached the subject matter in this spirit and has taken her work very seriously; as an islander I feel obliged to extend her my special thanks."
"I should also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen who, I see, has put his headphones on. Thank you for your attention earlier on during the explanations of vote by the honourable members."
"Mr President, Commissioner, at a time when we are trying to correct regional disparities, Mrs Peijs' s report is very opportune, since it deals with the matter of short sea shipping and asks Member States and the Commission to adopt measures to promote this type of transport."
"As always, I would like to remind you that the regional and structural policy of the Union, as a whole, is a response to the specific disadvantages suffered by certain European regions, such as the so-called outermost regions."
"Last March, the Commission presented a report which lays out a strategy aimed at the sustainable development of those regions and which includes various principal aspects, notably those regions' relations with the areas in their geographical vicinity, which, to a certain extent, largely condition their development."
"Therefore, we believe that Mrs Peijs' s report is opportune, especially if it is reinforced by the amendment I have presented on the inclusion of sea transport between ports in the outermost regions and ports in the vicinity of those regions."
"In this way, we could correct the error made by the Commission when it drew up the two-yearly report on the development of this type of transport, of employing an incomplete definition of short sea shipping."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, short sea shipping is the most economical, most efficient, and most suitable solution for remote regions."
"I would like to thank Mrs Peijs for her interesting and excellent proposal."
"In my own country, shipping is almost totally of this short sea shipping type: in other words, it is important to us in that respect."
"We are unusual in that we only have a land connection with the rest of the EU in the north, so the importance of maritime traffic is enormous."
"On top of everything, our railways have a different gauge from those found elsewhere in the European Union."
"What is most peculiar about our situation is, however, that our shipping always comes to a halt in the winter unless certain measures are taken, because the sea freezes."
"This has led to a situation where we have had to establish a special fleet to break the ice."
"They are powerful ships: one ship' s energy is equivalent to that used by a whole city."
"This being the case - as we have this hindrance to movement - we hope that this ice-breaking operation may be supported, as the obstacle has been ordained by the Lord, and we cannot do a thing about it."
"It is also to be regretted that the effects on employment and welfare of this sort of traffic have not been highlighted sufficiently."
"A cheap workforce is a huge risk in these circumstances, especially in the north, and especially in ice."
"How can someone wearing shorts, who has no professional skill to his name, cope in minus thirty degrees and three metres of ice?"
"That is the problem."
"Aircrews are always well trained, but the same cannot be said of the cheap workforce that is employed on ships."
"I expect the Commission to look into this matter."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Peijs on a successful report."
"There are many problems and bottlenecks with regard to transport in Europe: roads and air space are congested and the competitiveness of the railways is poor."
"This week here in Parliament there have been many important reports on the subject of transport, all aimed at relieving congestion and reducing bottlenecks."
"Mrs Peijs' s splendid report aims at exploiting the opportunities offered by short sea shipping."
"It is an important addition to the reports on railways and air traffic."
"We indeed need viable and competitive logistical chains linking road traffic, rail transport, short sea shipping and, in addition, modern information technology."
"For remote countries across the seas, and that includes Finland, short sea shipping is an absolutely vital necessity, just as Mr Paasilinna there just said."
"I wish to mention the importance of the suitability and availability of ports and port services."
"Ports must be included in the Trans-European Network as part of the transport infrastructure."
"For the measures proposed in the report to be implemented, good levels of co-operation will be required between the Union, Member States, players at local level, and companies too, as will genuine investment of time and money in short sea shipping."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"Quite clearly she has spent a lot of time on it and has brought a lot of problems to light."
"We can see the different problems quite clearly from different areas of the European Union."
"Each area has its own particular problem."
"We have to recognise that it will take time to achieve our ultimate goal."
"But there is no doubt that short sea shipping is something we must strive to achieve better than we have up to now."
"It is certainly sensible to ship more goods by sea rather than by road."
"It is more environmentally friendly, more acceptable in every way."
"But we have to ensure that we get the balance right."
"That is what the rapporteur has been striving for."
"One of the greatest problems will always be the cost factor."
"To be competitive ports have to be more efficient and for this they will certainly require more support."
"I support Mrs Attwooll's appeal for the A75."
"It recognises that we in Northern Ireland export goods across what is a very expensive stretch of water between Northern Ireland and Scotland."
"It is our main outlet for all we produce."
"From Scotland they trundle down to England."
"There certainly could be a more efficient and environmentally satisfactory way of doing that but there is no cheaper way."
"For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost-effective."
"We had a very good ferry service set up between Ballycastle and the south of Scotland which was forced to close recently because of lack of support and bureaucracy."
"Mr President, Mrs Peijs, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her report."
"All the previous speakers have said this, and, like you, regretted the fact that short sea shipping suffered from such a poor image in terms of its slowness and inefficiency, even though it provides one solution to traffic congestion, high infrastructure and environmental costs."
"Moreover, in recent years, this form of transport has enjoyed an unquestionable success, even though it is not very well known, or not well enough."
"It does however offer, as you said, advantages in terms of costs, energy, efficiency, regional cohesion, the environment and even intermodality, as it is an ideal means in the implementation of multimodal transportation."
"Measures must therefore be taken at the earliest possible opportunity to step up the efficiency of dockside operations and reduce waiting times in port."
"Speaking personally, I would insist on the public authorities playing a part, at regional as well as national and European levels."
"There are, however, two points in your report that I have a problem with."
"Firstly, the proposal to draw up a list of ports particularly suitable for short sea shipping."
"I do not consider such a list to be necessary, as it entails a risk of penalising the ports which are not currently entirely suitable, but which are going to be modified in future."
"Moreover, there is a suggestion that the logistical services offered to users should be combined in a single unit."
"I am in favour of an information system but, personally, I reject the idea that a thriving major port should have central control of all the services."
"Finally, I should have liked, as a member of the Industry Committee, to have heard someone say clearly that short sea shipping must not be considered as an alternative, but that indeed an intermodal strategy should be found, establishing complementarity between modes of transport."
"In this context and in this spirit, the Member States should moreover harmonise their regulations so as to prevent distortions, which, particularly in the case of mainland transport, often cause hold-ups."
"If we wish to achieve a multimodal system, it is important to have a set of means of transport and regulations that are, if not common to all, then at least perfectly harmonised."
"Mr President, let me thank Mrs Peijs for her excellent report and for the work she put into it."
"The report show that short sea shipping is an issue on which there is the widest agreement between you, the Member States, and the Commission and the agreement goes further."
"I know of no one and no organisation which does not wish to see short sea shipping developed."
"In the past we were guilty of talking short sea shipping down."
"We mentioned its potential and by doing so implicitly said that it was not really doing very well."
"But it is doing well."
"It was not much publicised but short sea shipping was the only mode of transport which, during the 90s, could more or less keep pace with the development of road transport."
"So we must give credit to the short sea shipping industry."
"However there is always room for improvement."
"The shipping industry is the first to acknowledge this."
"Let me mention a few key issues in Mrs Peijs report."
"We need a comprehensive approach to make this a genuine door-to-door concept."
"It must be fully integrated in the transport chain and be offered through one-stop shops."
"Several bottlenecks hamper the development of short sea shipping."
"The Commission services are currently identifying these bottlenecks and potential solutions, together with the new Member States and industry."
"One area which has already been identified is the diversity of documents required."
"To create more uniformity, the Commission intends to present a proposal by the end of the year aiming to harmonise certain ships' arrival and departure documents."
"The efficiency of ports is crucial for short sea shipping, and also by the end of the year the Commission will present a package of measures intended to enhance that efficiency through liberalisation."
"Further, the old fashioned image of short sea shipping needs to be changed."
"That was already mentioned in the debate and I appreciate that very much."
"National short sea promotion offices should play an essential role in implementing this policy."
"Some promotion offices already exist and the Commission encourages establishing further offices so that we can create a European network of promotion."
"In the debate the question of Community grants was raised, and I would like to answer the question here."
"The main source of Community grants to short sea shipping has in the past been the PACT Programme, that is a Pilot Action for Combined Transport."
"Last year around 40% of the PACT budget was used to favour combined short sea shipping and that amounts to EUR 2.3 million."
"It will even be more in the 2000."
"We will increase the share up to 50%."
"The DG responsible aims to continue this trend, so that short sea shipping will continue to receive its fair share of the PACT budget."
"In the forthcoming revision of PACT this principle could even be incorporated into the legal text."
"Mr Purvis, has asked me to pass an invitation to Commissioner de Palacio."
"I certainly will do that and Mrs Palacio will enjoy a romantic trip to Scotland."
"It would be even more romantic if you would invite me to accompany her."
"Mrs Peijs, thank you for your work."
"Thank you for ensuring that we all move in the same direction."
"Let us all do it together, the Commission will certainly do its best."
"Mr President, I should like to express my disappointment that on a matter on which I have had a written question before the Commission for more than six weeks, and which I raised in the debate, I have had no acknowledgement, far less a reply."
"Thank you very much, Mr MacCormick."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Friday, at 9 a.m."
"Civil dialogue"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0533/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the future financing of the civil dialogue."
"Mr Pronk has the floor."
"Mr President, I hope that, at this late stage, we will not be taking up too much time."
"It is unfortunate that we now have to round up this important debate, which is important on its own merits."
"If I can use this opportunity, I would just like to say that it would perhaps be sensible if in future, for example, we do not manage to vote on a Tuesday evening, we could squeeze in an extra round of voting, so that we do not incur further delays during the rest of the week."
"You might be able to submit this to the Bureau for their consideration."
"But this is, of course, not really related to these issues."
"I do not need to add too many explanatory notes."
"Firstly, it is indisputable that non-governmental organisations play a vital role in Member States, in the European Union and outside of the European Union. Everyone is agreed on this."
"This is something which the Council states, and which is backed up frequently by the Commission and this Parliament."
"Also, Article 136 of the European Treaty, in combination with declarations 23 and 38, underlines that cooperation with Wohlfahrtsverbände (welfare associations) is necessary, and these are also non-governmental organisations, of course."
"The European Parliament has always put its money where its mouth is and has for some time, for some considerable time, created a line, B3 4101 in order to finance non-governmental organisations."
"However, as a result of different provisions which have been agreed in conjunction with the Council, and following judgments by the Court of Justice, this line has now more or less expired after three years."
"The European Commission has been aware of this for three years."
"This is not the issue."
"This issue is that so little is happening."
"On the one hand, the great need is staring us in the face while on the other we see little in the way of specific action, except for the document which the Commission has issued and which we are specifically asking after."
"The six million dollar question now is how we can translate the finely worded ideas we have all expressed into reality."
"What I am saying on my own behalf, not on behalf of the Commission, is that bureaucratic issues are bound to crop up."
"The reason for this could be that there are different Commission directorates involved."
"NGOs are not restricted to one directorate general."
"It could be that they are looking for a general angle and at the same time specific angles, but at any rate, this is all taking up too much time, as the budget lines are expiring."
"This is also the reason why we are drawing the Commission' s attention to this issue this evening, in itself not a very appropriate time."
"Speed is the main issue."
"It is not so much the Commission' s intention which is at issue, but the speed with which certain things can be brought about."
"We might otherwise run the risk of failing to implement not just a core task stipulated in the European Treaty, but also what has been stated by the European Council in Feira, because NGOs - and this is the only problem - are extremely sensitive, at least the majority of them, to breaks in payments to them."
"They are far more sensitive to this than other organisations, and certainly Member States."
"This means that if we wait around for too long, the patient will die."
"This is the serious concern which we have in our committee."
"This is the reason why we are asking these questions and this is also the reason why we hope that the Commission will tackle this matter with due haste within the scope which the Treaty offers and within the generally benevolent climate which the Council and Commission have displayed in Feira, as witnessed by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I can be extremely brief."
"I thought the response by the Commissioner was encouraging on its own merits."
"I think he is right in stating that we in Parliament should make every effort not to obstruct procedures."
"I should point out, however, that we in Parliament have tried our hardest, using all the means at our disposal, to keep those budget lines up and running that enabled us to continue financing NGOs."
"This can only be stretched so far and speed is then of the essence."
"I would like to make one last point following on from the official reply by the Commissioner on the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is, in fact, not so much the content of the present Treaty or present declarations which is at issue, in fact he is more concerned to adapt these declarations, presumably in such a way as to form a legal basis from them, so that a programme can be based on them."
"This is the problem, in fact, and I would ask the Commissioner whether it would be possible to give this matter further attention within the Commission."
"As such, we are thus not asking for a new treaty, but for some attention."
"Finally, because we are of course involved in the development of NGOs in the new Member States, in the context of enlargement, we believe that this should be given extremely high priority."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in support of Mr Pronk's words on behalf of the Committee as a whole."
"I have to say that I was not totally satisfied by the Commissioners' responses, in that the documents that were referred to, with which we are familiar, as Mr Pronk said, need to contain time frames and rather more practical decision."
"As we know, we have been discussing the issue for years."
"Parliament has played a fundamental role in this dialogue, but it is now time to move on from dialogue and declarations to concrete action."
"The Commission needs to start putting forward practical solutions, for otherwise the issue will never be resolved."
"I can see a certain contradiction and I am concerned, and I believe I speak for the rest of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well, that behaviour within the Commission in relation to the issue appears to be somewhat contradictory."
"The role of the non-governmental organisations in the democratic construction of the Union and the economic and social role they play in Europe, the entire social economy sector, the third sector, is now acknowledged in practice as well as in documents - if we consider that approximately nine million workers are employed in this sector - as a major sector of fundamental importance."
"Well, the most recent decisions of the Commission - and I refer to the Directorate-General for Industry - have labelled this a negative priority - they have now invented the concepts of positive and negative priorities - and have abolished the 'social economy' operative unit."
"In my opinion, this is extremely serious and leaves us extremely sceptical as to whether the declarations made repeatedly in this House, which we have heard on several occasions, will be followed by practical action in the right direction."
"The NGO platform, with which Parliament and the Commission have maintained dialogue, and all those involved feel as if they have been taken for a ride, and I think that we parliamentarians also feel rather as if we have been deceived, when declarations are made saying one thing and then, in reality, practical decisions lead to another."
"The absence of an interlocutor on the administrative side apart from anything else will make it all the more difficult to resolve these problems rather than making it easier."
"So if we genuinely want to make positive progress, speed up the procedures and provide positive responses for the European citizens as well as the Non-Governmental Organisations, in my opinion, we need to rethink a whole series of decisions which have been taken and, most importantly, change them."
"Mr President, many of us in the Group of Greens and the European Free Alliance have our roots in the NGO and activist movement, so it is very dear to our hearts."
"Earlier today we discussed the annual report of the Committee on Petitions, that is the complaints end of the process of evaluating what is going on within the European Union."
"The NGOs in our view act as part of the preventive process."
"They provide a scrutiny mechanism, they provide a way of making sure that we do not lose aspects of the legislation that we are doing."
"They make us think of new things and they are essential to our process."
"They are one of the few organisations which are really active on the citizens' behalf and if we are trying to create confidence within the structures we are trying to build, their role is absolutely essential."
"It is really important that they are there to counterbalance a lot of the business interests which do not seem to have financial difficulties in finding a path to our door, whereas for a lot of NGOs working internationally is enormously expensive."
"The work we have been doing in various committees over the last few weeks on Article 13, the anti-discrimination article, would have been impossible without the input of those bodies."
"So the need to sort out a clear legal basis for their participation, and hence their funding, is absolutely essential, because this body cannot work properly without them."
"Reference was made to the applicant countries, and I would echo the words of my colleague, Mr Pronk, that the NGO and civil society movement in those countries is going to be essential if we are going to have a European Union based on values of justice and democracy."
"I would urge that we find a way of establishing a serious and reliable funding mechanism for those organisations that represent the poor, the excluded and the discriminated against at least, so that they are not scrabbling for funds every year, wondering if they are going to survive so they can do the job they exist to do."
"Mr President, in the last few years the EU has, of course, been given more and more significant powers in the social area, but it has not been given an awful lot of money for solving social problems."
"As long as the Member States are of the basic opinion that social issues should be dealt with by the Member States themselves, there will be no rapid change."
"We are, of course, aware that those funds which do exist are strictly budgeted for and that it is difficult to move funds around within the budget."
"It is difficult to meet new needs while the Member States have this attitude."
"For these reasons, I believe that it is particularly important for those of us who work in the EU institutions to concentrate on according much greater importance than we have until now to the non-governmental public organisations in Europe operating in the social sphere."
"I am sure everyone can see that there is a need for transnational activities in the social sphere, too."
"There is, therefore, a place for non-governmental organisations."
"It would, however, be unfortunate, and that is perhaps the way the Member States see it, if the non-governmental social organisations were to be strongly bound, financially and politically, to the EU - more so than they are already becoming."
"Their worth lies precisely in the fact that they are non-governmental and civic and are able to see social problems from a different perspective than the authorities. In that way, they constitute a complement or alternative to the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"I will take the opportunity to make a suggestion, despite there not being many people listening (there are only around six MEPs in the House)."
"I propose that the Commission try to set up a European fund for this purpose with the non-governmental organisations in the social sphere."
"I propose that the Commission turn to the Council and the Member States to try to get them to contribute to such a fund."
"This fund ought to be set up as an independent institution whose board of directors is made up of people from the social organisations themselves, together with researchers and experts in the social sphere."
"One might imagine that such an organisation would escape some of the bureaucratic problems."
"Financial supervision could be exercised by professional auditors."
"I believe that if we set to work on a task like this with a certain diplomatic tactfulness, the Member States would react positively to the proposal."
"I also believe that all other parties - the socially disadvantaged, the non-governmental organisations, the Member States and the EU institutions - would all be very pleased with such an institution."
"Mr President, we must thank Bartho Pronk and the chairman of our committee for speaking about civil dialogue and relations between the Commission and NGOs, because, in the final analysis, the report and other contributions seem to me to be purely administrative and far removed from the practical reality, and this is exactly the impression I had, Commissioner, when you answered Bartho Pronk."
"You told us that the Commission was active in meeting the operating costs of NGOs, but what we Members of Parliament want is to ensure that all NGOs, may be supported and funded on the basis of a number of practical projects."
"For, nowadays, it is the major NGOs which have the opportunity to respond to a number of invitations to tender: Médecins du monde, Médecins sans frontières, the Red Cross and so on and so forth."
"That is my first comment."
"You must be aware of the problems experienced by a good number of smaller NGOs in being able to respond to a number of invitations to tender."
"The work they do in terms of relations and competencies is, however, just as important as that of the major NGOs, but some of them do not have the same administrative facilities that some major NGOs have."
"Secondly, what we would also like to see is the needs of NGOs being satisfied before a major tragedy occurs."
"Let me take just one example, the protection of childhood."
"For four years, a number of Members of Parliament have been fighting for funding for associations working to combat child abuse."
"Our attempts have been ignored."
"It was not until the Dutroux case that we were able to obtain a budget line enabling two programmes to be run: Daphne and STOP."
"Today, regrettably, only one programme is left, the Daphne programme."
"I can tell you that, as experts on matters to do with small children, a number of NGOs would indeed love to be able to respond to specific invitations to tender."
"Finally, I feel it advisable to simplify the procedures and that, in this connection - I do not know if this has to be a fund -, the Commission should, at least initially, make a service available to NGOs, enabling them to obtain information on the work carried out by other parties and, possibly, establish networks on certain topics in order, ultimately, to be able to submit tenders to the Commission when offers come up."
"That, Commissioner, is what I wished to say."
"We shall make progress in the social sector because we know that we have to make progress in terms of cooperation in that sector."
"We need time for this."
"This is precisely why, given that social matters are essentially part of the remit of NGOs, we must make progress in the matter of civil dialogue."
"Mr President, Mrs Lambert and Mrs Ghilardotti are right."
"The European social NGOs are playing a critical role in our work."
"Anyone who went through the Article 13 discrimination package could see this."
"Since the 1998 budget crisis which saw the freezing of funds destined for NGO work with some of the most vulnerable people in Europe and the developing world, much progress has been made."
"The Portuguese presidency broke new ground and invited the European aid platform to the Lisbon informal social affairs summit and the French presidency is following suit."
"These kinds of initiatives were recognised in the conclusions of the Lisbon summit."
"But words are not enough and two years after the 1998 budget crisis, the difficulties continue."
"There have been two years of consultations with NGOs and all the Commission has come up with is a discussion paper and two internal working groups which have hardly met."
"Meanwhile NGOs, and I worked in the NGO field, are being squeezed by bureaucratic rules which were introduced to promote accountability and transparency but which in the end have created more red tape."
"The troubles of NGOs Mr President are further compounded by this House when it makes difficult rules on co-finance requirements which are set with the tightest deadlines."
"The one budget line that we had - B3-4101 has been scrapped and the Commission has failed to come up with a proposal for a legal base for the civil dialogue either through suggesting a Council regulation or a Treaty article."
"Worse, the social NGOs have been told by the Commission that they will need to be funded through our new discrimination and social exclusion budget lines."
"How can that be when the funds for those programmes have been reduced beyond what is reasonable?"
"A number of valuable social NGOs are facing serious crises because of the inaction of the Commission and the Council."
"I saw one NGO which made an application for projects requiring eighty pages of budget sheets and so many supporting papers that one NGO application weighed over twelve kilos."
"Mr President, that has to change."
"NGOs are critical to our work and we must support them."
"I would like to give warm thanks to all the Members who took part in this debate for their suggestions, as well as for their very strong criticisms."
"I will pass them on and will raise them during the Commission' s debate."
"Let me just reply briefly to two points."
"The first concerns the legal bases and the financing."
"Here we should not forget that one of the characteristics of a non-governmental organisation is that it should not be dependent on public funding."
"Otherwise it ought to be called a governmental rather than a non-governmental organisation."
"So I do not have very much sympathy for the oft-repeated call for governments or the Commission to assure the financing of non-governmental organisations in full."
"All they can ever do is provide support and cooperate on projects."
"That is quite fundamental."
"A number of speakers have addressed the question of non-governmental organisations and enlargement."
"I will answer them, because this matter is within my direct remit."
"All the ideas I have heard put forward in this debate have long since become reality."
"With our pre-accession aid, we are working very closely with the non-governmental organisations in the candidate countries; moreover our communications strategy, the organisational and financial framework of which has now been established, is also very much targeted at non-governmental organisations in candidate countries, since the aim is precisely to fully involve civil society in this important political process."
"I will faithfully report everything else back to the Commission, without omitting to mention what I perceived to be the basically rather critical mood of this debate, and I can assure you that I myself will certainly urge very strongly that procedures are simplified and decisions taken more rapidly."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.08 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must inform you that it has not yet been possible to make available all of the language versions of the Minutes."
"The approval of the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting is therefore postponed until all the versions are available."
"The reason for the delay is that we have more than 200 pages of roll-call votes, which have cost Parliament' s budget the modest sum of BEF 4 million."
"We are therefore currently producing the remaining versions."
"I hope that all the groups will bear in mind how much requests for roll-call votes cost Parliament' s budget."
"Therefore, when we have the remaining versions we will proceed with the approval of the Minutes."
"Mr President, on a point of order I should like to draw the attention of the House to a very serious incident which occurred yesterday in my constituency of Sunderland, in England."
"A fruit and vegetable wholesaler had his premises raided by police and trading standards officers, who seized the weighing equipment which he used to dispense his produce in the traditional British units of pounds and ounces."
"Apparently this is now in contravention of an EU directive, although there is a legal doubt about this."
"I hope the President will join with me in condemning this extremely heavy-handed reaction and write to my constituent offering the full support of the House in his fight against this nonsense."
"If Members are wondering why the EU is so unpopular in the United Kingdom, it is because of incidents such as this."
"Mr Callanan, I am extremely concerned about this very serious attack on British tradition, and it will be duly discussed."
"However, this was not, in my opinion, a point of order."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say something about the Minutes, although it is not yet time for them to be approved. However, it might be possible to make a correction to them already."
"Yesterday, with Mr Karas' excellent report, I had intended to vote in favour of paragraph 5, a particularly good one. I accidentally voted against it."
"I would ask you to correct this."
"This has been noted."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you to instruct the Security Service to investigate what has been going on."
"When I came into my office this morning, the door was open, even though I know for sure that I closed it last night, and my computer was switched on, even though I am quite certain that I switched it off last night."
"I think that what went on there last night must be investigated at any rate."
"Mrs Gebhardt, this is a concern that I share, because exactly the same thing has been happening to me for two days."
"We will therefore notify our security services."
"Mr President, I respect the fact that you cannot put the Minutes to the vote yet, but I would just like to comment on a matter which was raised yesterday."
"At the beginning of the topical and urgent debate, we had a discussion on the application of Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure, that is to say adjournment of a debate."
"The President declared this not applicable to the topical debate."
"I wonder how it is possible for a rule of the Rules of Procedure not to apply to a situation without it being further mentioned in the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 146 was clearly cancelled out in that instance."
"I would therefore ask whether the Committee on the Rules of Procedure or the President could explain in what instances Rule 146 would apply."
"Yesterday' s incident caused a great deal of confusion."
"Mr Maaten, Rule 50(6) stipulates that Rules 143, 144 and 146 shall not apply to those resolutions."
"This means that the president of the sitting strictly applied the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, on the point that Mr Callanan raised a couple of moments ago, I suggest that instead of raising the matter with you he should raise it with the Queen of the United Kingdom as she seems to have an opinion on most European issues these days."
"I have taken note of this peculiar point of order."
"I would like to inform you that, as you are aware, yesterday a tragic road accident occurred in Spain, near Soria, in which 2 drivers and 25 teenagers died."
"The President has decided to send our condolences to the families and to the respective authorities."
"I think that this goes some way to satisfying the requests that were made during the debate yesterday."
"Mr President, of course, the Catalan Members here today, such as yourself, Mr Gasòliba and I, are particularly affected by this tragedy."
"Aside from the rightful decision by the President to send her condolences to the families of the victims, perhaps, Mr President, it would be helpful if that communication from the President urged all the authorities responsible for transport in the European Union once again to step up the application of legislation and the monitoring of safety conditions for the transport of both school children and pensioners, who have frequently been victims of such tragedies."
"This will be done."
"Mr President, you said that recorded votes cost 4 million from Parliament' s budget."
"Could you ask the Committee on Rules of Procedure to look at the following point: we all respect the principles of power with responsibility and subsidiarity so every time a group asks for a recorded vote could a certain sum be debited from the budget allocated to it by Parliament?"
"Mr Newton Dunn, I am afraid to say that this is not an original idea."
"It is not the first time that it has been discussed."
"I think that there could be a better solution in the context of the reform of working methods that is currently being examined by the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"There are a few documents from a working group chaired by Vice-President Provan, which deal with these matters and which have now been passed on to the groups to be discussed."
"Working Document No 4 specifically deals with the actual mechanics of the plenary session, and I think that would be the appropriate environment for this type of discussion and for making improvements to our working methods."
"Mr President, I have the following question to ask: we have just received the printed version of the texts adopted."
"We have received the bulky paper version with the numerous roll­call votes, but what is missing is the verbatim report of proceedings for yesterday' s topical and urgent debate."
"Topical and urgent subjects of major importance are being postponed until Thursdays, certainly not without good reason, but urgent topics also need to be dealt with urgently as well."
"We have taken the floor on many occasions."
"I recall the subject of Tibet being discussed on the Dalai Lama' s 65th birthday yesterday. The people are keen to hear that there was great unity here in the European Parliament, how this came about, and what the outcome of our debate was."
"It has happened before in my experience that we have only had one opportunity to avail ourselves of the verbatim report of proceedings for the Thursday topical and urgent debate, and that was on the Wednesday of the following week."
"Hence, the question: when will we receive the verbatim report of proceedings for these topical and urgent subjects of major importance?"
"Mr Mann, this week at least, the verbatim report of proceedings has been available to all Members from 10 a.m. onwards on the following day."
"I would be surprised if today we were not in a position to do the same."
"Vote"
"Mr President, although we consider the prospect of developing short sea shipping in Europe, as well as inland waterway transport, as something positive, Armonia Bordes, Chantal Cauquil and I have chosen, nevertheless, to abstain from voting on this proposal."
"The report indicates that the large sums of money which need to be invested in order to develop the infrastructure will come from public funds, whereas the way in which the infrastructure is used will be governed primarily by the requirements for profitability and competitiveness of the private companies that, according to the proposal, should be its main users."
". (FR) We know that short sea shipping is an integral part of the European transport system."
"However, as the Commission report and the report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism point out, short sea shipping is suffering from a poor public image in terms of its cost, slowness and inefficiency."
"Nevertheless, this image no longer corresponds to the real situation and this mode of transport can provide solutions to global problems which are prevalent in this area in Europe."
"I am thinking about traffic congestion problems, and high infrastructure and environmental costs."
"During the last few years, progress has also been made and there has been a real increase in short sea shipping: from 1990 to 1997, a 17% increase in the tonnage transported and a 23% increase in the number of tonnes per kilometre."
"While there is no doubt about its success, this mode of transport has not yet reached its full potential and maximised its hidden advantages: advantages in terms of cost since it is the most economical mode of transport; advantages in terms of the amount of energy consumed per tonne/kilometre; advantages in terms of efficiency since it is the most efficient mode of transport from the point of view of the amount of investment required in relation to transport capacity; advantages in terms of regional cohesion since it is the most suitable mode for servicing the peripheral regions of Europe; advantages in terms of the environment since it causes less pollution than mainland traffic; and advantages in terms of intermodal transport since it is an ideal way of developing multimodal transport."
"We must therefore act quickly in order to contribute to its development."
"In particular, we will have to develop joint investment programmes."
"One of the priorities will have to be to increase the efficiency of port operations and reduce waiting times in ports."
"I would stress the fact that the public authorities have a major role to play at regional level, as well as national and European level."
"However, two points in my fellow Member' s report pose a problem for me."
"They concern the proposal which seeks to draw up a list of ports which are particularly suitable for short sea shipping."
"Drawing up such a list seems unnecessary to me and, in particular, runs the risk of penalising those ports which are not yet entirely suitable, but which are being converted for this purpose."
"Moreover, a 'one­stop­shop' approach to the transport logistics services offered to end users is proposed."
"While I am in favour of the idea that we need to find the means to set up an information system, I am against the service being centralised by a large port, which is already in a dominant market position."
"Finally, I would have liked the report to have included the proposal made by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, according to which short sea shipping must be considered neither as an alternative to road transport nor as a competitive system."
"The European Commission should therefore develop an intermodal strategy to achieve complementarity between the modes of transport."
"In this context and with this in mind, the Member States should harmonise current legislation in order to prevent it from representing an obstacle to continuity between short sea shipping and mainland traffic, particularly as regards the total weight of rolling stock."
"The proposal which is being put forward to us today therefore represents an important step in the right direction in the area of short sea shipping."
"However, we still have a long way to go."
"Combating serious environmental crime"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0178/2000) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Denmark with a view to the adoption of a Council Framework Decision on combating serious environmental crime [5343/2000 - C5-0078/2000 - 2000/0801(CNS)]"
"Mr President, the framework decision put forward by the Council merely reproduces the Council of Europe Convention of 1998 on the prevention of environmental crime, a Convention which has not yet been ratified by any of the Member States of the Council of Europe."
"The sole purpose of this proposal for a framework decision is to speed things up, at least with regard to the 15 Member States."
"In almost every country environmental laws are based almost entirely on very small fines, and this encourages those who are destroying the environment to maximise their profits by trying to avoid using all the modern techniques available to protect the environment."
"And so, in recent years we have witnessed major disasters such as that of the Erika, which was a rust bucket used to transport crude oil by sea, or the pollution of the Danube with cyanide from Romanian mines."
"And all this because, as I was saying, these big companies are guaranteed impunity, with the aim of maximising profits."
"First of all, this framework decision allows European countries to raise fines to make this offence - environmental crime - unprofitable."
"Indeed, until such time as environmental crime is paid for by the community and not by individuals, there is no hope of protecting the environment."
"Another area where this framework decision impacts is that of encouraging European countries to adopt sanctions, or at least a system making environmental crime a punishable offence for legal persons."
"Few European countries provide for the liability of legal persons in their criminal law, but others are taking steps towards this."
"Italy too, in revising the new penal code, intends to make legal persons punishable, because today serious environmental crime is not committed by individuals but by large multinationals, which cause huge disasters simply because they do not invest in prevention."
"European countries should agree on fairly general regulations soon and, in any case, raise fines so that these offences are not paid for out of the community' s pocket."
"Another important aspect is the cooperation that this framework decision will bring about between countries: an information network enabling a rapid exchange of information and an agreement which requires environmental crime to be considered as a crime that may lead to extradition or for example the confiscation of property and profits, and which, in any case, makes these offences unprofitable."
"I would just like to point out that the committee approved this report almost unanimously, with only one abstention, and all the political groups, from the PPE to the PSE to the Greens, contributed to improving it."
"This report therefore expresses the point of view of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and, we hope, expresses the point of view of the European Parliament, which must ensure that the European countries at last adopt effective legislation on the protection of the environment."
"draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. (SV) Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion prepared by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the basis of the Hughes procedure, I am able to say on behalf of the whole Committee that we welcome the Danish initiative which, together with our amendments, was adopted unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We consider that this initiative will be a useful instrument for combating those environmental crimes and their ever more common cross-border consequences which are, of course, a direct threat to the environment and also, therefore, to human beings, animals and plant life."
"Serious environmental crimes are a common problem for the Member States because their effects are not confined to individual countries."
"Therefore, we also ought to be able to take common measures to protect the environment as effectively as possible using the provisions of criminal law."
"I would point out that this Framework Decision is to be made unanimously in the Council, and it has been agreed that it will be binding upon the Member States."
"At the same time, it should be remembered that it is the Member States which decide how the results are to be achieved, that is to say which method is to be applied and which course of action adopted."
"How is this to happen?"
"Perhaps, for example, through efficient investigations promptly carried out, by sharing the information obtained in this way and by ensuring that these investigations are carried out by staff knowledgeable about the environment."
"That is extremely important."
"By means of administrative cooperation between the Member States, it is also possible to obtain such information as can be of use in enabling us to combat environmental crime."
"I would also, however, point out something which we also emphasised in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, namely that we must also go in for preventive measures, that is to say measures to be taken before environmental damage has been caused and environmental crimes committed."
"It is therefore also important for legislation to deal with environmental liability, that is to say the issue of who is liable, and for there to be effective legislation of this kind in the various Member States."
"More knowledge, pure and simple, about the environment and details of relevant techniques are also, of course, required, as well as information on how to detect environmental crime, on the consequences of this and on the penalties that can be imposed."
"It is important to try to cooperate as much as possible in this area."
"Serious environmental crime is defined in this Framework Decision as 'acts or omissions which, under aggravating circumstances and in breach of the legislation, result in substantial damage to the environment' ."
"It is, of course, open to discussion how the definition in terms of the words 'serious environmental crime' and 'substantial damage' is to be interpreted, but that is no doubt as far as the definition goes, even if it is not recognisable in legislation outside the Member States."
"We have looked at this definition of serious environmental crime in the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Because the definition is so vague, we consider it important to obtain as wide an area of application as possible in the proposed Framework Decision."
"Moreover, combating serious environmental crime cannot only apply to private companies but must also apply to administrative crime, that is to say cases where the administrative regimes in the various countries, or in fact the governments, have brought about serious environmental damage either through negligence or irresponsibility."
"We have tried to include such circumstances by means of Amendment 16."
"Another important aspect is what is regarded as 'aggravating circumstances' if the organisation which has caused serious environmental damage has been inadequately insured and has been so, too, in connection with the risks entailed in the particular business."
"What is at stake here is the issue of liability and the polluter pays principle, as well as the principle that the burden, consequences and risks should not be imposed upon others."
"This may be found in Amendment 25."
"Finally, I just want to say that we are on the way to taking joint action to protect the environment."
"This Framework Decision is one step, like the Council of Europe' s Convention on the Protection of the Environment through criminal law."
"The Framework Decision also states that this convention must be ratified as quickly as possible because it is significantly more detailed."
"These steps are absolutely necessary, I believe, to deter environmental crooks and prevent irresponsible actions which cause serious environmental damage."
"I am in favour of the Framework Decision and of the amendments which have been tabled."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I must begin by highlighting the excellent work that Mr Di Lello Finuoli has carried out on this report, which received, as he has already said, the almost unanimous support of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I also wish to praise this initiative by Denmark, which seeks to ensure that a Framework Decision on combating serious environmental crime is approved."
"We are all aware of the increasing scale and the frequent cross-border effects of this type of crime."
"I must also mention one of the recent surveys by Eurobarometer, which confirms that the environment, together with security, health and unemployment, is one of the concerns closest to the hearts of the European citizens."
"We therefore have an obligation to respond to these concerns, in a way that will guarantee the protection of the environment and public health, with a view to improving the quality of our citizens' lives."
"The truth requires us to recognise that the European Union has made considerable progress in the area of the environment over the last five years."
"Today, even from the point of view of the Treaties, we have already seen a balanced and sustained form of development taking place. Under the terms of the Tampere conclusions, environmental crime is one of the areas specifically mentioned, on which efforts must be concentrated in order to establish common definitions, charges and sanctions between the various national criminal laws."
"There is therefore a crucial need for joint action by the Member States in order to protect the environment under criminal law."
"We in the Member States are facing a common problem, which, more and more, is having effects which go beyond the borders of the State in which the crimes are committed."
"This makes it crucial that we implement concerted measures for protecting the environment under criminal law, which are in force right across the territory of the European Union."
"Either through criminal laws or through severe sanctions - and I stress the adjective severe - which are commensurate with the offence and which act as an effective deterrent."
"Furthermore, as Mrs Schörling pointed out, there must also be a global course of preventive action, under which Member States can guarantee that companies whose activities involve a greater risk to the environment and which might have harmful effects on public health are properly informed about the environmental consequences of their activities and that they adopt the appropriate safety measures and precautions."
"It is therefore imperative that the methods for combating serious environmental crimes are strengthened and coordinated between Member States."
"To conclude, I wish to call on the Member States that have not yet signed up to the Council of Europe' s 1998 Convention on the protection of the environment, to adopt, under their national legislation, the necessary measures to do so as quickly as possible."
") Mr President, the harmonisation of Member States' criminal law on combating environmental crime forms a very serious part of the policy to create an area of freedom, security and justice and an essential supplement to any effective environmental policy."
"I would therefore like to congratulate both the Danish Government on the initiative it has undertaken and the honourable members, Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Schörling, who have used their texts to broaden and specify the scope of the initiative."
"Despite the Danish initiative being a positive step in the right direction, it does in fact have its weak points in comparison, for example, with the 1998 Council of Europe Convention."
"This is because it focuses solely on criminal law and disregards questions of prevention, health, protection of cultural heritage and so forth."
"However, despite its weak points and contradictions, the initiative is a positive one because it promotes the creation of a legislative framework which will allow for more coordinated joint action through a stronger Europol, mainly in tackling cross-border environmental crime."
"It lays down minimum sanctions, particularly for cases in which the environment is sacrificed at the altar of profit."
"I fully endorse this approach because, as we all know, the punishments laid down for environmental crime are grossly out of proportion with the effect which these crimes have on society as a whole."
"However, we feel that the Danish initiative has not properly examined the Member States' legislation and will probably be difficult to implement because of the major discrepancies between them."
"But I do agree with the reference to the liability of legal persons given that, by definition and by nature, the majority of environmental crimes are committed by corporations and industries."
"I also feel that the reference to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is essential as I think that every proposal ought to take account of the prospect of enlargement."
"Furthermore, I must stress the need for educating and training the personnel who will be responsible for investigating and prosecuting environmental crimes, the need to highlight preventative measures and the need for all the Member States to ratify the 1998 Convention of the Council of Europe. To date, not one Member State has ratified it."
"I should also like to stress that the Member States will have to pledge to work together on this extremely important issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is both an incredibly complicated and, at the same time, incredibly important area."
"It is a logical continuation of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Council of Ministers' summit in Tampere."
"It is a classic area requiring cooperation."
"When we look at the Danish text, as well as at Mr Di Lello Finuoli' s report and Mrs Schörling' s opinion, which are both excellent, we see, however, that it is an extremely complicated area."
"We must have good coordination between the assistance agreement, which has recently been debated here in the Chamber, and the rules concerning money laundering."
"I am not completely certain that the instrument is ready in every respect, but I am pleased that the attempt is being made to avoid duplicating the work of the Council of Europe."
"We see that there are really three parts to the Danish initiative, plus the demand for ratification of the Council of Europe' s Convention."
"It is important to have regulations in criminal law so that we can prevent environmental crime."
"I personally believe that confiscation rules are more important than the demand for strict penalties and severe fines."
"Experience shows that a very great deal can, in fact, be achieved by means of strict confiscation rules."
"We have the old saw, 'Crime must not pay' ."
"As Mrs Schörling also pointed out, we must have close cooperation, including when it comes to the rules relating to environmental liability which we are to draw up and which are mentioned in Article 2 (a)."
"I am pleased that, in the opinion she has drafted, Mrs Schörling also takes up the question of animals, which does not surprise me at all."
"I think that we in this Chamber should say loudly and clearly that this must be an instrument with which we tackle the disgraceful ways in which animals are transported."
"We are quite surprised that the Commission, for example, has not set to and wanted to apply the existing rules."
"Why is the Commission so passive - much more passive than in many other areas - when it comes to being the Guardian of the Treaties on the issue of protecting animals in transit?"
"Amendments 16 and 19 introduce interesting matters which I doubt would be a part of many other countries' criminal legislation."
"They concern misleading information provided by local or national authorities, at the same time as the latter, in their turn, have been misled."
"I think this is something we should study in the future."
"I see this as a clear illustration of the current questions in Baia Mare and of the investigation which is under way there concerning who is really liable."
"Who has misled whom?"
"These are very complicated, very interesting and very important questions."
"I am also pleased that specific vessels have been cited and that there is also a readiness to apply measures outside the territory of the EU."
"We should nonetheless be aware that, if we do this, we must also define what constitutes the type of serious environmental crime we are talking about combating."
"Mr President. I think it is accepted by most people that the existing laws are much too lenient and it is important that some sort of provision is put in place to ensure that criminal law cases are possible."
"In the present situation there is no incentive whatsoever either for companies to clean up their act, to take responsibility to ensure that negligence does not occur."
"This has a knock-on effect on other companies as well."
"When it comes to taking legal action it is up to individual citizens themselves to take up these cases and that can be extremely difficult and expensive."
"Of course, people can be up against big companies with huge amounts of power and resources at their disposal which makes it very very difficult in many cases for them to pursue these cases to the end and ensure that the companies pay the price."
"They really are criminals who through negligence or through deliberate action are destroying the environment, affecting human health, affecting our flora and fauna and causing in many other ways long-term damage, all in the interest of profit."
"Companies that manage land and sea transport, for example, have in many cases absolutely no sense of responsibility and it is essential for some sort of sanctions to be put in place to ensure that they are forced to act responsibly."
"Governments should provide more information and make clear to the public the scale and effects of environmental crime because many sections of our society are unaware of this."
"For example in relation to water, soil, our health, flora, fauna and indeed climate, it is extremely important that proper information is made available."
"Moreover it is not just companies."
"Sometimes it is national authorities who are actually flouting the law and behaving in an utterly negligent way."
"I do not have to go any further than my own country to see that in many cases local authorities and so on are actually responsible themselves for environmental damage."
"And, when it comes to enforcing the law in relation to companies that are operating in their area, they are negligent in that respect as well."
"It seems that profit comes before the interests of the public and the environment."
"That should not be allowed to continue and authorities who fail to enforce the law should themselves be held liable for the environmental damage caused as a result."
"Whether it is deliberate or through negligence, at the end of the day it makes very little difference because the damage is done."
"In many cases companies use the argument of negligence rather than saying it is deliberate but in fact negligence in its way is deliberate."
"These firms knew the consequences and they should be held accountable for the complete and total cost of cleaning up the damage that they have caused wherever possible."
"The other thing I would like to point out is that there are companies, such as British Nuclear Fuels, who have absolutely no sense of public responsibility or environmental awareness."
"They have been causing pollution for such a long, long time the length of our coast by polluting the Irish Sea and putting the public in Ireland, and indeed on the west coast of the United Kingdom, at serious risk."
"You only have to look at what happened in Chernobyl which again was due to a negligent attitude."
"How long is that going to take to rectify?"
"These situations can no longer be allowed in a world where we should be fully aware of the environmental problems that we are causing."
"We have the technology, the know-how and the resources to ensure that these things do not happen."
"The Erika is another example of negligence."
"I would also like to support the last speaker who talked about animal transport."
"This is deliberate exploitation and ill-treatment of animals and should be taken into account as well."
"On an international level we have seen many many disasters in the past, just to take Bhopal as an example."
"Cost-cutting and cutting corners caused the biggest environmental disaster in history."
"That company still has not been held properly and legally responsible."
"It was taken to court in India."
"The head of the company was supposed to be arrested and a warrant was issued for his arrest."
"He absconded to the United States where he has decided to stay and has not come back to face the consequences of his action, even despite warrants from Interpol."
"Then there are the issues of forestry and fishing."
"The malpractice of many fishing activities should be taken into account because it is also an environmental crime which has long-term consequences."
"It is about time that we all faced up to our responsibilities because we have not only ourselves and our environment to think of but future generations as well."
"The only way we are going to do that is to ensure that environmental damage is considered one of the most serious crimes in our society."
"Mr President, it is not difficult to express one' s support for the analysis that has been put forward in this report."
"The effects of environmental crime spread into the territory of many countries."
"The importation and exportation of crimes does not recognise the EU' s external borders."
"The crimes are often committed by a corporate body."
"The crimes are often perpetrated in a spirit of profit-making."
"The perpetrator makes the profit; external costs are left for others to pay."
"You analysed the situation quite correctly: the environment must be broadly interpreted as people' s health, biodiversity and artistic and cultural heritage."
"It is not hard to support a policy that makes it easier to combat environmental crime."
"These crimes must be made unprofitable; they cannot be allowed to have merely financial consequences. They have to be prevented."
"Publicity is also one way of combating environmental criminality."
"Why do we not start by publicising, or demanding publicity for, the fact that the Belgian Government allows unclean waste water to run into the river in the city of Brussels?"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Italian radical members of the Technical Group of Independent Members, I would like to say that the Di Lello Finuoli report certainly contributes to improving Denmark' s initiative, and we therefore congratulate the rapporteur."
"However, in addition to repeating the positive things that have already been said, it is important to stress some of the limitations of Denmark' s initiative, precisely to help us to take more effective action in the future."
"Mrs Karamanou has already made an important point: in reality, the Council is not telling us what the current state of the Member States' laws is."
"Now, my reaction may well be over-cautious, but I am very suspicious of those who say: let us raise fines, let us increase the sanctions, without, however, telling us what these fines and sanctions are."
"I think it would have been appropriate for Denmark and the Council to have also given us a framework of sanctions, so that we could have seen what really are the most serious gaps that need to be filled and the most serious limitations of the European situation."
"The part on criminal sanctions is, of course, important, and the European legal framework must surely be made consistent."
"Nevertheless, this is not the only question concerning respect for the environment and environmental disasters: we need to take a more comprehensive view of the matter."
"We know, for example, that the levels of pollutant emissions are decreasing in the European Union, and they are decreasing because of the structure underpinning the way the economy operates."
"Clearly, we also need to intervene with the criminal framework where real crimes are committed, but it is important for the criminal framework to be consistent with the rest of the legislation, administrative sanctions and provisions regulating the economy in order to make the overall framework consistent."
"Indeed, administrative sanctions, which affect the effective costs of businesses, are often sanctions which have an even stronger preventive effect than criminal sanctions: the person in charge of a business or a company is unlikely to consider the risk of being arrested or of facing criminal sanctions when a tragedy occurs, while on the other hand, it is preferable if he or she is obliged, on a daily basis, to consider the higher expense that polluting processes entail."
"Having said that, if, as many of the Members have said, the Council of Europe Convention is more comprehensive and more consistent, perhaps in these cases we should also ask ourselves how the European Union might be able to consider the Council of Europe texts directly in order to make legislation more homogeneous, both within and outside the Union."
"I would like to make one final remark about the sensitive matter of the relationship between the State and pollution."
"We speak of individuals and companies, whereas the state-owned companies or the State itself are often partly responsible for major environmental disasters."
"This is something which should be taken into account, and I think that the initiative of Denmark and the Council does not do this directly enough."
"I will end by extending my congratulations once more to the rapporteur, Mr Di Lello Finuoli."
"Mr President, in all decisions and acts, it is sensible first to examine what has already been regulated and what else we are prepared to do or can do."
"In the Council of Europe - and this has already been echoed by others - a convention was concluded in 1998 to fight international environmental crime."
"However, most Member States have yet to sign and ratify this ""Convention of the Council of Europe on the Protection of the Environment"" ."
"Denmark has proposed that more far-reaching measures be taken at EU level to fight environmental crime."
"Within the Council of Ministers, the only item which survived in the framework decision was that of criminalisation, and all Denmark' s other ideas have been taken out."
"As such, the added value of such a framework decision has been nullified, since penalisation was already included in the Council of Europe' s Convention."
"In more concrete terms, fewer countries have signed up to the framework decision than the Council of Europe' s Convention."
"Hence it is preferable for various Member States to sign and ratify the Council of Europe' s Convention."
"Needless to say, I welcome further steps at EU level, such as the Danish proposal."
"My question to the Council of Ministers is whether it would be prepared to go this extra mile."
"The European Parliament, however, is now caught in a dilemma."
"Should it issue a recommendation with regard to the Danish proposal or with regard to the Council of Ministers' amended proposal?"
"Since we only have the Danish proposal at our disposal, we will use it as our basis, although we wonder whether this is at all useful, because if the Council enforces the watered-down proposal, I for one will argue against laying down any EU framework decision at all."
"Concerning the Danish proposal, I would firstly point out that this framework decision should mainly be considered as a supplement to the national approach to environmental crime."
"This supplement must have a legal framework for an international approach, such as coordination, information exchange, reporting of crimes, central registration and criminal prosecution in international environmental crime."
"In order to make clear what does and does not fall within the scope of the framework decision, a sound definition of environmental crime is vital."
"I principally assent to the formulations proposed by Denmark, although I wonder whether the illegal trade in threatened flora and fauna could be added to the definition."
"Even if we can agree on a sound definition, the application will be difficult in practice."
"Was the Erika disaster an example of environmental crime?"
"And what about the cyanide pollution in Romania?"
"It was a clear case of extensive environmental damage, but do the other criteria apply too?"
"It is important that liability for these acts eventually falls to those responsible."
"It would be useful if this issue could be included in the White Paper on environmental liability."
"Many of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs concern editorial changes, some of which are redundant."
"In my opinion, it is better to give the Danish proposal to the Council our full backing than to propose minor changes of no real consequence. I do, however, support additional ideas, such as providing information on the effects of environmental crime and court rulings."
"Mr President, naturally I am interested in the European Commission' s view."
"Could Commissioner Schreyer clarify this rather odd procedure which we have ended up with?"
"Mr President, on most occasions when my Irish colleague Mrs McKenna speaks in this House we would disagree, but on an issue like this we have far more in common than that which divides us."
"I certainly recognise that the greatest environmental disasters occur as a consequence either of irresponsibility or the actions of those who are driven by the profit motive, irrespective of the consequences."
"Regrettably such disasters affect many countries at the same time."
"We know only too well that major environmental disasters respect no international frontiers."
"In more recent times we experienced the problems caused by the pollution of the Danube with cyanide from Romanian mines, the Erika tanker break-up off the French Atlantic coastline and, from an Irish point of view, the continuing problems caused by Sellafield."
"And of course in the not-so-distant past there was Chernobyl, the memory of which still haunts us."
"Events such as this will continue to recur unless and until we establish the ""polluter pays"" principle in the fullest sense of these words."
"Multinational firms will only change their behaviour when they are forced to pay heavily for their misdeeds."
"They will continue to inflict damage on the environment when the rewards far exceed the punishment."
"Their attitude is based on the simple belief that implementing restrictive environmental protection either harms their business activities or increases their financial overheads significantly."
"Furthermore, any meagre fine they will be obliged to pay pales into insignificance when compared to the huge profits that they make."
"I therefore welcome this initiative that acknowledges the international nature of environmental damage."
"It recognises the need for strong punitive sanctions."
"In particular the criminalisation of environmental damage will send a clear warning to those responsible for it."
"If the Danish proposals were to be implemented, those who put unsafe vessels on our seas would think twice."
"Others, such as the management at Sellafield, who deliberately conceal information and involve themselves in bad practices, be held accountable for their deeds."
"And the chief executives and managers of the multinationals who make the important decisions displaying the callous disregard for the consequences would face the proposal of not only seeing their businesses maybe in some cases closed down because of heavy fines and seizure of assets and so on, but they themselves could face imprisonment."
"I believe that this is a direction in which we must go but I would also like to make one additional point."
"Proposals and actions in this field should not simply be confined to the territory of the European Union."
"We have a responsibility to ensure that multinational firms are unable to transport their damage and their behaviour to the developing world because of restrictions that we may place upon them within the European Union."
"We must also impose standards on European firms that operate in the developing world and seek international cooperation to have tough standards and sanctions applied on a worldwide basis."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the Danish Government on taking the initiative to propose the Council framework decision that we are discussing, which aims to equip us with more effective tools for combating serious environmental crime."
"We also congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Di Lello Finuoli, who, throughout the negotiation of this initiative, has acted with great clarity and strength in relation to our shared principles and values, but also with prudence and flexibility, which led him to adopt several amendments incorporating various adjustments."
"We are therefore arriving at a final proposal that we consider to be both reasonable and ambitious."
"We welcome the fact that, by means of this framework decision, the European Union is supporting the Convention on the Protection of the Environment through criminal law that was approved in the Council of Europe in 1998 and which has so far not been ratified by enough States to enter into force."
"In the European Union, only nine Member States have signed it, and only one has so far ratified it, which is still quite scandalous."
"My colleague and compatriot Carmen Cerdeira contributed ideas and amendments that are now part of the text on which we are going to vote."
"I agree with these and would like to highlight four aspects in which I feel that we have succeeded in improving the initial proposal during the parliamentary process."
"The first aspect is that it is recognised that a country may act against criminals when the crime against the environment has been committed on its own territory, but also when it has been committed in another country, if the consequences of that crime affect the former."
"The second aspect is that this ability to act has been extended and will affect not only crimes that have been committed, but also attempted crimes which, for one reason or another, do not have any effect, but could have had effects."
"A third element is that it is applied to legal persons, when they are responsible, as it is they, rather than individuals, that commit the vast majority of serious environmental crimes."
"The fourth element that I wish to highlight is that the financial and other penalties imposed for such crimes will always have to be greater than the benefit that the perpetrators would gain from them."
"This will put an end to a situation in which, in many cases, it is not only cheap but actually profitable for them to commit a crime."
"This is a good document, which we hope will be effective, but we also need to be committed to it."
"Mr President, I would first like to join in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on his work."
"I am pleased with this initiative from the Danish Government, which is based on the new procedure established in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in order to deal with the matter of ensuring better and greater protection for the environment in the European Union, something which should obviously not be limited by borders within the Union."
"My colleague, Mrs Thors, has already expressed our favourable position with regard both to the report and to the amendments tabled by the respective committees, and I will therefore focus on three points."
"For some time, I have been trying to ensure that the Commission deals appropriately with European forests, and I have seen the problems that have arisen as a result of the need to deal in a variety of ways with this issue which has a clear environmental dimension."
"The first difficulty that I see in truly applying this proposal is in categorising environmental crimes, given the diversity within the Union."
"The second matter is the need to consider the international dimension of the crime."
"We have seen how difficult it is to find out who is ultimately responsible for many large-scale environmental crimes, but, furthermore, the set of legal responsibilities of the entities who, ultimately, appear to be responsible, really makes it very difficult to actually deal with these crimes from a criminal point of view."
"I think that this will be an important task for the Commission."
"We have to prevent criminal responsibilities from being blurred."
"Thirdly, Mr President, I just want to say that it is essential that the field of justice and home affairs be communitised in the European Union, and this proposal demonstrates that."
"Mr President, we in the United Left welcome this initiative from Denmark concerning the penalties which should result from environmental crime."
"Clearly, there are quite a lot of Member States which have problems imposing effective penalties for this type of crime."
"In my own country, Sweden, a great many reports of environmental crimes are now being made."
"It is remarkable, however, how small a proportion of the reports subsequently lead to guilty verdicts."
"When one looks at the consequences of these judgements, it has to be said that they are fairly light in many cases."
"I do not think that this is in any way unique to Sweden."
"These problems certainly exist in a number of Member States, and there are certainly many different reasons for this."
"One reason may be a lack of knowledge and of resources for investigating environmental crimes through the legal system."
"At the same time, there is also still an outmoded view that environmental crimes are not as serious as other crimes and that environmental laws are not as binding as other laws."
"If that is the case, then that is, of course, quite unacceptable."
"Major financial interests are often at stake."
"At present, it pays to commit environmental crimes because the risk of having a penalty imposed is so small."
"What is perhaps most remarkable about this is that there are so few countries which can sue legal persons and hold companies liable."
"Altering this state of affairs is perhaps the most important change which can be made."
"Obviously, this is, in the first place, a responsibility of the Member States, and there should be international cooperation in this area."
"Coordination as a result of this initiative is, of course, also necessary."
"In addition to the fact that coordination reinforces the work done by the Member States, I would emphasise three other reasons for engaging in this."
"The first is that many environmental crimes have international consequences, something which many people have emphasised in the course of the debate."
"The second reason is that, if this Danish initiative is implemented, it will facilitate pan-European environmental cooperation in the Council of Europe and perhaps enable this convention to be complied with."
"The third reason is that we all know that environmental law is that area of EC law which is least complied with."
"An initiative like this might also lead to EC law being better observed in the environmental area which is absolutely necessary if we consider how certain directives are followed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Save the Planet!"
"This is a mission which we have to accomplish."
"Sustainability is a really important concept, particularly in times like these."
"We should try to set an example because the environment is a really important criterion for future generations."
"However, I should particularly like to come back to Amendment No 3, which concerns the profit motive."
"The profit motive is also something completely natural and sensible."
"Companies in the red or countries which get into debt cannot pay the salaries which are desirable for employees and civil servants."
"We are in favour of high salaries, so we also need to make profits."
"At the end of the day, I also support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There are 18 million of them in the European Union, on which jobs directly depend."
"Whether profits or long-term losses are made threatens the company' s existence and in particular, also the jobs it creates."
"I should now like to come to Amendment No 8 and point out that criminal law is obviously not like occupational practice legislation."
"I would have liked us to have obtained at least an opinion on this from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market because such issues are, after all, extremely important in principle and in my view, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy cannot deal with them conclusively on its own."
"I should also like to make it clear that the company' s obligation to gain trust must be defined or interpreted in such a way that it must of course relate to the rules concerning the extent of the authorisation for the plant."
"The individual company must, of course, be aware of the rules, so that it can then also comply with them."
"On Amendment No 19, I should like to say that it can obviously only be taken to mean deliberately providing misleading information, and Amendment No 20 obviously only deals with financial gain."
"On Amendment No 25, I should like to say that within the insurance industry it is in fact still not possible to calculate or insure pure environmental damage."
"We would need it to be defined precisely."
"I believe, nevertheless, that this proposal is by and large very sensible, especially when we think of enlargement with Central and Eastern European countries."
"If we create a legal framework for the future now, it could be very useful to our thinking on the environment."
"However, I am of the opinion that the criminal sanctions should first and foremost only be applied in the case of criminal intent or persistent gross negligence."
"The threat of imprisonment is an approach that really threatens a person' s livelihood!"
"I should not like to put a worker behind bars and threaten his livelihood because on one occasion, he acts with gross negligence by not turning off a tap."
"I would therefore suggest that we are extremely cautious with these criteria because this is obviously a very sensitive area."
"We should also think very carefully how to optimise the best practice method in this instance, that is to say, best practice and benchmarking and offering incentives are an important basis particularly for environmental protection."
"The European Union, in particular, has shown that a great deal can be achieved in this respect with numerous incentives, research and development, and consultation."
"However, training and certification are obviously necessary too."
"We have already spoken about EMAS this week."
"If we follow this positive route via incentives, then we will really be protecting our planet."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group on this Danish initiative for a framework directive on combating environmental crime, I must say that I support the principle of this initiative."
"Environmental crime, whether it be the illegal trade in endangered species of flora and fauna or their products, or whether it be the illegal export and dumping of toxic waste in other countries, either inside or outside the European Union, is a growing and increasingly a cross-border problem."
"Those engaged in these crimes in the search for profit hide within the interstices of European law."
"This cannot be allowed to continue."
"It is important that we have legislation in place to protect us against serious environmental crime before we see further enlargement of the European Union."
"At the moment, we have nothing to combat these crimes but derisory financial penalties."
"We must impose prison sentences as well as serious financial penalties and orders for restitution when people are found guilty of environmental crimes."
"We must identify as culprits not the victims who drive the lorries full of toxic waste, or hawk the products which threaten species, but those who make the decisions and who supply the goods, the big men and women rather than the little men and women."
"As usual, of course, the devil is in the detail."
"The Danes want harmonisation in criminal law, increased European cooperation, a register of expertise and know-how and the use of Europol."
"Some difficulties exist in resolving all of these to the satisfaction of the 15 Member States of the Union."
"All can be resolved, but some will have to wait."
"It is probably too early at this stage, for example, to widen Europol' s remit without overloading the work of this important organisation."
"This proposal suffers from the same problems we have too often in the European Union."
"Without increased resources, Europol' s capabilities are limited, but I congratulate Mr Di Lello Finuoli on his report."
"Mr President, yesterday we debated and voted on a report from the Committee on Petitions."
"This year that Committee has dealt with a thousand complaints from citizens."
"Forty percent of those one thousand complaints are associated with violations of Community environmental law."
"Given these complaints we can appreciate the need for the proposal that we are examining, a Council proposal at the request of the Kingdom of Denmark, and also the need to approve the reports by Mr Di Lello Finuoli and by Mrs Schörling, from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I believe that this report covers three important aspects."
"Firstly, the request that the Council of Europe Convention on the Environment should not only be signed, but also that it should be ratified."
"No state has ratified the convention so far, but that is not contradictory with adopting this report here today."
"The report gives a quite correct definition of the parameters that are useful for defining the crime: repeated violations of Community law, the seriousness of the damage and, in some cases, putting profits before any other consideration."
"We believe that the crimes are often clearly premeditated."
"Of course they are, Mr President, even in the case of some environmental crimes that appear to be accidental."
"I well remember the case of Doñana in Spain or of the Danube."
"It was obvious that a reservoir containing such a large quantity of dangerous products near to a natural park such as Doñana could cause an accident at any time."
"Secondly, Mr President, I feel that penalties are essential."
"I am in no doubt about this."
"Some of the Members here today shed doubt on the need for penalties."
"I do not. I think that even the 'polluter pays' principle is a partial one."
"Sometimes there are those who prefer to pollute and pay a small amount, which is much less than the profits that they will gain from committing the crime."
"Penalties are therefore essential, and they need to be designed to act as a deterrent and to be proportional to the damage to citizens' quality of life."
"Thirdly, the natural environment should be regenerated."
"Mr President, is it not acceptable that, in the case of Doñana, public money should be being used to regenerate the area, while the company that caused the major damage has only contributed a small proportion?"
"It is therefore essential to regenerate the damaged environment, and also for legal persons to be liable."
"Only in the United Kingdom, Finland, and Denmark are there rules that enable legal persons to be held liable."
"To conclude, Mr President, I would like to mention cooperation between states, which is essential."
"In the Committee on Petitions, we are aware of the terrible frustration felt by those citizens who take the trouble to report environmental crimes and see that, in Europe, we are incapable of coming to their aid in order to improve the natural environment in which they live and to prevent these crimes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to Denmark for this excellent initiative, and thanks too to the rapporteur for the good work."
"It is definitely so that when the fines are small, environmental crime becomes lucrative."
"But we have to remember that this branch of criminality also affects people, people within and outside the workplace."
"The framework decision would prevent this sort of crime from being profitable."
"In my opinion, however, the multinational giants are the big problem, and co-operation between the authorities is needed in this area, also so that these regulations might enter into force before enlargement."
"The worst environmental crimes are those perpetrated by companies, for which it is just part of their business."
"Some of these are repeatedly found guilty of these crimes."
"It is just this repeated, intentional, environmentally criminal activity that is what we should be looking into."
"I hope that the Commission will make a public register of such companies, as for them it has become just a part of their business. Consumers and people in general could then bring public opinion to bear on the situation."
"I come from a country where we can initiate criminal proceedings against a corporate body, and that has had an impact and preventive effect there."
"It is obvious that the director of a company will take a more serious view of the environment, as it is possible that he will end up isolated from it as a result of having gone to prison for criminally abusing it."
"I therefore think that when people start having to face the consequences, progress will be made in the matter both within the Union and in other respects."
"Mr President, like everyone else, I want to join in the praise of the Danish Government which has taken this initiative."
"It goes to show that there can be aggressive and progressive action in the Council when it comes specifically to environmental questions."
"As we know, conscious and intentional misconduct by companies and individuals in environmental matters not only puts our countryside at risk but also endangers people' s lives."
"I am quite convinced that if anyone says the word Teckomatorp in my country, Sweden, then everyone - or at any rate the majority of people - knows what the word signifies, even though it is an environmental crime which was committed more than 20 years ago."
"It concerned a company which did not manage to deal with its poisonous waste but chose instead to bury it in the ground and in that way put a whole district at risk."
"Unfortunately, Teckomatorp is not the only event of this kind, and many representatives here in Parliament have also witnessed other events which have occurred since then, not to mention the situation - akin to that in the Wild West - which prevails on our high seas."
"Obviously, we must regard environmental crimes as seriously as we regard all other criminal acts."
"Common definitions of environmental crime are therefore also needed."
"I agreed with the draftsperson of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mrs Schörling, that, in order to prevent environmental crime, we also need effective legislation governing environmental liability."
"Preventive measures are the best way of guarding against further crimes against our environment."
"If we are to be able to investigate suspected environmental crimes efficiently and well, special knowledge is also required on the part of both police and prosecutors."
"Otherwise, there is a danger of these crimes' not being properly investigated."
"If these crimes are not detected quickly, they can remain unsolved or perhaps not have anything done about them at all."
"In the few seconds I have left, I want to address the Commission directly with the request which, among others, Mrs Thors and Mrs McKenna mentioned in connection with the transport of livestock, instances of which occur every day within the Union and which are perhaps the most obvious environmental crimes we face today."
"I should like the Commissioner to take this issue seriously on board and ensure that we get something done about the current situation."
"I really believe we have the citizens of the entire Union behind us when it comes to doing something about the dreadful ways in which livestock are transported."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I think I can say with regard to your last request that I would be happy to accept it along these lines."
"The Commission takes the view that the initiative of the Kingdom of Denmark for a Council Framework Decision basically consists of two parts."
"The first part should lead to any serious culpable breach of environmental legislation within the Community being punishable with criminal sanctions which are effective and act as a deterrent."
"It puts forward a minimum standard with regard to criminal acts."
"The initiative mainly focuses on this part, which in essence corresponds to the provisions of a convention which was adopted by the Council of Europe in November 1998."
"Unfortunately, none of the Member States - and this has also been pointed out several times here - has ratified this convention yet. I can therefore understand Denmark' s initiative, which now seeks to deal with this issue afresh within the framework of the Community powers."
"The second part, on the other hand, contains provisions on improving cooperation and the exchange of information between the law enforcement authorities and the courts of law of the Member States."
"There is a lot to be said for an all­embracing approach to such issues of legal assistance and improved cooperation within the judicial field that is not limited just to environmental law."
"In accordance with this, a Council working group - one speaker has gone into it already - is currently working just on the first part of the initiative, that is, on substantive criminal law."
"There are already several initiatives and proposals on improving cooperation in criminal law matters, which are not limited to environmental criminal law."
"A primary aim of the Treaty of Amsterdam and one of the Communities' general objectives is to improve mutual legal assistance, the exchange of information and other forms of cooperation between the courts and the public prosecution authorities of the Member States, in order to create a genuine area of freedom, security and justice."
"What we need for this are very clear and transparent provisions, which are easy to deal with, and to which the individual authorities can quickly refer when applying the law."
"The Commission takes the view that in order to achieve this and counteract fragmentation within the field of justice, the rules on legal assistance should have as much general applicability as possible."
"Special provisions, such as in environmental law, should only be made when required and as an exception."
"With this in mind, the European Judicial Network was established in 1998 through a joint action. It has started its work and is developing many activities to make legal assistance and the exchange of information easier."
"Of course, the Commission takes the view that this must be developed further."
"As well as the international convention already in existence on legal assistance and mutual recognition of judgements, further Community actions are planned in this area."
"The Commission very much welcomes the first part of Denmark' s initiative."
"Until now, the environment has certainly not been protected as legal property by criminal law in all Member States."
"While some Member States have specified particular environmental offences in their criminal law, this is not the case with others."
"A serious breach of environmental law is therefore not necessarily punishable in every Member State."
"This is then naturally to some extent an incentive for cross­border environmental crimes."
"The overall lack of enforcement in environmental protection cannot, of course, be corrected by criminal law measures alone, but here too, this framework decision would certainly provide new impetus."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the question has already been raised as to whether the existing Community law of the first pillar already contains adequate obligations for the Member States."
"On this subject, it must be said that the instruments of the first pillar frequently provide for sanctions, but these do not necessarily need to be in the form of criminal law."
"Under the first pillar, it is in principle up to the Member States whether they regard sanctions of administrative law as adequate or whether they take up the sharper sword of criminal law."
"I would like to mention one point, which still appears problematic from the Commission' s point of view, and which has also been mentioned in different speeches here, and that is the question of the punishability of legal persons."
"The Danish initiative provides that legal persons must be made responsible under criminal law for serious environmental offences."
"In the Commission' s view, however, account must be taken of the mature legislation of some Member States, which generally rules out punishing legal persons."
"Comparable provisions of Community law merely provide that sanctions should be imposed on legal persons, which may then be entirely in the form of administrative law, and - as has rightly been said repeatedly - that the material damage caused is then punished by financial penalties."
"This is also included."
"On the question of financial penalties, I should once again like to point out the significance of the Green Paper - which the Commission published a few months ago - on environmental liability, which ultimately aims to include the environmental damage caused."
"In the interest of the initiative' s chances of implementation, it may well be advisable to proceed in this case by talking about responsibility of legal persons without using the words ""under criminal law"" ."
"Irrespective of this, however, the persons responsible for serious environmental offences should, of course, also be subject to criminal law."
"There was in fact unanimous agreement on this in this very interesting debate."
"To conclude, may I say, on behalf of the Commission, that, unfortunately, we are repeatedly having to instigate infringement proceedings against Member States in matters of environmental law, and there is a large number of infringement proceedings pending in this self-same sector."
"Unfortunately, this gives the overall impression that perhaps many Member States do not take the area of environmental protection and environmental law so seriously after all."
"Against this background, the Danish initiative is very noteworthy and significant from the Commission' s point of view."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we were more than happy to endorse this report, because we believe that environmental crime is still being underestimated, that its effects often go undetected and liability is sometimes difficult to establish."
"The dioxin scandal in Belgium started with the illegal dumping of a few litres of toxic spent oil from transformers which ended up in animal feed."
"In some cases, environmental crimes are not detected or are detected when it is too late."
"Often, environmental officials draw up official reports which are subsequently 'filed away' within the legal system. After all, fighting and prosecuting environmental crimes is not a priority for many Member States."
"At any rate, cooperation in terms of criminal prosecution at European level still leaves a great deal to be desired."
"This was once again borne out in this report."
"We have established that as yet, Europol has no authority whatsoever to act."
"What is more, the majority of Member States still need to ratify the Council of Europe' s 1998 Convention and environmental crimes are still not being penalised adequately in many countries."
"If Europe wants to prevent and fight environmental crime effectively, Member States will need to adopt a consistent approach and will need to accept the instruments required to achieve this."
"Mr President, this time I shall speak not only as representative of the Pensioners' Party, but also as a former sailor, because both the measures that we have discussed this morning concern the sea: the first, short sea shipping and the other, the environment, and the sea is often the victim of environmental crime."
"This morning, a pensioner telephoned me from Liguria and said: ""It is really hot."
"I wanted to go swimming but I had to come home straight away because the sea was very polluted and full of tar."
"So what are you doing for those of us who live in Liguria, in Genoa, and although we have the sea, it is polluted?"""
"""Do not worry"" , I said, ""Today is Friday 7 July."
"On Fridays we normally discuss fish, and today we are discussing the sea."""
"Now, just as I voted for the measure on short sea shipping ports - and I hope these will include Genoa, Imperia, Savona, Toulon and Marseilles - I also voted for the measure on cleaning up the sea, which is so important for pensioners and people who live on the coast."
"Mr President, I came into the Chamber to vote against this report as a protest against the misleading and inaccurate comments made by Mrs McKenna in relation to the management of the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in the United Kingdom."
"I see that Mrs McKenna felt so strongly about the matter herself that she did not bother to attend the vote."
"I can only hope that the rest of the debate and the report are more accurate than Mrs McKenna."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"We will now proceed to the approval of the Minutes from yesterday' s sitting."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, yesterday, I gave an explanation of vote in writing on trafficking in human beings, and there is no record of it in the Minutes."
"It will be duly corrected, Mrs Laguiller."
"Mr President, it is only about a correction concerning the verbatim report of proceedings for Wednesday' s sitting."
"That is to say, I have just learnt about this report and discovered the following in the process: I was interrupted by rounds of applause and heckling several times during my speech on the Radwan report about the European Central Bank' s annual report, particularly after the speeches made by several former communists from the GDR, when I described as absolute rubbish the solutions which they - the people who ruined an entire country - have put forward again here, and when I pointed out how important the European Central Bank' s independence is, particularly in view of nine out of twelve national governments in Euroland being red­pink­green."
"There is no record of this in the verbatim report of proceedings."
"Neither can I find any record in the verbatim report of my statement that it would be better for the strength of the euro if the electorate were to give the red-green governments, of which there are too many, their marching orders rather than imposing political sanctions against Austria. These represent an attempt to manipulate an election result that brought a government to power, which is now trying to create grey markets after 30 years of a socialist web of patronage and nepotism."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mrs Lulling, we are approving the Minutes."
"The President has taken note of your correction to the Verbatim Report of Proceedings, and Parliament' s enthusiasm for your comments will be duly noted in the Minutes."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.40 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 7 July 2000."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, once again it is my sad duty to open our plenary sitting against the background of the violence in the Spanish Basque Country which has intensified dramatically over the summer."
"A further seven victims have been murdered by an organisation whose strategy is clearly, henceforth, one of attempting to defeat democracy by the use of terror."
"Let me give the names of the murder victims: José María Martin Carpena, a Popular Party municipal councillor in Malaga, whose widow and daughter are to visit the House tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.;"
"Juan María Jauregui, the former Civil Governor of Guipuzcoa;"
"José Maria Korta, president of the Guipuzcoa employers' association;"
"Francisco Casanova, a Second Lieutenant in the Spanish army;"
"Irene Fernández Pereda and José Angel de Jesus Encinas, members of the Guardia Civil in Sallent de Gallego; Manuel Indiano, Popular Party municipal councillor in Zumarraga."
"On each of these sad occasions, I expressed our solidarity with the victims."
"I have expressed our condemnation of these unspeakably barbaric acts."
"I have also offered the Spanish authorities our support."
"Today, Parliament as a whole, unanimous in spite of the range of our political affiliations, is honouring their memory, affirming loudly and clearly that terrorism is the very antithesis of democracy."
"To deny the right to life is to kill liberty."
"Not only is violence a solution to be condemned, it is also inefficient, as it isolates and excludes the perpetrators of such actions."
"I propose a minute' s silence as a last tribute to these victims, as an expression of our support for their families and friends and, indeed, to all democratic men and women in Spain, and particularly in the Spanish Basque Country, who, despite the climate of terror, continue to believe in political dialogue, the fundamental values of civilised society and the ultimate victory of democracy."
"Please stand and observe this minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"- Madam President, unfortunately I cannot agree with what you have said."
"There is no truth except the whole truth."
"A part of reality is not sufficient by itself."
"The whole is the only real truth."
"This is much more than a metaphysical quotation from Hegel."
"We in Euskal Herritarrok also regret profoundly the loss of human lives and share with all Basque citizens the shocked feelings of our people at the moment."
"Bertrand Russell denounced the obscenity of deliberately humiliating a nation, of making people crazy so that a straitjacket would be needed."
"This is actually the Spanish Government's strategy towards the Basque country."
"The action of ETA is a righteous expression of the struggle for recognition of something quite elementary."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, in view of the circumstances, I must say, personally, and this is perhaps not quite in keeping with my duties as President, that I find your contribution quite unacceptable here."
"(Loud applause)"
"Tribute"
"Addressing more particularly those Members of Parliament that were members of the previous legislature, it is my very sad duty to inform you of the deaths, this summer, of Vassilis Ephremidis and Staffan Burenstam Linder."
"Many of you will have very clear memories of their time with us, of their particularly dynamic presence, and I have taken the liberty of sending condolences to their families on behalf of the House as a whole, of course."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"In a letter I sent to you on 1 September, I referred to various allegations in the British Press about one Member of this House, Mr Hannan, and the fact that he is alleged to have raised over GBP 100 000 for the 'no' campaign in the Danish referendum on the euro."
"Could you launch an investigation into this matter to establish that Mr Hannan did not use Parliament premises or the staff to which he is entitled as a Member of this House to raise that money?"
"Could you also ensure that Mr Hannan states the position in his declaration of financial interests in advance of the referendum in Denmark so that the citizens of that country can see where the money came from?"
"Mr Murphy, I note your statement."
"I have indeed received your letter, and I have forwarded it to the quaestors, who will see what action needs to be taken in response to it."
"Madam President, could I ask you to invite colleagues, when they make declarations of that type, to assure themselves that the Member concerned has been informed of such a declaration? It is very discourteous to make that sort of remark, openly in the Chamber, when the Member concerned is not present."
"Mr McMillan-Scott, the problem I have is that I never know what subject the Member is going to raise."
"In fact, that should really have been a procedural motion."
"Madam President, I rise on a point of order on the issue of the recent industrial action at the French Channel ports, which caused major disruption yet again to EU citizens legitimately travelling between the United Kingdom and other Member States."
"Is the House aware that the Strawberry Regulation permits expedited procedures for the owners of goods delayed by this type of action to receive compensation, but does not give the same rights of compensation to tourists and other travellers?"
"Are you aware of the anger felt by citizens of this Union who seem to be regularly disrupted by these wildcat actions which are now taking place for the sixth summer running at the Channel ports?"
"Would you, Madam President, undertake to raise with the President-in-office and the Commission what action can be taken forthwith to stop this happening in future by strengthening the regulation, which I believe is No 2679/98."
"Thank you, Mr Bradbourn, I shall happily take note of this comment."
"Madam President, I am sorry to take the floor to raise an issue which is not a point of order, but I feel that I should explain what happened today to some interpreters, officials and MEPs."
"All of us here today know what a problem it is to get to Strasbourg."
"I, for example, need to take three flights, starting at half past seven in the morning, to get from Asturias to Strasbourg."
"However, given that we arrive in Paris at 1.20 p.m. and the plane for Strasbourg leaves at 1.30 p.m., it is not acceptable to have a situation where, if the Madrid-Paris flight is delayed, we are left behind."
"Some interpreters were due to work at 4.30 p.m. and were unable to do so, and some MEPs, such as Mr Medina, left the Canary Islands yesterday evening to arrive here today at 5.00 p.m."
"If we arrive an hour late, they clearly cannot be expected to wait for us."
"However, if we arrive in Paris ten minutes late, it is not right that nobody bothers to tell the next flight to wait for us."
"This cannot continue, Madam President, because some of us have enormous problems getting here, specifically those of us who come from outlying regions."
"I would ask you to speak to Air France."
"Mrs González Álvarez, as you know, I am well aware of all these problems."
"Believe me, I am continually informing the relevant authorities, both governmental and airport, of our problems. You all received a questionnaire."
"I should like to thank the 300 Members who sent in their completed questionnaires."
"These will enable us to get an overview of the situation, as the saying goes, and indeed, I have every hope of achieving tangible results, which is what we really need, not another committee or some other such thing."
"We need real results which will change the conditions governing Members' travel to Strasbourg and I shall fight at your sides, believe me, in order to obtain them."
"Madam President, during the last Strasbourg part-session I communicated to the Presidency the enormous concern in the Bay of Algeciras and the Campo de Gibraltar about the presence of an English nuclear submarine suffering from a serious fault in the cooling system of its nuclear reactor."
"I am yet to receive any reply in this regard."
"Madam President, we Andalusians are proud to receive this broken-down vessel in our waters, but we are very concerned about the United Kingdom' s stubborn determination to repair the fault there."
"It is common knowledge, from the Royal Navy' s own documents, that this port is not sufficiently equipped for the repair of this type of fault."
"We would therefore ask for your help so that a section of the European Union' s population may be protected from any possible risk."
"To this end, I would ask you to take the necessary steps so that the said submarine may be towed away and repaired somewhere where there are sufficient safeguards, and so that we can thereby prevent the social alarm which is being caused."
"Mr Bautista Ojeda, I should like to point out that next Thursday, in the topical and urgent debate, the safety of nuclear submarines will be discussed."
"The Conference of Presidents specifically wished to widen the debate beyond the tragic accident of the Kursk."
"This will be the appropriate opportunity for you to state your case."
"Madam President, I would like to point out that this House has on many occasions condemned the death penalty, and has also made representations to the United Nations requesting moratoria."
"Furthermore, it has given its opinion on specific cases, including the case in question - the execution of Derek Barnabei which was announced in July."
"The execution is to take place in ten days time on 14 September, and I therefore feel that it is important that you, Madam President, who are well-known for your sensitivity, write to the Governor of the State of Virginia on behalf of this House and request a stay of execution."
"I shall be happy to do so, Mrs Napoletano."
"Indeed, we have already made representations on several occasions and, even if we were unsuccessful in changing the course of events, I believe we must continue to do so, and I shall do so wholeheartedly."
"Madam President, as other Members have said, there is indeed a problem with air services to Strasbourg."
"I should, however, like to remind those members that are such devotees of free competition, that since we deregulated airlines, it is no longer possible to subsidise them and to class services to and from Strasbourg as public service operations, and hence, many invitations to tender have failed to bear fruit because no airline has been prepared to offer flights which are considered to be unprofitable."
"Madam President, I am not about to enter into this debate, but I would just like to draw your attention and my fellow Members' attention to another matter concerning this city, which is the extremely sensitive and worrying situation of a group of Hungarian gypsies who arrived in Strasbourg on 24 July, following persecution and racial discrimination in their own country, and who are seeking political asylum not only in our country, but also in other European Union countries."
"I do not wish to go into the details of the situation, but the essence of the problem is of very direct concern to us since, on the one hand it provides a very tangible and specific illustration of the problems involved in applying the Copenhagen criteria, which require urgent solutions, and on the other hand, the problems that certain countries that are candidates for membership of the European Union have in fulfilling the terms of the treaty."
"Then again, it also forces us to state, once again, that respect for minorities and human rights must be assessed in the same way and on a par with compliance with the economic criteria."
"So, Madam President, and I believe you are in complete agreement with this opinion, which is also in line with the opinions adopted by this House on these issues, I should like to see the matter referred to the joint parliamentary committee, in this case the EU-Hungary Joint Parliamentary Committee, at your request, as a matter of urgency."
"The group of 46 people who are here, Madam President, the Zamoli gypsies, are placing all their hope in the ability of this House to achieve progress in these matters."
"Thank you, Mrs Gillig."
"I shall write this evening to the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, so that he can look into the situation."
"Madam President, Mr Murphy was speaking about Mr Hannan' s ill-timed interference in the Danish election campaign."
"It is not a problem for us Danes that the Conservatives have nothing to do in England, but are acting the fool in Denmark."
"We just smile at them and say, ""Heaven knows why they do not just mind their own business over in England and leave us to get on with our own business in Denmark."""
"Madam President, given that the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee is present, I should like to respond immediately to my fellow Member by saying that we are indeed going to hold a meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee this week, and I shall immediately contact the Ambassador, who is scheduled to visit us on Thursday, to see if he can offer some response to these questions as early as the Thursday sitting, and I am perfectly willing to invite my fellow Member to take part in our proceedings on Thursday morning."
"Thank you, Mr Desama, you have pre-empted us, so I do not need to write to you."
"Madam President, I am one of those MEPs who need to travel for 24 hours in order to be here by 5.00 p.m."
"I say this because I have spent half an hour trying to talk about the Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 7 July of this year."
"On Friday, 7 July, on behalf of the ELDR Group, I tabled an amendment to Mrs Peijs' s report, which was fortunately accepted."
"However, the amendment has not been correctly translated into Spanish since, where it talks about the peripheral regions, I wished to refer, and I in fact did refer, to the outermost regions of the European Union."
"Mr García, I apologise. We shall make the correction."
"We had not understood that you wished to speak regarding the Minutes."
"Madam President, since a colleague has mentioned the name of Gibraltar could I remind the House that Sunday, 10 September is the national day in Gibraltar and some of us will be there."
"But I am surprised that the House is not debating Burma on this day."
"Yesterday, the ministers of the 15 imposed sanctions on Burma, and there has been a siege of the elected leader of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi, and an outburst of violence around her home."
"The British Ambassador was beaten up this morning, and the European Parliament should take strong action towards Burma, just as the ministers are doing."
"Lord Bethell, I have, myself, already made a statement on this subject because we are extremely concerned about the highly insecure situation of the winner of the European Parliament Sakharov Prize and we are monitoring this situation extremely closely."
"Indeed, it is on the agenda for the topical and urgent debate on Thursday, i.e. the day after tomorrow."
"Madam President, I also refer to the point of order that was raised about the nuclear submarine in Gibraltar."
"I would ask you and other Members to bear in mind, when considering this issue and when it comes for debate that, although Gibraltar is part of the European Union, the residents of Gibraltar do not themselves have direct representation in this Parliament."
"I would ask this House to give urgent consideration to the exclusion of those citizens and to secure their representation in this Parliament so they can bring their concerns to this House themselves."
"Mr Perry, Members of Parliament will be able to express whatever opinions they see fit in the course of the debate."
"They do have freedom of speech."
"Madam President, some MEPs will probably be surprised to hear the reality of the situation, which is that Gibraltar is a British colony."
"It is very odd that there are still colonies within the European Union in the year 2000, but that is the case, Madam President."
"Madam President, I am afraid I must raise this issue again."
"In your letter of 14 July it appears to me that this House is putting Members' health below that of the state of the carpets."
"I was quite shocked to receive the letter to say that ashtrays will be put outside the Chamber, along with no smoking signs, because you have always been helpful in the past on this matter of smoking in this building."
"It is incredible to me that there are Parliament rules stating that there are no smoking areas yet we do not have a safe passage into this Chamber."
"I have just been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and the medication I am taking makes my asthma worse."
"I plead for a safe route from my office into this plenary session, not only for me but for other Members here who suffer from other breathing problems."
"I hope this will be put into place immediately because, otherwise, my health and other people's health will suffer."
"I hope you will look into it as a matter of urgency and remove all ashtrays from all the no smoking areas as a matter of course."
"Mrs Lynne, thank you for making this point."
"I noticed a number of quaestors applauding heartily, and so I do not for an instant doubt that they are going to draw up regulations along the lines you suggest."
"To reply to what you said to me, the regulations are already in place."
"European Parliament rules have been drawn up, and we are not abiding by them."
"Mrs Banotti will give you an answer, but if the regulations have already been drawn up, then they must and shall be applied."
"Madam President, I fear that I must say something that might upset some Members, but the ushers outside are afraid - and I use the word advisedly - to ask some Members to stop smoking, because of the kind of abuse they get when they try to do that."
"I need hardly say that I am totally against smoking as an ageing ex-nurse."
"I have personally gone round to both Members and visitors to ask them to put out their cigarettes."
"The ushers themselves have tried their very best to be diplomatic, but they are subjected, and I use the word advisedly, to abuse by some smokers when they ask them to stop smoking outside the doors."
"Members ought perhaps to be aware that this is not a very nice way of behaving towards the staff of Parliament."
"Madam President, I should like to express my respect for those who do not smoke and to state there must indeed be routes which allow them to move through the Parliament building without being affected by smoke."
"I should also like to express my respect, however, for those who do smoke, and to defend their right to smoke."
"It is important for my mental and physical wellbeing that I smoke, and I must point out that if there were no ashtrays, we would be creating even more unpleasant situations."
"There must be ashtrays, just as there must be separate areas in which smokers can smoke and non-smokers can feel comfortable."
"Mr Graça Moura, what we need is for non-smokers to respect the rights of smokers and for smokers to respect the rights of non-smokers."
"We will have a calm discussion with the quaestors in order to designate areas where Members who wish to smoke, and feel a real need, may do so reasonably while respecting the rights of those who are bothered and even made physically ill by the smoke."
"I promise you that this is something that we shall certainly sort out."
"Madam President, as a rule of thumb, when a person wishes to condemn irregular behaviour they should state the name of the offender and specify when the event occurred."
"This complaining about the rude behaviour of entire categories - whether smokers, non-smokers, reds or whites - is disgraceful!"
"In my opinion, if a Member of the European Parliament is asked to put out his cigarette by an usher, it is his duty to acknowledge civilly that the usher is doing his duty and thank him for it."
"These are therefore important matters."
"Would Mrs Banotti, who has complained of such incidents of irregular behaviour, like to state the names of those responsible and those affected, for I will be the first to request that measures be adopted to protect ushers and officials who are doing their duty."
"Having said that, it goes without saying that if some of the general rules are stupid or petty, then it will, of course, be much more difficult to uphold them."
"For example, it would appear appropriate to place an ashtray at the point which marks the end of a smoking area and the start of a non-smoking area in order to avoid cigarette butts burning the floor, but this is a question of common sense."
"In conclusion, Madam President, it would also be sensible for us to stop complaining and to behave in a manner befitting Members of Parliament."
"Just as you do over the issues of flights and Strasbourg part-sessions, you are whining like the hoi poloi instead of behaving with the dignity of representatives of a sovereign Parliament!"
"Mr Pannella, let me reassure you straight away. The quaestors are not lacking in common sense, believe me."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, has been distributed."
"Relating to Monday:"
"The Group of the European People' s Party have requested that the vote on the report by Mr Valdivielso de Cué, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the MEDA programme, be postponed until the Brussels part-session in order to enable a number of technical problems to be resolved."
"Madam President, the rapporteur, Mr Valdivielso, has just informed our group that the amendments are not yet all available in translation."
"I do not know when they will be available, but if it were to be before tomorrow then - in accordance with our agenda - the vote would have to be taken as early as tomorrow at noon!"
"This is simply impossible because we need to discuss this in our groups."
"Hence our request: if the groups still have sufficient time for discussion then the vote could be taken at the end of the week."
"But if this is not guaranteed then it will just have to be taken at the mini-session in Brussels."
"In any case, we insist, or at least we ask - as we have, of course, already decided - that the debate take place now without delay. After all, the Commissioner is here!"
"Madam President, I would like to speak against this proposal."
"We had initially heard that it was not possible to vote on the Valdivielso report because Commissioner Patten was not here."
"It now turns out that Commissioner Patten is here and it seems to me that any technical problem that there may have been, and I am aware of that possibility, could be resolved by the Parliament services within no more than 2 or 3 hours."
"I would therefore ask that the vote on the MEDA regulation be included in this part-session and if the services really need one more day to resolve the technical problems, that the vote be delayed for one day."
"However, it seems to me that the groups have debated this sufficiently, it has been on the table for too long now and I believe that there is no reason why it cannot be voted on during this part-session and in the presence, as we had asked so many times, of Commissioner Patten, whom I would like to thank for being here."
"Mrs Terrón, there is clearly a technical problem here."
"I have received confirmation that the amendments are not ready today because some of them still have to be clarified."
"All the language versions will be available tomorrow morning."
"It will not therefore be possible to vote tomorrow at noon because not all Members will have had time to see the amendments."
"I think it would be reasonable if the House were prepared to postpone the vote until Wednesday. This would be in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, which stipulate that Members must have received the texts in their own languages."
"I see that Mr Poettering agrees with this."
"So, if the texts are indeed available tomorrow morning, we shall vote on Wednesday."
"Relating to Tuesday:"
"Madam President, it is with regret that I must rise this time to address the following point: we have been astounded by the content of a statement made by a Member of the Commission - Commissioner Verheugen - on the issue of the enlargement of the European Union."
"Commissioner Verheugen has made the enlargement of the European Union to incorporate the countries of central Europe conditional - this is the impression which he gave - upon a referendum, or at least he is recommending making it the subject of a referendum in one Member State of the European Union, the Federal Republic of Germany."
"Now, although I am German, it is certainly not my concern - I am speaking here not as a German but as the chairman of my group - to debate the constitutional situation in Germany, but in the countries of central Europe, the unfortunate impression has been given that new conditions have been attached to the enlargement of the European Union."
"We need to refute an impression of this kind in the strongest possible terms!"
"That is why this statement from Commissioner Verheugen - and I do not know whether it was made deliberately as part of a predetermined strategy or whether it was simply a rash comment - is not only incomprehensible but also damaging."
"My group is asking - and I have heard similar noises from other groups - for the Commission to make a statement on this."
"A suitable time for it to speak on this matter would be tomorrow morning when the Council and the Commission make their statements on the Union's external action priorities."
"Should the Commission feel that tomorrow morning is too soon, because it usually meets here on Wednesday mornings, and would prefer to make a statement at a later stage, then the appropriate time would be on Wednesday afternoon at 5 p.m. when other Commission statements will be made."
"But I would ask the Commission to ensure that our position on the enlargement of the European Union is the one which we have always held, namely that by the year 2003 we in the European Union wish to be capable of enlargement, and to ensure that these principles are upheld here!"
"If the Commissioner gives the impression that this is no longer the case, then I believe that this is irresponsible, and the Commission as a college must set the record straight!"
"I have received several requests to speak on this subject, which is perfectly understandable, but I can see that Commissioner Patten is asking to be given the floor and, if you permit, I shall give him the floor immediately before allowing other Members to speak because he may well have some explanations to give us."
"I will tell my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, of the views that have just been expressed, which I know are held by other Members of Parliament."
"I am sure that he will want to respond fully and rapidly to the concerns which have just been raised."
"I want to make two points absolutely clear."
"These are the strong views of the Commission, including my colleague Mr Verheugen."
"First of all, in our view, the enlargement of the Union, the incorporation of other European countries in the liberal order of Europe, is the number one priority that we face in the next few years."
"In my view and the view of other members of the Commission, there is not only a strategic and economic argument but also a moral argument for enlargement."
"We want that message to go out loud and clear to all the enlargement candidates."
"Secondly, all of us have the task in the next few years of convincing public opinion of what I have just said."
"Mr Verheugen was trying to make that point very strongly."
"We have to go out and sell the case for enlargement to public opinion in all the Member States of the European Union."
"It would be wrong if it seemed to some of our voters in the fifteen Member States that enlargement was an issue for the political elites of Europe."
"We have to convince them that it is in their interests that we enlarge and that there is an obligation on us to press the case for enlargement."
"That is certainly a cause about which I feel very strongly and which I know President Prodi and the rest of the Commission will be arguing with vigour and passion over the next few years."
"The point that the honourable Member raised expresses a legitimate and understandable concern."
"I will relay it to Commissioner Verheugen."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his statement."
"To some extent it addresses the matter and to some extent it fails to do so."
"I think it is very important as a matter of public record that we should have a declaration in the clearest terms from the Commission in a body, that it is continuing to act as the essential European prime mover of enlargement."
"I applaud the view expressed by the Commissioner that we all share the task of selling this historic challenge but I deplore the fact that someone as pre-eminent as Commissioner Verheugen, at least according to a number of newspapers today, should say the Member States should not leave the Commission to do the dirty job alone."
"This language is not appropriate to the sensitivities and subtleties required in this historic debate and it constitutes loose talk which opens up an appalling prospect, not least in the hearts and minds of those who support enlargement, and especially in candidate States and in their capital cities."
"That is why this matter is of exceptional political importance this week."
"It is important to understand that a Commissioner, Commissioner Verheugen in this case, has a role to speak for Europe."
"Of course he is a German politician, but the German Government is empowered and in a position to speak for Germany."
"I believe it is entirely proper that Mr Poettering should demand that this issue be dealt with here this week and I would urge the Commission to give the necessary assurance, not only because I agree with the sentiments of Commissioner Patten, but because the world at large wishes to be reassured that there is no dysfunction at the heart of Europe on the question of enlargement."
"Madam President, there was a lot of animated discussion in our group about the position Commissioner Verheugen has adopted, and our main conclusion was that transparency, more than anything, is now required in the negotiations on enlargement."
"Our citizens need it and so does Parliament."
"It seems to me that Mr Poettering' s proposal would serve the purpose well if we were now to create a little transparency, for it is just as Commissioner Patten says: enlargement must not be allowed to be merely an issue for the elite."
"I can well understand why Commissioner Verheugen is somewhat vexed by the fact that candidate countries are being toured in the name of the Council and the various Member States and being promised that they can definitely join our club one year or the other."
"Perhaps we can also talk a little about what part the Commission, the Council and Parliament should have in the talks that are now going on."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Poettering spoke here as a group chairman and not as a German."
"I am speaking here as a German and as the acting chairman of my group."
"Commissioner Patten has already outlined the Commission's views on Mr Verheugen's comments."
"For me, that would actually suffice as a Commission position."
"My group has always believed that not only the Commission as a whole but also all of the individual Commissioners must justify themselves before this Parliament, and this regardless of their nationality and regardless of any affiliation to a political party."
"That is why we would welcome Mr Verheugen's being given the opportunity this week to clarify his remarks here before the European Parliament and, if necessary, also to amend them."
"Madam President, I should like to declare myself in favour of Mr Poettering' s proposal."
"I should like to say that my own group is in favour not only of ""selling"" enlargement or other major projects to public opinion but also of getting our fellow citizens closely involved in all the major phases of European construction, including by means of referenda."
"We are, however, totally opposed to the idea of using the referendum as a sort of threat which could be abused by some ""stirrers"" , exploiting fears and, in particular, unwillingness to open up to others."
"Consequently, in order to ensure that enlargement is a success in the eyes of public opinion in our respective countries and in the eyes of the citizens of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, I am in favour of dispelling any misunderstanding, and thus of giving Commissioner Verheugen the opportunity to offer Parliament a clear explanation."
"Commissioner Verheugen should indeed come and address the House to offer some explanation."
"We are not about to start a debate on this matter. I shall put this proposal to him."
"I think the most suitable time would be on Tuesday, when the Council and Commission will be making their statement on the European Union' s priorities for external action."
"Commissioner Verheugen was not scheduled to attend at that time, he was not expected, but Commissioner Patten and I shall insist that he makes himself available and comes before the House to offer some explanations."
"Madam President, we would of course welcome a statement from Mr Verheugen."
"Since this is a very important issue, a statement from the Commission President would obviously be even better."
"But we do not insist on this."
"What we do insist on, however, is that the statement which Mr Verheugen eventually makes is unequivocally a declaration by the Commission as a whole, and that any misunderstandings are then cleared up."
"This is not then a private, personal statement by Mr Verheugen, but a clarification by the whole Commission acting as a college."
"Let me remind you, as if I needed to, of the formal sitting at 11.30 tomorrow morning on the occasion of the joint visit by Mr Avraham Burg, the President of the Knesset, and Mr Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"There is no need for me to stress the importance of this joint visit. The fact that I am stressing it should show you, as you might imagine, that I should like to see the Chamber as well attended as possible."
"Let it be understood I am counting on all Members of this House, men and women, to attend."
"Relating to Wednesday:"
"President."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has requested that the statement on human cloning should not conclude with a motion for a resolution being tabled."
"Who wishes to speak in support of this request?"
"Madam President, my group believes that the issue of biotechnology - because we are not only talking about cloning - is an issue which not only concerns various Member State governments, but is one which is also of considerable concern to public opinion."
"This is the case not only because of the advances being made in this area, but also because of the scientific, industrial, ethical and religious consequences of this matter."
"We pointed out at the time in the Conference of Presidents, and we have said so publicly, that we believe that this is a debate which cannot be resolved through an urgent resolution."
"We believe that it requires well-considered and serious work, and proof of this can be seen in the drawing up of the directive on biotechnology which has been going on for a long time. An attempt was made to finish it, for the second time, during the previous parliamentary term, and it is yet to be finished because it is still facing certain problems."
"We believe that we must ensure that the work requested by Parliament of the Ethics Committee - which advises the Commission and Parliament - is speeded up and we believe, furthermore, that an issue as important as this, which involves various committees of this Parliament and which is generating enormous concern in many areas - frozen embryos, the patentability of cells which may be multiplied for the purposes of transplants etc. requires a temporary committee."
"We have therefore accepted that this declaration should be made."
"However, we do not believe that it is appropriate at the moment to vote on a resolution, drawn up as we go along, which may create problems and be divisive."
"Madam President, I would like to speak in favour of Enrique Barón Crespo's proposal for the reasons he has outlined so eloquently."
"Madam President, my group takes the opposite view, to the effect that it is important to vote upon a resolution."
"In the first place, it is not the first time that Parliament has given an opinion on the subject of human cloning."
"On several occasions since the advent of Dolly we have voted on a number of resolutions."
"If anyone adopted a unilateral stance on these occasions, it was the British Government which, without any prior consultation whatsoever, adopted a position in favour of therapeutic cloning."
"We therefore consider that a reaction from the European Parliament which does not close the door on the debate is a useful move."
"When I say we must not close the door, clearly the suggestion of a temporary committee must not be rejected out of hand."
"I am not saying that I am for or against that, but I do think that it would be a good idea for Parliament to deliver its opinion by some means other than an inconclusive debate."
"Mr Lannoye, I can confirm that the Conference of Presidents did decide to set up a special committee to deal with all these matters."
"Madam President, before the vote I should like to make a point of order."
"I refer to Rule 118 of the Rules of Procedure."
"This is about all Members of the House having access to all the necessary documents."
"With a view to the vote, which will probably take place on Thursday, I should like to confirm the substance of what Mr Lannoye said on this issue."
"There are Parliament resolutions in which we have made our views on cloning very clear."
"That was also true of therapeutic cloning!"
"People are acting now as though the proposals put forward by the British Government were something entirely new."
"In actual fact we have already discussed this and Parliament has always been opposed to it."
"The votes were always controversial."
"Those who now want to prevent the debate and a resolution have always represented a liberal standpoint."
"But a majority of Parliament has always adopted an uncompromising position."
"It would not be very consistent if now - since the issue is topical - we were not to stand by our earlier statements."
"Mr Liese, you very cleverly associated your speech to one of the Rules of Procedure to make it look like a procedural motion, but I have to say the connection was tenuous."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"Relating to Thursday: President."
"I have received several requests for amendments to the agenda relating to topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"On the subject of Item 3, 'Human rights' , and Item 4, 'Burma' , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the current Item 4 'Burma' be replaced by a new item entitled 'Temelin' and that the item on 'Burma' be brought forward into item 3 'Human rights' to replace the sub-item 'Fundamental freedoms in Iran' ."
"Madam President, I support this proposal and justify it on the basis of the fact that quite a lot has been said about Iran recently."
"The situation is very delicate and a lot is happening there, but there has been discussion about it."
"We would very much like to see a place on the agenda to discuss the nuclear power plant at Temelin, as in many Member States, especially in Austria, obviously, as it is next door to it, the situation is very tense."
"I would like this proposal to make it possible to include the Temelin resolution on the agenda."
"I shall therefore put the request from the group of the Greens to the vote."
"We are talking about adding the item on the Temelin nuclear power plant. The item on 'Burma' would, however, be retained as this has been moved forward into item 3, 'Human rights' ."
"Instead, it would be the item on 'Fundamental freedoms in Iran' which would be taken off the agenda."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Still on the subject of item 3, 'Human rights' , I have received two identical requests from the Technical Group of Independent Members and the group of the European People' s Party to replace the sub-item entitled 'Turkish bombing in northern Iraq' with a new sub-item entitled 'Higher education and universities in Macedonia' ."
"Who wishes to speak in support of this request?"
"If you are looking for support, then I would be pleased to support this proposal from the PPE because it concerns an extremely positive development in Macedonia, which could in fact be further consolidated by a swift endorsement from Parliament."
"I believe this to be a matter of great importance."
"(Parliament rejected the request) President."
"The order of business is adopted thus amended."
"MEDA"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"Report (A5-0204/2000) by Mr Valdivielso de Cué - MEDA, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1488/96 on financial and technical measures to accompany (MEDA) the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro­Mediterranean partnership [COM(1999)494 - C5-0023/2000-1999/0214(CNS)];"
"Report (A5-0205/2000) by Mr Piétrasanta - MEDA (annual report 1998) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission report: Implementation of the MEDA programme - 1998 annual report [COM(1999)291 - C5-0117/1999 - 1999/2120(COS)]"
"Mr President, certain circumstances could have justified postponing this report to a time when everything was available, including the amendments."
"However, in any event, I believe that we, as MEPs, must take the work forward so that the MEDA report is not delayed at any time, with the resulting harm that that could mean for the countries concerned."
"Having expressed these reservations, I shall summarise the MEDA programme."
"I shall then give my opinion of the proposed regulation, as well as the report as a whole."
"As is well known, the MEDA programme comes within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which was created after the Barcelona declaration of November 1995."
"The Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union participated in that meeting."
"This is an initiative which encompasses 27 countries from both sides of the Mediterranean."
"On the one side, there are the 15 states of the Union and, on the other, Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian territories."
"As for Libya, for obvious reasons, it only has observer status."
"Our main objective, through this cooperation, is to forge links, especially in the numerous areas of common interest which we share with our Mediterranean neighbours."
"To this end, around EUR 3 500 million have been invested over the last five years, shared between two broad cooperation formulae: bilateral and regional."
"Specifically, this economic and financial aid must facilitate the completion of a free trade area by 2010, to which end aid programmes have been implemented, both for macroeconomic reforms and for sectoral reforms and structural adjustments."
"We must remember that the ratio between the per capita income of the European Union and the MEDA countries is 1 to 10, that is to say a very considerable gap."
"Therefore, in my judgement, it is logical that the sustainable economic development of the area should be our main goal."
"In this regard, I must add that the commercial balance between these two blocks favours the European Union to the tune of EUR 21 billion."
"Meanwhile, measures are also being considered to facilitate private investment in these 12 countries, which in 1994 amounted to EUR 3 500 million, particularly by means of updating legislation and administration, as well as by means of meetings between companies belonging to the MEDA countries and the European Union."
"We should also remember that we are discussing an area of the world which is particularly affected by military conflict."
"There is no point in listing the different wars being waged by many of the countries which are members of this partnership."
"The MEDA programme seeks to clear the way towards a definitive and lasting peace in that part of the world by means, amongst other things, of economic stability."
"We are talking about a population of around 230 million people which, given the current rate of growth, will reach 300 million in 10 or 12 years time."
"There is a significant diversity of religions and traditions in all of those countries and this is one of the pillars on which the European Union' s work is based."
"As you know, MEDA also includes a short- and medium-term action programme for the environment, which aims to reverse the current environmental deterioration in the area."
"Turning now to an analysis of the Commission' s proposal, I think the proposal as a whole is insufficient, partly because of the criticisms made about the implementation of this programme."
"The Commission principally defines three initiatives for achieving greater efficiency: on the one hand, making the decision-making process more dynamic, focussing the activity of the ""MED Committee"" on strategic planning and programming."
"The national and regional funding plans will be adopted annually on the basis of indicative programmes."
"It also proposes an increase in programming and implementation abilities, for which greater human resources must be provided."
"Lastly, the Commission intends to scale down procedures in order to achieve more effective implementation and increase the percentage of programmes that are implemented."
"Specifically, the intention is to develop common harmonised procedures for all aid programmes."
"Finally, I wish to say that I believe this report is important because anything that helps the countries to the south of us, in turn, helps us."
"Mr President, MEDA represents the practical implementation, the instrument of our Euro-Mediterranean policy, as defined following the Barcelona Convention in November 1995, followed by a number of forums, particularly those in Malta, Naples and Stuttgart."
"We are now presenting the first progress report, or annual report for 1998, but which, in fact, summarises the initial implementation period, 1996-1999, and prepares the way for the implementation of the actions for the second period, 2000-2006, in the form of the regulation proposed by our fellow Member, Mr Valdivielso de Cué."
"Given that this report is subject to the Hughes Procedure, we have included all the proposals adopted unanimously not only by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which was chiefly responsible, but also those of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"The context is this: approximately EUR 4 billion over the last four years, plus the considerable appropriations contributed by the EIB, have been allocated."
"The Barcelona Agreement signed by 27 countries, those of the European Union plus the 12 countries of the southern Mediterranean: Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey."
"The three main objectives involve the political and security dimension, the economic and financial dimension and the social, cultural and human dimension."
"The following observations have been made: this is a programme still in its infancy which has experienced implementation problems and has suffered from various administrative problems, as highlighted by the European Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"There has been particular criticism of sub-contracting associations such as RTM."
"In the final analysis, implementation has been virtually paralysed and, despite the almost 100% commitment of appropriations, only 26 % have been paid to date, and that only with difficulty, with payment taking, on average, four years."
"We presented the ins and outs of the matter in sufficient detail in our report, so I am now able simply to summarise our conclusions, which are as follows: firstly, there is a need to simplify the regulation in order to enable the process to be speeded up, while ensuring greater transparency by providing the resources necessary for the Commission to plan the programme and for the Council to monitor it."
"Above all, the European Parliament must take part in the process and must be kept informed more regularly, particularly through the Euro-Mediterranean forum."
"It would be appropriate to speed up the signing of the association agreements, which to date have been signed only with 7 countries."
"This particularly concerns Lebanon, Algeria, Syria, etc."
"Secondly, project selection must be more democratic and must, to a greater extent, involve greater participation by civil society and NGOs, who continually expressed this desire, especially at the European Parliament round table held in Brussels on 29 June this year, entitled 'Towards a sustainable MEDA' ."
"Thirdly, respect for human rights must be monitored more carefully, for cooperation is not only targeted at economic progress, but is fundamentally related to democracy, freedom, peace, the eradication of inequality, and sustainable development."
"We would therefore ask that a report on the human rights record of each of the signatory or candidate countries be presented to Parliament annually to be taken into consideration in the selection of projects."
"Fourthly, we consider that the 10% of appropriations allotted to regional cooperation are inadequate as compared with the 90% allocated to bilateral cooperation."
"We must therefore comment on the volume of appropriations dedicated to regional schemes which, we acknowledge, are harder to negotiate and implement but which correspond to the objective of efficiency, particularly in improving South-South relations and, above all, in safeguarding more extensive action for decentralised cooperation, which we all consider to be an important goal."
"Fifthly, on the subject of the six priority areas of partnership, the environment, water policy, industry, energy, transport and the information society, we think it essential to reactivate programmes disregarded until now, the SMAP adopted in Helsinki in 1997 on the environment."
"At least EUR 10 million must be allocated annually for water."
"Action must be undertaken to promote renewable energies and to provide support for SMEs and for transport."
"We should support each country' s sustainable development plans."
"We therefore consider it absolutely essential to implement the proposals for regulations suggested by Mr Valdivielso de Cué, particularly those on simplifying procedures in order to increase the transparency, efficiency and speed of payments and on deploying more Commission staff in order to ensure better administration of the programme, which must cease to be a poor relation in comparison with the cooperation programmes for Asian or ACP countries."
"At this point I should like to thank not only the many participants, particularly the countries concerned and the NGOs that helped me to finalise this report, but also our European Commissioner, Mr Patten, who has a clear overview of the situation and whose external relations departments should contribute towards improving Mediterranean projects from now on."
"Thanks, too, to Mr Patten' s colleagues, especially Mr Patrick Laurent."
"I should also like to stress the interest which Commissioner Busquin has taken in our work, reactivating Mediterranean cooperation in the field of research, particularly at the forthcoming informal summit on Capri, on 29 September."
"Thanks are also due to all our fellow Members of Parliament, particularly Mrs Terrón, Mrs McNally and Mr Sami Naïr who are working on this issue."
"Above all, the appropriations for 2000-2006 should not be penalised because of the programme' s earlier problems. Instead the programme must be the spearhead of our policy, which we shall be discussing again at the Marseilles Conference in November."
"We wish the French Presidency every success. I know that they are extremely concerned to resolve all difficulties and determined to achieve their objectives."
". (FR) Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Valdivielso de Cué and congratulate him on his excellent work."
"Broadly speaking, his report makes all the points which I, personally, consider important and also those which the Socialists consider important."
"I should also like to thank Mr Piétrasanta, who has just given us a highly clear and pertinent outline of both the content of this report and the points which we were hoping that he would stress and mention."
"The points which were missing from the Commission proposal and which were added by Mr Valdivielso de Cué are important ones."
"Firstly, Mr Valdivielso de Cué added, and I congratulate him on this, a fundamental idea, namely the need to make a real commitment to the Mediterranean by granting this region aid comparable with that granted to the countries of Eastern Europe."
"The countries of the South, rightly or wrongly, have the impression that they have been rather overlooked, even though everyone knows that the Mediterranean is one of the most sizeable divided regions existing in the world today."
"The second idea which was restored was the harnessing of financial resources that were adequate to the challenges."
"Reference was also made to the overall approach defined in Barcelona (and not just, as the Commission thinks, the structural adjustment dimension), the intensification of regional cooperation, particularly South-South relations, the importance of decentralised cooperation (contrary to the wishes of the Commission which would apparently like to do away with it), the maintenance of support for micro-projects, i.e. for NGOs and civil associations and the need to finance initiatives for industrial cooperation, particular for SMEs."
"Mr Valdivielso de Cué has done excellent work on all these points."
"I do, however, feel that one fundamental matter, immigration, has not been sufficiently taken into account by this proposal for a regulation."
"The Commission' s proposal looks at the question of migration from a strictly negative point of view."
"They make a very serious connection, and I say this weighing my words carefully, drawing a parallel in the very same indent between, on the one hand, the campaign (which I consider to be legitimate and necessary) against illegal immigration and in favour of repatriation and, on the other hand, the fight against drug-trafficking and international crime."
"This intolerable attitude is an insult to the millions of immigrant workers who contribute to the wealth of Europe."
"A distinction has been made, as I requested, but it is still insufficient."
"I believe the time has come to consider a genuine policy of movement between the two sides of the Mediterranean, north and south."
"Europe must, I feel, today establish a genuine co-development policy related to migratory flows, which should, Mr President, centre on a few simple proposals, such as the framing of aid policies for projects by migrants, devising instruments for channelling the savings of immigrants, the placement of students in training and the placement of young trainees."
"Voting in favour of the amendment I have tabled would therefore, I feel, be a contribution towards giving immigrants legally resident in Europe the opportunity to be acknowledged as vectors of co-development for their country of origin."
"Let me, in conclusion, quote Mr Prodi who said that immigration must become a factor in development."
"Mr Valdivielso' s work has gone some way to achieving this, and I would like to see us go further still."
"Mr President, we very much welcome these two positive reports and congratulate the rapporteurs and fully support the vital importance of the MEDA programme."
"In this respect it is critically important that the funding should be properly applied."
"I would urge the House to support the two amendments tabled to the Piétrasanta report in the name of this group."
"As a member of Parliament's delegation to the Mashreq countries and Gulf States, I am concerned that the association agreements with these countries should be ratified as expeditiously as possible; the Jordanian agreement in particular is only slowly proceeding through the ratification process."
"Our amendment urges the Member State parliaments which have not yet ratified the agreement to hasten this process."
"Our other amendment refers to a degree of hypocrisy in our approach to developing a fully free-trade zone in the Mediterranean area."
"As Mr Valdivielso pointed out in his speech, the EU has a large trade surplus with this area."
"Yes, we call for a free-trade zone but when it comes to those products which these countries could most readily export into Europe - i.e. agricultural and food products - we maintain trade restrictions."
"Our friends in these countries understandably question our sincerity."
"I accept that free access to Europe for Mediterranean products poses problems for producers in our southern Member States, but surely this problem could be compensated at least to some extent in the CAP."
"So our second amendment calls for the acceleration of progress to free trade for all products including food and agriculture."
"I would appreciate the Commission's estimate as to the likely timing for achieving a full free-trade zone in the Mediterranean and how it intends to implement this."
"I would urge my colleagues to support these amendments along with the two excellent reports under consideration."
"Mr President, firstly, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Valdivielso and Mr Piétrasanta, and say that I share the views of Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Naïr."
"The deep schism that divides the Mediterranean world is obvious."
"The Conference of Barcelona was the European Union' s reaction to it."
"We should now be working at a steady speed to achieve the aims established there, but that is not the case."
"Many reasons have been given for this."
"The MEDA programmes have always been surrounded by too much fuss, and they still are."
"It is totally pointless to return dwell on this fuss."
"I prefer to look forward."
"The Commission has proposed a new MEDA regulation and in it asks us for speedier decision-making procedures."
"We agree absolutely with this."
"My group and Parliament - if we reflect the vote of the relevant committee - proposes to place more trust in the Commission so that it may decide on projects of less than EUR 5 million and we also ask that the Commission be accompanied by a Council advisory committee."
"Of course, the Council and Parliament cannot expect the Commission to do things which they do not give it the power to do."
"In this regard you have our support, Commissioner."
"You also have our support - and this is expressed in the amendments we are tabling - in order to solve any problems relating to staffing and to management ability that you may have."
"I would like to remind you, Commissioner, that the Barcelona agreements talk about an area of free trade and economic cooperation and of security and they also talk a great deal about the cultural and human dimension."
"Commissioner, I believe that in order to develop these three pillars on an equal footing with one another, we must continue to show our confidence in Mediterranean society and, far from ending decentralised cooperation and small projects, we should implement these effectively and by incorporating all the players: entrepreneurs, unions, cities, NGOs, immigrants - as Mr Naïr pointed out - professionals etc."
"I wish to believe that we share the aim of reducing the gulf between the, at least two, Mediterranean worlds."
"To this end, Commissioner, we ask, and my group will act in accordance with this request in the budgetary debate, for the restoration in the regulation of the amounts allocated to MEDA, so that these will remain at least equal in real terms to those allocated during the previous period."
"While the problems in the Mediterranean remain serious, and there has been considerable delay in implementing the Barcelona decisions that were designed to tackle them, we cannot accept a reduction in investment."
"Mr President, I am pleased to announce that the Liberal Group' s vote is favourable to the reports by Mr Valdivielso and Mr Piétrasanta. However, I must admit that there are certain reservations in our group with regard to future budgetary proposals as a result of the difficulties which have arisen up until now in the employment of funds intended for the MEDA programme."
"However, this issue would lead us into a discussion of the budget, which is not the main subject of this debate. The main subject of this debate is political and the issue is the fact the Mediterranean is one of the essential elements in ensuring the peace, stability and progress of the European Union itself."
"Eliminating tension and promoting balanced development in the Mediterranean third countries leads to greater security, prosperity and prospects for the European Union."
"Therefore, Mediterranean policy must be a fundamental pillar of the Union' s external action, which will benefit the European Union itself."
"Furthermore, I believe that we must consider that officially, there are at least three Mediterranean candidate countries, and that, with regard to the conflicts which Mr Valdivielso has mentioned, the European Union has made a very significant contribution in recent years to solving them."
"We are very close to reaching peace agreements to solve them definitively and this obviously requires a significant economic contribution for which MEDA is the main financial instrument."
"The different aspects mentioned in each report must be taken into account because they make a wonderful contribution to achieving this."
"Mr President, the imbalance highlighted in the Piétrasanta report regarding the limited participation of decentralised operators and NGOs shows just how difficult it actually is for civil society to take hold of and take over this development instrument."
"The report also condemns the fundamental political imbalance between structural adjustment measures and free-trade measures and the other dimensions of the partnership (social, cultural and democratic)."
"Such obvious imbalances stack up, distancing us from the objectives of peace, democracy and sustainable development contained in the Barcelona Declaration."
"The case of Tunisia, signatory to the first association agreement and the first recipient of appropriations, is an edifying one."
"In an increasingly overt way, the international partners delight in describing countries involved in harsh repression and widespread corruption, where increasing social instability prevails, as stable and successful."
"We should be wondering whether accelerated economic liberalisation, in the guise of free trade, is not an aggravating factor in this deterioration."
"Democracy and respect for human rights must not continue to be officially declared theoretical principles which are ignored in practice."
"Is respect for these principles compatible with the repatriation of illegal residents even though this represents the very success ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off.)"
"Mr President, the MEDA programme is a crucial instrument for enabling us gradually to establish a genuine area of shared prosperity, as stated in the Barcelona Declaration."
"The difficulties in setting it up, the impatience and even the disappointments it has caused our southern partners should nevertheless encourage us to look more deeply into the state of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a whole."
"The southern Mediterranean countries need European aid, aid that demonstrates solidarity and which contributes to the development of their society. This aid must also reduce the disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, by putting an end to the existing relationship of economic domination, the most obvious and most unfair example of which is perhaps the system maintaining national debt."
"What role does MEDA have to play in this?"
"With more than EUR 3 billion in commitment appropriations for 1995-1999, MEDA I actually committed just over EUR 2 billion in its first four years and actually paid out EUR 553 million, or scarcely a quarter of the credits committed."
"What a discrepancy between the aid promised and the aid actually provided!"
"This discrepancy is largely due to the fact that, as Mr Patten has often told us, the Commission lacks the human resources to deal with all the tasks that are assigned to it."
"I am sure that I will not be the last person to call for further human resources if that will enable the European Union to shoulder its responsibilities."
"The Commission proposals, moreover, are aimed at simplifying and speeding up procedures under the new regulation, even though removing from the outset individual States' ability to supervise projects would not necessarily be the best solution to achieve greater transparency."
"More credit should be provided for smaller-scale projects."
"Too frequently I meet people who have extensive experience of the local association movement, who feel let down by the procedures they have to follow in order to receive subsidies."
"The Euro-Mediterranean partnership can only really be built by and for the general public, who themselves wish to achieve a partnership that is of real benefit to all citizens."
"The MEDA programme also raises fundamental questions about our Euro-Mediterranean policy in general."
"First and foremost, cooperation is concentrated essentially in the economic and financial dimensions and marginalises the social and cultural dimensions."
"It is also time that we took greater account of the growing dissatisfaction with the practices of out-and-out free trade."
"The social consequences we are seeing in the free trade area are cause for deep concerns, which cannot be ignored."
"The social budgets of southern countries risk seeing the budgetary resources raised from customs duties cut to a dangerous level."
"The growth in competition could eat away at the industrial fabric of these countries, which in some cases consists of vulnerable small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Rather than so-called 'accompanying' measures, the economic systems in the South need real technological support."
"The purpose of aid, furthermore, should be not only to convert businesses to comply with the criteria of profitability, but also to respond to the employment needs of the population."
"While private sector development is heavily supported by MEDA, the public sector is largely forgotten, even though it responds to genuine needs."
"To conclude, I should like to concentrate on two aspects of the reports which I support: really encouraging the participation..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, whilst appreciating the mental efforts of the two rapporteurs and the draftsmen of the opinions, I would like to emphasise how important it is for the EU to set political priorities."
"In concrete terms: the laborious and monumental undertaking of EU enlargement simply does not allow for a similar tour de force within the European-Mediterranean partnership."
"That is certainly not to say that there is no room for improvement in the Union' s Mediterranean policy as matters stand."
"An evaluation of MEDA I and the wording of MEDA II clearly demonstrate the need for this."
"In particular, this programme lacks cohesion and has been insufficiently implemented."
"For example, to date, only a quarter of the commitment appropriations has been paid out."
"It is right that a streamlining of the programmes and implementation should be proposed with a view to resolving the aforementioned shortcomings."
"The sluggish pace of implementation is not the fault of the committees, in any case."
"They are responsible for a delay of five months at most."
"No, it is the procedures within the Commission that are largely to blame for the delay."
"Giving the Commission more financial latitude is not, therefore, the most obvious solution worthy of recommendation."
"Transparency and control are important aspects that will enhance the quality of MEDA projects."
"And the standard of quality required varies from project to project to this day."
"It would appear from the conclusions of the European Council of Feira (19 and 20 June 2000) that the EU' s Mediterranean policy is founded on 'the partnership' ."
"I will quote in full from this document: ""this partnership should be actively supported by both sides"" ."
"Cooperation with a view to becoming good neighbours, increasing prosperity and eliminating poverty, and, not least, promoting good government and the constitutional state."
"May these reports and this debate help to realise these lofty ambitions."
"Mr President, I too wish to stress how important relations with the southern countries are for Europe, in particular with those in the Mediterranean Basin."
"I share the view that enlargement of the Union to the East is causing us to underestimate the South and the crucial nature - crucial for our future, that is - of our relations with these countries."
"We have been working in this area for almost ten years and for the last five, the significant MEDA programme has been available to us."
"The way this programme has been implemented is far from ideal - to say the least - and that is why I share and approve of the objectives of the Commission reform."
"That is also why I support the calls made by Mr Valdivielso and Mr Piétrasanta to redress the balance, for regional cooperation, for support for 'micro-projects' and for projects involving civil society."
"It must, however, be clearly stated - and also made clear to the general public - that the financial objectives must match up to our speeches and there should be no question of accepting a reduction in credits relative to the previous period. This holds true whatever arguments and quibbles are put forward."
"Lastly, looking beyond MEDA, we must not lose sight of the urgency of the problem of cancelling the debts of poor countries, the need to speed up the implementation of bilateral agreements and the need to promote new multilateral agreements."
"To conclude, we must therefore improve the systems that are already in place. Above all, however, we must ensure that the proposals that have already been made, the positions that are adopted in our debates and the way we vote tomorrow are not seen and perceived by our Mediterranean partners as just so many negative messages."
"There is a serious risk of this, and, if we wish to maintain a political presence, in the region, in conflict management and risk prevention, we must do more and better in the future than we have done in the recent past."
"Mr President, in the development of relations with the Mediterranean, Europe cannot fail to give due importance to this geographical area of the world."
"The economic boom in Far East Asia has changed all the parameters, and the Mediterranean Sea has become an important element in international trade, assuming major importance."
"Trade and cultural relations have to be given priority for economic reasons; a cooperation process needs to be set in motion, but the development of countries which are developing at a slower rate than Western countries also needs to be promoted."
"There must be political and commercial dialogue and cultural and financial cooperation."
"This is what is important for the development of relations between the European Parliament and the countries of this area of the world."
"The Mediterranean Sea is the testing ground for the European Parliament' s capacities to act outside the borders of the Union."
"It is a well-known fact that the great Europe which is a dream of so many cannot be achieved without the political and economic involvement of this major, fundamental part of the Union."
"Mr President, now that all the honourable members' wishes have been voiced, I feel we must resolve to make urgent changes to the way in which the implementation of the MEDA programmes is organised."
"In particular, not only is there a need for transparency and streamlining, there is also a need for efficiency."
"This requires ongoing dialogue with the regions that are lagging behind."
"These regions must be able to prosper on the basis of their own potential."
"That is why it is so important to have local sub-offices that can pursue this dialogue with universities, NGOs and local authorities."
"That is preferable to having expensive technical assistance offices, and is also preferable to the divide and rule policy of the governments, who often put their own interests first, whereas we regard MEDA as an instrument for peace and democratisation and not just for economic well-being."
"Mr President, while discussing the MEDA programme it might also be important to consider the balance that is supposed to exist throughout the Union."
"It is obvious that the main instrument of the MEDA-Euro Mediterranean programme is a programme of tremendous benefit to the whole of the EU."
"In the same way, we should recognise that cohesion between the Union' s central and northern regions and the neighbouring regions should be strengthened by means of a comprehensive solution similar to the MEDA Programme."
"New initiatives to support cohesion policy, such as the Union' s northern dimension that stepped into the limelight during the Finnish presidential term, must also be seen as important projects for the Union as a whole, especially with regard to the challenges of eastward enlargement."
"It is encouraging to see that, after a long period of twisting and turning, appropriations have been set aside in next year' s budget for the northern dimension."
"It would be good to move on from here."
"We need an enormous amount of additional financing, however, to be able to guarantee, in particular, the future of the small-scale programmes to strengthen cooperation with neighbouring regions."
"The objectives of the MEDA programme were unfortunately not realised in the financial period that has just ended."
"For various reasons, there have been problems with the implementation of appropriations, and the monitoring arrangements to prevent misappropriation have proven inadequate."
"The European Parliament should concentrate on ensuring that the under-use of resources that has gone on for years should come to a stop and the internal monitoring of programmes made more effective."
"This cannot be guaranteed merely by swelling administration."
"Cooperation between the Commission and the agencies that implement programmes in the Member States must also be able to be made more effective through other means, for example, through water-tight cooperation between the European Investment Bank and the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two things to say. The first is that I should like to thank both rapporteurs for their reports, which were well worth reading."
"Secondly, I should like to say directly to the Commission: stick to your guns, stick to your guns with the Council!"
"Because the real problem is that the Council, that the Member States, are forever wanting to have their say on a matter which the Treaty says is your responsibility."
"Just imagine that the Americans had implemented their aid under the Marshall Plan after the war in such a way that for each sub-programme they had asked the Member States of the USA whether they, for example, ought to fund a reforestation project in the south-western part of Bavaria or not!"
"It would probably have taken until the end of the last century to disburse the Marshall Plan aid."
"This is not what I want to happen to you."
"Mr Patten, stick to your guns!"
"Parliament ought to support you on this."
"The Council or the Member States have a right to be consulted, but they do not have a right to co-decision."
"I suspect that this will also be the decisive issue for the Commission when history judges it one day."
"You will be judged on enlargement towards the east, but also on whether you create your own room for manoeuvre in external policy."
"Now we are not demanding a voice for the Commission alongside the United Kingdom or France on nuclear capabilities for example."
"But where the budget is concerned, the European Union's own budget, you are the executive."
"We should secure this position and defend it!"
"In Parliament you should have an ally here!"
"Mr President, as someone who lives in the Mediterranean, under the Mediterranean sun and who enjoys Mediterranean traditions and culture, I would like to speak up for the countries of that area."
"The MEDA programme, which largely failed in the first stage, perhaps did not appreciate that the situation of the Mediterranean countries, given the direction that European politics are taking, is extremely difficult."
"Many Mediterranean countries are less highly developed than other countries, and they face the threat of a single agricultural market, which they will not be able to cope with."
"In this respect, I would like to refer to the wonderful article by Mr Riccardi of two or three months ago, in which he spoke specifically of the fact that, for reasons of scale, the Mediterranean countries do not attract investment."
"It is extremely difficult in those countries to change the agricultural system and, nevertheless, they have to share their products with other countries of North Africa, of the mare nostrum, which belongs to everyone at the same time."
"Meanwhile the greatest migratory impact originates from these countries."
"Therefore, we must have a fair policy, and to this end the MEDA programme may be a start, although I believe that, in many cases, it is based on criteria that are important to the northern countries."
"Firstly, it is not possible to set up a project without highlighting the great weaknesses of those countries such as, for example, water and desertification."
"What European policies do we have to combat desertification?"
"We have no clear policy on this issue."
"Secondly, as far as culture is concerned, more importance is being attached to intermediaries than to the actual beneficiaries and producers of culture."
"The same thing is happening with many other industrial projects."
"Numerous NGOs have been created, forming networks with no obvious beneficiaries, when what southern Europe really has to do is wake up."
"I therefore support a process of industrialisation based on innovation - we must not turn to the old industries but to innovation - and of supporting projects relating to technological innovation and training."
"In this respect, I believe it is a mistake to turn to large projects."
"They would simply make a few people richer. What Mediterranean Europe needs is to wake up, to leave behind its self-absorption and to exploit its own human resources."
"This will only happen if we support multiple initiatives which together create awareness, a critical mass and a basic system so that, on that basis, many other small initiatives and businesses of all types may be created. Some will be successful and some will fall by the wayside, but if we do not create a policy of multiple initiatives of many types, allowing society to express itself and take advantage of its resources, we will not achieve anything."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the two reports in question, particularly Mr Valdivielso' s report, deal with one of Europe' s problems in great detail."
"The Mediterranean' s location as a major geographical point in terms of the stability and security of our continent has already been mentioned."
"This is all very well, but there is another issue underlying many of the points made in Mr Valdivielso' s report: a gap is forming between the absolute priority status of enlargement and the development of relations with the Mediterranean countries, which gives cause for concern."
"The Mediterranean is, in actual fact, an area which is still marked by zones of real poverty, and it is an area where the standard of living and quality of life are such as to require a major European presence."
"Whatever we are able to do to boost development of the private sector, to improve the conditions under which small and medium-sized enterprises operate, to modernise infrastructures and encourage the promotion of investments, industrial cooperation and trade, will be gratefully received, for hitherto there has been no support for the economic and production networks of the partner countries and industrial cooperation has played an extremely minor role due to the lack of direct support programmes and joint initiatives between European companies and partner countries."
"Therefore, we need simpler administration, a more strategic approach and rapid execution of programmes, for this might actually benefit the small and medium-sized enterprises rather than consultancy firms or financial brokers."
"I would like to end with a reference to the agricultural sector."
"The establishment of a free-trade area in the Mediterranean is, of course, a goal to strive towards, but first we must analyse carefully the plight of Mediterranean agriculture and Mediterranean farmers, and, before we do anything else, we must use the common agricultural policy to rectify an extremely dangerous drop in the income levels of our farmers in precisely the poorest area of Europe."
". I am extremely pleased to be able to comment on these two important reports on one of the most significant programmes for which we are responsible."
"It is clearly going to be a considerable political test for the Commission and for our whole partnership to try to ensure that we deliver more successfully on these programmes in the future than we have managed to do so far."
"I thought that Mr Linkohr made some extremely pertinent and challenging points."
"We will be coming back to that, not least when we have the opportunity of discussing the letter which the Commission will be addressing to the budgetary authority as a letter of rectification to the 2001 Budget, which will go right to the heart of the real resource problem we face, which creates so many political difficulties for us."
"Let me comment first on Mr Valdivielso's report before dealing with Mr Piétrasanta's report."
"Naturally, I welcome the fact - though I do not think his speech was quite so enthusiastic - that Mr Valdivielso's report is generally supportive of the Commission's efforts to reform the MEDA Regulation, though there are some criticisms."
"Mr Piétrasanta's report is also favourable towards the 1998 MEDA Programme report."
"I want to stress that the revision of the MEDA Regulation is a key element in the broader efforts we are making to enable us to deliver aid more effectively and to streamline our often excessively onerous procedures."
"The Commission's objective in revising the MEDA Regulation is to streamline the decision-making process so that we can deliver assistance promptly, in line with the political priorities of the European Union in the Mediterranean."
"The Commission proposes to reduce excessive scrutiny arrangements for individual projects in the Management Committee by introducing strategic programmes through the yearly adoption of national financing plans and a regional financing plan and simplifying decision making."
"The simplifications that we have requested would bring MEDA programming procedures in line with those of other financial instruments of EU external relations programmes."
"It makes no sense to treat MEDA differently."
"I must underline that the Commission cannot hope to improve the implementation of the programme if it remains paralysed by cumbersome procedures."
"The approval of the new regulation will allow the Union to lend real support to the Mediterranean countries in their structural reform process."
"The economic growth of these countries is of key importance to their political and social stabilisation."
"I should also note that the firm commitment of the Mediterranean partners themselves to economic reform would greatly facilitate the implementation of the programme and would trigger a significant rise in its disbursement rate."
"We have an absorption problem with some of our partners."
"It is difficult to spend the money as fast and as sensibly as we would like if we have not even agreed the Association Agreements, or to justify a situation in which we successfully negotiate an Association Agreement and then cannot get our partner to initial it."
"We all have to move faster if we are to make a greater success of the programme."
"We agree with the bulk of Parliament's amendments, particularly those which strengthen MEDA's strategic character."
"In that spirit, we can fully endorse Amendments Nos 2, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 30, 33, 37 and 41 and we can partially accept Amendment Nos 4, 5, 6, 10, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 31, 35, 38 and 40 providing some slight verbal modifications."
"That may save me a bit of work if I am doing the votes later in the week."
"However we cannot support Amendment No 25, which proposes an individual examination of financing proposals by the MED Committee."
"We think this is contrary to the spirit of our overall proposal on the revision of the MEDA Regulation, because we want to streamline and simplify procedures."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 13, which would seek to include a financial reference amount for the period 2000 to 2006 in the regulation since this would clearly prejudge the results of the budgetary procedure as has been agreed in the context of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 21 which seeks the removal of direct budgetary support, nor Amendment No 27 on direct industrial cooperation and I should point out that the new enterprise policy of the Commission focuses on the improvement of the business climate rather than on direct tools of cooperation."
"In addition, the Commission at this stage lacks the necessary resources for proper industrial cooperation."
"Nor can we accept Amendment No 35 or part of Amendment No 40 on the expansion of decentralised cooperation so long as we do not have the necessary human resources to do the job in a responsible and effective way, but forms of decentralised cooperation will be pursued where possible within existing regional cooperation programmes."
"Now let me comment briefly on Mr Piétrasanta's report."
"I congratulate him and the other rapporteur, Mr Vandevielso, for the commitment and dedication which they have shown."
"Most of the views expressed in Mr Piétrasanta's report and in the amendments are wholly in line with the Commission's efforts to reform the MEDA programme and our overall objective of streamlining procedures and accelerating delivery of aid."
"We support the plea regarding the simplification of MEDA's management procedures and the strengthening of its strategic and integrated approach."
"The report's appeal for an increase in Commission staff assigned to management of the MEDA programme is one we wholly support."
"Enough staff to do the job is one of the key principles underlying the Commission's efforts to reform its external assistance services."
"The increase will be, of course, pursued within the overall staff priorities of the Commission, and I note as well the report's request for the preparation of an annual report on human rights in the Mediterranean."
"We believe this is something for the Council and the Commission to consider together."
"We support the proposals for reinforced South-South cooperation and for more programmes backing small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We are taking action on water management but we are not, I regret to say, in a position to support the micro-project proposals because again we lack the staff to manage them properly."
"They are extremely resource-intensive in terms of management."
"It will be apparent from what I have said that we are thinking very much along the same lines."
"Our programmes in the Mediterranean are at the core of my agenda, along with the reinvigoration of the Barcelona process."
"Let me make two final points."
"First of all, I hope, the Commission will this week be agreeing a Commission communication on the revitalisation of the Barcelona process, which we will then, of course, wish to discuss with this Parliament."
"Our funding of programmes in the Mediterranean between now and 2006 is probably the largest of all our programmes representing over 20% of our efforts externally."
"My concern is that we should deliver that assistance more effectively and more rapidly."
"I have told Parliament before of my surprise at the discovery that if we were to continue at the present rate of disbursement it would take us almost nine years to get through the backlog of our existing obligations in the Mediterranean."
"That is simply not tolerable."
"You cannot explain that to the people you are trying to help and it is very difficult to justify it to Europe's taxpayers."
"Instead of our programmes enhancing the reputation of the European Union in the Mediterranean countries and around the world, it damages our reputation even though we are using taxpayers' money to do good."
"So, the reform of programmes like MEDA goes right to the heart of what we are trying to do in the Commission."
"The other point I wanted to make is this: at the informal meeting we had in Evian at the weekend we spent over three hours talking about external assistance and how effectively we do things as a Union."
"I pay great tribute to the French Presidency for giving this issue the priority it has."
"The Commission raised the issue in May when I set out our external budget for the General Affairs Council, the first time the General Affairs Council had ever discussed the budget for external relations, and when we put forward our proposals for reforms, so I think the issue now has the political priority it deserves."
"But we will be tested by what we do with MEDA and what we do in the Balkans and by how these programmes actually work on the ground."
"I cannot keep on coming back to this Parliament and saying we have terrible problems."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council have to be able to show that we are making a difference."
"I hope that with the Parliament's understanding we will be able to ensure over the years ahead that our external programmes are as effective and rapid as we all want them to be."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Common Community diplomacy"
"The next item is the report (A5-0210/2000) by Mr Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on common Community diplomacy 2000/2006(INI)."
"Mr President, I believe that we all agree that in 2000, obviously, the Community already enjoys numerous and fundamental competencies in the external field."
"The Maastricht reform reflects the aspiration, so often expressed in this House, that Europe should speak with one voice in the international arena."
"With the CFSP, the Union' s external activity takes on a new dimension, definitively going beyond the economic field in order to participate actively in external policy."
"However, the European Union repeatedly has cause to regret - we have been seeing this recently - that it cannot meet the requirements of external action."
"Having said this, I wish to begin by saying that the objective of this report is not to seek a further increase in the competencies of the Union in the external field."
"Those who wish to do that have other debates, in the field of institutional reform, in which to find expression for their aspirations."
"All that we are proposing is to implement measures which will rationalise and improve the way in which the enormous external action of the Community institutions is carried out."
"We propose basically to make decisive progress in three areas."
"Firstly, by improving the training of Community officials intended to be involved in carrying out external actions."
"The numerous officials in the Commission who deal with external relations, taking on competencies of prime importance, are technical specialists but in general they lack the prior diplomatic training, which is necessary to fulfil their duties."
"We therefore believe we need to create a Community diplomatic college, which will provide Community officials intended for external action with a good diplomatic and international training."
"To the same end, we believe it is necessary to provide an opportunity to link the national diplomatic corps, whose experience and long tradition are of great value, to our external action, and we therefore propose to implement a 'bridging' system between national external services and the Community external service."
"Secondly, we wish to clarify and develop the legal status of the Commission' s current external delegations, their role and their relationship with the various Community institutions."
"The Commission delegations have seen a dramatic quantitative and qualitative expansion over recent years."
"Nevertheless, they do not function in the same way and their relationship with other institutions is unclear, since it is not regulated."
"We therefore propose that the Commission delegations become Community delegations so that their relations with the Council may be closer, through the High Representative of the CFSP, as well as their relations with the European Parliament and its members, thereby guaranteeing greater efficiency and political control of their activities."
"Thirdly and lastly, we intend to improve the coordination between the delegations and the external services of the Member States."
"We need to promote this type of coordination, in order to prevent confusion and inconsistency, not to mention other deficiencies, which were plain to see at the informal General Affairs Council in Evian last weekend."
"To this end we propose various mechanisms and, amongst other things, we envisage the possibility of joining together the missions of those Member States that agree to do so with the current Commission delegations, at the appropriate time."
"Furthermore, this would represent a considerable reduction in costs."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr President, none of the proposals that have been put forward represent institutional reforms, and even less the ceding of Member States' sovereignty."
"We are simply proposing a more effective use of the competencies which have already been granted."
"We are not setting out to propose conflicting models of Europeanism, but simply to be more efficient."
"Therefore, the rapporteur cannot support those amendments which would represent profound structural changes to the institutional architecture of the Union."
"In particular, I would like to express my gratitude for the other contributions which, in committee and with tomorrow' s vote in Parliament, greatly enrich the initial proposal."
"I would ask the various groups to vote in favour of this report and the European Commission to reflect the feelings of this House."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to extend sincere congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Galeote Quecedo, for his very important and also interesting report that has come at a very opportune moment."
"If we look at how the tasks of the European Commission, and, in fact, those of the European Union in general, have developed, then we see that this relates to the new phenomenon of the candidate countries, the old phenomenon of the existence of trading partners and development regions, and the not so new phenomenon of Bosnia and former Yugoslavia."
"These are areas in which the European Union, and the European Commission in particular, have an abundance of tasks before them."
"A great deal of criticism of European effectiveness has to do with the way in which these tasks are organised."
"The committees we have sent out there appear to echo the call for decentralisation that is often heard in other areas of the European Union too."
"Decentralisation is needed to make decision-making more effective and also to ensure that when there is no pressing reason for something to be dealt with in Brussels, it can be decided on locally."
"Naturally this will directly affect the way in which these European missions are assessed."
"For example, the mandate of the European missions must be widened, which therefore means that they will need more personnel."
"There have been some very embarrassing discrepancies between the possibilities open to the European missions, and those of the United States, for example."
"Indeed this found expression in the number of people that could be employed locally through the European Union."
"The European Union' s profile could be raised by putting Mr Galeote Quecedo' s plans into practice."
"We must have real EU embassies that are at least some sort of a match for the United States embassies, especially in areas where it is the European Union that bears most responsibility."
"Therefore we cannot tolerate having ineffective diplomats in situ."
"I believe it behoves the Commissioner to look closely at who is proving effective and who is failing on that score."
"I welcome the fact that there is contact between the European diplomats out there and the European Parliament."
"Naturally this must proceed under the supervision of the Commissioner who has responsibility for these affairs."
"This contact with diplomats appointed as special envoys by the European Parliament is, of course, also something we would heartily recommend."
"We gladly subscribe to those aspects of Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report that could lead to us speaking with one voice."
"Mr President, this report on a European Parliament initiative highlights an extremely important issue that we are facing, not only in the field of common foreign and security policy but in the context of enlargement of the European Union itself."
"In the field of CFSP, notable progress is already being made, particularly in terms of cooperation in the area of defence."
"A common military force is being created."
"It would be strange - not to say dangerous - if the European Union did not at the same time strive to improve its common diplomatic instruments."
"There is no excuse for lagging behind in this area, even if we take the factor of each Member State' s national interest into account as well as the almost purely economic nature of the history of the Community' s institutions between the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Maastricht."
"Diplomacy at the beginning of the twenty-first century has indeed been marked by great events and processes that are giving it much greater scope than it has had in the past."
"Amongst these I would highlight the globalisation of the international economy and the financial markets."
"It is no exaggeration to state with all certainty that diplomatic activity is becoming more and more involved in the economic sphere and to say that, in turn, economic interests cannot be protected without diplomatic activity."
"As is also well known, this situation is being played out against a backdrop in which the positions of the main players on the international political stage are being redefined."
"The aims that provide the market with additional sensitivity or idealism, however, particularly the fight for a project which is able to reconcile the goals of economic development and those of social and political development cannot be reached unless there is a high degree of cooperation between the Member States at all levels, specifically at the diplomatic level."
"What better instrument than diplomacy can there be for promoting objectives of peace and of reconciling national interests?"
"The European Union must provide itself, as this report recommends, with more and better elements of common diplomacy."
"It is quite clear that, amongst other obstacles, organising matters according to pillars and the fact that the European Union has no legal personality both make it more difficult to achieve this aim and forced this report' s proposals to perform some clever balancing tricks."
"Nevertheless, we can, at no great financial or organisational cost, contribute to a better use of the diplomatic resources we already have in the European Union, to everyone' s benefit."
"The wealth and diversity of diplomatic experience in the various countries of Europe is also recognised throughout the world."
"It would be a mistake to think that any of the proposals put forward in this report could harm processes that are under way in the field of CFSP in general, or in the field of diplomacy in particular."
"The underlying aim of this report, as we understand it, following on from several discussions held over a period of months, is to bring together all relevant current experiences and processes and to direct them towards a common goal, which is, by and large, to create a genuine common European diplomatic service."
"Lastly, I should like to say that although one might criticise certain aspects of the report, I have no hesitation in recommending that you adopt it, and I hope that the proposals it contains are given the reception that they deserve."
"Mr President, we in the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party set great store by the fact that this is not an attempt to set up a single diplomatic corps to replace the Member States' external services."
"Rather, it is a question of improving the quality of the external service the Community already has and of improving cooperation between that service and the Member States' external services."
"There is no doubt that there is a need for improved training of this kind in the majority of Member States, and especially in the applicant countries which will, of course, soon need a sizeable staff of well-trained people."
"We in the Liberal Group attach importance to the fact that what is at issue here is in-service training and not basic training."
"By that, I mean providing training to people who are already in service or on the way to joining the service. And we attach great importance to the fact that the training should be open to participants from the national external services so that there is interaction between EU and national diplomats."
"We have therefore tabled a number of amendments which we hope Parliament can accept."
"It is debatable whether there is a need for a new institution with its own building and board of management, as well as a heated dispute about where the institution is to be located."
"We would certainly prefer to support actual activities than just bricks and mortar, but we are able wholeheartedly to support the intention behind the proposal, and we hope that Mr Galeote Quecedo' s reflections will be given careful consideration in the Member States, the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, the majority of my group considers that, unfortunately, the unambitious and technical nature of Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report means that it fails to live up to its fine title of a common Community diplomacy."
"In particular, I feel that it is a mistake to deny, as Mr Galeote Quecedo has done, that the political aim of his report is the gradual creation of a common diplomacy as the expression of a common policy."
"This is to ignore the reality that what we have at the moment is a discordant, incoherent chorus of European countries and their 14 thousand or so diplomats, compared to the 3 500 diplomats of the United States."
"We should simply supplement the 15 diplomatic corps with another, more or less competent corps, made up of European Union officials or, as is the case today precisely in Commissioner Patten' s entourage, national diplomats, possibly including more representatives from some countries than others."
"I also feel that the debate on Commissioner Verheugen' s statements indicated extremely clearly that it is not possible for the Union to carry out its external activities in the context of such a lack of cohesion and such frustration caused by the confusion of powers and responsibilities."
"Commissioner Patten, you have already spoken on this subject, Commissioner Verheugen will also do so, and then each of the Member States will give their opinion."
"This means that the message we send to the European citizens can only be contradictory."
"The group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support Amendments Nos 5 and 6 tabled by Mr Dupuis, which introduce the political agenda of a common diplomacy and the proposal to start establishing European Union embassies in those countries where not all the countries of the Union are represented."
"I hope that others will also support these amendments."
"Mr President, our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, broadly supports Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report, although it is also the case that certain sections of the group disagree with important aspects of it, as we will see later."
"We feel that Mr Galeote Quecedo has carried out a profound, serious and ambitious piece of work, although it is also prudent with regard to current prospects."
"The joint effort in committee by the various political groups demonstrates that common diplomacy is a concern felt by all of us."
"In fact, our experience, acquired through visits to different parts of the world, highlights four worrying issues:"
"First: the scant and insufficient coordination of the Member States with regard to issues that must be addressed jointly whenever the interests of the European Union are at stake, and the minimal cooperation between the delegations of the European Union."
"Also, we sometimes fail to exploit the rich diplomatic experience we possess in Europe and often there are worrying confrontations between these various diplomatic services."
"Second: the accidental occurrence of contradictions in interventions by different countries on issues affecting the interests of the European Union."
"Third: the insufficient coordination in the defence of points of view, interests and responsibilities of the European Union in international bodies of a political, economic, cultural nature etc., such as the UN, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation, the WHO etc."
"Fourth: we have also noted that the presence of the European Union is weak in relation to its economic importance and also in relation to the significant presence of the United States."
"We therefore believe it is important to proceed with the proposal presented in the report and, furthermore, to take more cohesive action, make a greater impact and make greater progress in that direction."
"Hence the usefulness of the proposal to create a Community diplomatic college and also the importance, which appears in Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report, of the European Parliament playing an important role as trustee of the sovereignty and will of the European citizens in order to give content to this Community diplomacy and also give content to this prospect of constructing a European Union which creates peace, respect for international law and solidarity in the world."
"Therefore, as I said at the beginning, our group will broadly support Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Galeote Quecedo report is interesting for two reasons: the first is that Parliament unashamedly reveals its true intentions in it, and the second is that nobody is paying it the slightest attention."
"What is the real issue here?"
"The real issue is nothing less than providing the European Union, which, by the way, is now simply the Commission, with those final attributes of a sovereign State that was lacking, i.e. a diplomatic service and the prerequisite for establishing it, which is legal personality."
"Let us be logical about this."
"The only reason for this college' s existence is to create a common diplomatic service and to do so in a completely transparent way, as outlined in the Galeote Quecedo report."
"If those who back this report achieve their aims, the 'carving up' of our nations will thus have reached its logical conclusion, by once again adopting the old Monnet, Schuman and Delors method, which consists of creating a body in the hope that it will get around to creating its own role and content. The truth is, however, that so many preconditions have been left out that people may have the impression that we do not care what anyone thinks."
"We are creating a diplomatic instrument without even thinking about the essential prerequisite of a common diplomatic policy."
"This itself presupposes another prerequisite, which is that the common interests of the Member States must be defined. This prerequisite in turn presupposes another, consisting of defining a common link between Europe and the rest of the world."
"If we are only talking about the three main powers, Germany, Great Britain and France, it is impossible to see what points would form the basis of our common interests and diplomatic policy, either on Western Europe' s relationship with the United States or on the role of NATO, subjects on which we are definitely not in agreement nor likely to be, or on the East - and here we have the thorny question of Russia and our relations with the Central European countries in general - or on the South, perhaps significantly less where the South is concerned, particularly in the context of the Mediterranean policy."
"This is therefore a fraud, and the worst of all kinds of fraud at that, which is intellectual fraud, unless, that is, we accept that the diplomacy of the main power - the central power - can effectively be foisted on everyone else, which would actually amount to solving the problem."
"Quite recently, at the UN 'Women 2000' conference, our Polish friends were able to see just how flexible common diplomacy really is when they were ordered to fall into line with the position laid down by the Union, or face delays in their country' s application for Membership."
"We feel sure that the experience of our friends in Central Europe in the field of resistance to totalitarianism could prove useful to us some day, and furthermore, an illustration of this form of totalitarianism has been provided recently by the unacceptable quarrel that some people are picking with one of our fellow Members, Daniel Hannan."
"Let there be no mistake, the idea of common representation at the United Nations is being used to attack the permanent seats held by certain Member States as well as the idea that there could be dissident voices in this world, such as the voice France tries very often to make heard with regard to the United States."
"Ultimately, Europe can speak with one voice only if it has nothing to say."
"This has been proved once again and it has also been proved that this Europe is not simply negating nations as individual nations - it is rejecting and annihilating Europe itself."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am sure that it will come as no surprise to our friend and fellow Member, Mr Galeote Quecedo, when I say that I am sorely disappointed by this report."
"I feel that this is an over-cautious report, and yet it is already raising some people' s hackles."
"It would have been better to address the crux of the matter and I am sorry that the report has not done this."
"The issue of diplomacy is not merely a question of training diplomats and the status of delegations. The issue is of fundamental importance and there is a powerful taboo in this Parliament which we are never prepared to confront: that we have fifteen national diplomatic services, which have been strengthened over years of integration by gradually taking over the competencies of all the national ministries and which have become the real powers, the main power blocking any possible reform of foreign affairs and diplomacy, because it is their power that would ultimately be under threat."
"They had no trouble delegating and taking the powers of the other ministries to the European level, but when it comes to their own power, it is a different question altogether."
"Mrs Frassoni pointed out how ridiculous it is to have a situation in which we have 14 000 diplomats, whilst the United States has 3 000, with the cost/quality ratio of which we are fully aware."
"We must address the issue of the diplomatic services and the issue of external affairs policy with the same approach that we used to achieve economic and monetary union, by establishing a gradual process of communitising external policy and the diplomatic services."
"Unfortunately, the report does not address these issues."
"Unfortunately, we are only proposing slight changes, which will just add a new level to the structures that already exist and we are in danger of ending up with bodies that are even more incapable of making the right decisions quickly."
"In my opinion, the questions we must answer are these: do we or do we not want to communitise external affairs policy?"
"Do we want to make the same huge mistake that we made by creating the figure of Mr CFSP and by restoring exclusive Community competence for external policy to the Commission or to a Vice-President of the Commission?"
"These are the real questions."
"I am rather disappointed that the report does not discuss these issues and somewhat surprised that the EPP has adopted this position given that, tomorrow, in another report on the Union' s political priorities, it will probably adopt a more forthright position on the communitisation of external policy."
"I therefore urge our rapporteur and friend, Mr Galeote Quecedo, to perhaps incorporate some of the amendments that have been tabled and to ensure that a process is initiated, that an appeal is made to the Council and that, for once, our Parliament does not fall short of the position of the Council and the Commission, as unfortunately has been the case for the last ten years."
"Mr President, wishful thinking sets the tone of this report in my view."
"Only occasionally does the rapporteur display any sense of reality."
"This is very clearly the case in Recital O, in which he states that ""the objective is certainly not to create a single diplomatic service to replace the foreign services of the Member States"" ."
"Yet at the same time, the entire document is suffused with the notion of - it would be safe to say, the passionate desire for - a Community diplomatic service for the Union."
"The rapporteur rationalises his intention at the very beginning of his report."
"In his words: ""since the 1950s the Community' s external activity has expanded continuously"" ."
"Given that the Union' s vacillating behaviour in the Balkans during the recently elapsed decade of the previous century is still fresh in the memory, this robust declaration sounds extremely implausible to my mind."
"Another important point raised by Mr Galeote Quecedo is that of ""a lack of coordination"" in the foreign policy of the EU Member States, which he believes to be essential to the ""visibility and effectiveness"" of the CFSP."
"Does this really amount to nothing more than a coordination problem?"
"As if the divergent national interests of the Member States had already been consigned to the European past!"
"The opposite is true."
"The CFSP' s self-same lack of efficiency and visibility, as picked up on by the rapporteur, can be directly attributed to the divergent interests of the Member States."
"The tension between fantasy and reality in the report also manifests itself in the proposal to set up a College of European Diplomacy."
"Just how realistic is it to ask for ""adequate funding to be provided in the General Budget"" for this project when the current EU delegations are already having to contend with serious personnel shortages due to a lack of funds?"
"Mr Galeote Quecedo makes the same point himself in his explanatory statement."
"Mr President, the question I am dying to ask is this: to what extent do the Member States themselves actually share the rapporteur' s views?"
"At the end of the day, there is nothing skilful about spending Community money."
"On no account does this typically European custom rule out legitimate and extremely useful prior enquiries as to necessity and effectiveness."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for producing this report."
"As Mrs Carrilho has pointed out, this is the first own-initiative report which this Parliament is approving in the field of external policy during this parliamentary term."
"It is odd to hear the interventions of certain MEPs who say that they find this report very timid, and of others who feel that it will put an end to the last redoubt of Member States' sovereignty."
"I believe that this report represents a move in the right direction."
"I believe that it limits itself to adhering pragmatically to the Community method and that it clearly demonstrates that joint diplomacy is one of the fundamental aspects of the visibility of the European Union' s external action."
"I do not know if we can speak today of the European Union as the main economic power, the main industrial power or the main financial power in the world."
"What we can say, without a shadow of a doubt, is that the European Union is today the main provider of development aid, and this means that the European Commission delegates play a very important role when it comes to representing the Community institutions and, in particular, the Commission."
"This means that their specific importance in many cases, given the significant quantities they have to distribute, is greater than that of the ambassadors and of the Member States."
"Therefore, Mr President, it is clear that anything which helps to improve the preparation and knowledge of the Commission officials will be an important element for the European Union' s external action."
"The rapporteur has explained the main initiatives contained in his report: the creation of a common diplomatic college, the establishment of procedures for Commission delegates to be received in third countries - an initiative which Mr Patten has accepted in general terms and which I am pleased to see included in this report - and also the drawing up of an annual report on the activity of European Union delegates."
"I hope, Mr President, that these initiatives will contribute effectively to the creation of a more visible and coherent external policy for European Union action."
"Mr President, today we are discussing Mr Galeote Quecedo' s excellent report, on which there is a broad consensus."
"Clearly, if we are to support the Union' s international activities, we need suitable mechanisms, knowledge and skills."
"Equally clearly, these alone are not enough."
"We also need policies."
"In this sense, Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report remains within the limits of procedural rationalisation; it also remains within the framework of certain policies."
"We often ask the question: which came first, the chicken or the egg?"
"Something of the sort hangs over today' s debate."
"But we must be clear that there are no vacuums in life."
"In this sense, moaning and groaning solves nothing in politics."
"Having said which, the framework to which the Galeote Quecedo report belongs will always dictate the conditions both for rationalising procedures and for the prospects of common diplomacy."
"In this sense, it moves within the bounds of technocratic rationalisation and goes no further than policy will allow."
"However we, the citizens of Europe, who are striving for a better future for the people of Europe and of the world as a whole, have to realise that we need to intervene in these matters transcendently."
"We need to move forward, we need to be guided by the logic of a positive dynamic balance, not a static balance which goes nowhere."
"In this sense, there have indeed been huge vacuums in the CFSP and we have all acknowledged the fact and seen what is needed in order to put flesh on the bones of this policy, which is instrumental to the political development of Europe."
"In this sense, the report translates the initiative of the European Parliament into a framework, into prospects, action and rationalisation."
"In any event, if there is anyone here in this House - and I do not think that there is - who believes that Europe has no future, they can express it somewhat differently."
"But I believe that the people of Europe and the large majority of parties and factions see Europe as a Europe with prospects, a Europe of peace, a Europe of cooperation, a Europe of social cohesion, a Europe of development."
"And this sort of Europe cannot function if it has no prospect of a common foreign policy and defence and security policy, i.e. if it does not have the corresponding mechanisms."
"Under these circumstances, the tiny foundation stone of this structure which the European Parliament is laying today represents a serious starting point and I think that it has created new momentum and better prospects."
"I would like to speak on behalf of the non-federalists in our group who actually feel that Europe is centralising far too much and more and more powers are being taken away from people at local and national levels, basically without any proper democratic control."
"There is quite a lot of double-talk here tonight."
"On the one hand, people are saying that we are not talking about or aiming for a single diplomatic corps, but it is quite clear that the aim of this whole project is to have EU embassies abroad and to abolish national ones."
"I am not being nationalistic and saying that I want the Irish Embassy, but there is a certain amount of danger in this, particularly because it is geared towards the common foreign and security policy, which is not in the interest of the developing world or of the peoples that have been persecuted and exploited by Member States of this Union."
"You only need to look at the number of, for example, British embassies abroad."
"Britain has twice as many embassies as either France or Germany."
"It has a huge diplomatic corps which reflects its colonial past."
"I have grave reservations about the idea of a common European embassy, given that in the past people fleeing persecution in certain countries were able to go into some embassies and seek asylum and get protection."
"What happens if you have a single European diplomatic presence abroad?"
"We abolish national embassies."
"What would happen then if someone fleeing from persecution were to seek asylum or help from the EU embassy if it did not suit the EU's interests to support him or her?"
"I believe that there are grave dangers in what we are doing. It is interesting to hear some people speaking today about the need for a higher profile and EU embassies to compete with the US."
"This is all about competition."
"It is about being able to compete with other superpowers."
"I do not approve of the idea that Europe should create another superpower."
"To do so would destabilise the global community. Whereas, we should look for more cooperation and less competition."
"The idea of competing with the US is completely unacceptable."
"If you look at the report itself, it is geared towards facilitating the common foreign and security policy."
"Not all Greens and EFA members in our group - the non-federalists - would support Mr Dupuis' amendments, because we believe that they are moving in the same direction and we would have grave reservations about that."
"Mr President, although the European Union barely has a legal basis or status as an international political entity, the report and proposal under discussion suggest creating mechanisms which are suited solely to that sort of entity."
"The proposal to create a Community diplomatic corps and a college of diplomacy is not intended to fill a vacuum in Community legislation."
"In essence, this proposal, tabled no less as a proposal by the European Parliament, which is supposed to represent the people, is intended to deprive Member States of the facility to exercise an independent foreign policy which differs from the choices made by the dominant circles in the European Union, to the detriment of the people."
"It is basically intended to abolish diplomatic representation of the people, of the Member States, and to replace it with diplomatic representation directed by the managing board of the European Union."
"This proposal is intended to take all foreign policy matters out of the jurisdiction of national governments, far from any possible democratic control, and away from national parliaments, and is therefore in violation of national constitutions."
"The Communist Party of Greece, as you know, is opposed to any further integration of the European Union and to the CFSP and the superpowers of Mr CFSP, the notorious Mr Solana."
"We are opposed to measures which seek to convert national governments into powerless county councils, which is why we shall be voting against the proposal."
"Outwardly, Mr Galeote Quecedo's report seems very reasonable, but on closer examination, we get a rather different picture."
"If the proposals were pursued, we would have another building block in the construction of a European State."
"There are many points of detail in the report which are particularly controversial, not least the idea of European Union embassies and the suggestion that the European Union should have ""coordinated representation in international bodies such as the UN""."
"The implication of this is that the United Kingdom and France should give up their seats in the Security Council and make way for an EU representative."
"I am alarmed at the anti-United States rhetoric which we have heard from a number of speakers, and at some of the other outbursts from other Members."
"This is hardly the moment for the Commission to be encouraged to embark on yet another ambitious development of its role."
"The Commission's external assistance programmes account for nearly EUR 10 billion this year, and the priority task of the Community delegations is to administer these programmes properly and efficiently."
"Mr Patten has just made reference to this."
"In his communication on the reform of external assistance, Mr Patten recognised, and I quote, ""acute staff shortages have had a direct and negative impact on the speediness and quality of EC aid delivery""."
"He said that there is an urgent need to focus activities on core tasks and that additional staff needs will be concentrated in the area of project and programme implementation, in particular within delegations."
"The clear conclusion is that the most important role of delegations is the administration of external assistance, not to try and run some additional diplomatic tasks."
"Management personnel is what we need in the delegations."
"There is no recognition of this in the Galeote Quecedo report."
"Yes, the Commission needs to recruit a different sort of personnel."
"Yes, it needs to give them improved, specialist training, but not for some new-fangled diplomatic service, but to get the external assistance programmes on the right footing."
"Mr President, the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Evian has, in fact, already anticipated to some degree the excellent proposals in Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report."
"As I understand it, it was agreed that the EU embassies in third countries and the embassies of the Member States should improve their level of cooperation and coordinate their development programmes, and that there should be far more joint action."
"Now these are things we have already called for on countless occasions, and so I am delighted that Mr Galeote Quecedo has made a proposal that is very much in line with our wishes."
"Mr President, last week, I was in Indonesia on a fact-finding mission and all I can say is that the EU delegation out there provided me with outstanding support."
"When I go on foreign trips, I always ask for a meeting to be arranged which will be attended by all the EU ambassadors, i.e. the ambassadors of the 15 Member States."
"This occasion was no exception, and a meeting was indeed arranged."
"And then there are complaints that the joint policy of the EU Member States is not in the limelight enough, and that although people in Indonesia know full well what Japan and the United States are doing there, they do not have a clear enough idea as to what the 15 Member States of the European Union are doing there."
"If I then ask: 'how do you coordinate your work, and how do you harmonise your activities, the answer is: 'that is not something we do' ."
"And I would go so far as to say that people seem to be in great fear of achieving a degree of coordination and harmonisation."
"That is why I think it is so important that these agreements were reached in Evian, and why I welcome with open arms the fact that an EU college of diplomacy has been proposed."
"The national diplomats should also be required to attend courses at a college of this kind, so that they understand how to take joint action at European level."
"There is an urgent need for this."
"It is not a question of wanting to outdo the United States, or Japan, for example, but what we do need to do is give Europe a much higher profile in third countries."
"Accordingly, I have a great deal of time for Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report and I truly hope that the Evian proposals come to fruition."
"Mr President, over a period of 150 years, missionaries and aid workers have fostered knowledge of international affairs and commitment in my own country amongst broad sections of the population."
"It is important for each individual Member State to retain and extend the opportunities it has for asserting, through its government and embassies, the voice and commitment of its own people on international issues."
"Embassies constitute one of the most essential and most obvious expressions of national sovereignty."
"History shows how, for example, a country such as Norway fought to conduct its own diplomacy in its struggle for independence from Sweden."
"By having its own embassy, a country can also provide important services to its citizens when they visit another country."
"The embassy can provide them with a service in their own language."
"At the same time, embassies constitute indispensable sources of information and centres of analytical work for the various governments of the countries concerned."
"Mr Galeote Quecedo has done a very fine job, but I am sceptical about the following points: recital E concerning the establishment of a professional and permanent community diplomatic service; and recital P in which there is talk of setting up EU embassies in the future."
"What exactly does this mean, Mr Galeote Quecedo and Commissioner Patten?"
"Paragraph 1 - the setting up of a College of European Diplomacy."
"In which language is it to operate - in Spanish, English, French or in the languages of all the Member States?"
"Paragraph 12 - in which I think the embassies of the Member States are being told that they are to issue joint statements of their views."
"Is this not already clear to them under the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy?"
"Finally, there is talk of guaranteeing coordinated representation in the EU and other international bodies."
"Sweden and many other countries have proud traditions in the United Nations."
"Let us continue along these lines."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor now spontaneously - as spontaneously as it is possible to do so in this Parliament - because a colleague from the group cannot be here."
"But I am taking the floor as someone who until last April was a very ordinary civil servant in the German diplomatic service, and so people might perhaps think that I would be certain to be relatively sceptical about an approach of this kind because it will surely tend to erode the powers of national colleagues."
"I am not sceptical, and I should like to warmly congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo on his report."
"I am, however, rather surprised at the strange scenarios depicted by some of the honourable members here."
"What is this really about?"
"Mr Galeote Quecedo actually made this quite clear: there is a remit for the European Union to be represented in third countries and this is about us being represented there better and more professionally within its terms; it is about our people whom we post there being able to work as effectively as possible within their remit."
"I do not wish to offend anybody, but if I imagine let's say a former national civil servant from the Ministry of Agriculture in a Member State coming into the Commission at some point and doing really outstanding work internally, and then being appointed to head perhaps an external delegation or a Commission representation abroad, I think that this person would definitely still gain from learning what national colleagues will have perhaps learnt at a diplomatic college."
"And I believe that this would allow the person to do their job even more successfully."
"Similarly, however, I should also like to say that this remit will of course grow in conjunction with powers at European level."
"In this respect, both the fears expressed by Mr Coûteaux on the one hand, and the hopes expressed by Mr Dupuis on the other, are certainly justified."
"As the tasks broaden, so the power devolved to these representations will increase, but this is also what we, as a body, have all wanted."
"Seen from this point of view, it is good if we already start making appropriate preparations now."
"I believe that the report drafted by Mr Galeote Quecedo is a very good one."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the interest that Parliament has shown in the external service, in particular, Mr Galeote Quecedo's report."
"I want to assure Parliament that we will consider its recommendations very carefully."
"I want to pay particular tribute to Mr Galeote Quecedo."
"He deserves considerable respect for the very professional and open-minded way in which he has carried out his work."
"I can say without any reservation that the Commission has benefited from the report and it is bound to make a permanent impression on the way we run our external service in the future."
"It is already a subject in which we have been taking a keen interest."
"I left a special meeting of virtually all our heads of delegation in Brussels early today specifically to be here for this debate."
"When apologising for my early departure I was able to inform them of the close interest that Parliament takes in these matters."
"The fact that we called all our heads of delegation to Brussels at this time is a sign of our determination to give a firm lead to the external service and to provide it with the career structure and the leadership that it deserves and needs."
"Members will have seen the communication on the development of the external service that was adopted by the Commission on 18 July."
"It recommends continuing to rebalance delegation staff between officials and local agents and continuing the regionalisation of our representation in a way that will free up 32 official posts immediately to be redeployed to delegations that need reinforcement."
"The communication updates the list of priorities for the opening of new delegations and offices."
"However, even though some of these are urgent priorities, our first concern must be to use available resources to reinforce some of our existing delegations."
"The communication also describes the measures we are taking to devolve authority from Brussels to delegations in the field, known in jargon as ""deconcentration""."
"This is closely linked to our efforts to reform our external assistance programmes."
"The communication makes it clear that what it proposes is only a first step."
"We intend to continue and to ensure the best use of the resources we have at our disposal on the basis of an evaluation of the workload of each delegation."
"I want to make this point very clear because it is the backdrop to Mr Galeote Quecedo's report."
"If we get through our reform proposals and if they are supported by the budgetary authority, in the SCR and the Bureau d'assistance technique combined we will have fewer people managing our external programmes, though we will have more than at present in the SCR."
"But we will have fewer people in Brussels and more people in the field."
"That is the balance we should be striking: to have more of the work done on the ground in our delegations."
"We will be preparing a follow-up communication on the external services in the first half of next year."
"Let me comment specifically on Mr Galeote Quecedo's report."
"It makes recommendations in three main areas: the training of officials assigned to external relations, the legal status of delegations and coordination with Member States."
"A number of the points raised by the resolution, for example on regionalisation and on the evaluation of our network of external representations, are already covered in our own communication."
"The report stresses the role of the Commission and its delegations in the Community's external activities and it is, of course, essential that the Commission's external service be able to continue to contribute properly."
"The first step must be to develop the training of officials in the Commission who deal with external relations."
"I am delighted that the report puts so much informed stress on that point."
"We have already made good progress but we need to build on it very fast indeed, particularly given the deconcentration that I have talked about."
"We should try, as the report suggests, to benefit from the skills and experience of existing training institutions in the Member States."
"We are already in contact with many of them and we will seek to deepen that relationship."
"Whether it is now time to set up a college of European diplomacy is something that we will have to look at very carefully with Parliament, the Council and others."
"We will certainly consider that proposal very carefully and it underlines the importance of training - language training, management training, all the other sorts of training that are essential in order to make our delivery of programmes and our representation overseas more effective."
"On the legal status of delegations I should say that although delegations are formally delegations of the Commission they are under clear instructions to give all possible assistance to all the institutions of the European Union and indeed to Member States."
"I am not convinced of the need to formalise this state of affairs since it exists already."
"I do not want to complicate procedures further, but again I am open-minded on the issue."
"We have made it absolutely clear to our delegations that they should regard themselves as working for the High Representative and for the other institutions of the European Union, both when it comes to reporting and when it comes to logistical issues."
"On relations with the Member States, I wholeheartedly endorse the proposal for greater cooperation."
"This is already our policy and the discussions this weekend at Evian very much concentrated on how best we can achieve that in practice."
"In our 1998 communication on the external service, we made it clear that any Member State that wished to keep a presence in a third country without maintaining an embassy was welcome to use the Commission's delegations."
"This has already happened on two occasions: in Sierra Leone by Germany and in Burundi by Austria."
"There is already a considerable degree of cooperation between Member States' embassies and Commission delegations."
"There are regular meetings at all levels."
"Joint reports are produced, either at the request of headquarters, or on the initiative of heads of missions."
"The Commission also supports and, when appropriate, seeks to participate in co-location projects where more than one Member State and/or the Commission agree to occupy premises jointly."
"We have a programme of secondment of Member States officials and diplomats to our delegations."
"There are ten in our delegations at the moment, with a few more due in the near future."
"The restriction on the development of this programme is not lack of will on our part - I want to make that clear - but to some extent a lack of resources and also a certain reluctance on the part of the Member States to respond to our invitation to second diplomats to the delegations."
"I want to underline the importance of coordination."
"We have to cooperate better without finding ourselves in a situation in which everything we do is second-guessed, not just in Brussels, but in other countries as well."
"All this discussion about coordination and about the future of the external service takes place against the backdrop of a treaty which talks about a common foreign and security policy, not a single foreign and security policy in a Union of fifteen Member States, each with its own foreign minister."
"I strongly suspect that we will have fifteen foreign ministers in the European Union for the foreseeable future."
"But what we have to do is make coordination and cooperation more effective, more meaningful and more professional."
"A final plea."
"In welcoming this report and in promising active cooperation in following its recommendations I must stress that if the external service is to carry out the role which Parliament wants for it, it must have the resources to do so; that is, not just resources to place officials in third countries but also to ensure that they are properly trained, that they are equipped with the necessary information technology and that they have secure means of communication."
"Last and by no means least, it is very important that they are provided with adequate physical protection in what is an, often, very dangerous world."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.30 p.m."
"EC investment partners financial instrument"
"The next item is the report (A5-0202/2000) by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation regarding the closure and liquidation of projects adopted by the Commission under Council Regulation (EC) No 213/96 on the implementation of the European Communities investment partners financial instrument for the countries of Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean region and South Africa (COM(1999) 726 - C5­0062/2000 - 2000/0034(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the great honour of presenting, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, this report on the liquidation of one of the projects which appears to have been more successful or which has been more positively appreciated in the field of North/South cooperation: the ECIP (European Community Investment Partners) project."
"This project is universally considered to have been successful, although, in company with many other projects, it did suffer from the delays which have built up in the external relations sector, delays with which we are all familiar and which Commissioner Patten has recently analysed in great detail."
"In this case, we have almost 600 projects which were approved in due time and which are to be financed by the ECIP."
"The Commission has therefore proposed - after a delay which we condemn in our report, caused, of course, by the events of 1999 - to extend, not the legal basis itself, but the existence of the technical assistance offices and the means which are essential for the management of the sizeable remainder of the ECIP - 590 projects - and to do so for two years."
"I have to say, Commissioner, that the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been faced with the opinions of the other Parliamentary committees - the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control - on this matter."
"As you will have seen, these two committees attempted to fence in the Commission, so to speak, and place greater restrictions on it, calling upon it to conclude the operation six months earlier and to submit progress reports earlier in the process than proposed."
"We, the Committee on Development and Cooperation, have understood the Commission' s message, the request to assist the ECIP project - which, I repeat, has contributed, along with other projects, to the creation and growth of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises in Third World countries and has, in effect, raised the profile of the Union and enabled it to penetrate a new sector, which is therefore important to the Commission - and we have therefore decided not to go along with the more restrictive opinions of the other Committees or to make amendments to the Commission' s principal request to be granted two years to bring this major economic cooperation instrument to the best possible conclusion and to honour the agreements, signed before 31 December 1999."
"However, at the same time, Commissioner, we have made a request: we have called upon you to inform Parliament of what the Commission intends to be the future of this instrument and to do so in good time for us to be able to reflect on the matter, together if possible."
"We have seen that it is an effective instrument which has responded to real needs and has employed much more in the way of resources than the Community Budget funding."
"We therefore call upon you to accept our amendment in order to make the co-decision procedure as rapid as possible and so that, if possible, we will be able to close the procedure in a single reading, so that you will be equipped with the means for action as soon as possible."
"Our modest request is that you inform us of your intentions before the end of the year."
"We are aware of the differences of opinion and the possible conflicts of responsibilities between external relations and development and therefore between the responsibilities of the individual Directorates-General, and possibly even between the responsibilities of the individual Commissioners, but we are also aware that, during restructuring, the responsibility for external relations is extremely carefully reviewed by yourself, in particular, Commissioner, and by the entire Commission."
"We have not, therefore, laid down a line of march. We have not laid down that the ECIP has to remain an autonomous instrument or that the ECIP can and must be integrated into a wider-reaching instrument."
"We have merely requested that the faith we are placing in the Commission in granting it these extra two years will be repaid: this is our request, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to tell us now whether you accept the amendments which we have tabled."
"Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control unanimously supports the objectives of the EC Investment Partners programme."
"However, we do criticise the way in which it has been implemented."
"The first point to note is that the Commission is currently operating in a legal vacuum, because the proposal to continue the programme - which has after all already been extended twice - was only tabled at the end of January, that is, one month after the regulation had expired, and will not be able to be adopted until late autumn."
"We endorse the legislative proposal as a stopgap measure until the end of 2001, because we do not deny that, according to the figures published, 34 000 firms have been involved as partners, creating over 1 300 joint ventures and 42 000 jobs."
"Nevertheless, the Deloitte & Touche appraisal report highlights a series of grave shortcomings which need to be tackled."
"For example, procedures have become increasingly bureaucratic and cumbersome and therefore less business- and user-friendly, which has resulted in the accumulation of a backlog of payments and increasing discontent among financial institutions and enterprises because of delays in decisions and contracts."
"Bad management and a lack of coordination between the ECIP Unit and the SCR also mar the Commission's reputation, as does the discrimination between financial institutions."
"For example, the state-owned development bank of Denmark receives 38% of funding while Spain's only receives 23%."
"As well as further points of criticism and three proposals for amendments, our opinion also contains questions which the Commission ought to take into account when it is deciding whether to continue operating the ECIP beyond 2001 or whether to incorporate it in a single investment facility, as Mr Dell'Alba has already mentioned."
"Mr President, as somebody keen on helping countries to create jobs and transfer technology, I have to say that the ECIP programme is extremely good and, in principle, that was the objective."
"But as my colleague and friend, Mrs Theato, has mentioned, it is full of worms."
"It is almost as if the project was a wonderful, beautifully-wrapped box of chocolates, but inside was absolutely packed with worms."
"The reason for that is simple."
"If you look at Facility 1, it grants up to EUR 100 000 for simply identifying a potential joint venture."
"So, clearly, when you look at Facilities 2, 3, 4 and 1b, you soon realise that the work was not done by somebody who was a banker, but by somebody who perhaps was a bureaucrat and knew nothing about finance and lending to projects which could be viable."
"In short, I would say if such an instrument is ever to be invented and devised, it should be done with bankers and industrialists, people who know what they are talking about, not bureaucrats sitting in the European Commission."
"Therefore, the sooner this project is wound up and the European Union saves money that is being wasted, the better."
"I feel very strongly that such investment projects should be very carefully thought out with input from industry and bankers so that maximum jobs are created where they are needed and where there is wide coverage and public accountability and transparency."
"When I was a member of the Budgetary Control Committee and met the people who were managing this project, I was not at all impressed with the knowledge that they had of running such an enterprise, and I come from an industrial and financial background."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report presented by Mr Dell'Alba refers to the winding up of one of the main financial instruments for Community aid to the private sector."
"The Socialist Group supports all cooperation measures which, like this one, help to make companies, and economies in general, more dynamic, by means of private initiative."
"The ECIP, whose projects are now coming to an end, has been particularly successful, as has been previously pointed out."
"According to the external evaluation it has been subjected to, the ECIP has demonstrated a significant multiplier effect, creating jobs and joint ventures."
"We now hope, Commissioner, that the future programme that will replace it will add better management to these positive effects."
"Nevertheless, we have to say that although we are happy with the successes of this programme, we Socialist members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation suggest that the main objective of any instrument for aid, including those in the private sector, must be to reduce poverty in those countries, which is ultimately the objective of these instruments."
"Wealth creation and the generation of jobs by means of companies financed through Community funds must benefit those populations in need."
"The application of these instruments must take account of the need to achieve labour, social and environmental standards, otherwise it could be said that these instruments do not aid development but rather constitute subsidies to individuals."
"We cannot say that in the evaluations control has always been exercised over the quality of aid via the ECIP."
"For example, when a bank is established in a beneficiary country by means of ECIP funds, how can we be sure that these funds are directed towards attracting investment and not simply to subsidising the presence of the bank in that country?"
"As the rapporteur has said, it is a question of framing Community aid within a broad strategy which includes the private sector, which the Commission does not refer to in its plan for reforming aid policy, despite the fact that attracting private funds is necessary for the development of many countries."
"In this respect, we wish once again to repeat the question by Mr Dell'Alba to the Commission about its intentions relating to extending this instrument to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, whose need for funds is also very great."
"In short, we hope that this experience of the ECIP, which has been very important for Latin America, will serve to improve the programme replacing it, which, we have noted, has no clear role in the Commission' s plan for reform."
"Coordination within the Commission is essential to improving the effectiveness of aid and, to this end, the different instruments must have one broad aim and one overall strategy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to those of us who have closely followed the evolution and development of the ECIP instrument throughout its short but intense history, it seems that the best way to summarise Mr Dell'Alba' s report is to highlight the message contained in the amendments of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, since they recommend the continuation of this financial instrument because it has been the best vehicle for establishing and strengthening Europe' s business fabric in the countries involved and, consequently, for creating employment."
"Now that the agreement on free trade, political concertation and cooperation between the European Union and Mexico has just entered into force, it is a good time to remember that we should continue with this type of financial instrument which, in some cases, such as Mexico, has been used intensively and positively, and is ideally suited to strengthening commercial ties between particular blocks, such as the European Union and the countries involved."
"Otherwise, the European Union would no longer be acting in accordance with its cooperation and development commitment, not only in the case of the countries of Latin America, but also in the cases of Asia, the Mediterranean and South Africa."
"In short, we clearly support Mr Dell' Alba' s report, and we congratulate him on the clarity of his ideas when he deals with the need to continue in the future with the implementation of the ECIP, in my opinion, as a single instrument. We also hope that these ideas will be directed, after more than ten years of positive experience, towards making the bureaucratic process involved in the project' s implementation more flexible and rapid in order to allow for more efficient action."
"In my opinion, this requires a strengthening of human resources in the Commission' s offices in the countries involved."
"Mr President, the proposed ECIP development programme provides a pretty picture of the European Commission' s mismanagement."
"Although this programme is heading in the right direction, i.e. technology transfer to developing countries, the Commission has, perhaps unwittingly, applied a brake."
"The programme has been running for twelve years and the Commission has waited right until it is about to end before considering whether to carry on with it."
"As with other programmes, the Commission has not looked into the consequences of a possible end to this programme, the implications for the continuity of actions already undertaken or for the situation affecting partner businesses and jobs."
"It appears that, last year, the EUR 90 million that were budgeted for this programme were not even used, due to a lack of human resources available to study the dossiers, which are piled up on a desk somewhere in Brussels."
"At the same time, the administrative procedures have become more cumbersome with every passing year, yet the personnel running the programme have not seen any increase in their staffing numbers."
"Similarly, business partners were not informed of the possible termination of the programme."
"Lastly, the criteria for the distribution of funds between the different foci of the programme, particularly the social rights of workers, have remained impenetrably vague."
"In light of what I have just said, we ask the Commission to look into the means, firstly, of producing a rapid evaluation of the assessment and, secondly, of re-establishing the programme whilst improving its transparency and maintaining the level of its budget."
"Mr President, I shall be voting against the Dell'Alba report, and more generally against the ECIP and MEDA programmes, which were basically designed to finance subsidies and loans to private companies investing in Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and in South Africa."
"I protest at the fact that public money might be used - in any form at all - to generate private profit."
"This project, which is supposed to focus on SMEs in the first instance, in reality often involves subsidiaries of huge multinational companies, such as banks, which take part in these programmes and profit from them."
"The stated political aim of these programmes is to encourage the opening up of these countries' markets to European capital."
"In the past, these poor countries were plundered and exploited by the capital of the great European powers in competition with one another."
"All that has changed is the fact that the programmes now advocate coordinated action for this capital."
"Capital that is invested through this programme is no more designed to develop poor countries now than it was in the past, since they are dependent on European capital."
"These programmes are not designed to make the lives of the working classes any easier, but to exploit a cheap workforce over there in order to increase the wealth of owners and shareholders over here."
"I therefore object to these programmes across the board, because in spite of a few hypocritical phrases about fighting poverty, they all seek to provide the imperialism of the great European powers with additional instruments for getting a foothold in poorer countries and then dominating them."
"Mr President, we are holding a debate on an issue which is of relatively modest importance in budgetary terms, ambitious in its objectives, relatively encouraging in its results, inefficient because of its cumbersome management procedures, at times contradictory and, in short, there is clearly room for improvement in the future."
"I must express my satisfaction at the frankness and transparency with which the committee has analysed the results that have been obtained. It does not hide anything and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dell'Alba, because in a co-decision procedure he has rejected demagoguery and easy criticism in favour of the professionalism with which he has approached the drawing up of his report."
"I hope that, in a co-decision procedure, the Commission will be sensitive to Parliament' s position so that we can begin the now urgent reform of this important financial instrument."
"This instrument for the development of the private sector in developing countries is in accordance with the thinking which inspires the new position of the European Union in its cooperation policy."
"We have already talked a lot about this in relation to the ACP countries and we must apply the same criteria in relation to the countries of Latin America and the southern Mediterranean."
"The results obtained so far are encouraging."
"More than 1 300 new companies have been set up, generating 42 000 jobs, and investment flows to the tune of EUR 3 500 million have been created."
"Certain hopes and expectations, however, have been left behind."
"We find it contradictory to say that fighting poverty is our priority and, yet we lack the information and indicators necessary to ascertain to what extent the most impoverished sectors have benefited from the aid."
"Lastly, Commissioner, it is urgent that we reform the five current cumbersome procedures, none of which is of any real use, since they can clearly be improved."
"Let me thank Mr Dell'Alba and the Development and Cooperation Committee very sincerely for their excellent work on the Commission proposal on the future of the European Community Investment Partners."
"Let me commence with a bit of background."
"The ECIP instrument operated successfully for 12 years, from 1988 to 1999."
"More than 2 500 actions were approved in that period for a total amount of over EUR 290 million involving 1 400 joint ventures and EUR 4.3 billion in investment."
"From 1991, the Commission sent annual reports on the implementation and on the results of ECIP to Parliament and to the Council, of which the last covered operations in 1999."
"Parliament also received the independent evaluation report that was completed in December 1999, but, as honourable Members will know, from 1997 ECIP began to run into trouble."
"The lack of sufficient staff to ensure the smooth management of an ever-increasing number of actions resulted in delays in the implementation of the programme, which in turn caused growing discontent among its beneficiaries."
"These difficulties were compounded by the introduction of more stringent financial procedures needed to guarantee the proper use of the resources managed by the Commission."
"They are typical of the problems we face, namely insufficient resources to do the job wedded to overly restrictive practices and procedures."
"The Commission decided not to extend the instrument beyond 31 December 1999."
"This was a painful decision, but, I am sure, the right one - and to reappraise the instrument in order to prepare a redesigned programme."
"This will allow better coordination with other similar European Union instruments and ensure improved management and financial procedures in the light of the new Commission guidelines on development policy and the management of external aid."
"Mr Dell'Alba's report contains extremely helpful suggestions in this respect."
"The approval of the proposed regulation will make possible the continued sound management of existing ECIP projects and their orderly closure and winding-down as they reach completion."
"As far as the suggested amendments are concerned, the Commission agrees with Amendment Nos 1 and 2, which correspond with our views on the need to reassess, improve and redesign the existing financial instruments for the support of private investment."
"As regards Amendment No 3, the Commission agrees with the principle behind it but is not in a position to provide the legislative proposals requested by Parliament by the end of this year."
"We are presently engaged in a comprehensive review of all our existing financial instruments."
"We need to be candid."
"We need more time to present a properly thought through and fundamentally revised programme."
"The Commission therefore proposes to evaluate all the options by June of next year and then make proposals."
"The honourable gentleman has been generous, courteous and understanding."
"He therefore deserves the assurance from me that the timetable I have set out is one we intend to observe, and I hope he will accept our determination to present our proposals within that sort of time-scale in good faith."
"I wish we could act more rapidly, but to do the job properly we need a bit more time."
"Let me finish by thanking the European Parliament for the support which the House has given to the proposed regulation on ECIP."
"It will allow the Commission to bring this programme to an end in a responsible manner and to launch renewed and improved initiatives for promotion of the private sector in developing countries."
"I am sure that we will have other future opportunities that will enable me to explain to some honourable Members why I do not equate that with nineteenth century imperialism."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.30 p.m."
"Community humanitarian activities"
"The next item is the report (A5-0191/2000) by Mr Imbeni, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Assessment and future of Community humanitarian activities (Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 1257/96) (COM(1999) 468 - C5-0044/2000 - 2000/2016 (COS))."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all my fellow Members from the various Parliamentary groups who have made a substantial contribution to the preparatory work for this report to express Parliament' s position on the Commission' s Communication on ECHO' s activities, on emergency aid and on humanitarian activities."
"The committee' s unanimity regarding the report is evidence of highly profitable cooperation, and I hope that this will be reflected in the final vote in the Chamber tomorrow."
"A discussion on ECHO, or humanitarian aid, will include mention of the worst tragedies and the greatest contradictions of our time."
"It will touch on war, natural disasters and the damage to the world' s ecology system, on the continued tragic ethnic conflicts and civil and military wars, on the basic injustice underlying the North/South relationship and the suffering, in particular, of the most vulnerable peoples; of women, children and the elderly."
"And the truth is that the forecast for the next few years does not indicate an improvement in this situation."
"I merely refer to a number of newspaper articles which have appeared during recent months on issues such as the fact that a totally unexpected part of the North Pole has shown signs of melting, the water poisoning in Bangladesh which is endangering safety, health and hygiene conditions for 25 million people, or the drought in many parts of Africa."
"We must therefore be responsible and realistic, and, even more than in the past, we must plan action for the future to prevent natural disasters and to respond to the consequences of the tragedies often - almost always - caused by man."
"These planning operations require an improvement in coordination at international level between the European Union and all the other parties involved in humanitarian aid, and greater cooperation within the European Union between the Commission and the instruments available to the Member States, in order to avoid the repetition of the frequent past cases - referred to in the Commission document and confirmed by the assessments - of duplication and repetition of action and, thus, wastage of energy and resources."
"In this context, I find it unacceptable - and both my report and Parliament' s position are clear on this point - that ECHO should be reduced to a source of funding for initial relief operations and nothing else."
"We need to act in a wider perspective. The objective of ECHO and of European Union activities must be, firstly, to increase preventive action and then, secondly, to link emergency and initial relief actions to the operations intended to re-establish minimum living conditions in places affected by natural disasters and wars, thereby providing humanitarian aid during the stage following provision of emergency aid."
"The sums in question may well be limited, in terms of more general budgets, but we are talking about EUR 2 500 million which have been allocated over the last four years by the European Commission to non-governmental organisations (56%), United Nations agencies (25%), the Red Cross (11%) and other direct operations carried out by ECHO or specialised Member States agencies."
"There we are. In my opinion, the Commission' s analysis compels us to act to further strengthen ECHO and to avoid the prevalence of certain positions present within the Council, which is divided over these issues."
"Certain people in the Council are of the opinion that ECHO' s activities should be reduced, but I take the completely opposite view."
"One very last point, Mr President: ECHO cannot be treated as an ATM service where international agencies or non-governmental organisations withdraw money and do not even tell the beneficiaries where the funding came from."
"The European public and the beneficiaries should be told about this remarkable work by ECHO."
"This is why we have proposed - and I hope that Commissioner Patten, who is not listening to me at the moment, will take this proposal on board with due consideration - that an information campaign be mounted to inform the public of our countries how our money is being spent and how our resources are being used, and we propose that this information campaign should not, of course, be financed out of ECHO funds but out of the ad hoc funds."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Imbeni, has done an excellent job."
"There is no need to repeat anything."
"I should like to expand on two problematic issues."
"The first is a question of principle."
"Humanitarian aid has to be provided regardless of what has caused the catastrophes concerned and irrespective of any other political objectives."
"Its increasing politicisation in recent years is an unacceptable and, ultimately, also inhumane phenomenon."
"But at the same time, it should also be noted that the growing number of catastrophes is not only due to natural events over which we have no control."
"As it is, this cannot be said of wars, in which humanitarian aid has to be supplied, perhaps by ECHO."
"An increasing number of natural disasters are clearly linked to the fact that we are placing ever greater demands on the global ecosphere and biosphere."
"The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has reported, for example, that we can already see a, ""discernible human influence on global climate""."
"Our concepts of crisis management ought therefore, in my opinion, also to have a socio-political dimension and be integrated into development policy and, for example, economic policy strategy."
"Otherwise we will, in many cases, only be repairing the damage inflicted as a consequence of our own policy, and the people in the countries of the South, in particular, will suffer as a result of the disasters which we have caused."
"The second problem is directly linked to the first and yet is of a very practical nature."
"I call on the Commission - even if the extensive problem which I have just outlined is not yet resolved - to link the design, organisation and operation of humanitarian aid more closely to development policy."
"The Commission has already made attempts to do this, which I feel still need to be stepped up considerably and freed of red tape."
"An example of this is, in my opinion, the concept of emergency relief which is geared to development, which the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (Company for Technical Cooperation) is trying to put into practice."
"Mr President, I should first like to salute Mr Imbeni, the author of this report, and express my appreciation of his work."
"It is an excellent report which both identifies the main points of criticism and describes ways to ensure that ECHO is able to work effectively in the future."
"We have had this office for humanitarian aid in the EU since 1992, and both evaluation reports - which form the main basis of the assessment, together with the Commission's report - contain high praise for ECHO in respect of its work so far, while identifying several very serious weak points."
"Although the assessment of ECHO's work in terms of efficiency compared with costs, is very positive, there still remains the problem of the infamous 'grey area' in the time immediately following the events which trigger the provision of relief."
"Humanitarian operations in this 'grey area' cannot be assessed on the basis of precise criteria, nor do they provide the information and recommendations required for future ECHO operations in the area."
"It is therefore necessary, in my opinion, to improve disaster preparedness and step up the provision of disaster relief as a priority."
"It should be noted here that the regional approach adopted by the existing DIPECHO instrument offers a possible solution."
"At the same time, however, the lack of sufficiently flexible alternative instruments within the Commission is to be lamented."
"The Commission needs to present a clear strategy for the role which the humanitarian aid provided by ECHO has to play as part of foreign and development policy."
"ECHO does not have the necessary human resources to do the job of a planning headquarters."
"Staffing levels are below those characteristic of other Commission departments and well below those in national administrations, which are known to invest considerably less in crisis prevention."
"Here the appropriations, which currently stand at around EUR 7.5 million, therefore need to be at least - wait for it - quadrupled to allow the work to be done effectively."
"It is particularly regrettable - and Mr Imbeni has already made this point as well - that when projects are developed and run through partners, around 56% of which are non-governmental organisations, they are not identified strongly enough in the public arena as European Union aid."
"I believe that there is a considerable need for action here in the future."
"The public has to be informed, but please not with the funds which are directly available to ECHO."
"We should continue to pursue the positive initiatives here and use alternative sources of funding to defray the costs of informing the public."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mr Imbeni because I believe he has produced a splendid report and, while we were debating it in committee, we were already in complete agreement with his proposals. The Socialist Group believes that aid policy must be the flagship of the European Union' s external activities insofar as it reflects the ideas which must inspire the construction of the European Union, that is to say, solidarity and cohesion on a global level."
"In these times of Commission reform, when many Community policies and procedures are being questioned, humanitarian aid has been evaluated positively by different bodies and, of course, on a political level, by Parliament."
"It is true that there has been a lot of criticism of humanitarian aid."
"However, we, who have seen and evaluated what ECHO has done, believe that its work has been very positive."
"This report therefore serves to ratify the principle of humanitarian aid as a right for people involved in disasters and an obligation on the part of the international community, in which the European Union is a major player, in both quantitative and qualitative terms."
"Nevertheless and with a view to the future, we must take some steps forward."
"Firstly, we must overcome the so-called 'grey area' which was mentioned earlier, that is to say, the interregnum between the end of emergency aid and the beginning of the rehabilitation and development actions."
"While this 'grey area' continues, in which nobody is administratively responsible, there will be people who do not receive assistance for no other reason than a lack of internal coordination within the Commission."
"We have seen this in the case of Mozambique and other disasters."
"Humanitarian aid did arrive, but during this interregnum it has not continued for rehabilitation and development cooperation."
"Coordination within the Commission and complementarity with the Member States and other donors are factors which are fundamental to the efficiency which reform is intended to produce."
"Secondly, it is urgent that we increase the number of staff dedicated to humanitarian aid activities."
"The number of ECHO' s staff is not proportional to the importance of its work."
"Thirdly - and this is closely related to the previous point - the budget for humanitarian aid must be increased proportionally with its political importance and the real objectives we wish to achieve and which can be counted in the most important terms: human lives."
"In this respect, the Commission and the Council' s budgetary proposals are far from meeting what we believe to be the humanitarian needs."
"Lastly, we must try harder and harder to improve the decentralisation and flexibility of relations with agents for humanitarian aid, fundamentally the NGOs."
"An instrument was mentioned earlier, DIPECHO, which provides operative preparation for disaster situations."
"We believe that it is essential that, when a humanitarian catastrophe occurs, whether natural or caused by man, instruments are already in place."
"In this respect, we wish to highlight the importance of DIPECHO."
"The Socialist Group supports the principles which govern humanitarian aid and its future in the terms which I expressed earlier."
"We do not believe that this should become a token policy, but rather a flagship, together with development cooperation, of the European Union' s external action."
"Mr Imbeni said earlier - I do not know if the Commissioner heard what he said because he was talking at the time, but it seems to me to be very important - that there must be an awareness-raising campaign on the significance of humanitarian aid, on what this humanitarian aid means to us, the European Union. Mr Imbeni also said that the costs of that campaign should not be met with money intended for humanitarian aid."
"I believe that this point, the subject of an amendment which has been presented this afternoon, is important and deserves our support."
"What could be more important than humanitarian emergency aid?"
"In other words, saving the lives of numerous human beings by taking swift and effective action, making funds immediately available and ensuring that they are well-spent, whilst eliminating political deliberations and bureaucratic rigmarole."
"Needless to say, the European Union has its work cut out in this respect."
"More to the point, it can, and must, take a leading role in this field in view of the added value it offers compared with the individual States."
"ECHO must become the central coordination platform for all Member States."
"It must be equipped to this end, so that it can operate to best advantage, for this is about life and death and so only the very best is good enough."
"This will entail extending and improving the staffing capacity, decentralising competences, formulating quantifiable objectives, systematic monitoring of the results, continuing to learn from past mistakes, and above all, improving coordination with the other offices of the Commission and the Member States."
"In order to mobilise the necessary public support for emergency aid, it would be a good idea to give greater publicity to what Europe does and why."
"Moreover, increased transparency would create an additional incentive to meet the highest demands."
"The relationship between emergency aid, reconstruction and development is the same as that between the seed, the stems, and the leaves of a plant; one evolves naturally from the other."
"And what this means in terms of ECHO, which is the seed, is that although it does not have to handle all the reconstruction work itself, it does have to make all the necessary preparations."
"When it comes to the reconstruction and development phases, the Commission needs to bring its own staffing levels up to standard with all haste, and drastically reduce the procedures."
"A number of speakers have already said as much this evening."
"Only then will Europe be able to make a virtue of need."
"Mr President, throughout the world, development aid is giving way to humanitarian aid."
"Even here, the Directorate-General for External Relations is gradually taking charge of the areas that were formerly the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Development, with humanitarian aid compensating for the failures of external policy."
"It is not just a question of providing aid, but also of restoring balance in the use of natural resources among all of the world' s inhabitants."
"Unfortunately, humanitarian aid cannot play this role and must not serve only to bail out a liberal policy which at the same time murders the populations of the countries in receipt of aid."
"Sustainable development is all but absent from the European Union' s humanitarian policy - we are quite unprepared for natural disasters and do little to prevent conflicts."
"Systematic training in how to deal with earthquakes and floods as well as in preventing violence would be welcome in many parts of the world."
"Instead of this, the European Union always reacts too late - once the disaster has been declared."
"This lack of planning can be seen in the programmes of aid for health and nutrition, and gender issues are also ignored."
"The connection between humanitarian and development policy, although crucial, is systematically missing."
"It is important not to do just what is strictly necessary, but to prevent the effects of these catastrophes, and first of all, the factor that makes them worse, which is poverty."
"We hope that cross-sector posts will be created in order to link ECHO and the Directorate-General for Development."
"These could also initiate cooperation with other worldwide organisations in the field of humanitarian aid, beginning with those in Member States, since there is a considerable lack of coordination in their actions."
"It is equally important that operating and assessment costs do not exceed 20% of ECHO' s budget."
"Payments must also be made more rapidly."
"Venezuela has been waiting since last December for the aid it was promised."
"Even if we are satisfied overall with the European Union' s humanitarian policy, and if we are generally happy with Mr Imbeni' s report, this policy must, to a greater extent, be in keeping with sustainable development."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Imbeni on an excellent report, into which he put a tremendous amount of work."
"I want to refer to the question of Third World debt relief."
"We must be more forceful in our efforts to put the issue of debt relief for Third World countries on a permanent footing."
"The Jubilee 2000 campaign helped to focus international attention on the debt issue."
"The campaign has been instrumental in achieving progress in providing additional relief both at multilateral level and by major bilateral creditors."
"Poor countries face unsustainable debt burdens at the same time as they are confronting natural disasters, famine and the HIV/Aids pandemic."
"Debt service payments often exceed health and education budgets."
"Surely there is nothing more important in developing countries than education."
"If people have literacy and numeracy they are a danger to the leadership of the worst-governed countries."
"The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have brought out an initiative as an official response to the major multilateral lending institutions and the need for debt relief."
"We all know that the link between debt relief and poverty reduction needs to be substantially strengthened."
"Debt relief programmes for Third World countries must be put in place permanently."
"The joint United Nations programmes on Aids has already estimated that 95% of all HIV-infected individuals live in developing countries."
"The effect of the Aids pandemic means that progress and development become more difficult."
"We must address this problem urgently."
"The Ugandan President has set up a massive programme to deal with the Aids pandemic in his own country."
"It is a great example for the rest of the African countries."
"European Union leaders are meeting in Nice in December to discuss the reform of EU policy programmes."
"I would once again call on EU leaders to address the need to control arms exports to Third World countries."
"It is hard to believe that in the European Union, where all key economic sectors of activity are regulated and controlled by law, the export of arms to third countries seems to go unregulated for the most part."
"This is a barbaric and hypocritical position."
"EU leaders should have the courage to face up to the key defence manufacturers."
"They would also win broader support from the citizens of the EU, who are seeking leadership on this issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my thanks and congratulations to Mr Imbeni for his excellent report."
"I agree with him that ECHO has in the past been and can continue to be in the future an excellent instrument for humanitarian intervention in the world' s crises, and this aid must be given an increasingly higher profile and become one of the trade marks of European Union action, for so it has been in recent years, I recall, for example when there was an ad hoc Commissioner for ECHO in the Commission."
"I therefore feel that this evaluation, which attempts to improve the image of the programme, is right and necessary, and it appears, to a large extent, to be the aim of the excellent Imbeni report. I have tabled two purely technical amendments to the report, on the subject of the visibility of the programme in particular."
"We need to strengthen, develop and, I would argue, provide autonomous funding for this opportunity for the European Union to publicise ECHO' s activities, for it is an unknown fact, for example, that it contributes over 50% to the budget of the Commissioner for Refugees."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to give very serious consideration to Parliament' s suggestions and to take the Imbeni report carefully into account when carrying out the restructuring which is to take place to make ECHO' s actions increasingly useful and effective in assisting the areas and peoples in the greatest need."
"You may be certain, Commissioner Patten, that this report is of the greatest importance to Parliament."
"In the Committee on Development and Cooperation we have dedicated a great deal of time to humanitarian aid policies and you know that on this issue, in general, you will always have our support."
"Firstly, I must today express my gratitude to the officials in ECHO and the staff of the NGOs who, in extremely precarious circumstances, when everything is failing on the ground, are the first, the most self-sacrificing, and often the only ones to provide essential humanitarian aid."
"I must remind you that in Rwanda, in Kosovo, in Mozambique, in Central America, the sacrifices, sometimes of their lives, of those working in cooperation with us, have been some of the most inspiring stories in the history of the European Union."
"In the small amount of time I have for this intervention I must add that I agree with the Imbeni report and, in particular, I would like to highlight the following issues."
"As has been said, we must clarify the so-called dilemma of the 'grey area' . We must clarify the procedures and, in some cases, the legal basis and the responsibility of each party, in order to make the management of ECHO more efficient."
"I have already referred to the problem of human resources, as well as the problem of visibility, and the objectives must be clarified."
"In certain cases, in Cuba for example - as you know, Commissioner - in the guise of humanitarian aid, programmes are implemented which are no such thing, but simply a form of concealed cooperation, sometimes for reasons of 'ideological solidarity' with the Castro regime."
"For the future, it is necessary to improve management, increase cooperation with our partners, improve complementarity with the actions carried out through the efforts of Member States and, in short, frame the humanitarian aid actions of the European Union within the global strategy of our cooperation policies."
". Mr President, I should like to say at the outset that I welcome without reservation Mr Imbeni's extremely constructive report."
"It is an excellent piece of work and both my colleague, Commissioner Nielson, and I are delighted by the arguments set out."
"We are delighted by the broad welcome which has been given to the Commission's communication on its assessment and future plans for the Community's humanitarian activities."
"Many congratulations to the honourable Member."
"Humanitarian aid, as a number of honourable Members have said, is an extremely important facet of the European Union's external identity."
"I am the first to acknowledge that we have a great deal to do to improve our performance."
"But, it is also important that we should acknowledge the enormous amount of good that our help does, day-in day-out, often in extremely difficult circumstances, often in very difficult situations right across the world."
"Whatever the faults - and it is our responsibility to try to put them right - let me pay tribute to what has been achieved and is being achieved by European Union aid and by the generous support of Europe's taxpayers."
"We are the biggest providers of this humanitarian assistance in the world and it is important, occasionally, that we remember that."
"We very much appreciate Parliament's support for the reforms we are seeking."
"Much of the strategy which honourable Members urge on us tallies, marches very closely, with what we anyway wanted to do."
"I would stress that however much we might all like to do more we have to focus our action, given the very limited human resources at our disposal, on getting right what we are trying to do already."
"In this context, the Commission has decided to focus ECHO's interventions based on a definition of the term ""humanitarian"" which is, in my judgement, generous and flexible but is not infinitely elastic."
"We believe it would be wrong to overload ECHO with an ever-growing number of tasks simply for reasons of administrative ease."
"Both Commissioner Nielson and I want to help countries and peoples in emergencies."
"But we also want to help them out of emergencies so that they can stand on their own feet again as quickly as possible."
"We will address this through country strategies which bring together the various types of assistance, emergency, developmental and so on, as quickly as it is feasible to do so."
"That in my view is the best kind of assistance and it is the wisest use of our taxpayers' money."
"Let me add that we do not intend to make ECHO into an operational department which delivers aid from contingency planning to distribution in the field."
"That is not, and never has been, where ECHO's strengths lie."
"Such an approach would be ineffective and it would detract from the many advantages of ECHO's partnership approach which allows it, as has been said, to make funds quickly available to those who need them most."
"The partnership approach also allows for real involvement of civil society at the outset of aid operations, and the value of that has been proven time and time again."
"We will continue to choose partners on the basis of their efficiency and the availability of partners for the task in hand and bearing in mind, of course, their different comparative strengths and the roles they can play."
"The NGO sector is an extremely important channel, but the United Nations and the Red Cross movement are also valued partners."
"Thanks to this mixed approach to partnership when necessary, we will be able to send specific messages to the different political fora."
"Mr Imbeni mentioned the important issue of visibility."
"That is important."
"We want Europe's voters and taxpayers to know what is being done with their money and in their name."
"We have planned a Eurobarometer survey to gauge the current levels of awareness of ECHO in Member States and on the basis of that survey, which of course we will want to discuss with the honourable Member and others, we will be able to develop appropriate ways of increasing the awareness to which the honourable Member referred."
"The humanitarian aid we give will continue to be governed by the principles of impartiality and non-discrimination laid down in our regulation and accepted by the humanitarian community worldwide."
"It is an element of our external identity demonstrating that Europe can act worldwide with one voice and that it can make a difference on the ground."
"As the biggest single source of humanitarian aid funding worldwide, as I said earlier, the European Union has a responsibility to be not just the biggest in terms of quantity but the best in terms of delivery."
"That is our clear and ambitious goal."
"I should like to end with just one reflection."
"I do not come entirely new to the debate on these issues."
"Over ten years ago I was the development minister in the country I know best, as we learn to say, and was responsible among other things for humanitarian assistance."
"What has most depressed me about the international scene over the years is that, in practice, our ability to deliver humanitarian relief rapidly in the most unpromising circumstances has increased a great deal more than our ability to prevent that humanitarian assistance being necessary in the first place."
"That raises serious political and environmental questions about issues such as humanitarian intervention which are going to dominate much of the foreign policy agenda in the years ahead."
"But in the meantime we must make what we do in terms of humanitarian aid more effective."
"The honourable Member's report will make a significant contribution to that ."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m.)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to welcome a group of municipal councillors from Malaga this morning."
"Our visitors include the wife and daughter of José María Martin Carpena, a Popular Party municipal councillor in Malaga, who was assassinated by ETA on 15 July."
"Ladies, allow me to say that your presence with us here today illustrates your courage in coping with this horrendous experience, which was made all the more painful by your witnessing this heinous murder."
"In all sincerity, I can do no more than offer you our deepest sympathy."
"Yesterday, as you know, this House paid its respects to the victims of terrorism in Spain and observed a minute' s silence in their memory."
"I would like you to know that you have the full support of the European Parliament in the fight to put an end to terrorism in Spain."
"Madam President, we once again have cause to regret the fact that, in Europe, there are still people who murder others because they think differently and who burn down the houses of their political opponents."
"There are people who force many others to emigrate in order to save their lives and the lives of their families."
"Faced with this, under the rule of law, we democrats can only unite to defend our system of freedom from the tyranny of terror and trust in judicial action."
"The most difficult thing is to explain to the widows and to the children who have been orphaned why their loved ones have been taken away."
"To you, Elvira, María José, we can only offer our deepest sympathy."
"Madam President, once again you have shown yourself, through your words today and yesterday, to be worthy of your duties as a representative and as a human being, and I thank you on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"In fact, in an emotional tribute, we have just applauded one of the victims, José María Martín Carpena, whose life has been taken simply for having committed the crime of living and working in a peaceful and democratic country."
"Every, or almost every, human being feels emotional and all democrats feel indignation, but I have a special reason to feel emotional in this case."
"For sixteen years I had the honour of being mayor of the city to which Martín Carpena dedicated his life and of presiding over the Council in which he worked."
"I understand very well what a great job all councillors do."
"In return for modest human, political and economic compensation, they give their time generously and dedicate their lives to the public good."
"That is how Martín Carpena won the affection of all the people of Malaga."
"Madam President, as you know, and as we saw yesterday, there are groups in the Basque Country who support terrorism."
"Using Nazi rhetoric, they propose ethnic and political objectives for territories, which are currently Spanish and French, which surpass the Albania of the sixties. They wage their campaigns in the countries of the European Union."
"I would like to remind Members that a political union based on democracy and human rights would not have allowed the terrorist totalitarianism of the 20s and 30s to emerge in Europe."
"Therefore, when all the social and communication institutions of Europe can react with the courage of this Parliament and when the fifteen different populations have the same attitude to ETA' s attacks, terrorism will be all but finished."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group then, Madam President, I would like to pay the warmest of tributes to the memory of Martín Carpena and also offer my best wishes to the family and colleagues of this murdered councillor."
"Madam President, the presence of the group of councillors from Malaga and, in particular, the presence of the widow of Martín Carpena can help us to regain that sense of hope which ETA wants to stamp out."
"I believe that their presence is without doubt something which will allow us to believe that the Basque people can regain its capacity for dialogue and can return to peace."
"It is clearly difficult for words to keep their value, despite the fact that we repeat them and that yesterday and today Parliament has adopted its position."
"It is important, however, that they continue to have value."
"The presence of these people must be reflected in our words and it is important that we speak out so that our words may be worthy of their courage and so that, in speaking and in adopting our position, we share their pain."
"The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party wishes to express its hope that peace may return to the Basque people."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European United Left, I would also like to pay tribute to councillor Martín Carpena and express my admiration and gratitude to him, his family, his wife, his friends and, through them, to all the families of those people who, in the course of their duties, have lost their lives to terrorism."
"I would like to say to his family and friends that his sacrifice has not been in vain and that they have been at the front line in the defence of democracy, through their bravery and courage, not only in the Basque Country and in Spain, but also in Europe."
"The front line of democracy must be defended democratically."
"We must bear in mind the enormous courage required in order, on behalf of the people, as representatives of the people, to defend democratic values every day, in at atmosphere of danger, coercion and threats."
"Not only have councillors been killed, but also members of the security forces and of democratic forces, social representatives, union representatives and businesspeople. It is particularly perverse, however, to kill, intimidate and pursue those individuals in whom the people have put their trust."
"There can be no greater contradiction."
"That is why all the political groups, in unison, are today reaffirming their commitment to the defence of democracy and thanking those friends and families of people like Martín Carpena for the example they set."
"This will commit us in the future to the fight for democracy and freedom."
"Please be assured that the sacrifice of Martín Carpena has not been in vain."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to echo your words of sympathy with, and admiration for, but especially of sympathy with, the relatives of Martin Carpena."
"Any assault within Europe involving innocent people is an assault on Europe itself, on its democratic values, on the belief that via democratic means, the necessary changes can yet be made in a peaceful and tolerant manner, thus enabling people to live happier lives in a structured society."
"I therefore hope that all countries will join forces even more emphatically than in the past in order to find these paths of peace and dialogue and that nobody will try to seek political gain from such attacks."
"Mrs Carpena, relatives, friends and people from Malaga, as well as people from so many other places where the death toll has risen to more than a thousand, we feel for you and we should more than anything like to see an end to these acts of terrorism This is why we are opposed to polarisation."
"We invite all those who seek peaceful change to gather around the negotiating table."
"The Middle East"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East."
"As you know, today' s debate is rather special because it will be immediately followed by addresses by the Speakers of the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council who are here in Strasbourg and will be joining us in the gallery shortly."
"I shall welcome them once they are here and, as you know, they will be making their official speeches to the House at 11.30 a.m."
"Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by following you, Madam President, and the Speakers from the groups, in expressing the sympathy and sorrow of the Council, which condemns terrorism."
"This is an issue which we addressed at our informal meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Evian on Saturday and Sunday."
"I in turn wish to assure the inhabitants of Malaga and Mr Carpena' s widow of the European Union' s intention to fight on their behalf against the scourge of terrorism, which represents a real threat to our democracies."
"You quite rightly decided, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to address the question of the situation in the Middle East."
"This decision was all the more timely given that this region, which has been the scene of a number of particularly striking events over recent months, is approaching what may prove to be an historical watershed."
"What we in fact face is a turning point for the people of the region: for the first time there is a real possibility of an end to half a century of conflict between Israel and Palestine; but there is also a risk, if this hope is dashed, of a resurgence of violence."
"The fact that the Speakers of the Knesset, Mr Avraham Burg and the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Ahmed Qurie, have agreed to come here together and address the European Parliament today at your invitation, Madam President, demonstrates the will for peace and dialogue which now drives both sides."
"I also see their, to my knowledge, unprecedented visit as a gesture of recognition of the European Union' s unceasing efforts to promote peace in the region, a recognition which is also accompanied by high expectations of Europe."
"We must live up to these expectations and this gesture, which I see as a sign of trust and hope, deserves to be welcomed."
"I shall now endeavour to explain our analysis of recent developments and of the current state in the region and future prospects of the peace process."
"We have witnessed a number of extremely important incidents in the Middle East over recent months, such as the Camp David summit and Israel' s withdrawal from southern Lebanon."
"The death of the Syrian president, Hafez El Assad, under whom Syria became an important player in the region, occurred at the same time."
"This rapid series of developments mainly concerns negotiations between Israel and Palestine."
"The accession to power in Israel of Ehud Barak, who was elected on a platform of peace, and Yasser Arafat' s unstinting determination to keep the dialogue alive allowed the peace negotiations to resume, thereby helping to resolve the stalemate which had dogged the peace process for several years."
"The Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed on 4 September 1999 marked the start of a new stage in the peace process and the end of a long period of deadlock, if not retreat."
"It specified how the clauses of the Wye River agreement, which had as yet still not been applied, were to be implemented."
"It set out a new timetable for concluding Permanent Status negotiations and granted a de facto extension to the one-year interim period by setting new deadlines, which are due to expire shortly, on 13 September 2000."
"As this deadline approaches, we are entitled to take initial, albeit provisional stock of the breakthrough in the peace process."
"My first comment is that it has been possible to implement the main provisions of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, even if somewhat belatedly in relation to the original timetable."
"The second redeployment was completed on 24 March 2000, i.e. just over two months after the original deadline."
"Several hundred prisoners have been released, although the overall outcome is still not completely satisfactory."
"Other provisions have not been properly implemented."
"For example, the third redeployment has not taken place."
"Only one of the two corridors planned between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank has in fact been opened."
"Land on the West Bank has continued to be colonised and expropriated, in violation of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, which prohibits any unilateral action designed to change the situation on the ground."
"These difficulties, together with the depressed economic and social climate, have done much to foster tension in the territories which, on several occasions, has degenerated into violence."
"As for Permanent Status negotiations, which were to follow an interim framework agreement, they stagnated long ago."
"The parties had departed so far from their initial positions as to give the impression that it was still too early to hope for a compromise. The recent Camp David summit was held in response to this situation and, even though it did not achieve the hoped-for agreement, it did open new prospects on all aspects of Permanent Status and, as such, cannot be considered a failure."
"On the contrary, it created new momentum."
"I for one am certain that this outcome, which seemed unthinkable just a few months ago, would not have been possible without the personal commitment of President Clinton and Mrs Albright."
"The progress achieved owes a great deal to their determination to bring the positions of both sides closer together and move the negotiations forward."
"It is, of course, also - and above all - due to the political courage and sense of responsibility and commitment to peace demonstrated by the President of the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Prime Minister."
"It was in fact the first time that they had debated all aspects of Permanent Status without any taboos and neither hesitated in advancing and relaxing the positions of principle which they had hitherto presented as non-negotiable."
"As we know, the discussions were broken off and, under the diplomatic rule which dictates that nothing is agreed unless everything is agreed, the progress achieved cannot be considered definitive in the absence of any overall agreement."
"Peace in the Middle East may be in sight, but that does not make it a fait accompli."
"The progress achieved at Camp David needs to be consolidated and final concessions are necessary, especially on the question of Jerusalem, refugees and, above all, the Holy Places."
"Camp David opened up new possibilities."
"We have no doubt that a solution can be found which takes account of the legitimate expectations of each party and the rest of the world, including for the Holy Places."
"We therefore have an historic opportunity and the current situation is still extremely auspicious."
"The Israeli Prime Minister, who was elected on a platform of peace, wants an agreement, and an agreement is just as much in his interests as it is in the interests of President Arafat, who has stood by his decision to become involved in the Oslo process."
"As for President Clinton, he is more resolved than ever to use all his influence and the influence of his country to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion before the end of his term of office, i.e. by the end of the year."
"This rather exceptional window of opportunity could, however, close again quickly and this is something we must guard against."
"The American elections are approaching, as is the new parliamentary term in Israel, and could prove to be a delicate issue."
"As for the deadline of 13 September set in the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement for concluding Permanent Status negotiations, it cannot be postponed indefinitely unless the negotiations show some tangible sign of progress and the prospect of an early outcome."
"This exceptional opportunity must not be wasted."
"If the hope raised by Camp David is to be made reality, the parties must, first and foremost, continue to be involved and to demonstrate the same commitment and will as they have shown hitherto."
"Their leaders must make difficult and courageous decisions and everything must therefore be done to encourage the parties to continue unwaveringly along the path which they have taken in a bid to conclude a global and final agreement."
"The European Union is prepared in this context to do whatever it can to guarantee that the efforts being made will be successful."
"There are several aspects to its role, which it intends to continue to play in an active and constructive manner: encouraging the parties, helping to find solutions, supporting the implementation of agreements."
"The Union never misses an opportunity to reiterate the importance of international legitimacy, its concern to see the United Nations resolutions applied, the basic principles which inform the peace process and its determination to encourage the parties to continue with the peace process through close, regular political dialogue with all the parties in the region."
"You yourself, Madam President, noted the extent to which European positions are listened to and anticipated, scrutinised, dissected and judged sometimes as too timid, sometimes, on the contrary, as too energetic or ill-timed but, on balance, always as constructive and balanced when you visited the Middle East at the beginning of the year."
"You also noticed how just how strong expectations of Europe still were."
"It was this concern to affirm the role of Europe and meet the parties' expectations which prevailed when a special European Union envoy was appointed back in 1996."
"Ambassador Moratinos - whom I greet and who has held this post for the last four years - has managed to give Europe a profile in the Middle East by cultivating daily contacts with all the leaders in the region."
"This role of supporting, facilitating and mediating, which complements that of the United States, is coupled with a contribution to the collective debate to find new ways forward, break certain taboos and propose compromises."
"The 1999 Berlin Declaration and the 1980 Venice Declaration are an expression of the remarkably unified views of the European partners and act as reference texts which have, I am sure, opened the way to historic compromises between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"Finally, Europe has developed a cooperation policy with all the countries in the Middle East in a bid to create the right conditions for harmonious economic and social development and, at the same time, strengthen regional integration, which is crucial if peace is to gain a permanent foothold."
"As a result, as you all know, Europe has underwritten nearly half the financial commitments to international aid to Palestine since 1993."
"It is, of course, and I should like to stress this point, prepared to help with the full implementation of the agreements that have been concluded when the time comes."
"It is still, without doubt, too early to discuss what an agreement on the Permanent Status of the Palestinian territories might look like; in any event, it will be solely up to the two sides to define this status through negotiation, which is the only admissible method."
"However, the Camp David discussions give us an initial idea of what the outlines of a future agreement may be."
"I should like to say in this context that, in our view, a Palestinian state will inevitably emerge, but it must be a viable, peaceful and democratic state."
"It is the natural concomitant of the Palestinians' indefeasible right to self-determination and I am convinced that it is also the best guarantee of security for Israel."
"This right to a state and, hence, to proclaim statehood must not be subject to any veto."
"However, as the European Union has already stated, it would obviously prefer a Palestinian state to emerge from a completed process of negotiation."
"But, as you know, it does not stipulate that this is a condition."
"Its position on this question is as stated in the Berlin declaration of March 1999."
"But all the efforts planned at the present stage, starting of course with the efforts made by both sides, must be geared towards concluding an agreement, an agreement which is, let me repeat, within arm' s reach."
"As you may have noticed, even the Palestinians are now questioning the advisability, the conditions and, most importantly, the timing of their proclamation of statehood in the light of current developments."
"The exchange of views between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Fifteen during the recent informal meeting in Evian, which I referred to earlier confirmed that the European approach in support of the peace process hitherto is the right one."
"The urgent need for a decisive breakthrough on the Israeli-Palestinian front should not, however, distract us from the other aspects of the peace process, and it is this that forms a coherent global issue to which a universal, lasting settlement must be found."
"An Israeli-Palestinian agreement is indispensable."
"It is vital but it alone cannot guarantee peace and stability in the Middle East."
"In addition, it is time, as the President of the French Republic recently stressed, for Syria and Israel to return to the negotiating table, given that the present status quo is in the interests of neither country."
"Every effort should therefore be made, as quickly as possible, to broker an agreement between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon."
"In this respect, there are prospects despite the contrasts in the present situation."
"Israel' s withdrawal from southern Lebanon on 24 May of this year put an end to 22 years of occupation and, as a result, 're-dealt the cards' , as it were."
"This withdrawal, which was certified by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 16 June, is a positive factor on more than one count."
"First, it marks the implementation, the belated but full and unconditional implementation of Security Council Resolution 425 and therefore represents undeniable progress in this respect."
"It went through under less inauspicious conditions than might have been feared and, more to the point, was not accompanied by the dreaded outbreaks of fresh violence."
"We really must highlight the sense of responsibility which both sides demonstrated here."
"So far, the difficulties have been overcome and it has been possible to implement the provisions of Resolution 425."
"The question of Israeli incursions along the blue line was settled after two months of wrangling."
"On 27 July, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1310 extending the UNIFIL mandate for a further six months."
"On 5 August, the Lebanese Government agreed for the force to be redeployed in the former occupied zone and, since then, UNIFIL has set up a number of permanent posts in the zone and taken up its position along the Israeli-Lebanese border."
"At the same time, the Lebanese Government went ahead on 9 August and deployed a mixed force of 1 000 men, 500 soldiers and 500 policemen in the former occupied zone whose mission is to maintain public order within Lebanon itself, but not to engage in any kind of border surveillance, despite its responsibility to do so."
"The redeployment of UNIFIL and the Lebanese Government' s dispatch of a mixed security force to the south are, in our view, positive developments."
"The situation along the border with Israel is, however, still volatile."
"Incidents flare up along the blue line blue from time to time but have been relatively minor so far."
"It is therefore in the interest of all the parties to avoid any incident which might provoke an escalation."
"The Lebanese Government therefore needs to accept all its responsibilities here in order to create the conditions needed so that UNIFIL can exercise its mandate in full."
"The situation in southern Lebanon can only be stabilised if this region, which has suffered enormously from the occupation and the war, is rehabilitated and reintegrated into Lebanon' s economic and social fabric."
"The European Union is of course more than ready to help reconstruct southern Lebanon as soon as conditions on the ground allow."
"It intends to give very precise expression to its aid to Lebanon at the donors' conference for the reconstruction of southern Lebanon which is scheduled for the autumn under our presidency."
"Here too, the withdrawal of Israel from southern Lebanon and the gradual restoration of Lebanese sovereignty in the area are steps in the right direction."
"In addition, the changes taking place in the region give cause, we hope, to anticipate a gradual change in relations between Syria and Lebanon; here too the situation is no less volatile and we are convinced that only an Israeli-Syrian agreement, in application of Security Council Resolution 242 and the principle of land for peace, will allow fair and lasting peace to be established in the region."
"We must admit that circumstances do not appear to augur well for the resumption of negotiations between Israel and Syria, at least not in the short term."
"The positions of the two sides, which we are all aware of, are still irreconcilable at this stage, even if the gulf between them does not appear as wide as on numerous aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"In addition, the internal agendas of the Israeli and Syrian leaders appear for the time being to be monopolised by other political preoccupations, although the strategic choice of both sides is for peace, as was recently reaffirmed at the highest level."
"During his investiture address on 7 July, President Bashar al-Assad indicated that he was anxious to conclude an agreement with Israel, reiterating that everything was negotiable except the line of 4 June 1967."
"Ehud Barak, for his part, called on Syria to conclude what he called a 'peace of the brave' , an expression with which we concur."
"There is therefore cause to hope that they will return to the negotiating table during the months to come."
"My reading is that recent developments in the region are not linked solely to developments in the peace process, even if it does play a vital part."
"Although still inadequate, regional integration is progressing slowly but surely."
"It comes first and foremost within the wider context of the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean process, which is an expression of the European Union' s wish to develop a global strategy for this region which is so close to and so inextricably bound up with us."
"A free trade area is being set up with the Union, to include all the countries of the Middle East and should - in fact we are sure that it will - help these economies to liberalise and modernise and integrate into the world economy."
"Association agreements have already been signed with Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority and an agreement should soon be signed with Egypt."
"Negotiations are under way with both Lebanon and Syria."
"There is no doubt that, in its political dimension, the Euro-Mediterranean process, with the draft charter for peace and stability, not only economic but also social and human stability, will help to construct the 'post-peace' Middle East, the Middle East which we all wish for, because there is no alternative to the peace process which has now entered what we hope and believe to be a decisive stage."
"Europe has followed the lead of the rest of the international community, especially the United States - and I shall end here Madam President - and intends to do everything to facilitate the decisions incumbent upon the main players, i.e. the Israelis and the Palestinians, who are answerable to their people and to posterity, and to foster the emergence of peace, a peace which we have waited so long for, wished for so hard and which is now within our grasp."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by associating the Commission wholeheartedly with the moving remarks that you made yesterday about terrorism and about the courage of those who have been martyred for democracy and also with the remarks made this morning by Members of this House."
"I should also like to say what an honour it is to discuss the question of a peace settlement in the Middle East in the presence of some of those who have it in their hands to bring about this historic development."
"Naturally I very much agree with what the President-in-office has just said."
"I do not intend to repeat all his arguments save, perhaps, to make one or two personal reflections on some of the comments the President-in-office has made and to add one or two other points, principally on economic issues."
"The Camp David summit, whilst it did not manage to achieve a final settlement, did, as the President-in-office said, mark enormous progress."
"I am sure we would all want to pay tribute to the skilful and persistent diplomacy of President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright."
"Camp David helped to narrow the gaps between the parties to the dispute."
"It helped to address and indeed to remove some long-standing taboos, for example, on the intensely difficult historical issues surrounding the status of Jerusalem."
"Having travelled as far as that, it would obviously be a tragedy if the opportunity for peace that now exists more than ever before were to be wasted."
"We stand ready, as the President-in-office has indicated, to help move things forward in any way we can and we are ready to do what we can to secure a settlement."
"It is a great pleasure to see our own representative, who has done so much to ensure that the European Union's presence in the region is felt."
"With time moving relentlessly on, there has inevitably been a growing amount of talk about Palestinian statehood."
"The Berlin European Council Declaration remains the position of the European Union."
"President Arafat has received wise advice to postpone the planned declaration of an independent Palestinian state on 13 September."
"I want to repeat what was said in the Berlin European Council Declaration last March, that the European Union is convinced that the creation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of existing agreements and through negotiations would be the best guarantee of Israel's security and Israel's acceptance as an equal partner in the region."
"That is our position."
"As far as Syria is concerned, everyone recognises that President Bashar al-Assad needs to consolidate his position."
"However, here too the differences with Israel are narrow and we think they could be bridged."
"We will continue to do all we can to achieve this."
"We have a key role to play in Syria in terms of actively encouraging economic reform and modernisation in the interests of Syria and in the interests of regional stability."
"I had an extremely good visit to Syria, albeit too brief, earlier in the year, at which we significantly moved forward our dialogue on economic issues and on the assistance we can provide. We want to respond to further requests from Syria for assistance in the reform process."
"We will also be prepared to support strengthening of the rule of law, human rights issues and political pluralism."
"As far as South Lebanon is concerned, there remains an enormous amount for Europe to do, not least as part of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"The European Union will assist with the reconstruction of southern Lebanon as soon as the Commission conditions permit."
"The Lebanese Government must maintain order in the south and in addition it must translate its generic aid requests into concrete and realistic proposals."
"We will outline our strategies as soon as these conditions are met and, as many Members know, we have had an assessment mission in the area to see exactly what we can do on the ground as soon as possible."
"It will not surprise the House to know that we intend to work in areas like mine clearance where we have so much experience, areas which are vital to the restoration of normal economic life and decent social conditions in South Lebanon."
"At the same time as we are preparing for a possible role in implementing any peace agreement, we are also focusing on the regional scenario after a peace settlement."
"When conflict is a thing of the past, it is important to recognise that a peace settlement would transform everybody's prospects."
"Sustained economic growth and economic stability are the keys to regional peace and consolidation of that peace in the years ahead."
"People are more likely to support peace if they feel that their living conditions are improving."
"However, at present, economic growth is stagnant, and unemployment is distressingly high, over 15 to 20% overall."
"Disparities are growing both within the region and, as was said in the debate that we had yesterday on MEDA, between the region and the European Union."
"In addition, the regional labour market will come under strong pressure because of high population growth resulting from the welcome incorporation of more women into the labour market and the future integration of Palestinian refugees into the economies of the region."
"Regional prosperity, therefore, depends on serious efforts to promote economic growth."
"Private investment will play a central role in that, but public investment will continue to be important, especially regarding economic transition, including harmonisation, internal liberalisation and regional cooperation, stabilisation and regional infrastructures."
"I referred to the interesting debate that we had yesterday evening on MEDA and our attempts to speed up and simplify the regulation so that we can deliver our assistance in the region much more rapidly."
"It is important to remember what the scale of that assistance is."
"The European Union as a whole, the Commission, Member States, and the EIB, are responsible for about 50% of all the economic assistance in the region."
"The Commission and the EIB are responsible for about half of that 50%, so we are responsible for about 25%."
"Over the last few years our assistance in the region has been averaging about EUR 800 million, that is from the Commission and the EIB, about EUR 450 million from the Commission and the rest from the EIB."
"That is a substantial investment in the future prosperity and well-being of the region, but I am still seeking to ensure that the resources available are spent more effectively and more rapidly."
"I said yesterday that the Commission would be holding discussions this week, and I hope it is not presuming on its collective wisdom to say that we will be able to publish our proposals later this week."
"We are discussing a Commission communication on the revitalisation of the Barcelona process, which everybody recognises to be extremely important."
"In that document we will be stressing the vital significance of greater regional cooperation and more trade and cooperation between the countries to the south and not just between Europe and the countries of the South."
"I hope that the document and its implementation will help to consolidate political developments in the region."
"I repeat: this is clearly a historic opportunity to secure a peace that would bring prosperity as well as stability to our neighbours to the south."
"We stand ready to help them in every way we can, politically and economically."
"We stand ready to help them both to achieve peace and to build on the foundations that a peace settlement would lay."
"Madam President, since the creation of the State of Israel, we have surely never been so close to a lasting and stable peace agreement in the Middle East."
"The differences between the parties, however, have probably never been so profound."
"The withdrawal of the Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, the will demonstrated by the new Syrian President and the clear progress made at Camp David - as has been mentioned here this morning - seem to offer us a panorama in which peace is actually within reach."
"However, there are still potential pitfalls, which remind us that, we are as close to taking advantage of this historic opportunity as we are to the black storm clouds that will descend upon the region should the negotiations fail."
"What we can we in the European Union do?"
"Of course we offer our services by means of the European Union' s special envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, whom I welcome."
"We undoubtedly offer a guarantee in terms of the future economic development of the region, which would no doubt result from the peace agreement, through our cooperation and investment, as Commissioner Patten has correctly reminded us."
"We encourage the opposing parties to persist courageously with the negotiations, ignoring the most pessimistic, sometimes threatening, voices, which sometimes emerge from their respective countries."
"We are grateful for the summary of the facts, the information communicated to us this morning by the Council and the Commission, and their good will."
"However, we should ask ourselves whether this is worthy of the responsibility and aspirations of the European Union on an international level."
"To speak with one voice, to aspire to a leading role not only economically but also, surely, politically, demands more of us."
"No group is offering greater support than the European People' s Party to the governments promoting the peace process, especially to the United States. No group is forcing itself to act with greater prudence than we are at this critical moment."
"From this point of view we propose that next year, when we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Conference which gave rise to this peace process, the European Union should once again bring together, in a repeat of the Madrid meeting, the leaders who participated in that Conference."
"Meanwhile, we should reaffirm the European Union' s full commitment to the peace process and our willingness to honour our historic, economic and also political responsibilities in the region."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like, on behalf of my group, to welcome the President of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, and the President of the Palestinian National Council, Mr Abu Ala, who are present in the gallery, and whose interventions we will listen to with great attention."
"The presence of these two distinguished persons indicates that the peace process is not purely a process taking place between governments."
"It is a process taking place between peoples and between parliaments, which democratically represent those peoples."
"I would ask the two Presidents to deliver a message to their people: they have come here and they have seen how the representatives of peoples who have been age-old enemies and who have waged war for centuries, can work together and in peace, and can share values."
"I believe that this is the fundamental message we can offer you."
"I would also like to point out that, as well as the effort being made in terms of negotiations between the governments, which we must support, my political family, the Socialist International, is also trying to support and promote this process because both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders belong to our family and we feel profoundly committed to them."
"We agree with the exhaustive analysis of the situation made by the President of the Council and I would simply like to repeat the message, to our friends from the Middle East, that we are committed to the peace process and to its development since the Sharm-el-Sheikh agreements, which led to the last major debate in the European Parliament."
"We are approaching a deadline."
"We Europeans understand the importance of deadlines and the need to pull out all the stops when deadlines approach, but we believe that the important thing at the moment is for both parties to persevere."
"We welcome the efforts of President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright."
"We consider ourselves to be committed to this process, and we welcome the presence here today of that tireless pilgrim of peace, Ambassador Moratinos."
"Above all, I believe that we should point out the importance of what is at stake at the moment because, until now, there had been no real negotiation of the situation of the Palestinian refugees since 1948, the continuation of the Israeli settlements and the establishment of definitive borders."
"Those are the very important and thorny issues which must be dealt with."
"Another very important issue is the status of Jerusalem, which requires a compromise."
"It is not only a political problem. It is a cultural, historical and religious problem."
"Therefore, there is no room for a solution based on exclusive claims."
"As some experts have said, on religious issues there are no half measures, but, if we are talking about the religions of the Book, which preach the love of God and our fellow man, it must be possible to find a solution between people."
"Where Holy Places are concerned, there is no room for solutions based solely on sovereign rights and it is very important to take proper account of the various international formulae: I believe that the mediation of certain Arab countries, who are closely involved, may be of help."
"Lastly, Madam President, I believe that, from the point of view of European Union action, we must try to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean process, bring Syria out of its isolation, strengthen the process in the whole of the region and, above all, send a message to the Middle East which indicates that the European Union, as a union of age-old enemies, wishes to participate fully in the creation of a shared peaceful future in the Middle East."
"Madam President, for lack of time, I shall merely focus on the relations between Israel and the Palestinians."
"We all very much regret that the Camp David negotiations came to nothing."
"This was most probably down to the fact that the time was not quite ripe for an agreement, as a result of which the gap between both parties could not be narrowed or could not be narrowed sufficiently at any rate."
"We live in the hope, however, that a new foundation will be laid after a period of contemplation and reflection, so that we can pick up the peace process once again and herald a new era."
"Indeed, we now have to ensure that the negotiations are resumed as quickly as possible."
"Needless to say, the international community needs to lend a helping hand, together with the Arab States and the Muslim community."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, we hope that it will speak with one voice and assume a more pro-active role - and I particularly refer to a more pro-active role in the political field - and will thus contribute to the peace process."
"The EU owes this much to both parties and to the international community."
"It is evident that, meanwhile, unilateral action from either side is to be discouraged, as this could well harm future negotiations."
"We cannot tolerate violence in any form."
"The negotiations must be resumed by means of an open, direct and genuine dialogue, and Europe has a major part to play in this!"
"Madam President, I have been present in Jerusalem as a provisional member of Parliament' s delegation for relations with Israel."
"We met reasonable representatives of the Israeli Government but also, among the members of the Knesset, a dismaying number of implacable fanatics who maintain that Israel has all the rights and the Palestinians none at all."
"It was therefore good that the Council' s representatives made it clear that the EU backs all current UN decisions."
"What, then, do these decisions imply?"
"Well, they say that there should be Jewish and Palestinian States in the area, that the whole of Jerusalem should be an international area, that all Palestinian refugees should be allowed to return home and that Israel should leave those areas which it has occupied."
"It may therefore be noted that Israel is right in one respect, namely that there is to be a Jewish State."
"That is what no-one now questions but, when it comes to all the important questions in the peace negotiations - that is to say, Jerusalem, the refugees and territorial considerations - the Palestinians in fact have international law on their side."
"At the same time, everyone appreciates that the UN decisions cannot directly be implemented by peaceful means."
"Israel is opposed to this."
"The Palestinians are prepared to compromise."
"They are not demanding west Jerusalem."
"They appreciate that Israel cannot receive between five and six million Palestinian refugees."
"The Palestinians are prepared to make concessions over territory."
"They are making concessions, which is splendid and necessary, but the Palestinians and Arafat cannot make large concessions of any kind without a revolt in their own ranks."
"It is therefore important that the EU should stick by the Berlin decision to recognise a Palestinian State without conditions as soon as the Palestinians see fit to declare such a State, to which they are entitled."
"Israel has the military power and US backing."
"The Palestinians do in fact have international law on their side."
"Let them also have the European Union' s full support, in the same way and to the same degree that the United States supports Israel."
"Let the EU act as a sponsor for the Palestinian State, that is to say the democratic Palestinian State."
"This would also raise the EU' s standing in the world."
"Madam President, my group asked for a major debate on the situation in the Middle East to be included in this part-session."
"It also suggested that high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian leaders be invited jointly to the European Parliament."
"We are therefore delighted by the initiatives taken in this direction and warmly welcome the speakers of the two assemblies who have honoured us with their presence."
"At a time which everyone senses is decisive, what useful message can we Europeans send out to the peace process today?"
"I tend to agree with what the President-in-Office said on the subject."
"The first message, to my mind, concerns the issue around which the entire process turns, i.e. the Palestinian State."
"I think the time is right to clearly reiterate the terms of the unequivocal declaration adopted by the Berlin European Council in March 1999, in which the Fifteen stated that they were ready to recognise a Palestinian State."
"Did Europe' s recognition of this inalienable right lead the Palestinians to proclaim statehood without further ado?"
"On the contrary."
"It fostered the sovereign and responsible decision on the part of the Palestinian leadership to postpone the deadline and I am convinced that it is prepared to postpone it by a few more weeks to give negotiation a chance if it feels, between now and 13 September, that we are on the brink of an overall peace agreement."
"So let the European Union clearly reaffirm the position which it took in Berlin and encourage the Palestinians to make precisely this gesture."
"In the same spirit, Europe' s second message, in my view, should consist of a reminder of the basic principles from which negotiations can and should develop, i.e. the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, especially those relating to the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, or the right of refugees to return or receive compensation."
"This sort of reminder would not in any way close the door to the compromises needed."
"On the contrary, it would make the sovereign Palestinians responsible for seeking original, mutually acceptable legal formulae, together with the sovereign Israeli negotiators, on the basis of the principles recognised by the entire international community."
"I think that Europe' s third message should contain a guarantee that the future global agreement will be implemented to the end, unlike - alas - all the partial agreements which have succeeded each other since Oslo."
"The United States alone cannot provide this guarantee."
"No one today knows the intentions of the future leaders of the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"The European Union is therefore a unique guarantor, alongside the United States and Egypt, as the representative of the Arab world, that the commitments made will be honoured faithfully and to the letter."
"These are the three wishes of my group with the hope that, as a result, Yerushalaim, which means in Hebrew: peace will appear."
"Madam President, thank you very much indeed for arranging this very important debate at this particular time."
"I also wish to warmly welcome to our Parliament the Speaker of the Knesset, Mr Avraham Burg, and the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Ahmed Qurie."
"Like many people, I too, Madam President, was disappointed that the recent Middle East peace talks in Camp David did not culminate in a peace settlement between the Palestinians and the Israeli Government."
"However, I do not believe that these peace talks were a complete failure either."
"We should fully recognise that the Palestinians and the Israeli Government are now negotiating on bottom line issues, including the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian State, the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees."
"I very much hope that the Middle East will resume peace talks in the near future."
"I appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to lay down a negotiated settlement based on existing agreements."
"Permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999."
"It was always going to take time to tease through what were very difficult, delicate and sensitive political matters."
"EU Heads of State have affirmed on a number of occasions that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people both collectively and individually must always be protected."
"I support the principle of exchanging land for peace and the continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination."
"I believe that the best way to address this latter issue is through negotiation."
"I am calling on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership to take the necessary steps to re-establish mutual confidence, accept the need to make concessions and focus on the overriding goal of achieving lasting peace and stability in the region."
"The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are not the only matter up for discussion within the Middle East."
"It is important that negotiations between Israel and Syria should resume quickly and that the Lebanese track of the Middle East peace process should also be addressed."
"In this latter regard, I welcome the fact that since the Israeli forces left southern Lebanon, the region has been very peaceful."
"There has been peaceful progress on the Lebanese-Israeli border since the Lebanese Government gained authority within the region, and we all must certainly welcome the fact that southern Lebanon is now at peace."
"In the overall context, securing peace in the Middle East is always going to take time."
"The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the Camp David peace treaty in 1979."
"It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way with the Madrid conference, which enshrined the land for peace principle."
"We can all take solace from the fact that the key protagonists in this difficult political equation are now addressing the most vexed and thorny bottom line issues that have to be resolved if a permanent peace agreement is to be put in place in the Middle East."
"Madam President, I have very mixed feelings about the peace talks that have been broken down at Camp David."
"In any case, the extreme time pressure which the participants were under did not serve any immediate purpose."
"In fact, I wonder what use this ""diplomatic pressure cooker"" approach has in terms of the final stage of the peace process in the Middle East?"
"It is a tough peace process that needs to provide a lasting solution to the lengthy and complex conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians and between the Israelis and Arabs respectively."
"Public opinions on the Israeli and Palestinian sides - invisible yet very tangible - were also very much a player within Camp David."
"It is exactly because of this key factor on the home front that third parties, whether they are referred to as peace brokers, such as President Clinton, or very committed subsidiary parties to the peace process, such as the European Union, need to guard against exercising excessive pressure in the shape of a punishing time schedule."
"Is there not a task here for the EU, namely to urge all parties involved to keep the so-called ""windows of opportunity"" open for as long as possible?"
"However, my mixed feelings about the failure of Camp David are mainly generated by the uncompromising attitude adopted by the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Yasser Arafat, and the enthusiastic response he received to this at home."
"The home front hailed him in the Gaza Strip as the 'Palestinian Saladin' , complete with flags and banners."
"In popular speech, Arafat has inherited this dubious Arab title of honour from Saddam Hussein."
"It is exactly this Palestinian homage after Camp David 2000 which shocked Amos Oz, a recognised Israeli champion of peace and noted author."
"He put his bleak state of mind into words this summer in a probing newspaper article. ""I am sitting in my front room in front of the television and am watching the tremendous reception which Yasser Arafat is being given in Gaza just because he said 'no' to peace with Israel."
"I watch in silence and amazement and I am reminded that the real Saladin made a solemn pledge to the Arabs never to make a pact with non-believers."
"He would kill them en masse and throw them into the sea."
"I can see Arafat in his grey-green military outfit."
"An Arafat, dressed as Che Guevara and greeted as a Saladin: it breaks my heart"" ."
"The author moved on to a crucial topic within the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiation: ""the right to return"" ."
"Earlier this week, Arafat reiterated this Palestinian political claim in the context of the meeting of the Arab League in Cairo: ""We will not accept an agreement without obtaining all the rights we are entitled to pursuant to international resolutions"" ."
"So this includes UN Resolution 194 which stipulates the right to return on the part of Palestinian refugees."
"Madam President, I am also keen to give you Amos Oz' view of this increasingly poignant historical burden."
"In his opinion, this ""right to return"" is nothing more than an ""Arab euphemism"" for the liquidation of Israel."
"In the same breath, Oz adds that he is more than happy to grant the Palestinians the ""right to their free and independent Palestine"" but that this should not be at the expense of the existence of the Jewish State."
"This is a view which will hopefully give Western politicians food for thought."
"In the foregoing, my aim was certainly not to trivialise the suffering of the Palestinian people."
"I wish them a life in peace and freedom with all my heart."
"However, this peace and freedom cannot be brought about if it is at the expense of other peoples' safety."
"Madam President, as a representative of a Christian political party, I am not an unquestioning defender of Israel' s political interests."
"This is a task which Israel' s leaders and citizens are more than capable of handling themselves."
"In accordance with the Bible, God' s word, I consider the Jews as His chosen people, upon which lies the divine duty to be a ""beacon for all peoples"" ."
"Only in religious compliance with this requirement is a true Israeli-Palestinian settlement possible, on the basis of justice from Above."
"Madam President, Europe has a special historical responsibility for the peace process in the Middle East."
"This means proceeding with great sensitivity and not taking a schoolmasterly line or apportioning blame to one side alone."
"The fact that the Foreign Minister himself responded to the last peace negotiations by stepping down, serves as a reminder to us that above all in Israel, which is the stable democracy in the region, every step taken by the politicians must have the backing of the majority of the Israeli people."
"Nevertheless, we would do well not to forget that for all the fine words uttered, the crucial negotiations for peace in the Middle East take place in the USA and not in Europe."
"Perhaps those EU politicians whose brief it is, have so far been unable to find the right way to act as genuinely neutral and productive mediators in this conflict."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, this is not the first time that the House has concluded that the situation in the Middle East is critical."
"It is critical both for the Middle East itself and for the European Union because, apart from all the important issues which the peace process encompasses, it represents a new challenge for the common European foreign policy."
"In other words, the European Union must play a more active, more systematic and more intensive role in projects in the region and, of course, in the peace process."
"There are precedents for this."
"Let us not forget that the highly important UN Resolution 242 was devised mainly by Europe."
"So, to pick up on something very important which Mr Patten said, peace is not enough, we also need to monitor what happens, to see what the scenario is once an agreement has been reached, I think that the European Union should review its presence and involvement in the region."
"Thus, as well as the special envoy, I think that the time has come for the European Union to set up a task force consisting of representatives from the Commission, the Council and, yes why not, the European Parliament - after all we have two eminent parliamentary representatives from countries in the region here today - to work out detailed proposals and positions on specific issues being addressed during the current peace process and on any issues which we need to bear in mind in the period following the agreement."
"Mr President, I too would like to welcome the Speaker of the Knesset, Mr Burg, and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Abu Ala."
"I feel that this debate, from the Council statement to the speeches made by Mr Moscovici and Commissioner Patten and the majority of the other speeches, has shown that Europe is of one mind regarding this extremely sensitive period following Camp David."
"I am sure that we all see that phase, or in any case a change in the situation as very important, and I am sure that the situation has not been compromised, although we realise that, if change does not come about, there is currently a serious risk on both sides that the extremist tendencies present in the two camps may prevail."
"My opinion is that if we analyse the situation in the region thoroughly - and we have, indeed, talked about the withdrawal of Israel from the Lebanon, the situation in southern Lebanon and developments in Syria - we find that we are in agreement on this matter as well: I feel that this debate is evidence of the convergence of our views - of the agreement of Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the matter - and that Europe has already made a contribution."
"The quality of its performance is debatable, but Ambassador Moratinos' role in the region and the Council resolutions have certainly been effective."
"I have to give credit to Commissioner Patten, for his presence in the area and also in Syria - we were able to go to Syria when his mission was finished - had a lasting influence on the development of the situation in Syria."
"We can draw encouragement from all this and from the continuing work of the Clinton government on this initiative."
"Nevertheless, I do feel that, today, without professing to be telling anybody what to do and in respect for the two interlocutors and their positions, we should be asking ourselves what we can contribute."
"I would like to end by suggesting that we could use regional cooperation as a solution to make a European contribution right now before the peace process comes to an end."
"Mr President, will the United Nations Millennium Summit which took place this week be the last chance summit?"
"I see it rather as yet one more chance for peace in the Middle East."
"Six weeks after talks broke down at Camp David, Bill Clinton is due to meet Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat in New York tomorrow, after a month of intensive, albeit less media-attracting negotiation."
"So hope of saving the peace process is not lost, even if it means setting aside the original timetable and, hence, avoiding at all costs any unilateral provocation which would ruin months of effort."
"Everyone has his or her own interpretation of the outcome of Camp David and of the responsibilities incumbent upon either side."
"Discussions have certainly never progressed this far before."
"The gulf is still wide, although certain historical taboos have been broken."
"But that is not enough."
"We must now accept in our hearts what our heads have known and been dictating for a long time."
"This is the price for peace."
"To rely on the strength of symbols, on either side, is to hold on to a myth."
"As for Europe, which intends to support the process, not to take sides, it hopes to be more, much more, than the region' s banker."
"It is our historical and moral duty as well as our desire to become a full political partner very quickly, tomorrow if possible, and the simultaneous presence here of Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset, and Ahmed Qurie, the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, both of whom I welcome, cannot but augur well in this respect."
"Mr President, I arrived back yesterday from Palestine and Israel, where over a thousand Italians - representatives of district, provincial and regional councils - have been spending a week building peace bridges between Palestinians and Israelis and setting up projects for cooperation with the Palestinian people."
"Jerusalem is at the centre of the conflict, and it is one of the key factors in the peace process."
"For the Palestinians it is a town to be shared with East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State and West Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel."
"For the Israelis, before Camp David, no part of Jerusalem could be touched."
"Now the taboo has been broken."
"Yet the Israeli negotiators are still extremely uncompromising, for the problem is not that the Palestinians do not want to make concessions but that they have the right to the return of the territories occupied in 1967 which is enshrined in the UN resolutions."
"Since 1993, Jerusalem has been a closed city for the Palestinians."
"As Commissioner Patten said, the Israeli Government has many times failed in its obligations following the Oslo negotiations: they have not adhered to the timetable laid down in the agreements for the withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories."
"For the Palestinians, the divided territories are a nightmare."
"There is no free movement and over a thousand prisoners arrested before 1993 have been held in prison as if they were hostages."
"Their imprisonment is a constant threat to the peace process."
"However, a genuine tragedy for the peace process and the future of the Palestinian State is the continued increase in Israeli settlements: under the Barak Government, over 41 000 settlers moved into in the occupied territories."
"And I, together with the thousand Italians, saw these settlements expanding all over the place."
"This is a genuine crime against peace, but also against the environment and nature: just one example is the mountain of Jellab Edumin, a green hill outside Jerusalem which has been destroyed by bulldozers."
"Another key factor are the refugees: they are not merchandise but human beings who want to realise their right or their dream to live in their own land or see it once again."
"It is makes no sense for them not to be able to go back: Palestinians, who were born there, are not even allowed to visit it."
"Peace is necessary."
"It is on everyone's lips, but peace can only be achieved if each person is allowed to exercise his right of citizenship in his own free State."
"As Europeans, we must make every possible endeavour - over and above the economic efforts which we are already making, we must increase our political role - to ensure that the law prevails and that the Palestinians are able to live in their democratic State, which we must recognise as we recognise the Israeli State, so that Jerusalem becomes an open city, a city of the world, the capital city of two peoples and two States."
"I fully endorse the statements by the President-in-Office and Commissioner Patten."
"I cannot understand how they have ignored in their contribution the conditions in which the people of Iraq now find themselves."
"The reasons for this are twofold: the continued dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and his oppression of Iraq's citizens and the continued imposition of sanctions of the most Draconian kind."
"The war has always been about controlling oil and in my view little or nothing to do with Kuwait."
"As for weapons of mass destruction, I agree that somebody like Saddam Hussein should not have control of them, but there are others in the region who should not either."
"Look around the Middle East, and indeed the rest of the world, and what confronts us is an array of weapons of mass destruction, mostly supplied by the developed world, including the European Union."
"The market in weapons is now so competitive that some of the most horrific despots are getting bargain basement deals for weapons of mass destruction."
"It is a lesson to the Middle East that it is unwise to nationalise the oil industry."
"It must be asked where did Saddam Hussein get the weapons from before the Gulf War and where is he supposed to be getting them from now?"
"I suggest that we should consider appointing a political envoy from the European Union to Iraq to see if we can broker some sort of peace, between the United Nations and Iraq, because the sanctions are genocidal in their effect."
"Mr Moscovici, Commissioner Patten, I also would like to be associated with the words of welcome to our honoured guests, Mr Ahmed Qurie and Mr Avraham Burg."
"It is understandable that Palestinians feel that right would have been on their side in formerly declaring an independent Palestinian state on 13 September."
"They believe that the Oslo negotiations and the various Camp David discussions would have conferred legitimacy on such a step."
"However, it has to be recognised that even if negotiations had progressed so far that the declaration of statehood was non-controversial, the future of Jerusalem was always going to re-ignite controversy once again."
"Jerusalem is the key issue and it needs to be looked at in a new light."
"It is a unique problem which requires a unique response."
"Jerusalem should not be regarded as an Arab city or a Jewish city, a Christian city or a Muslim city."
"Progress will only be made if it is agreed that it is a truly international city to which all traditions have a valid claim."
"The governance of this historic city must be removed from any nationalistic or sectarian, in the best sense of that word, spirit and this governance must provide for equal access and rule for all."
"Just as we were delighted to remove Berlin walls in Europe, we do not want to see similar walls erected in Jerusalem."
"People from the furthest ends of the Earth have an affinity with Jerusalem and this must be recognised and honoured and not overlooked in the current negotiations."
"With these few words, I would like to wish the discussions, if they do take place, all success and genuinely hope that they lay the basis for permanent peace in the Middle East."
"Mr President, as far as the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is concerned, I have always counted myself among those in the House who say that it is up to the people of the region and their leaders to define the terms of their peaceful coexistence, just as it is up to them to make the efforts and sacrifices needed on both sides in order to do so."
"As a European, I set great store by the Euro-Mediterranean balance and if, like many others, I have somewhat regretted the European Union' s lack of political clout in this process, I have likewise always refused to sit here in Parliament and play at being teacher, to coin a phrase."
"Today, just a few days away from a peace agreement or a major crisis which could erupt in dramatic scenes of violence, we must give peace every chance to succeed by helping those on both sides who are taking huge collective and individual risks to bring about peace."
"That is why I am in total agreement with the position stated by Pierre Moscovici and what I would say today is that we shall not help to bring about peace by taking sides in the debate and in the difficult negotiations under way."
"As I see it, therefore, in the short time left to us, our message to the Israelis and Palestinians should be simple and straightforward."
"It can be summarised in three points: we want a peace agreement in the Middle East, we shall support and guarantee a peace agreement once it has been signed and we shall use every possible means, including but not only financial means, to help ensure that it is implemented."
"To conclude, we know full well that peace is always a difficult process."
"Europe, torn apart over the centuries, knows that better than most."
"Overcoming divisions and eradicating terrorism is easier to talk about than to achieve as we know only too well from the Balkans, the division of Nicosia and the bombs in the Basque country."
"And yet, peace is the only way forward, as the Israeli-Palestinian negotiators are well aware."
"So all we can say is, good luck, agree to peace and we shall be at your side, as we are now."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Speaker of the Knesset - whose acquaintance I made during a visit to Israel a very short while ago - and the representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"We all deeply regret the partial failure of the Camp David discussions, although we would like to thank President Clinton and Mrs Albright as well, who put so much work and brainpower into the talks."
"However, we feel - and here we agree with the report - that this peace agreement which is being drawn up has increased the possibilities and that there is a way forward."
"We feel that everything that can be possibly be done now and in the future, including in terms of equal opportunities, must be done and followed up: the Palestinian people has the right to self-determination, without prejudice to the rights of the State of Israel."
"There is one more point which deserves our attention, Mr President, which concerns the city of Jerusalem, which is one of the most sensitive elements in the issue."
"We must endeavour to preserve the religious, cultural and universal character of this holy city, and it must certainly not become the subject of haggling or the property of any one side."
"It has been proposed that it become the capital of both States."
"That would be ideal."
"I would also like to touch on a personal, political consideration. Europe must make an additional effort, it must take further steps to gain and perform a political as well as an economic role."
"We cannot limit our concern to economic issues or matters of water, the sovereignty of Lake Tiberias and so on and so forth."
"We must not forget our political responsibility to history: the European Union has a responsibility as well as the Heads of the States of Israel and Palestine."
"Europe must become a political body and negotiate to achieve peace in this case as well, doing everything in its power to ensure that lasting peace is established in the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, I would like to reinforce Mrs Sbarbati's warning: right now we need more boldness."
"The European institutions need to be more courageous."
"Together with the United States, the European Union now has the difficult and vital task of preventing either party from reverting to its past position and of assessing the possibility of finding a solution to the problems of the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"With a view to this, I support Mr Galeote's proposal to hold a conference along the same lines as the Madrid Conference."
"I will illustrate the importance of this with a historical reference: in the 1980 Venice Declaration, proposed by Ministers Genscher and Colombo, the Community first of all established the need for a solution to be found to the Palestinian question through negotiations."
"At that time, Arafat was still regarded as a terrorist, he was barred from obtaining a visa to go to the United Nations headquarters in America and there was no general consensus regarding the diplomatic strategies to be adopted."
"Following his visit to Rome in 1982 for the Conference of the Interparliamentary Union, things at last started to move and not only did Arafat obtain his visa but - following the preparatory work carried out in Oslo - the United States started to play an active part in the Palestinian question."
"Today, there is no question about the fact that the United States' activity is vital, but I do feel that the European Union also has a part to play and that it must not forget the past, not in order to claim any right to rule, but to regain its essential role which, as Minister Moscovici pointed out, complements the activities of the United States in the search for a solution to the matter, a solution which is still a long way off."
"I would like to end with a reference to what is known as the International Statute of Jerusalem."
"By an International Statute I do not mean that the city would have an international administration, but merely that, as an international community, we must direct this initiative so that the statutory instrument - irrespective of who has territorial sovereignty over Jerusalem - commits all parties to a system of international control, so that every believer - whether Christian, Jew or Muslim - is, at last, guaranteed access to the holy sites."
"Mr President, Arabs and Palestinians have committed terrible historical errors and injustices, but they have also paid the price for them."
"For some time now, it is not the Palestinians who have been the most intransigence in the negotiations. Indeed, they have even given ground in the supposedly neutral area of basic concepts."
"Given the cultural and religious importance of Jerusalem for the Islamic world, I believe that the Palestinian renunciation of all rights over that city - East Jerusalem - could lead not only to a backlash from broad sections of the Palestinian population against their own leaders, but also an international Muslim mobilisation against them."
"Media and political circles are warning that the Palestinians could waste the historic opportunity of being able to negotiate with a Prime Minister such as Ehud Barak, who has dared to put the issue of Jerusalem on the table openly."
"Nevertheless, it is also the case, in my opinion, that Barak and the right-thinking political and social sectors in Israel could lose the excellent opportunity to negotiate with a leader such as President Arafat if they do not fulfil the minimum necessary requirements."
"In my view it is now necessary to adopt a formula which allows for this right thinking and I believe that the European Union is in a good position to contribute to this."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the various speakers for their interventions and I should also like to welcome Avraham Burg and Ahmed Qurie, whom I have already had occasion to meet in Israel and Palestine."
"You have all naturally focused in your interventions on the peace process and the negotiations, which are without doubt the key to progress in this region of the Middle East."
"Allow me to repeat our point of view: Camp David created new momentum which clearly broke down the barriers."
"We are, in fact, facing an historic watershed, an unprecedented opportunity, because the present climate, this combination of circumstances, is exceptional."
"Each of the parties - and the American mediator, who is playing his part to the full - has an interest in reaching an agreement and is determined, I have no doubt, to do everything to bring one about."
"And so, I repeat, we have an historic opportunity to put an end to this conflict which has lasted so very long."
"Having said which, every historic opportunity has its historic risk."
"Clearly, nothing is a foregone conclusion and additional efforts, imagination and courage are still vital."
"Equally clearly, time is running out."
"President Mubarak was in Paris at the end of last week and I think he used an excellent phrase which sums up the situation perfectly: 'peace is now or never' ."
"What role, therefore, can the European Union play?"
"What does this role involve?"
"Several speakers welcomed the role of the European Union; at the same time, I rather had the impression from their interventions that they regretted that it was not a more active role, which is perfectly logical."
"We can always wish for a more active Europe."
"I too wish for a more active Europe."
"The French Presidency has vowed to have a highly active Europe."
"It is in keeping with our historical approach and the way in which we intend to conduct the mission incumbent upon us today."
"At the same time, however, you cannot rewrite history. Nor can you act against the wishes of the players themselves."
"In this respect, I note that it is the two sides themselves who have come to see us, who are requesting our help, our advice, our intervention and our assistance, and not just and not predominantly financial assistance."
"Obviously they feel that we are playing a useful part although I am also aware of the extent to which they are sometimes able to show us the limits of our role."
"So find ourselves between these two sides."
"What does this role involve?"
"It is exercised at three levels, as I have said."
"The European Union intervenes in support of the negotiations."
"It is in contact with both sides, through our intermediary, Mr Moratinos."
"It constantly encourages negotiation."
"It reiterates the principles of international law, which all of us, especially we Europeans, live by."
"Secondly, the European Union makes a contribution to the debate on issues connected with the negotiations."
"But here too, and this brings me back to the same point, both sides must want and ask for our contribution and sometimes we witness the sort of role-playing here with which we are all familiar."
"And thirdly, we help to implement the agreements that have been concluded, as and when this occurs."
"I think that we should already start to think about the Middle East which will emerge once there is peace, peace which we hope for and believe possible for tomorrow."
"Whether or not this peace will last will also depend on how we go about strengthening ties between the countries in the region and developing their ties with us."
"What can the European Union do in this context?"
"There is all the action which Commissioner Patten summarised."
"There is also the Barcelona process, which offers us a particularly suitable framework, provided that we make full use of its potential."
"It is this Barcelona process - and this brings me to the end of what I have to say - which the presidency wishes to leave its mark on and to start on at the forthcoming Barcelona IV meeting."
"I heard a call for a summit meeting here."
"What we are planning at the moment is a ministerial-level meeting."
"We sincerely hope, however, that developments in the peace process will make it possible to hold a meeting not just at ministerial level, but also at Head of State and Government level in order to set the seal, as it were, on the emergence of a new era in the Middle East."
"This is where the presidency, with the Commission and, I am sure, with Parliament' s support, will be concentrating its efforts in the weeks and months to come."
"That concludes the debate."
"EU external action priorities"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the European Union's external action priorities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, as our debate has just demonstrated, is perfectly qualified to take on the role of a full, influential and respected actor on the international political stage."
"Our democratic values, our common will to foster peace and security in the world and our history guide us towards such a role."
"The Community' s economic clout, its primary role in promoting development, and its privileged links with numerous countries or groups of countries also allow us to take on such a role."
"Finally, the instability of a fast-changing world, sometimes at the Union' s very door, actively encourages us to take on such a role."
"That is why the French Presidency of the Council intends to continue the efforts made over recent years and help to promote the Union' s international profile."
"I should like to explain briefly the four main objectives which we have set ourselves."
"First, needless to say, to press ahead with the process of enlargement, the main task facing us in coming years; secondly, to promote the development of a European security and defence policy, which should help to put the European Union firmly on the international map."
"We also want to promote the development of strategic partnerships with our neighbours and with the main regional blocs. This should allow the European Union to help create a multipolar world, which is one of the fundamental long-term factors to the stability of international relations."
"Our fourth and final objective is to improve the efficiency of EU instruments on the basis of the debate held by the ministers of foreign affairs at the informal meeting in Evian on 2 and 3 September, i.e. last Saturday and Sunday, at the Commission' s proposal and in the presence of Mr Patten."
"The French Presidency' s first objective is to give new momentum to the accession negotiations."
"The prospect of enlargement is the basic question which we Europeans have to answer, the huge challenge which faces us over coming years."
"That is why the French Presidency is determined to ensure that the IGC is a success and conclude 'a nice treaty in Nice' , in order to prevent any delays to enlargement and ensure that we can welcome the first candidate countries to a Union with more efficient institutions."
"I should like to make a brief aside here to tell you that our attitude today is one of slight concern. We feel that it is time to move from somewhat static declarations of position to real negotiation culminating in compromise; otherwise we shall have trouble both starting and concluding the negotiations."
"Again on the question of accession negotiations, allow me to say that we shall push as far ahead as possible with negotiations with the Luxembourg six, of course. These are the countries with which we expect to make progress in negotiations on the most difficult chapters of the Community acquis."
"And we shall do likewise with the Helsinki six, maintaining the pace of negotiation and, depending on the level of preparation of each country, opening up a whole series of new chapters, 42 in all, ranging from four to nine, depending on the country."
"All in all, our objective, in close consultation with the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen, is to arrive in Nice at an overall vision of the state of negotiations, thereby efficiently guiding the work of the following presidencies and preparing the way for the completion of negotiations."
"The various reports currently being examined in our committees and the debate on enlargement planned for October will give us further food for thought."
"Hence the main deadlines during our presidency will be as follows:"
"A ministerial negotiating session will be held with each of the 12 candidates either on 21 November, for some of the candidates, or on 5 December, preceded by two meetings at ambassadorial level in the autumn."
"As far as the Fifteen are concerned, we shall be organising a politically-orientated debate at the General Affairs Council on 20 November on the basis of the overall report and the individual progress reports on each candidate country which the Commission is due to submit to the Council at the beginning of November."
"The purpose of this debate, in the run up to the Nice European Council, is to identify the main difficulties which need resolving, chapter by chapter, country by country and, on the basis of this, to discuss how the accession process should continue."
"Finally, we shall be convening the European Conference twice, once in Sochaux on 23 November for the ministers of European affairs of the Fifteen and ministers from the candidate countries, and once in Nice on 7 December for the Heads of State and Government, at the opening of the Biarritz Summit."
"As you will see, we hope to give a strong new impetus to the enlargement process."
"The Union indicated in Helsinki that it would be ready to welcome the first new members on 1 January 2003, as soon as the procedure for ratifying what we hope will be the future Nice Treaty has been completed but, as the Heads of State and Government stressed at the Feira Summit, the countries in question must not only transpose the Community acquis, but more important still, they must be able to implement and really apply it."
"This is naturally a very complicated and, as we well know, a difficult task for the candidate countries, but the Community is already helping by supporting the efforts of each country."
"These efforts are vital in order to complete the enlargement process under way in a serious and controlled manner and thus enable the most advanced countries to accede as quickly as possible."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, I would just like to say briefly that recognition of its candidate status in Helsinki marked an important step which my country, France, supported."
"The presidency will work in the Council to have the accession partnership for this country adopted and will continue to conduct a detailed analysis of the acquis."
"It will also ensure that the Union honours its financial aid commitments with a view to setting up a single framework covering all aid instruments to Turkey."
"It will work especially hard to have the regulation on the economic and social development of Turkey adopted."
"It goes without saying, however, that accession negotiations will be quite out of the question until such time as Turkey complies with the Copenhagen criteria, especially the democratic criteria, although any progress in this direction will of course encourage us to adopt the measures which I have just mentioned."
"We are waiting with interest for the House to adopt Mr Morillon' s reports on these important issues."
"The French Presidency' s second objective is to push ahead with the European common security and defence policy by implementing the decisions taken in Helsinki and Feira."
"The Union now has the instruments which it needs in order to apply a common foreign policy."
"It had been missing one instrument which was vital to the credibility of its commitment, i.e. the capacity to mobilise sufficient military resources to allow it to decide and act autonomously within the context of the so-called Petersberg tasks."
"Our objective, which the crises in Bosnia and, more recently, in Kosovo have taught us, is to provide a global response to the manifold and extraordinarily complex dimensions of today' s crises: not just ethnic crises, but also sociological, administrative, judicial, security-related and military crises."
"All these dimensions apply."
"What is special about the European response, compared with other instruments, is that it can offer a global response to all these dimensions."
"In other words, the French Presidency hopes to take part in an extremely ambitious project which will of necessity take several years to complete."
"It therefore intends to keep up the pace of work so that the Feira commitments can be kept by the time the European Council meets in Nice - a particularly heavy agenda."
"The three main issues are as follows: as regards countries' abilities to meet the objectives, the commitment conference which we shall be holding on 20 November will give each Member State the chance to state how it intends to help achieve the overall objective defined in Helsinki; as regards the permanent political and military institutions, our presidency has to prepare for the transition to the final, operational stage which will allow the Union to manage a crisis in all its dimensions as quickly as possible."
"Finally, we need to implement the Feira decisions on relations with NATO and with third counties in connection with military crisis management and the continuing work to strengthen civil crisis management instruments."
"The French Presidency' s third priority will be to develop strategic partnerships between the Union and its neighbours and the main regional blocs."
"The priority within this priority is to strengthen relations with the Union' s neighbours, especially the Balkans where, as we all know, the situation is still giving cause for concern."
"As a sign of the importance which the Union attaches to developing relations with the Balkans region, which we wish to see enjoying peace and democracy, France has proposed that Croatia host a summit on 24 November with the countries of the former Yugoslavia which, although at varying stages, have made the most progress with their democratic development."
"The idea is to support recent positive developments in several of these countries and to remind the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the door will also be opened to it once it joins the movement or, to be more precise, when the conditions are right for it to join the movement."
"Developing the strategic partnership with Russia and the Ukraine is another priority of the French Presidency, which is due to host the EU/Ukraine Summit in Paris in 10 days' time and the EU/Russia Summit on 30 October."
"The framework for action by the French Presidency of the Union vis-à-vis Russia is defined by the conclusions adopted by the Feira European Council, which offered to support the efforts being made by President Putin and the new Russian Government to modernise and reform Russia."
"At the same time, the presidency will, of course, continue to monitor the issue of Chechnya closely."
"The Council reiterated in July that only a political solution would bring about a lasting settlement of this conflict."
"Finally, despite the uncertainty hanging over the future of the peace process in the Middle East, which we have just debated, developing our Euro-Mediterranean relations is one of the French Presidency' s main concerns."
"We hope to take general stock of the Barcelona process and assess cooperation under the MEDA programme during the ministerial meeting in Marseilles on 16 November and, if circumstances allow, at the summit which may then be organised for the following day in order to define guidelines to give new impetus to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"The presidency also intends to complete work on the peace and stability charter."
"During this meeting, as far as the peace process is concerned, the European Union should play a major role in supporting the two sides and the agreements which they conclude."
"Finally, the presidency is keen to implement the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean adopted in Feira and ensure that the new MEDA regulation is adopted."
"As far as the association agreements are concerned, let me repeat that it hopes to sign the agreement with Egypt and achieve substantial progress in negotiations with Lebanon, Syria and Algeria."
"Beyond its immediate environment, the French Presidency will ensure that it develops political dialogue with the main regional blocs."
"I am thinking here of Asia."
"In Asia, priority will be given to resuming political dialogue between Europe and Asia and to strengthening economic and financial cooperation within ASEAN."
"A summit will be held in Seoul on 20 and 21 October and we also hope to resume the dialogue between the EU and ASEAN."
"History will record two important summits with key countries in the region during the French Presidency."
"The summit with Japan on 19 July decided to start revising the 1991 declaration and preparing an action plan for adoption at the summit in 2001."
"The other summit, with China, will be held in Beijing on 23 October."
"As regards Africa, the presidency will be organising an initial follow-up meeting to the Cairo Summit and working to develop relations with sub-regional organisations in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Convention."
"It will be organising the fourth ministerial meeting between the EU and SADC in Gaborone on 29 and 30 November and a ministerial meeting between the EU and the Community of West African States in Abuja on 16 October."
"The trans-Atlantic dialogue will focus on three foreign policy issues: the Balkans, Russia and the peace process in the Middle East."
"This framework will also be turned to good account during the summits with the United States and Canada on 18 and 19 December, in order to bring our main partners up to date with recent developments in the European foreign, security and defence policy."
"Dialogue with Latin America will be furthered during the course of regular meetings with the regional groups next week on the fringe of the general assembly of the United Nations."
"France has also suggested that its partners consider the future of relations with Cuba."
"Finally, the French Presidency will ensure that Europe is able to do all it can, in a coherent and responsible manner, to help open a new round of negotiations, which we hope will be global and balanced negotiations, within the World Trade Organisation."
"In the longer term - and this is the fourth priority of the French Presidency - the Presidency again opened a debate during the informal meeting in Evian, in the presence of Mr Patten, on improving the efficiency of Union instruments."
"The Union - as I have said - has numerous instruments at its disposal which allow it to influence developments in international relations."
"Thus, its diplomatic presence in the world, both that of the Fifteen and of the Commission, is unique both in terms of staff numbers and geographical coverage."
"Similarly, the Union now constitutes an active and coherent group in the United Nations, where its points of view are represented in every forum."
"Finally, its financial resources, our financial resources, are considerable."
"However, we all know the weaknesses in the Union' s external action: lack of visibility, inadequate coordination on occasions, flexibility which leaves much to be desired, too little influence in international institutions, especially Bretton Woods."
"Efforts have already been made to rectify these shortcomings, mainly by adopting the first common strategies, but this does not alter the fact that the impact and credibility of European action fall well short of the resources implemented."
"The ministers of foreign affairs of the Fifteen therefore opened a debate at the instigation of Hubert Védrine during the recent informal meeting at Evian, based on the excellent work presented by Mr Patten on behalf of the Commission and by the Secretary-General of the Council to the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, who was also present in Evian."
"Several items were entered on the agenda."
"First, we need to improve coordination between the various actors in the European Union - in situ, in the third countries, through more decentralised management of Community programmes and through improved coordination between Community action and action by Member States."
"At central level, this must be done by reaffirming the coordinating role of the General Affairs Council in order to improve the coherence of external action in all its aspects."
"I am thinking here about political dialogue, financial cooperation and commercial franchises."
"Then we need to turn the overall efforts of the Union to better account and make them more efficient."
"That presupposes establishing the measure of this global effort vis-à-vis the outside world and, hence, having synthetic tools which integrate all aspects of external aid."
"We also need to enhance Community aid management by improving the planning and implementation of Community instruments, taking account of the finding made by the Commission and endorsed by the Member States, that there is an unacceptable divide between commitments and Community appropriations disbursed and the increasing criticism, legitimate criticism, by third countries of slow, unwieldy processes."
"Finally, and this is my last point, Mr President, the partners, i.e. the Council and the Commission both agree that we need better monitoring of the implementation and efficiency of Community aid, especially by the General Affairs Council, which needs to play a more important role in steering the Union' s external action."
"I can tell you, in this respect, that the ministers will refer to this point at the Council session on 18 September in order to define a monitoring framework and modus operandi, together with the Commission and the Secretary-General or his representative."
"Those, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, are the priorities of the French Presidency as regards external action."
"We intend to cooperate in this and many other areas with both the Commission, which will be the main driving force in this area, as it is in every other area, and with the European Parliament."
"I very much welcome this opportunity to speak to the European Parliament just a couple of days after the informal meeting of foreign ministers in Evian, at which there was a serious discussion on the effectiveness and efficiency of the European Union's external activities and the budgetary consequences, the first time to my knowledge that such a discussion has taken place."
"I want to congratulate the French Presidency without reservation on the priority that they have given to this extremely important practical issue."
"I want to respond to the motion for a resolution, not least since I suspect that in it are the bones of the discussion that we will be having between the Union's institutions on CFSP over the coming years."
"Just before the summer break, as some Members may have read in the newspapers, we discussed in the Commission the demands, the constraints and priorities of the European Union's external relations, our understanding of what should be the Commission's external role and some of the problems we encounter in performing it."
"Any such discussion should of course begin with the Treaty."
"One of the five objectives of the European Union, as set out in Article 2 of the Treaty, is that it should assert its identity on the international scene."
"That objective reflects a number of things."
"It reflects first of all the European Union's political interests, including a growing role in the area of security, which the President-in-Office referred to in his interesting remarks."
"It reflects our economic interests, trade and the external dimension of the single market, including our agricultural policy."
"The Euro would also come under this heading."
"It reflects our responsibilities for external assistance which have grown exponentially in recent years."
"The European Union and its Member States now provide 55% of total international aid and two thirds of global non-refundable aid."
"It reflects our defensive external interests, issues such as drug trafficking, nuclear safety issues, environmental concerns and migration and last but not least relations with our near neighbours, including the whole process of enlargement, which in my view is the most important and challenging issue facing this generation of European politicians."
"It is worth remembering that less than 20 years ago relations with Greece, Spain and Portugal were external affairs for the European Community as it then was."
"Our prime task in the European Union's external relations is surely the projection of stability, both in our immediate neighbourhood and beyond."
"A more stable neighbourhood and a more stable world guarantee a more stable European Union."
"The skills that the European Union has brought to its own development are skills which offer an example and a model elsewhere in the world."
"We need to be more imaginative in drawing on our experience and using it beyond our shores."
"In discussing how the European Commission can concentrate on this task, I want to be clear about the limits of our role."
"Foreign policy is and will remain fundamentally a matter for national governments, in other words for Member States."
"There are 15 foreign ministers in the European Union today and there will be 15 for the foreseeable future."
"But it is equally important that the Member States should acknowledge what you in European Parliament and those working on the CFSP have long understood: that mere intergovernmentalism can be a recipe for weakness and mediocrity, for a European foreign policy of the lowest-common denominator."
"That is why the Union chose to move on from political cooperation, why the Treaty of Amsterdam created the new high representative for CFSP and why there is an important role for the Commission and for the European Parliament in trying to make a Common - I stress common not single - Foreign and Security Policy more effective."
"The new structures, procedures and instruments of CFSP recognise the need to harness the strengths of the European Community in the service of European foreign policy."
"It would be absurd to divorce European foreign policy from the institutions which have been given responsibility for most of the instruments for its accomplishment, for external trade, external assistance, many of the external aspects of justice and home affairs and so on. That is why the Commission participates fully in the decision-making process in the Council, that is why we have a shared right of initiative - not a sole but a shared right of initiative - in these issues."
"There needs to be a sensible and sensitive partnership in the external field between the institutions of the Union, including the European Parliament, and its Member States."
"We should be engaged in a common effort to make sure that world's largest trading group also makes its presence felt politically."
"We have a real contribution to make and we must not be afraid to make it."
"Another point I want to emphasise is that the Commission is not seeking new powers or a new role, but we do want to be able to exercise the powers we already have under the Treaty more effectively."
"I have every sympathy for European Parliament's desire to do exactly the same."
"I am determined that the Commission should make a coherent contribution to the external relations agenda."
"It is very easy in the external field, perhaps more than any other, to make grandiloquent statements about Great Issues such as peace in the Middle East, a stable and productive relationship with Russia, international development."
"But if these are to be transformed from aspiration into reality, we have to pull our collective European weight."
"What does that mean in practice for the Commission?"
"Firstly it means better coordination between Commissioners and Directorates-General encouraging a habit of working together."
"I think we are starting to improve things."
"I chair the group of RELEX Commissioners which meets regularly both formally and informally."
"We try to frame a single agenda to discuss the impact of what we are doing on other Commissioners' areas of responsibility."
"I think it is fair to say that this has so far been successful and that we intend to continue in this spirit."
"We have managed to avoid the turf wars which I am told occasionally disfigured the harmony of previous Commissions."
"Secondly, we are feeling our way towards a new and more productive working relationship with the Council and I hope with the European Parliament."
"It was evident at Evian with ministers this weekend."
"Apart from the detailed foreign policy issues on our agenda like the situation in the Middle East, we were looking at how we decide our overall annual priorities in external relations and how we apportion the budget."
"As I said before, when I made a presentation to the Council on the budget and on our priorities in May it was the first time this had ever happened."
"Earlier this year, as well as that presentation to foreign ministers, I hope that I gave the European Parliament exactly the same candid presentation on our external relations budget."
"In the past commitments have simply built up from one budget exercise to the next, with almost no effort to pull things together into a coherent whole."
"We are now trying to create a more rational system in which we can all have a proper political discussion early in the process on what our priorities should actually be."
"That is important in the Council and it is important in the Parliament because you are the budgetary authority."
"We cannot spend more than you allow us to but in that case you should not ask us to do more than is possible and criticise us when we have to make judgments about priorities."
"However, I think we are in a much better position to make those judgments with political guidance from the Council and Parliament."
"Thirdly, I am working with Javier Solana to create sensible structures and the right division of responsibilities between the Commission and the High Representative for the CFSP."
"The institutional relationship between the Commission and the High Representative is evolving, as is the precise role of the European Parliament in the CFSP."
"But we have in this last year managed to develop a strong and sensible partnership and I think we can honestly claim that, whatever the difficulties, it is starting to make a difference, for instance, in the Balkans where the challenge to the credibility of Europe's foreign policy remains formidable."
"Fourthly I am working to respond to new demands on the Commission arising from the new security agenda."
"We have set up a new crisis management unit to help pull together the Commission's contribution in that area, but I also want to adapt our structures so that we can have a greater input into aspects of external relations where traditional bilateral diplomacy has been less effective and where the Commission has particular expertise which it should be able to deploy more effectively."
"One example is conflict prevention, which may involve issues that are not part of the normal diplomatic agenda."
"Other examples are climate change, control of drug-trafficking, control of the other death industries, the creation of new civil structures including independent media and so on. These are the sort of issues on which I want to see the Commission contributing its experience and resources."
"In the discussions we had in the G8 foreign ministers' meetings I was struck by the extent to which the foreign and security policy agenda is changing and bringing together disparate issues in which the Community has almost unique competence, for example in the environmental field."
"We discussed yesterday Mr Galeote's excellent report on our external services and the importance of enhancing the effectiveness of what the European Union does around the world."
"There was a lot of discussion about better coordination, better coordination between Member States and all the institutions of the European Union, which I know is a serious priority of the French presidency and one which I totally share."
"We have perhaps talked more openly about these issues in the last few months than ever before but now we have to put our rhetoric into practice and discharge our responsibilities."
"Mr President, a great deal is expected of the European Union, particularly if it is to do justice to the challenges it faces in the sphere of foreign and security policy."
"There has been a considerable amount of progress over the last few years, especially considering the Cologne and Helsinki Decisions, and the development of a European defence identity."
"We must see - indeed Mr Patten made this very point - that we contribute a large proportion of the world' s international aid."
"But are we really well-equipped to do justice to these challenges?"
"Are the structures genuinely suitable?"
"Do we really allow excellent individuals such as Mr Patten and Mr Solana to represent us overseas or are we increasingly forcing them to compete against each other owing to inappropriate structures?"
"The fact is that the Council wants to operate as the executive in the foreign, security and defence policy, but how is this to be accomplished with 27 Foreign Ministers at the same time, when the Council thinks of itself as an executive authority in collective terms?"
"All this is bound to lead to a situation that will be untenable in the long run."
"The European Union may have put the instruments for external assistance and trade policy on a Community footing to a large extent, but unfortunately we do not have the chance to allow the institution to push this Community policy through, the intention being to avoid any competition with the Foreign Ministers, who are not prepared to give up a little bit of their jurisdiction in de facto terms."
"If you keep appointing new special representatives then, in the end, this will detract from the competences of the Community bodies, notably the Commission, without really bringing about coordination."
"Kosovo is a case in point: it was absolute chaos."
"We provide the most money but nothing is actually being resolved out there, despite the best efforts of all concerned, because the structures are inappropriate."
"That is the real problem and it is increasingly bringing us into disrepute."
"We must ensure - and Mr Patten has the right approach in proposing the reorganisation of external assistance - that we strengthen the power to act of our Community bodies, and that we improve the way in which work is carried out there and make it more effective."
"But at the same time, the structures must fit together, or else we will fail to make headway in this area."
"Of course that also means, for example, that - as Parliament said before Amsterdam - the two-fold construct of High Representative/Commissioner for Foreign Affairs will not work."
"We have had our first taste of this only a year on. We have had our first taste of this only a year on."
"It would have been much better to have a Vice-President of the Commission for Foreign Affairs attached by means of a special bond of legitimation to the Council."
"If we are to fulfil the expectations people have of the European Union then we must organise the structures accordingly, but not in line with the traditionally held ideas of EU Foreign Ministers, who are not prepared to relinquish responsibilities in de facto terms."
"The new troika must be made better use of under the circumstances, and the question of parliamentary control must be resolved too."
"According to the Treaty, the European Parliament is responsible for the area of civil crisis management, trade policy and the like, and that is clearly the case."
"The national parliaments are responsible for financing and supervising their armed forces and the orders to go into action, and there can be no doubt on that score either."
"Only, we must have the good sense to bring about a certain amount of coordination between them."
"But here too, control must clearly be in evidence, because we cannot have a situation where European foreign, security and defence policy means less transparency and democracy."
"For this reason, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must work closely together over the next few days in order to guarantee and secure the necessary secrecy of certain documents."
"On the other hand though, we must also guarantee the same level of transparency and control that the public expects from national governments and national parliaments."
"I believe we will find the right moment to make a start on this."
"I see that the French Council Presidency is extremely well disposed in this matter and so we should work on it over the next few days."
"We shall now suspend the sitting."
"Formal sitting on the occasion of the address by Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset and Mr Ahmed Qurie, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"Mr President, as you know I currently chair Parliament's delegation for the United States of America and I should like to raise a point of order under Parliament's rules concerning parliamentary delegations."
"It has come to my attention that a group of parliamentarians from the EPP Group visited the USA in July."
"Normally I would regard this as a private matter and not my concern."
"However, in the programme connected with this visit the group is described as a delegation and in particular Mr Goodwill, MEP, is described as leader of the delegation."
"I can make this programme available to you."
"This puts the whole visit in an entirely different context."
"There was a formal delegation which I chaired from Parliament to the USA in June and there is an understandable confusion when another group of MEPs some three weeks later arrive in the USA, to all intents and purposes also a European Parliament delegation."
"I have reports that the comments of these parliamentarians were from the wilder shores of the EPP Group and were notable for their anti-European content."
"I understand what you are saying, Mrs Read, and the presidency takes note of your comment."
"We shall correct this mistake and keep you informed of the situation."
"Mr Goodwill, I believe that what you wish to say echoes Mrs Read' s comments."
"Mr President, on a point of order I can inform the House that in no way did the visit by Members from the UK, Sweden and Germany wish to be described as a delegation."
"We were merely visiting the United States as a group organised from within our own national groups."
"We did not represent the EPP Group, we certainly did not wish to usurp the role of the official delegation."
"I contest the point made about the views expressed during that visit as being particularly extreme."
"We represented the views of our national parties over there as well as the views expressed within the European Parliament."
"I am very sorry, Mrs Read, but I cannot allow you to speak again, as we are already running late."
"We all know what the problem is."
"The Bureau and Parliament have already made a commitment to resolving this issue and you really cannot speak again."
"Let us proceed to the vote."
"Vote"
"I am extremely grateful for the courteous offer that has been made."
"Last night we had the opportunity to discuss this extremely important report at some length."
"In my speech I drew attention to the communication that we have already produced on the external services, but said that we will be coming back with a further communication in due course which will bear the imprint of this extremely important report."
"In particular I should like to express our enthusiasm for the very sensible ideas put forward about training for our external services and also the arguments about coordination."
"It is a very good report on an important subject."
"We hope that it will be a beacon for all of us in the dark nights that lie ahead."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"Report (A5­0191/2000) by Mr Imbeni, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Assessment and future of Community humanitarian activities (Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 1257/96) (COM(1999) 468 - C5­0044/2000 - 2000/2016(COS))."
"(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Dell' Alba report (A5-0202/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Dell'Alba's report, and I would like to explain this decision here since it relates to the financial concerns of pensioners in general."
"Since they have very little money, they are, in effect, very careful how they spend it."
"Sadly, the Dell'Alba report does not take into consideration the proposals of the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, who levelled severe criticisms at the report, which proposes to honour the outstanding expenditure laid down in a previous regulation on aid for certain European activities in Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and South Africa."
"In my opinion, much more should have been done, and this should have rung genuine alarm bells for the Commission's activities."
"Piétrasanta report (A5-0205/2000)"
"Mr President, I could not pass over the chance to give an explanation of my vote for the MEDA report, seeing as, this summer, after I had been to Spain, I had a holiday in Tunisia."
"While I was there, a Tunisian pensioner came up to me - goodness knows how he had found out that I represent the Italian pensioners in the European Parliament - and he said to me: ""I know that there is an aid programme for Tunisia as there is for all the Mediterranean countries, but what good has it done me, a pensioner in Tunisia?"
"What are you doing to help us?"""
"I have, in effect, read Mr Piétrasanta's report in its entirety and I regret to say that certain actions are missing. In addition to the various initiatives laid down in the MEDA programme - which, I hope, will be given much more funding than the EUR 3 475 million which were appropriated to it between 1995 and 1999 - I hope that measures will also be adopted to keep a check on how European Union funding is used and that a large proportion will go to the peoples of the African countries which border on the Mediterranean, including their elderly citizens."
"The MEDA programme is the mainstay of financial cooperation under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership set up in 1995."
"But the procedures are unwieldy and not transparent enough, the specification for the implementation of projects, which are too long..."
"Reform is urgently needed because these problems are throwing the entire process into disrepute and are seen as bad signs by the people of the Mediterranean, who did, in fact, originally welcome the Barcelona process with a certain degree of enthusiasm."
"The Commission text is a good text because its purpose is to help simplify current regulations."
"But we need more if we want to give our Mediterranean policy a new lease of life: we need to involve the people more by supporting decentralised cooperation, we need to improve the way in which the cultural and human dimensions are integrated, open the free trade zone to agricultural produce and monitor and support fundamental freedoms."
"I fully support the rapporteur' s proposal that an annual report be drafted on human rights in the Mediterranean countries."
"Galeote Quecedo report (A5-0210/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report on a common Community diplomacy."
"I have to say that my daughter, who was extremely happy to see European driving licences introduced and remarked at the time: ""So Europe is making progress!"" , asked me on this occasion: ""But when will European embassies be set up in the countries we visit as tourists?"""
"Well, I would have liked the Committee's report to have been more decided, more resolute, and to have, at last, established single European embassies to replace the 15 national embassies in the 15 Member States and the other States throughout the world."
"Sadly, this did not happen, but I hope that it will come about with the next Commission communication."
"The Liberal Party' s five Members of the European Parliament support the efforts in this report to give better diplomatic training to those EC officials who work in the Commission' s delegations."
"We have proposed - and had accepted - an amendment which emphasises that it is simply a question of in-service training and that the courses are to be open to diplomats from the national foreign services."
"The Liberals do not, however, support the idea of setting up a new institution in the form of an EC College of Diplomacy. Nor do we want the present delegations to develop into EU embassies."
"Therefore, the Liberals have today voted in favour of the report as a whole but abstained from voting on the above-mentioned points."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament welcome, and have voted in favour of, the initiative to improve the Community' s common foreign service."
"We also support the initiative to give further training to EC officials engaged in external activities."
"We are opposed, however, to setting up a college of diplomacy for training the staff."
"It must be possible for such training to take place as, for example, in-service or on the job training."
"We also make reservations about the Commission' s delegations developing into proper embassies."
"That would create an unclear picture of which problems are to be solved by the national embassies."
"We have abstained from voting because the aims of the report are unclear."
"On the one hand, it contains a large number of proposals for improving operations in the EU' s present offices abroad."
"It is also established (in paragraph O) that the purpose is not to create a single diplomatic service for the EU to replace the foreign services of the Member States."
"On the other hand, the whole enterprise smacks of efforts progressively to do precisely that, namely to create veritable EU embassies as a stage in the process of transforming the EU into a superstate."
"This impression is powerfully reinforced by paragraphs P, 13 and 15, in which the talk is precisely of EU embassies, of coordinated EU representation in, for example, the UN and of Member States which so desire arranging for their diplomatic missions to be combined with the EU' s delegations."
"Because we are in favour of practical improvements to the existing foreign operation, but absolutely opposed to the EU' s beginning to behave like a superstate in the world around, especially by stealth, we have no option but to abstain from voting."
"Our countries have a special responsibility, being among the few democracies in the world."
"In the same way as the United States, we must be in a position to take independent initiatives and intervene in those parts of the world where there is a need to defend human rights and to propagate democratic values."
"Interventions of this kind should primarily take place with the help of economic sanctions but, depending upon the circumstances, military intervention may be necessary."
"The prerequisite of the EU' s being able to assemble the required drive to complete these tasks is close cooperation, both economic and political, within the EU, including closer cooperation between the foreign services."
"At present, statements from the Commission' s delegations are too dissimilar because of the divergent positions held by the Member States."
"If the EU is to assert itself on the political stage, it requires a better coordinated foreign policy in which the EU countries are obliged to combine forces and to speak with one voice."
". (FR) Mr Galeote' s report has the strange merit of indicating its real objective and logic fairly clearly, i.e. the creation of a single Community diplomatic service, while formally claiming the opposite."
"The entire proposed arrangement in fact contradicts recital O, which states that the objective is not to create a single diplomatic service to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States."
"I welcome Mr Dupuis' frank and coherent amendments, which at least have the merit of calling a spade a spade."
"The subtle internal balances of the PPE probably explain the baroque nature of the structure being proposed to us."
"This clearly pathetic ducking and diving is directly inspired by the Monnet-Delors method and all Mr Galeote has done is to propose a new variation on that theme, this time on diplomacy."
"With this method, the institution creates the function, the container hides the content, the technique gives rise to the policy."
"But now we have the key and know how to decipher."
"When Mr Galeote proposes setting up a training college to mould Community super-diplomats and recycle national diplomats, giving the European Union an international legal personality and 'coordinating' representations, especially to the UN, we know full well that the sub-text reads: merge embassies, create a single Community diplomatic corps and communitise France' s and Britain' s permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council."
"And of course, as always, the question of purpose, the question of content, the only question worth asking, is omitted."
"What are we creating with this new institution?"
"In this particular case, what foreign policy will this Community diplomatic corps serve?"
"What common interests is it supposed to defend?"
"This is a typically Marxist approach."
"We are waiting for the 'critical qualitative mass' which, we hope, will change the quantitative into qualitative at a certain threshold."
"The common instrument is supposed to produce the common conscience, the common will, the common responsibility."
"This cult of the quantitative culminates in a grotesque comparison between the number of American and 'European' diplomats, the number of 'European' diplomats having been obtained by adding up the numbers of professional diplomats attached to the foreign services of our various countries."
"Must we reiterate that the United States are one and the same nation and the Member States of the European Union each have privileged links in the world, different and sometimes diverging experiences and affinities, and that it is this which so enriches European diplomacy?"
"It is the complementarity of this individual expertise which can be used for a clearly-defined common objective which really serves European interests."
"It is precisely these advantages which the single diplomacy being proposed to us will devalue."
"In fact, we are eroding national will, despite the fact that it is the diplomatic driving force behind Europe and, at the same time, we express surprise when the increasing number of instruments and declarations is reflected merely by an absence of content and a general lack of interest."
"The only positive aspect of this report might be its desire to rationalise the organisation and improve the professionalism of the European Commission delegations in third countries."
"Experience has shown that these delegations are not always up to their real job, which is to implement Community programmes and agreements and monitor them on the ground."
"It would appear that this job has now taken second place to other considerations, with Commission representatives too busy trying to obtain officially the usurped title of ambassador to oversee the proper implementation of the programmes which they are responsible for applying."
"This last point apart, you will understand that we obviously did not vote in favour of the other, totally surrealist proposals in this initiative report."
"Today we are admitting the absurdity and intrinsic weaknesses of a single currency which is not supported by any sovereignty."
"And now we expect single diplomacy, conceived in the same back to front manner, to work or rather, not to work."
"I welcome the initiative to improve training for EU officials working on foreign issues, but I cannot support the creation of a single diplomatic corps."
"The Member States are responsible for foreign diplomacy, and I think there is a danger that transforming the Commission' s delegations into Community delegations with legal standing might lead to conflicts of interest with the Member States' national diplomatic delegations."
"I cannot therefore vote in favour of Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report."
"Imbeni report (A5-0191/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Imbeni's report as well, for the European Union is certainly doing something extremely important in organising humanitarian aid for areas which have been struck by natural disasters or the effects of war."
"Pensioners, whom I have the honour and the pleasure of representing, are among those who are most willing on these occasions to go and help the less fortunate victims of disasters."
"But what benefit has Europe drawn from this initiative which, among other things, cost EUR 813 million in 1999 alone?"
"Moreover, I would call upon the Commission to increase its expenditure, for it is extremely important for Europe to maintain a presence in the world and to give a high profile to its presence through, among other things, a symbol and greater publicity of this important activity."
"Mr President, a single example, taken from the explanatory statement, illustrates just how laughable the report on the humanitarian activities of the European Union is."
"The report cites the absence of operational tools, especially helicopters, as the reason for the lack of international aid in general and the lack of aid from the European institutions in particular, in dealing with the floods in Mozambique, whereas - and who could forget? - there was no lack of helicopters, aeroplanes, every type of transportation equipment and even means of destruction when it came to intervening in Yugoslavia or Iraq."
"The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the major powers, which are capable of mobilising huge resources in order to impose their hegemony on the rest of the world, are not prepared to make the slightest effort when it comes to saving human lives."
"Under these circumstances, the pacifying declarations on humanitarian aid by the European institutions are shamefully hypocritical and we have no intention of backing them, which is why we abstained from the vote."
"I wish to start by congratulating Mr Imbeni on the quality of his report."
"This report is fully in keeping with the philosophy of our institution, which has always made its voice heard in the least well off countries, through its opinions, its resolutions or specific action to improve and develop humanitarian aid."
"Since the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) was created at the beginning of the 1990s, Europe has taken its place as the biggest donor in the world."
"However, despite legitimate efforts driven by historical links between certain European countries and developing countries, we are forced to admit that poverty is increasing throughout the world."
"Today, half the world lives on less than two dollars a day."
"This is unacceptable!"
"Has the money released been squandered?"
"I do not think so."
"Without the emergency aid provided by ECHO in order to deal with the natural disasters or serious crises which regularly hit the most vulnerable people on our planet, I hardly dare imagine the situation which we would have to deal with today."
"Nonetheless, humanitarian aid needs to be rationalised."
"In this respect, I welcome the fact that the House is calling for more coherent, more coordinated help and for greater collaboration between the various partners, such as the executive Commission, the Member States, the various associations or even the United Nations."
"In addition, apart from humanitarian aid proper, we need to find ways of improving conflict prevention because 25% of the African continent is still being torn apart by war."
"Finally, even if the problem of development is a multi-dimensional problem and the European Union does not have all the answers, we still need to continue and step up our action in order to lay the foundations for sustainable world development and help eradicate poverty."
"In any event, this was the concept which inspired the work of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, which is why I voted in favour of the report presented today by Mr Imbeni."
"Mr President, I would like, on my own account and also on behalf of my colleagues, to protest in the strongest terms, and have it put on record, about the article that Madam President had published in today' s edition of the Strasbourg daily newspaper."
"In it, she voices her belief that it would have come to riots in Austria had the 14 EU States not imposed sanctions against Austria."
"I utterly repudiate this."
"In making this comment, not only has the President done the Austrian people an injustice, she has also abused her office, and thereby caused this House, an EU institution, a great deal of harm."
"Mrs Raschhofer, I shall gladly pass your comments on to President Fontaine."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Vice-President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"With your permission I would like to re-raise the point of order that I tried to make just before the votes this morning."
"I will re-read the point that I wanted to make."
"I currently chair the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the United States of America and would like to raise a point of order under Parliament's rules concerning parliamentary delegations."
"It has come to my attention that a group of EPP Members visited the USA in July."
"Normally I would regard this as a private matter, but in the programme for the visit, which I can supply to you, the group is described as a delegation and in particular Mr Robert Goodwill, MEP, is described as leader of the delegation."
"This of course puts the visit in an entirely different context."
"An official delegation from Parliament, which I headed, visited the United States of America in June."
"I think that you will understand that confusion may well arise when another group of MEPs arrives in the USA some three weeks later as, to all intents and purposes, a second European Parliament delegation."
"I know that there was a strong anti-European tone to their reports, and this, of course, is a matter for the EPP, but when damaging and derogatory remarks about the European Union stem from what is purported to be an official visit from the European Parliament, I feel that the matter should be raised here."
"I would ask you as a matter of urgency to investigate whether Parliament's rules have been broken."
"Could you also ascertain whether the Members concerned had a formal invitation from relevant bodies in the USA and intend to declare their visit in the Members' register of interests?"
"I will of course pass on the other documentation that I have received."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, in the Minutes, in point 2, you can see at the end, after Parliament observed a minute's silence in memory of those who had died, the Minutes said: ""Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso spoke."""
"Actually there is no mention of what I said."
"But if you look at the verbatim report you can see that there is a very important error which could mislead people."
"The verbatim report says, at the end of my words: ""The action of ETA is a righteous expression of the struggle for recognition"" ... etc."
"The right to exist as Basque."
"You can understand that the difference is a very substantial one."
"I would like to amend it."
"I would ask for responsibility to be taken for that because if you look at the Spanish press today, everybody has taken these words as the real ones."
"That is at least based on a reference but then some mass media in Spain, whereas I cited Hegel as a quotation, have put in Nietzsche and this is no coincidence at all."
"I am afraid I am faced with a determination to put words into my mouth which I did not say."
"That is my protest."
"I would like to amend what is in the verbatim report."
"To say in the Minutes that I spoke is not sufficient."
"You must record the sense of what I said yesterday."
"Mr Gorostiaga, if you feel that you have been misquoted, you have hereby been given the opportunity to report this."
"This too will be included in the Verbatim Report."
"We will of course examine how this has happened."
"I am taking note of this now."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"As you are aware, Parliament decided this morning to add a communication by Mr Verheugen on enlargement to tomorrow' s agenda at 5.00 p.m."
"Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, has also expressed the wish to make a communication on this subject matter."
"Since Mr Prodi is to leave Strasbourg by 5.00 p.m. at the very latest, I suggest bringing the Commission communication forward to 4.00 p.m."
"The debates will consequently be resumed after the Commission communication until Question Time (Commission) which commences at 5.30 p.m.."
"Are there any objections to this?"
"Mr President, I wholeheartedly agree with what you have said, and also welcome with open arms the fact that President Prodi himself is to make a statement."
"All I would ask - and the group chairmen in attendance will support me in this - is that the group chairmen are also given the opportunity tomorrow to make a brief statement of their position."
"This has not been scheduled yet, but I would ask if it could be attended to, so that we too are able to make our positions clear."
"There is no need for it to be a long statement, but the group chairmen must be given this opportunity."
"I would urge you to arrange this accordingly."
"EU external action priorities (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the declarations of the Council and the Commission on EU external action priorities."
"Mr President, many thanks for allowing me to continue this morning' s debate."
"The Socialist Group has a need to recognise for itself that Europe' s position on the world stage has undergone a dramatic change since the fall of the Berlin Wall, when traditionally, foreign policy was adopted by national states which continue to play a major role, of course."
"We also noticed that our own governments often thwarted each other in their efforts to adopt effective external policy."
"We are now in a position where we can gradually see these governments taking joint steps and the European Union setting up a growing common foreign policy."
"And in our view, and this was also explained very clearly by Mr Patten, with regard to those external actions, ""foreign policy"" involves more than traditional foreign diplomacy as we knew it but also touches upon concepts such as security - and embraces a much wider concept of security - the environment, conflict prevention, trade and relations in all kinds of areas."
"It encompasses development cooperation and naturally the traditional tools of foreign policy."
"This has culminated in an enriched foreign policy for the EU and has also resulted in the integration of the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr CFSP, Mr Solana, and the Council who all have a particular role to fulfil."
"It is unfortunate that Mr Solana was unable to be here to make a contribution of this kind."
"We would actually like to emphasise that there are three priorities for which we need to find a balance simultaneously. Firstly, of direct concern are our neighbours, in other words eastward enlargement."
"Our second priority is the strategic aspect within MEDA. This is the second area which touches upon traditional relations within NATO, the G7 and the other contexts within which we cooperate with America and the other traditional partners."
"The third priority is easily forgotten but in our eyes essential, namely that of Europe as the bearer of values in the world, or, in other words 'a global player in a global village' ."
"In this respect, it is essential to regard the fight against poverty as a key contribution in our policy, rather than according it a minor position within foreign policy."
"Mr Patten, Mr Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, and the Commissioner for External Relations, you could, in fact, extract new value, new quality and effectiveness from this, working in tandem with Parliament."
"We very much regret the fact that heading 4, the role of our Parliament and the tasks which we actually have to fulfil in the process are still being sidelined to such a degree."
"All too often, we find that the Council follows its own line of thought and this is no longer the way in which we can market modern foreign policy which covers a wide range of issues."
"We therefore hope that we can once again drive our message home."
"We hope that this new policy takes account of the budget and can be accompanied by an involved and powerful European Parliament that can have its say and is taken entirely seriously."
"We would welcome a positive response from the Council and Commission with regard to this new policy in these matters too."
"Mr President, I welcome the resolve that was shown here today by the French Presidency and the Commission in placing emphasis on enlargement as the key priority for the external action of the Union."
"I hope that when we come to deal with the matter in the House tomorrow the Verheugen incident will have simply served as a timely reminder that we must get our signals clear and avoid giving mixed messages with regard to this strategic priority."
"With regard to the matter in hand, I should like to pick up on a point made by the Commissioner earlier today when he talked about the attempt to make foreign policy more effective and to warmly welcome and subscribe to his view on the indivisibility of the Union's foreign policy."
"If we take the Barcelona process, the Middle East peace process, our relations with the Western Balkans, our relations with Russia, clearly there is a vast area of policy to be covered and a wide variety of instruments."
"It is clear that a successful foreign policy cannot stand on one pillar alone."
"Even if the conduct of foreign policy - and in particular, the security and defence dimension of foreign policy - is essentially for government, it follows that because of the nature of the policy terrain and the instruments available it cannot be government's exclusive concern."
"The Commission is right to demand its right of association under the Treaty and, through that, for this Parliament to demand its right of accountability and scrutiny."
"A second general point I should like to refer to is in respect of the efficiency of policy."
"Here too the new Commission - and in particular, Commissioner Patten - deserve to be congratulated, first of all for revealing to us the extent of the horror that much of the policy had become."
"Let me recall one of the results of these inquiries: in the past five years the average delay in the disbursement of committed funds has increased from three years to four-and-a-half years."
"For certain programmes the backlog of outstanding commitments is equivalent to more than eight-and-a-half years of payments."
"That clearly is a farce in anyone's analysis."
"It has to be said in fairness that the former Commission led by Jacques Santer was as much a victim as an author of this process."
"This is an accumulation of an ineffective and inefficient system over years."
"We welcome the commitment to an urgent review of that process."
"On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to lay particular emphasis on our distress at the code of secrecy rather than the code of transparency normally promoted by the Council."
"Blanket secrecy is not the way to legitimise an evolving Community policy."
"My group deplores the fact that this code of secrecy was slipped in during the Parliamentary summer recess, with no Parliamentary consultation and by written procedure."
"It amounts to a form of intergovernmental conspiracy against citizens' right to know."
"I want to hear from the Council today what role it feels it is prepared to accord to this House in terms of the scrutiny and accountability of issues which may be intergovernmental but which cannot stand on one pillar alone?"
"Mr President, as the European Union assumes new powers we might expect that transparency in this matter and parliamentarian monitoring would increase at the same rate."
"Now, it would seem that the European security and defence identity is making dramatic progress in the wake of the Helsinki summit."
"It appears, however, that the Council has been resorting more and more to the intergovernmental process in this, so much so that it has threatened even to bypass the Commission, something quite unheard of, as far as I am concerned."
"The Commission must have a strong role to play in this process."
"Just like my colleague, Mr Cox, I too strongly condemn the fact that, during the summer recess, the Council produced very significant restrictions on the public' s right to gain access to documents relating to matters of security and defence."
"Obviously, nobody is claiming that confidentiality and even secrecy are not necessary from time to time, when it is a question, for example, of operational matters in defence policy."
"But the Council' s decision seems to be leading to a situation now where the whole development of the security and defence policy in the political sphere can no longer be properly monitored, being, as it were, beyond that."
"The public can no longer follow the development of security and defence policy, and neither can Parliament monitor it properly."
"We here in Parliament have discussed this situation, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which I am involved in the discussion of the issue, is looking into whether Parliament should possibly take the Council to court on account of this decision, which is a clear violation of Parliament' s rights, and weakens our citizens' already barely attainable rights of access to documents."
"I demand a clear explanation from the representative of the Council, and I would be very grateful if the Commission were also to comment on the situation."
"I shall be very brief, Mr President, as I only wish to discuss one very specific aspect of the European Union' s external actions. I feel that, although this is a very specific issue, it nevertheless deserves our utmost consideration and is of great concern to us."
"I am referring to the obvious trend towards placing less and less value, in terms of both our attention and resources, on cooperation with developing countries."
"I realise, of course, that we have other objectives and that these too must be given the appropriate consideration."
"Nevertheless, I think that, because of the expectations that are created, because of the European Union' s responsibilities and even because of the new problems facing developing countries, for all these reasons, taking account of these very important parts of the world must be a major factor in determining our actions."
"I would emphasise one aspect in particular: we need, in this context, to have our own independent strategies that confirm the European Union' s position in this field."
"This concern has arisen mainly as a result of the successive budgetary cuts in the field of cooperation which, to a certain extent, illustrate and endorse the fears I have just mentioned, which I feel we must lay to rest once and for all."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by addressing a brief remark to Mr Patten."
"The document on which we are preparing to vote deplores the slide towards intergovernmentalism which is creeping into our common foreign and security policy and that this somewhat contradicts the Commissioner' s speech this morning, in which he said that foreign policy would remain a matter for national governments."
"I therefore feel that the question should perhaps be broached with greater flexibility."
"In politics, we never use the word ""never"" ."
"I think that the European Parliament is fairly reticent on this question, but Mr Brok' s intervention demonstrated that no one here in this House continued to feel that it was still possible and absolutely vital to communitise foreign policy."
"I should like quickly to ask the President-in-Office two questions."
"I was interested to read of a recent Franco-German initiative to unite consulates."
"Does the Presidency-in-Office entertain the idea of rapidly communitising foreign policy and, more importantly, of giving a Union embassy the task of representing all the Member States of the Union in the fifty countries in which no Member State of the Union is represented?"
"My second question is this."
"I was interested to note, Mr President-in-Office, your obvious lack of enthusiasm for the European Union/China summit, which pleases me greatly."
"Does that mean that the so-called policy of critical dialogue with China is dead and buried and would you be prepared, as the President-in-Office, to address the question of the recognition of the Tibetan Government in exile at your next meeting with the Chinese if no agreement on the new status of Tibet is reached within a reasonable period of time?"
"Mr President, I believe it is important not to lose sight of the objectives pursued in the course of this debate. In my opinion, there are two:"
"Firstly, to guarantee more effective, coherent and visible external action on the part of the European Union."
"What would be the point of having more than 40 000 officials in more than 1 500 diplomatic missions between the Commission and the Member States - twice the number the United States has - if our activity really is not sufficiently efficient, coherent or visible?"
"I believe that Mr Patten expressed this very well in his intervention when he demonstrated that he had at least read the joint motion for a resolution which we have negotiated in Parliament."
"Secondly, to take note of the fact that the days when the European Parliament simply rubber-stamped the priorities established by other Community institutions have finally been assigned to history."
"Mr Moscovici, in the coming months we will have to make important decisions in the field of the nascent, embryonic defence policy. During the Balkan crisis the inadequacies of the European Union were made blatantly clear."
"In the United States there is currently a great debate taking place concerning defence expenditure."
"We will soon have to hold this debate here in Europe. We in Europe will not only have to consider this expenditure but also the structure of this spending."
"The incompatibility and heterogeneity of the Member States' investments in this field - the national views - make this such a difficult debate that we will have to consider other added problems such as interinstitutional disputes."
"This Parliament would clearly have preferred the figure of the High Representative to be answerable to the Commission."
"Instead, it has been answerable to the Council , and this is something we have to accept, as we also have to accept that the Commission must play a role."
"Mr Patten is right when he says that we have to clarify and resolve a series of tensions between the intergovernmental realm and the Community realm."
"This dispute between the institutions must be resolved, and the European Parliament must not simply be serving at the table, but it also wishes to take its place in the kitchen."
"Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, with my French colleagues in the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I naturally follow the external actions of the European Union with great interest."
"In general we favour a strong European Union presence on the international scene."
"That implies firm and unswerving commitment from the Council itself first of all."
"You spoke of high ambition, Minister, and I was pleased to hear it."
"But that also presupposes a Commission genuinely capable of action."
"That is what the Commissioner wants and I hope he is getting, and will get, the political, administrative and financial resources he needs to put his ideas into practice and make the CFSP really effective and efficient."
"But in this short speech, I want to focus on enlargement."
"A recent interview with a German newspaper stirred up some turmoil."
"For us, however, it is clear: there is no question of slowing down the enlargement process by introducing new requirements or a variety of delaying tactics."
"On the contrary, we must do everything we can to move it forward, as you just reaffirmed, Minister, and of course that does not exclude either rigour or vigilance."
"A slapdash enlargement would obviously be a great mistake."
"Having said that, we are conscious of the problems due to public opinion both within the fifteen Member States and in the candidate countries."
"Public opinion is very ill informed and can veer from irrational enthusiasm to a sense of discouragement to outright hostility."
"A great deal of work undoubtedly needs to be done if the long and difficult process of enlargement is to have solid, clear-sighted and determined popular support."
"Mr President, the foreign policy of the European Union can only be successful if it satisfies three main criteria: clarity, credibility and transparency."
"Mr Patten, we will continue to push for this, even though you believe that we should at last put an end to the game of ping pong."
"As far as I am concerned, it has started and can only finish if a constructive solution is found."
"Otherwise this will lead to further competition between the institutions."
"I believe the speech you gave in Paris was significant in this respect."
"It is true that there should at last be open discussion on how to pursue a truly coherent foreign policy."
"The European Parliament will play an important part in this."
"You said yourself that it will only be possible to achieve credibility - your second point - if the European Union employs all its capabilities, i.e. all three pillars, and particularly the first with its financial and economic means, in preventive conflict management, and if the EU promotes stability overseas by making proper use of its economic instruments and using its political means to achieve real cooperation."
"After all, we know that we must take a considerably broader view of the issue of protection."
"Protection of the environment, the individual and human rights cannot be secured through one pillar alone."
"In the same way, preventive conflict management is not just about the deployment of a police force; it involves all three pillars."
"As far as the last point, that of transparency, is concerned, my group has made it quite clear today that we do not accept, nor will we accept, that access to these documents should be restricted."
"Transparency is Parliament' s watchword, and we will continue to demand it from the Council and the Commission alike."
"We will revisit this theme at a later stage."
"Mr President, I was interested to hear the President-in-Office mention the four priorities which the Presidency-in-Office envisages for the future in the field of foreign affairs and defence. Two of these priorities also concern the resolutions, namely the selection of tools which are needed to achieve this and the development of the common foreign and security and defence policy itself."
"Commissioner Patten, the Vice-President of the Commission, reacted to this in his own way and remarked that the European Union is in fact extremely resourceful."
"The lion' s share of aid - two-thirds in fact - originates from our European Union."
"Enlargement is on the agenda and he also mentioned the promotion of stability, at which point I started to have my doubts."
"When he then mentioned the fact that the EU should have its own identity on the world stage, I thought: I would love to share this objective with him but in a way which would take account of European responsibilities."
"Needless to say, this identity can only find expression in true European policy."
"European responsibilities can certainly not be divided among fifteen to thirty or perhaps more Member States."
"This does not mean that there will be no Foreign Affairs Ministers in the Member States. They will certainly be kept on, just like the Ministers for Economic Affairs or certainly those for Education."
"Once European responsibilities are identified, they should in any event not be divided up and they should also be truly based on a European vision and European values which we share here in this Parliament."
"This is not about a simple bureaucratic division of powers between institutions or a power-crazed Parliament or such like."
"This is about a practical solution: how can we solve the problems we have encountered?"
"This is about the fact that our policy was unable to prevent the suffering in Bosnia, which claimed hundreds of thousands of victims."
"That is what this is all about!"
"We need to ask ourselves how we can prevent this."
"This is when we say as a Parliament: we need European policy; otherwise we will not succeed."
"Mr President, first of all, I want to say thank you both to the French Presidency and to Commissioner Patten for their excellent contributions this morning."
"The priorities established deserve all our support."
"Time permits only a couple of remarks on my part."
"I choose to concentrate on the deficiencies in the implementation of the Union' s development cooperation."
"Commissioner Patten deserves praise for the openness with which he describes and has described the problems."
"My own experience when, in a responsible post within the UN' s development programme, I sought cooperation with the Union at national level with a view to assembling and coordinating forces in different areas was that, as a rule, it did not work, either because almost every decision in the EU' s case needed to be taken in Brussels and also because of the lack of qualified staff within the area concerned."
"All this made cooperation with the EU difficult and incredibly time-consuming."
"The UN has its problems with bureaucracy and dilatoriness - I am the first to admit that - but, where development work and development cooperation are concerned, the EU was lagging far behind, in any case a few years ago."
"The conclusion I draw is, first of all, that the Commission must radically decentralise the right of decision-making to national level."
"""Brussels"" , with all its administrative levels, must relinquish a large degree of control."
"Secondly, it is important to ensure that the Commission has an adequate number of qualified staff to carry out the operations about which decisions are being made."
"I know, Commissioner Patten, that this is the direction your politics are taking right now."
"I would just emphasise that it is a matter of urgency."
"If there are no rapid improvements, I fear that the Commission' s support for development cooperation will gradually disappear."
"That would be a pity, given that well-developed multilateral cooperation has many advantages and that the Union needs such an instrument in order to be able to play a proactive role on the international stage."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office's speech seemed to me to be rather on the biased and general side, but I found that Commissioner Patten's speech was realistic and focused well on the different problem areas."
"We therefore now need to discuss the different issues."
"Firstly, tomorrow marks the start of a major UN session where 159 Heads of State will be present."
"In what form will the European Union be present and at what level?"
"I feel that it is extremely important for us to establish ourselves at the very highest level and to make our presence felt."
"A discussion on priorities should include economic policy, but our economic policies are all inward-looking and only concern the interior of Europe."
"It is also just as important not to let go of development policy, for that creates stability and peace and has to target Russia and China as well as developing countries."
"In my opinion, it is not right to ask us to choose between the Balkans and developing countries."
"The Member States need to take these factors on board."
"Working towards constitutionalisation of the European Union, one benefit of which would be institutional citizenship in international bodies, the creation of a European diplomacy as per the Galeote report, the cultural concern which we must take on board in order to avoid fresh incidents of colonialism, the support and valuing of democratic processes which have also been established in certain countries such as Iran, and the regulation of relations with NGOs, which could become the operational arm of the European Union - these options could all contribute to an effective political initiative for developing countries, an initiative which would assert the supremacy of European civilisation in terms of a quest for solidarity to improve quality of life and bear witness to respect for human dignity, celebrating it in every corner of the world."
"Mr President-in-Office, this morning you mentioned the report Parliament has asked me to present on Turkey' s accession process."
"I think I can announce the body of the conclusions today."
"Like the Commission, Parliament salutes Turkey' s endeavours in drawing up a programme for developing its legal arsenal to comply more closely with the requirements of the European Union, especially in terms of respect for human rights."
"At the same time we understand the stir caused among the various political parties and public opinion as it recognises the magnitude of the reforms that country must agree to introduce before it joins the Union."
"We want our partners to know that the European Union has no intention of interfering in their domestic affairs, but is offering them a contract under terms now redefined under the accession partnership and the agreement on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is up to them to accept or refuse that contract."
"In that connection, I believe we must have the courage to tell the Turkish people that there are at least two prior conditions governing its accession to Europe. First, respect for the need for identity."
"This is being demonstrated across Europe by our fellow citizens all the more clearly because they have the greatest desire to protect their roots in the face of the ineluctable progress of globalisation."
"Europe is resolute in recognising that need for identity, aware that its diversity is the source of its wealth."
"That is why it insists on the rights, but also the duties, of minorities. That is the spirit in which the Union proposes to help Turkey find a solution to the Kurdish problem."
"There must also be a solution to the Cyprus problem as soon as possible, because nobody in Europe would accept a wall continuing to divide it, like those of Berlin, Beirut and Sarajevo (amongst others), which have now, fortunately, come down."
"Mr President, our debate today reveals a continuing difficulty at the heart of the European Union's approach on foreign policy."
"Is the intention to give an enlarging group of European nations a stronger voice on the world stage and improve the coordination and effectiveness of their policies on a range of issues?"
"If so, I can support this."
"Or is the ambition to move towards a European state, with its own foreign and security policy backed by its own diplomatic service and army?"
"This concept I wholeheartedly reject."
"It is certainly not wanted by the British people, nor, I believe, is it wanted by many of the citizens in the rest of Europe."
"They have never been asked in honest terms."
"Mr Patten today reiterated his view that for the indefinite future there will be national foreign ministers."
"But this is only half the problem."
"What will be the content of their jobs in ten years' time if the EU continues on its present course?"
"After all, once EMU is fully established there will still be finance ministers in the euroland countries."
"But how much real responsibility will they have?"
"Clearly there are many in this House who are quite open in their advocacy of a single foreign ministry for Europe and the Galeote Quecedo report which was voted on today with its proposals for a permanent Community diplomatic service is, I am afraid, a step in this direction."
"I am also concerned by the extent to which many want to define European foreign policy in terms of its distinctiveness from the United States policies, sometimes even deliberate hostility to the United States positions."
"A priority for the European Union must surely be to break out of this antagonistic mindset and instead seek, as a primary aim, to contribute to western solidarity."
"The best forum for dealing with security policy issues is NATO rather than the European Union and the danger is that the common European security and defence policy, with its emphasis on an autonomous capability, will undermine the alliance which served us so well during more threatening times."
"Mr President, some of us have asked the President-in-Office and Commissioner Patten specific questions."
"I realise the debate has been particularly badly organised, being split into two halves, but could we at least have written responses?"
"This is certainly an option, and I assume that the Commissioner as well as the Minister would be prepared to reply to the Parliament in writing."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that we have no time left today to continue the debate and allow responses."
"At the end of these explanations, I have received six motions for resolutions in accordance with Article 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"Financial year 2001"
"The next item is the submission by the Council of the draft budget for the financial year 2001."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Patten for being here."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today, on behalf of the Council Presidency, it is my honour to present the draft budget of the European Communities, as drawn up by the Council on 20 July."
"As you know, my colleague Florence Parly chaired that Council, but unfortunately she cannot be here today, so please accept her apologies."
"First of all, I would like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by the Portuguese Presidency ahead of the Council' s adoption, at first reading, of the draft budget for 2001."
"I would also like to highlight the excellent climate in which this budgetary procedure has opened."
"This year, the provisions of the new interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 have taken full effect."
"The first session under the trialogue procedure bringing together the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission was held on 6 July, here in Strasbourg, and demonstrated its usefulness in terms of better mutual understanding of our respective positions and priorities."
"The conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council, which took place on 20 July, was, I think, very positive."
"In particular, it became possible to find a great many points of agreement between institutions and make good progress on potential sources of disagreement."
"I hope we can continue to work in the same spirit and produce a budget for the European Communities for the financial year 2001 which gives us the resources to meet the priorities and challenges the European Union is about to face."
"Firstly, I want to set out the major guidelines which have determined the way the Council has drawn up this draft budget before going into more detail - though not at length - on the various categories."
"In the first place, the Council has ensured proper funding, after identifying clear priorities and real needs, for the European Union' s various actions, especially those in the area of external relations, which we were talking about just now - albeit with a gap."
"So the evaluation of the likely implementation of the appropriations has been taken into account for commitment appropriations."
"The Council has also paid special attention to the development of payment appropriations, setting their increase compared with 2000 at a maximum rate of 3.5%, which in particular takes account of the capacity for implementation and the probable rate of payments entailed by the balances to be settled."
"That growth, which is much higher than the Member States authorise for their national budgets, plus the forecast inflation for 2001, is a mark of the Council' s determination to ensure satisfactory financing of all European Union policies."
"Finally, this draft budget remains totally in keeping with the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure."
"In particular the Council felt it was absolutely essential to respect - and I stress this - each of the annual expenditure ceilings set by the financial perspectives which our three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, signed up to a year ago."
"Those are the bases for the draft budget for the financial year 2001, drawn up by the Council on 20 July, to provide for EUR 95.9 billion in commitment appropriations, an increase of 2.7% over the budget for 2000, and EUR 92.5 billion in payment appropriations, an increase of 3.5% over the budget for 2000."
"Particular importance has been accorded to the increase in the importance of appropriations for aid to the Western Balkans, a repeatedly affirmed priority and one I reaffirm here, because I do not accept the comment earlier about 'chaos' ."
"The situation is sensitive, but not chaotic."
"There is work to be done, and work is being done."
"The Council hopes to convert this priority into figures with a total appropriation 30% higher than in 2000."
"The EUR 614 million adopted by the Council will ensure funding of all foreseeable needs."
"I would add - and of course this is important in our discussions - that it has been possible to earmark such a significant amount without having to revise the financial perspectives aimed at strengthening category 4, as proposed by the Commission."
"The Council has also ensured the funding of all the European Union' s other policy priorities."
"Without launching into an exhaustive description of the Council' s draft budget, which is in any case the subject of the detailed explanatory statement circulated to you, I would now like to present the Council' s 2001 draft budget decisions in a rather more specific way, that is, by category of expenditure."
"First, as regards category 1 of the financial perspectives relating to agricultural expenditure, the draft budget provides for an increase in commitment appropriations of 6.3% in relation to 2000 in order to fund the CAP reform agreed by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999."
"Nevertheless, for sub-category 1a of the financial perspectives, covering CAP market expenditure, the Council decided on figures some EUR 330 million lower in total than those proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft."
"In fact, there is under-implementation of these appropriations every year."
"The Council therefore felt that it could achieve a reduction by targeting some traditionally underspent budget lines."
"By doing so, it is also demonstrating the will to make special efforts to achieve significant savings in the compulsory expenditure and not just in non-compulsory expenditure."
"The savings made, in comparison with the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, do not prevent the Council providing for an increase, which also responds to Parliament' s concerns, in two budgetary lines: for the distribution of milk to schoolchildren, which I know has been the subject of massive correspondence for more than a year now, and promotion of product quality."
"For expenditure related to rural development, taking account of the delays which have built up in the approval and implementation of national rural development plans, the Council felt that a margin of EUR 225 million, under the ceiling of sub-category 1b of the financial perspectives, could be earmarked."
"The development of these appropriations, however, shows an increase of 4.6% compared with 2000, an increase which reflects the priority the Council accords the appropriations allocated to what now constitutes a second pillar of the CAP."
"So the draft budget drawn up by the Council includes margins available under the ceilings of sub-categories 1a and 1b of the financial perspectives."
"However, I want to specify that the Council is, of course, prepared to re-examine agricultural expenditure this autumn in the light of the content of the letter of amendment the Commission will be presenting and to reconsider, at that time, developments in market and rural development expenditure."
"As regards structural actions, covered by category 2 of the financial perspectives, the Council has budgeted this whole category as commitment appropriations in line with the conclusions of the Berlin European Council of March 1999 and, in addition, it has renewed all the payment appropriations entered in 2000."
"But it hoped to increase the Cohesion Fund allocations by some EUR 360 million over provision in the Commission' s preliminary draft, to take account of the forecasts for implementation of these credits in the Member States."
"On category 3 of the financial perspectives relating to the funding of internal policies, the Council was primarily intent on ensuring the appropriate funding for the multiannual programmes while respecting, where applicable, the programming decided jointly with Parliament."
"That is why it has accepted the amounts requested by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget for the framework programme for research and development as well as for the trans-European networks."
"It has done the same with regard to the appropriations requested to improve the financial environment of SMEs and the start up of the LIFE 3 programme."
"The Council believes the right amount has been identified to get the LIFE 3 programme off to a good start."
"As regards the extension of the 'Employment' initiative, agreed by Parliament to strengthen the employment dynamic begun by the Amsterdam European Council, the conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council held on 20 July demonstrated that this subject represents a priority for both our institutions for the 2001 budget, especially in terms of building on the conclusions of the Feira European Council."
"However, the Council is waiting for the assessment of the previous initiative soon to be delivered by the Commission with a view to seeking agreement with Parliament about its funding in the context of a global agreement during the second reading."
"Furthermore, it has identified a precautionary margin of EUR 208 million more than the one in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, the objective being to have enough room for manoeuvre over and above a necessary margin under the ceiling of category 3 to deal with the new priorities shared by the Council and by Parliament, such as the 'employment' initiative I mentioned earlier."
"I now come to the financing of the European Union external actions covered by category 4 of the financial perspectives."
"I do not need to remind you, after the debate we had just now, of the high priority the Council accords to aid to the Western Balkans. Here, as I have already indicated, the draft budget provides for an increase of 30% in comparison with 2000."
"The EUR 614 million adopted by the Council will be enough to finance all the foreseeable needs."
"This figure is based on the only evaluation of needs currently available, set out in the 1999 World Bank report on rebuilding Kosovo."
"Wishing to be pragmatic, the Council is renewing but not increasing the appropriations intended for Serbia, as it is not yet eligible for Community assistance beyond the aid for democracy and civil society included in this envelope."
"In general, the Council would like to see the implementation of effective and credible intervention in the region, based on an analysis of needs, adaptation of levels and types of aid to the nature of those needs, and distribution of effort between all the bilateral and multilateral donors."
"As regards the other budget titles, although the Council has maintained the major allocations, for a limited number of budgetary lines it has not retained all the appropriations the Commission asked for in its preliminary draft budget."
"I am thinking in particular of the TACIS programme, the funding of KEDO, the international fisheries agreements, the rapid reaction arrangements and the MEDA programme."
"On the other hand, the Council has kept to the Commission' s preliminary draft for the vast majority of the other cooperation programmes."
"However I want to emphasise, as regards the MEDA programme, that the draft budget provides for an amount of EUR 701 million which is higher than the annual average allocation over the period 1995-1999."
"The reduction of EUR 150 million made by the Council in comparison with what the Commission is asking for, takes account of the stock of still unpaid commitments still on this programme, and that represents several years of implementation."
"I take this opportunity to remind you of the Council' s determination to contribute to better management of the programme, an indispensable prior condition, in our view, to enhancing our efforts."
"Despite this reduction - motivated by the need to reabsorb the outstanding balance - the MEDA programme naturally remains very important to the Council."
"The French Presidency' s objective is to achieve the adoption of the new multiannual regulation for MEDA soon and it will in particular be listening to the European Parliament on this subject."
"I would also like to reaffirm the Council' s commitment to the accession process for Cyprus and Malta, and here I want to congratulate Mr Morillon on the conclusions of his report, which he outlined earlier."
"We look forward to reading the report with interest, not to say impatience."
"Consequently we have followed the Commission by grouping the appropriations asked for together under the heading of 'pre-accession strategy' ."
"However we have not followed up the Commission' s proposal for a revision of the financial perspectives, transferring these appropriations to category 7, and we have kept them in category 4."
"Finally, I want to express my satisfaction that agreement was reached at the conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council on 20 July on the amount of the appropriations to be included for the CFSP, as well as the transfer of the administrative expenses for CFSP special representatives, to the Council' s budget, in accordance with the institutional agreement of 1999."
"This agreement has given rise to the drafting of two joint declarations, one of which specifies that the sums included in the Council' s budget under the heading of CFSP administrative expenses should take account of their impact on the general position for category 5, while the other commits the Council to ensuring that the estimates for administrative costs anticipated for each new CFSP decision are transmitted in good time to the other branch of the budgetary authority."
"As you can appreciate, the Council has therefore tried to fund the various priorities in the field of European Union external actions appropriately and in doing so it has earmarked a margin of EUR 184 million under the ceiling of category 4 of the financial perspectives."
"In drawing up its draft budget for the administrative expenditure covered by category 5 of the financial perspectives, the Council has been concerned to stabilise current expenditure, while taking account of the exceptional needs of the institutions, especially as regards staff for the Anti-fraud Office and the Court of Justice."
"As regards the Commission' s budget, the Council did not make any decision in July, as it was awaiting the letter of amendment from the Commission which has just been presented, so the Council will now be examining that proposal and applying the lessons from the reorganisation work headed up by Neil Kinnock."
"The Council is ready to do whatever is necessary to examine this letter of amendment so that its incidence can be taken into account as from first reading by the European Parliament."
"To that end, there is a margin of EUR 113 million under the ceiling of category 5 of the financial perspectives."
"I wish to conclude this overview of the various categories of expenditure with the expenditure on pre-accession aid."
"For these the Council has kept the Commission' s figure for commitment appropriations."
"For payment appropriations, the Council has adjusted the Commission' s preliminary draft budget figure downward by EUR 300 million."
"In line with the logic prevailing for the other categories, the Council has taken maximum account of the substantial underspend of these appropriations in 2000."
"Despite this reduction compared with the Commission' s preliminary draft, the pre-accession payment appropriations recorded a strong increase of 10.8% compared with 2000, which again reflects the importance accorded this expenditure as absolutely vital to the proper preparation of our major political aim, the enlargement, a priority shared by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Naturally, I wish to take this opportunity to say that I am sure the discussion between Mr Verheugen and the European Parliament, tomorrow, will make it possible to eliminate a number of misunderstandings."
"I know Günther Verheugen well, I know how committed he is to enlargement and how hard he is working for its success."
"Before I end, I would like to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am about the agreement reached, at the conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council on 20 July, on a statement on financial programming."
"Under the terms of this joint declaration, the Commission will now be obliged to evaluate the financial consequences of each of its new proposals, in particular for categories 3 and 4 of the financial perspectives."
"I am sure that will be a fundamental factor in clarifying the decisions of the budgetary authority."
"Anyway it will undoubtedly mean better budgetary forecasting and should be extremely useful during future budgetary procedures."
"To conclude this overview, which I think has been as brief as it could be, I think, the draft budget being forwarded to you offers a balanced compromise whereby the European Union' s priorities can be funded while absolutely fundamentally respecting the Berlin financial perspectives - and we all know that it was not easy task to define them."
"The 1999 interinstitutional agreement established conciliation between the institutions in the course of the budgetary procedure, and we are all bound to benefit this year and in the future."
"In this connection, I am pleased with the progress we were already able to make, even before adoption of the draft budget at first reading by the Council, in bringing together the points of view of the institutions."
"It seems to me that the draft I have just presented to you draws a number of lessons from that conciliation."
"In any case I hope it gives you a good foundation for starting your work on the budget and that it will contribute to the establishment of a budget for 2001 which respects the priorities of each of the institutions, one which is satisfactory in terms of our joint mission, fulfilling our responsibilities towards Europe and its peoples."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, you will shortly be adopting two regulations that are highly significant in budgetary terms, one being the regulation on budgetary discipline in the agricultural sector, and the other being the regulation on own resources, that is to say, the financing of the budget."
"On behalf of the Commission, I am able to tell you that we are most satisfied with the outcome of the discussions, and are delighted that these two difficult matters will soon be resolved."
"However, the Commission takes a dim view of the outcome of the Council' s discussions on Budget 2001."
"Accordingly, I am bound to contradict the assessment of the President-in-Office."
"At first reading, the Council concentrated largely on cutting payment appropriations right across the board."
"The end result was the lowest draft budget of the past ten years, when considering the budget in relation to the EU' s Gross National Product."
"Now I have already made it clear to this august Chamber on numerous occasions that the Commission considers budgetary discipline to be an extremely important guiding principle, but the Council' s approach, i.e. to cut payment appropriations irrespective of the level of commitments entered into in the past which are due for payment, does not constitute sound budgetary policy."
"The Council' s draft budget would cause the following to happen: the payment of arrears, i.e. the arrears of commitments entered into which have not yet been paid, would continue to mount up."
"The Commission, on the other hand, supported by Parliament, would like to achieve the reverse, that is to reduce the arrears."
"I believe that since we are in the happy position in the European Union of having an economy with high growth rates, now is the time to cut the arrears back, not add to them."
"The Council has cut payment appropriations in the agricultural policy sphere by more than half a billion euro compared with the Commission' s draft."
"This beggars belief considering the fierce criticism that certain of the larger Member States have levelled at the Commission, because we proposed to release EUR 300 million from agricultural policy in order to make the necessary payments in the Balkans available."
"Obviously the Council now considers there to be far greater scope for making cuts in agricultural expenditure, but it is not prepared to make the funds available for the new external policy priorities for the Balkans."
"As happened last year, there was a very heated discussion on how much aid should be made available for the Balkans, and I would remind you that during the discussions on Budget 2000, the Council took the line that it would not be possible to release the appropriations for Kosovo in any case."
"Indeed, all the appropriations for Kosovo have in fact been tied up already."
"The Kosovo agency for reconstruction is proving highly successful in its work, and that is surely something we should all support."
"I would like briefly to take up the matter of Serbia, which you also mentioned in your speech."
"The fact that no provision has been made for Serbia in the draft budget, or only to a very limited extent, sends out the wrong message in my view."
"We find ourselves in a situation where we are competing in political terms with the dictator Milosevic, and we must convince the people that the European Union is willing to provide assistance."
"I am standing firm on this: by the end of 2001 we should have EUR 800 million more at our disposal for the Western Balkans than we do at present."
"Part of this could perhaps be made additionally available before the end of this year."
"I hope to enlist your support in this matter."
"Another word on foreign policy: the Budget Council has cut the funding for the Mediterranean programme - which is also something you mentioned - by EUR 150 million."
"Putting these cuts into effect would no longer just be a budgetary policy measure though, it would also constitute a change in the foreign policy in this field, a renunciation of the Barcelona process."
"The Commission believes this to be unacceptable."
"Turning now to administrative expenditure, i.e. staffing expenditure: I would point out that the Commission did not request any new posts in its draft preliminary budget, apart from those for OLAF, the European anti-fraud agency."
"We have now submitted a letter of amendment containing two key points: firstly a request for 400 new posts for the Commission with effect from the year 2001, and secondly, budgetary measures which will enable us to do without the vast majority of Technical Assistance Offices, as per Parliament' s request, and, in particular, that of the Committee on Budgets."
"I have just this to say about the requests for more posts: at the beginning of this year, the Commission set up a working group under the leadership of the President of the Commission, at my recommendation, which examined the tasks performed by all departments and completed a critical examination of the staffing situation."
"We ascertained where there was scope for reallocation of staff within and between the departments, with a view to improving the availability of resources for the key areas and for the political priorities, and in order to ascertain where we need to create new posts."
"Our findings are now available to you."
"The Commission has estimated that we need 1254 new posts for key activities and political priorities."
"We can create a vast number of these 1254 new posts through reallocation, which will mean requesting a total of 717 new posts - 400 in the year 2001 and 317 in the year 2002 - particularly if we are to strengthen the areas of external assistance, health and consumer protection and environmental policy, as well as justice and internal affairs."
"In addition, we have proposed a one-off early retirement scheme for 600 posts, organised in such a way as to have no impact on the budget, which would drastically reduce the need for new posts."
"As an interim solution - particularly for the purposes of external assistance - we would ask the budgetary authority to allow us, until such time as a new administrative structure is created, to use the funding that has been available hitherto for the Technical Assistance Offices, for contract staff within the Commission."
"We would also like to increase funding for the delegations, which are to be more actively involved in the administration of external assistance in future."
"The Commission has learnt from past mistakes, which boils down to making clear the fact that the Commission cannot perform miracles; all it can do is make it its business to perform to a high standard. And if we are to acquit ourselves well of our tasks, we need the necessary resources, including the necessary staffing resources."
"On a final note, it is fair to say that there are very testing times ahead again for all those involved in the budgetary discussions."
"I hope we all find the energy and patience we need during this period to meet each other halfway and bring these discussions to a satisfactory conclusion."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"We will certainly need energy and patience."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am the rapporteur for the so-called remaining sections of the Budget."
"This subject matter will seem somewhat dry after the eloquent presentation delivered by the Chairman of our Committee on Budgets."
"I believe that whilst the small budgets may not be quite as fascinating in terms of policy areas, they are not without interest when it comes to the question as to how organisational and staffing resources can be used to guarantee the effectiveness of the institutions of the European Union."
"I have a few comments to make on the Council' s first reading in this respect, which I have already submitted to the Committee on Budgets in the form of a discussion paper."
"I will start with the European Court of Justice."
"The Council has recognised the difficult situation facing the Court in relation to the translations backlog, and has proposed that 47 new posts be created."
"At the same time, however, the across-the-board cut was increased from 2.5% to 5.1%, which means that these newly created posts cannot be filled."
"I believe this is a contradiction-in-terms which has still to be resolved."
"As rapporteur, I will duly prepare proposals to this end."
"The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the funding for the freelance translator reserves, which we need so badly in order to clear the backlog, have also been cut."
"In other words, for all the Council may have recognised the problem, this is not reflected in the budget in concrete figures."
"I have taken a very detailed look at the promotion systems of all the institutions, and I have noticed that the Court of Justice has now followed suit and established a promotion model based on demonstrable merit."
"Switching over to a new system at the European Court of Justice will necessitate creating a large number of higher grades, which is something we have no hope of achieving within a year."
"However, we must tackle this over the next few years."
"This is another issue that the Council failed to take into account at first reading."
"Turning now to the European Court of Auditors."
"The only question that remains to be answered here, relates to the financing of the Court of Auditor' s new building in Luxembourg."
"For reasons that are beyond me, the Council has cut the funding for 2001 from EUR 7 million to EUR 5 million."
"During discussions at the Court of Auditors, I was assured that the total cost requirement of EUR 25 million at 1998 prices will not be exceeded."
"I therefore think it would be of more benefit to the European tax payer if the payments were to be made once the respective invoices have been received."
"I will propose to the Committee on Budgets that we redeploy the Court of Auditors' proposal."
"I shall now move on to the Economic and Social Committee."
"My guiding principle for the budgetary procedure for 2001 can be summed up by the following new High German expression: value for money."
"Needless to say, the same holds true for the Economic and Social Committee."
"The ECSC' s working method and public image are extremely dubious."
"Hence my proposals are geared towards raising the productivity of the Economic and Social Committee."
"In particular, the promotion policy of the Economic and Social Committee requires careful scrutiny."
"I hope that, as budgetary authorities, we will be able to put our heads together and come up with ideas that will lend the necessary weight to the ECSC' s endeavours in this field."
"We should also reflect on the role of the Secretariat of the Economic and Social Committee."
"The ECSC currently derives all its expertise from outside experts."
"However, I ask myself whether that should be the aim of such an institution' s work."
"That is something else we need to discuss."
"The same applies to the Committee of the Regions."
"Here too it is my goal, under the 'value for money' maxim, to promote the overall productivity of the committee through a variety of measures."
"I am only able to mention one interesting aspect."
"The committee has asked for an increase in the funding required to cover the travel and subsistence costs incurred by regional representatives of candidate countries attending plenary sittings as observers."
"We have placed part of this money for the financial year 2000 in reserve."
"To date, there has been no application for us to release these funds."
"At the same time, however, the Committee of the Regions has declared that it has need of more funds for the year 2001."
"My response will be to propose that these funds should also be placed in reserve, because the need for funding allocations is evidently by no means as pressing as we are always given to believe during budgetary negotiations."
"I only have a very brief comment to make in respect of the Ombudsman."
"There is not a great deal to add here."
"The Council has grasped the nettle and we support them in this."
"I will not submit any further proposals on this matter."
"To sum up: overall, we are being very sparing with the European tax payer' s money in performing our role as part of the budgetary authority."
"It is imperative that we take the same line for the administrative budget."
"There are major tasks in store for us over the next few years."
"We are in a position to create financial leeway for 2001, which we will hopefully be able to turn to good account when it comes to dealing with the administrative side of enlargement."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, Commissioner, honourable members, as the last person to speak on this agenda item, all I can do of course is make a few points and reiterate a few things that have already been said."
"But as you are all yourselves aware, repetition is the only way to learn."
"First of all, I would like to thank the Council for the constructive cooperation it has provided throughout the year' s trialogues and in all the conciliation meetings."
"However, it is not just the current Council Presidency that I should like to thank, but also the previous one, the Portuguese Presidency, for creating a thoroughly cordial atmosphere despite all the differences of opinion."
"I shall therefore deliver the good news first: compared with this year' s budget, both the Commission and the Council - albeit only temporarily - have proposed a total reduction of EUR 144 million in the budgetary lines for employment."
"But Parliament has already made it clear in its guidelines that the issue of job creation is very close to our hearts, and that one of our first priorities in internal policy is to fight unemployment in Europe."
"This is our determined aim, our goal, and we gave renewed expression to it in our resolution of July."
"We have always found the Council ready to listen, both under the Portuguese and now under the French Presidency."
"Accordingly, not only did the Council declare, in the course of the conciliation procedure, that it was willing to support our job creation initiative through suitable instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises, we have also agreed to come to an understanding, in the course of the budgetary procedure, on an amount within the meaning of number 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, which we intend to use to achieve our goal."
"So far, so good."
"So what exactly are the problematic areas?"
"Where do Parliament and the Council differ?"
"In view of the limited amount of time available to us all, allow me to mention just two."
"Firstly there is the manner in which the Council seeks to finance those policies where there is fundamental agreement."
"As Parliament made clear last year, we believe it is necessary to undertake a multiannual revision of Category 4 in order to meet the requirements for reconstruction aid in the Balkans in a stable and secure manner."
"The Council flatly refuses to countenance such a revision of the Financial Perspective."
"It obviously prefers a hand-to-mouth existence."
"No revision!"
"That is the name of the game."
"The Council has obviously made this its guiding principle, for how else are we to interpret the fact that it persists in refusing to commit the funds for the pre-accession countries Cyprus and Malta to Chapter 7 of the pre-accession strategy?"
"After all, that is where they belong logically, and in terms of content."
"But the Council does not want there to be a revision, even if it is not bound up with a financial amendment."
"As a Parliament, we now have an extremely difficult decision before us with respect to Category 4."
"The second major bone of contention is the Council' s tendency to focus time and again, in the course of its budgetary readings, on payment appropriations alone."
"The Commissioner made the same point."
"I cannot say whether it is because of our institutional view, or whether it also says something about our personally held views, that we both majored on this in our criticism."
"The Council' s declared aim was an increase in expenditure for 2001 of only 3.5% in comparison with the figures for the current budget."
"The outcome is a draft budget in which the ratio of commitments to payments is no longer sound."
"For example, on closer inspection, it is possible to discern that the commitments for 2001 are not matched with adequate payment appropriations."
"In category 2, for example, the commitments are covered to a mere 2.1%."
"In categories 3, 4 and 7 the situation looks better, but still not good."
"In many lines of the draft budget, the payments do not even cover a quarter of the commitments."
"In quite a few lines, no payments whatsoever have been earmarked for the commitments for 2001."
"This no longer has a great deal to do with serious budgetary management."
"I need hardly emphasise again that the Interinstitutional Agreement - which, incidentally, we concluded only 1¼ years ago - sets out as a matter of course, at various points, that there should be an orderly working out of the European Union' s expenditure, which should be regarded as being closely linked with the working out of the commitments."
"In fact it means that a strict relationship should be preserved between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations."
"The Council is neglecting this close relationship in the most criminal way."
"Its aim is to reduce expenditure."
"It argues that, at the end of the day, the Member States have to put their national budgets in order too."
"That is all well and good, but it must not be allowed to bring our own common European budget into disorder from the very outset."
"Aids"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Aids."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, I shall indeed try to do as you say and talk about Aids."
"Well, as you know, the Aids pandemic currently affects 33.6 million people, the majority of them living in developing countries."
"According to UNAIDS, 5.6 million new cases and 2.6 million deaths were notified in 1999, including 50% women."
"The epidemic has already wiped out the achievements of thirty years of development aid in the most affected countries."
"The most tragic consequences are in Africa."
"The African continent finally had the professionals and experts it so lacked at the time of independence."
"Now the disease has taken a heavy toll among those trained adults of working age."
"We cannot ignore the immense loss of human investment this first generation of victims represents, a loss which goes beyond the personal tragedy suffered by the sick and their families."
"Nor do we forget the poorest and most destitute who are still deprived of treatment."
"No one can forget the testimony of Judge Edwin Cameron, a white, homosexual, HIV positive man on the bench of the South African High Court."
"He courageously came forward at the opening of the plenary session of the International AIDS Conference in Durban last July."
"Only his social standing and income give him access to the treatment which is unfortunately inaccessible to the majority of his compatriots."
"His testimony illustrates African injustice."
"For around a decade, Africa has committed itself courageously to a difficult process of reform and structural adjustment."
"But the epidemic is putting a heavy burden on the care system, making the modernisation of the health sector even more difficult."
"Just when attempts are being made to establish methods of funding to guarantee better, more permanent services, the monstrous burden of AIDS falls on communities already assailed by the economic crisis, underdevelopment, an inadequate health structure and the lack of a social security system."
"So the issue of HIV-AIDS lies at the very heart of sustainable development."
"Aids decimates societies, threatens future generations and compromises economic growth."
"The members of the UN Security Council now regard the issue as an absolute priority."
"Beyond Africa, the pandemic is global."
"Thirty-five million people live with the virus, but fewer than 500 000 have access to antiretroviral treatments."
"It has to be recognised that, even here, there is a deep gulf between rich and poor."
"Inequality of opportunity in terms of access to treatment, intolerable in itself, is all the more repugnant today because information circulates, and circulates fast, on this planet."
"Today everyone knows these treatments exist."
"Humanely, morally and politically it is not only desirable but crucial to seek solutions jointly with developing countries, which are suited to their situation, take account of their potential, and help them improve accessibility to these treatments, while pursuing cooperation in the areas of education, health, prevention, and the training of local medical staff."
"The European Union has been aware since the beginning of the 1980s, of the need to give the developing countries practical assistance in the fight against HIV-AIDS, putting respect for the people affected, in particular the most vulnerable, at the centre of its concerns."
"Hence it has participated in implementing actions in the areas of transfusion safety, information campaigns, raising young people' s awareness, creation of documentation and information centres, as well as training and medical and social security benefits."
"Some countries, France in particular, are also involved in initiatives to facilitate access to treatment."
"The International Therapeutic Solidarity Fund has obtained encouraging initial results for the two access to medication programmes started in 1999 in Ivory Coast and Morocco."
"New programmes are now being launched in Senegal, Vietnam and South Africa."
"Even though these only affect a few individuals out of the millions of people in need, we feel sure they are contributing to international mobilisation and bringing in their wake the benefits of partnership and shared know-how."
"Their effects are already apparent in the mother-child prevention programmes set up by UNAIDS and UNICEF."
"So the international context is evolving."
"The United Nations, its agencies and the World Bank are mobilising to strengthen international therapeutic solidarity."
"An important, even historic, agreement has been concluded between WHO, UNAIDS and five pharmaceutical companies."
"It means the price of medication used to treat Aids can be reduced."
"Similarly, the recent decision to make nevirapine, an antiretroviral molecule effective in the prevention of mother-child transmission, freely available adds credibility to that agreement, because it proves that this is not just an announcement, and the pharmaceutical industry really can take practical action."
"Finally, many countries are recognising that the indebtedness of developing countries is an intolerable burden on their economies and acts as a brake on their capacity to combat poverty effectively, let alone the pandemic."
"France has taken specific steps to cancel that debt, while encouraging development and health education."
"Such initiatives show that the mobilisation of the international community is strengthening, and it must not slacken."
"But this is just a first stage in the struggle against the Aids pandemic."
"At the international congress last July in Durban, on African territory, researchers, health professionals, non-governmental organisation campaigners and political leaders, were all unanimous in emphasising the urgency of the situation."
"Contact with helpless health professionals, the resigned distress of mothers who have infected their own children, the powerlessness of the health authorities to act, visiting a paediatric hospital - all that further convinced me of the extent of the gulf between the inhabitants of the countries of the South and their fellow human beings who chanced to be born in our own countries."
"New commitment is necessary."
"We are convinced of that."
"International aid must be strengthened urgently in the fight against HIV-AIDS."
"Coordination of all resources at all levels remains one of the top priorities for international aid within the framework of the strategies defined at international level, in partnership with national Aids programmes and other donors."
"We must urgently strengthen prevention programmes, improve the research effort geared to developing countries and give all patients real access to treatment."
"Besides making antiretroviral medication available at reasonable prices to local health systems, access to treatment implies strengthening training actions, structural aid and support to patients' associations."
"Admittedly, mother-child transmission prevention programmes remain essential, but there is still a need for massive implementation of projects to provide access to treatment for chronic infection, because who is going to raise these children after we have saved them from infection?"
"Access to medication poses complex ethical, medical and socio-economic problems, even political and cultural problems, which we must try to overcome by respecting the people we are dealing with and regarding them as partners to cooperate with."
"Major cooperation must be established between donors, recipients, the pharmaceutical industry and associations to provide the operational systems for access to treatment."
"Several initiatives have been launched."
"First, a Commission round table will be held in September on Aids, tuberculosis and malaria."
"A Japanese conference will also be held in the context of the G8 this autumn on these three diseases."
"Finally, there is a proposal for a United Nations General Assembly Special Session to be devoted to Aids before May 2002."
"The presidency will support these initiatives to find lasting solutions to the problem of global and respectful responsibility for people suffering from the disease, by means of practical projects and partnership agreements with the countries concerned."
"Guaranteeing access to quality treatment, information and the necessary resources for all must be the aim of the European Community."
"Consideration of access to treatment is not new."
"The road is hard, but it must be travelled."
"We cannot succeed without everyone' s participation: the pharmaceutical industry, the bilateral and multilateral donors, and the countries involved."
"We know now that the epidemic can only be overcome through long-term commitment."
"That commitment is all the more necessary because it would not be just immoral and dangerous for development and the progress of humanity, it would threaten world peace and equilibrium if recent advances, especially in treatment, were just to benefit the richest countries."
"The Commission attended the 13th International Aids Conference, which took place in Durban, South Africa, from 7 to14 July 2000."
"The theme of the conference, 'Breaking the Silence', provided a framework which helped to strengthen national and international action against HIV/Aids."
"The conference welcomed scientific progress in addressing Aids, especially news of the first efficacy trials for an Aids vaccine and the evidence that transmission of HIV from mother to infant could be largely prevented by cost-effective use of anti-retroviral drugs."
"Also welcome was information on the many small-scale condom and safe sex empowerment education programmes that have proved their worth in stemming the spread of HIV/Aids."
"I believe that the conference could have given more attention to the lessons of success stories as regards improving and expanding these prevention strategies because information and prevention is in fact the most important ways of fighting Aids."
"Prevention is central to a successful long-term national, international and global response to Aids."
"At the same time a full spectrum of care from basic treatment of opportunistic infections to entry retroviral therapy for HIV infection can no longer be denied to the vast majority of the millions of people infected with the virus."
"The Commission welcomes the new initiatives being taken against HIV/Aids by some countries to produce cheaper generic drugs and would like to offer its support to help such countries provide technical assistance to other developing countries to enable them to pursue such initiatives."
"Possibilities will be further discussed with the countries involved."
"We recognise that the production of generic drugs could greatly improve access to care and treatment for HIV/Aids."
"The statistics of the epidemic are frightening and still getting worse."
"For example, one in four Zimbabweans will die from HIV/Aids, including one in three in the capital, Harare."
"More than a million children are already orphaned by HIV/Aids in Zimbabwe, almost 10% of the population."
"More than half the pregnant women in some areas in Botswana are infected with HIV, and a third of them transmit HIV to their new-born babies during delivery."
"The conference opened up exciting new opportunities and partnerships that will enable people who are vulnerable to HIV infection to gain access to technologies and procedures to make care more affordable for HIV/Aids sufferers and invest in new technologies and products to prevent and treat HIV/Aids."
"These opportunities must be exploited immediately, and the Commission intends to play its part."
"It is accordingly discussing innovative approaches with its developing country partners as well as with other donors."
"We can and must be doing all that we should do about HIV/Aids."
"We can and must also do everything possible to combat other major killer diseases affecting poor people."
"Malaria and tuberculosis, both of which kill more than a million people a year, must assume new importance in our work to reduce poverty and ill-health."
"Accelerated action on the three key communicable diseases - HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis - has been addressed this year by a number of high-level meetings."
"The Commission will shortly submit a communication to the Council and Parliament outlining proposals for accelerated action to improve access to proven key measures and commodities to develop active and effective delivery structures and systems for drugs and increase investment in research into and development of priority drugs and vaccines."
"The communication points especially to the value of bringing condoms, bed nets and other preventive procedures to the poorest and most vulnerable more rapidly and on a sufficiently large scale."
"The European Union accounted for 55% of global development aid in the social sectors in 1997 and has increased its support for health, Aids and population programmes from 1% of our total assistance in 1986 to over 8% at the present time, compared to an OECD average of 5.5%."
"We are therefore focusing more and more on this field."
"Total commitments of EUR 3.4 billion were earmarked for health, Aids and population between 1990 and 1998, none of which was offered as loans."
"This is in clear contrast to the recent offer from the United States to southern Africa."
"The Commission is holding wide-ranging consultations on options for accelerated national and international action and innovative approaches to address these diseases."
"On 28 September, in collaboration with the WHO and UN Aids, it will be hosting an international round table."
"The meeting will consider how a comprehensive approach at national and international level might tackle these three diseases and how we can make a difference."
"Madam President, I should like to express my thanks to the President of the Council and Commissioner Nielson for the statement they gave today with regard to the huge issue of Aids, especially in Africa."
"When, in the early 80s, the full extent of the problem of Aids became clear, the Western world adopted a large number of policies in order to curb the illness and provide sound treatment to those who had contracted the disease."
"A great deal of consideration was also given to prevention and consequently, in most Western countries, the illness failed to develop into the pandemic which was predicted in the 80s."
"Each Aids victim, in Europe too, is one too many, but thank God there are not as many as was feared twenty years ago and survival rates have gradually increased."
"How different is the situation in many Third World countries, especially in Africa!"
"There the tragedy has now exceeded everyone' s expectations."
"Out of the 18 million casualties this illness has claimed worldwide, the majority lived in sub-Saharan Africa, where the average life-span has fallen to under 50 years and will fall still further to 45 years."
"Millions of African children are already having to go through life without parents, millions of families have broken up, millions of children and elderly people are having to manage without the support and care of an ever dwindling part of the generation in between."
"And this is only the humanitarian tragedy."
"Then there is the socio-economic tragedy."
"Economic development is faced with more and more difficulties, investments are not being made because staffing levels are insufficient, schools are losing their teachers and hospitals can no longer cope with the problems."
"In fact, we have to conclude that much of what has been achieved over the past 25 or 30 years in terms of development has been cancelled out by the Aids tragedy, and this is something which should alarm us all the more as the largest provider of aid to Africa."
"What could Europe, the Commission, the European Union do to help Africa?"
"I believe it is not helpful to try to copy European policy in Africa."
"The situation in many African countries does not lend itself to European solutions."
"Instead, we should start with a few positive examples, such that those in Uganda and Senegal, where there are opportunities to stabilise the extent of the illness to some degree."
"And in our opinion, three key concepts apply: information and prevention, affordable treatment, and care of those left behind."
"Information and prevention are essential, and the use of condoms is extremely important in this context."
"As far as treatment is concerned, I believe it is important for the pharmaceutical industry to find affordable alternatives to the medication which is of some help in our Western countries, also where transmission of the illness from mother to child is concerned."
"And as for the care for those left behind, I would draw your attention to the many orphans this illness has already created."
"Finally, the Commission has announced that it will produce a memorandum to solve the problems but, to my mind, we have done too little so far, and the unit which is responsible for this care is too small."
"I therefore hope with all my heart that the memorandum which Commissioner Nielson has announced will offer us a new perspective, with more people at the European Commission who are prepared to tackle this issue, with more coordination at European level and, more than anything, with more funding, because that is what is needed to help Africa leave this misery behind."
"Madam President, in my view an important step was taken at the Durban International Aids Conference: although prevention also remains essential for combating this plague, the issue of access to treatment was finally placed at the heart of the debate."
"Durban made it possible to approach the essential issues - the price of medication and the development of generic medication - frankly, and move forward in our thinking about intellectual property rights and compulsory licences."
"It was about time."
"The conduct of the big drug companies has too often contributed to imposing a two-speed treatment system: medication for the rich and despair for the poor."
"That is why the initiative from the pharmaceutical laboratories on the price of medication, launched on the fringe of the conference, constitutes an encouraging beginning, as long as it was not just announced for effect."
"The G8 Summit at Okinawa has also made it possible to set the seal on the commitment of the rich countries and set targets to lessen the ravages of Aids in Africa over the next ten years, but, unfortunately, the issue of resources was not really dealt with."
"This very day a meeting should be taking place in New York, under the auspices of UNDP, between public and private operators to sign up to and finance the Aids action plan for South Africa."
"There really is a feeling that people are finally beginning to ask the right questions."
"Now perhaps the right answers should be provided."
"Obviously the European Union is not standing on the sidelines of this mobilisation but I think we should step up a gear, and I heard the French Presidency express that hope."
"We eagerly await the Commission' s communication, with guidelines and proposals for combating the major transmissible diseases: Aids of course, but also malaria and tuberculosis."
"Aware that the time has come not just for reflection but for action too, we expect really concrete proposals permitting very rapid progress."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the debates on industrial property rights and compulsory licences."
"I am thinking of the development of the International Therapeutic Solidarity Fund launched to raise international funds to give poor countries access to the new therapies, which must expand."
"I am thinking of the organisation of an international conference involving poor countries, the pharmaceutical industries, the NGOs and the donors."
"Perhaps the round table of 28 September, organised by the Commission, in liaison with WHO and UNAIDS could be the first stage in setting that up?"
"Madam President, I am not going to repeat what has already been said, and said very well, and with very laudable intentions."
"Rather, I am going to try to talk about facts."
"I think the facts, today, are simple."
"The facts are access to treatment and patient care."
"UNAIDS itself acknowledges the ineffectiveness of the programme announced by the pharmaceutical laboratories, which were only trying to improve their image, in fact, and are now withdrawing when it comes to genuine negotiation of a reduction in the price of treatment."
"The issue is no longer donations of medication, necessarily limited in time and subject to the selective interests of the laboratories, but adapting treatment price to purchasing power in the developing countries."
"The European Union must urge the pharmaceutical multinationals to grant voluntary licences, a first step towards access to treatment for the deprived populations."
"If that is not done, the European Union should impose respect for the agreements in case of medical emergency, and require the granting of compulsory licences, which would finally mitigate the problem of the price of treatment."
"I think the agony of a whole continent takes precedence over special interests."
"Madam President, I agree with Mrs Carlotti that the merit of the Durban conference was to make it clear that Aids is not being fought in the same way in Europe and in Africa."
"Aids lays bare all the economic and social deficiencies of developing countries and grafts itself onto the more general problem of destitution."
"Prevention cannot succeed unless it is accompanied by access to treatment."
"So, and here I agree with the previous speaker, the pharmaceutical companies with the monopoly of manufacture and marketing of triple therapy and even AZT charge a high price for them."
"We would not be having this debate if triple therapy cost a dollar."
"And as the director of UNAIDS recognises, we need to increase the amount currently invested tenfold even to make a start on a real policy of prevention and social security."
"Besides, medication cannot be distributed like sacks of rice."
"Doctors, dispensaries and social support structures are needed."
"And, by IMF dictate, poor countries are cutting public expenditure, in particular on education and health."
"The European Union must contribute towards the rapid cancellation of the debt of African countries, which costs them 15 billion annually, so that those resources can be allocated to establishing the health infrastructure and new social programmes."
"Finally, the research priority must be to perfect a vaccine."
"Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List."
"I have taken note of the words of the Council representative to the effect that France will allocate part of the African countries' debt to the fight against Aids."
"This is a major initiative which we hope will be echoed by all the countries of the Union and countries outside the Union as well."
"We call upon the Union to make a contribution as well so that more funds are invested in the fight against Aids in Africa, where 95% of deaths caused by the HIV virus occur."
"It is true that we currently spend USD 300 million per year on Africa, but, at the same time, Africa has a debt of USD 15 billion owed to the industrialised countries."
"I would like to end by drawing attention to the great pervading silence and condemning it: I refer to the campaigns which aim to deter people from using condoms on religious grounds."
"They are requesting people not to use condoms in the name of life, but that is to condemn the children to certain death."
"Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to express my distress at the outcome of the 13th Aids Conference in Durban, South Africa, which is at the very least alarming, and my deep concern for the future of the developing countries, particularly the African countries."
"This new resolution supplements the resolutions tabled last year in Lusaka, Zambia."
"However, sadly, the situation is tragic and has shown no improvement at all recently."
"On the contrary, it is assuming huge proportions if we consider that, in Africa, five people die of Aids every minute."
"The statistics presented by the experts are tragic, including the substantial population decline and the dramatic decrease in life expectancy in Africa, which will fall below the age of 45 by the year 2015."
"In the sub-Saharan area, as many as 10% of the population will be affected by the virus."
"I therefore feel that there is a need for the Commission and the Member States of the Union to make an ad hoc intervention, in consideration of the European Union's major responsibility precisely towards developing countries."
"Indeed, I would argue that we should relate the cancellation of the external debt of the poor countries to the fight against the Aids epidemic, and it is precisely with a view to this that we support the request of the specific programme Debt for Aids contained in the resolution."
"The Cairo EU-Africa Summit on debt cancellation procedures and the Durban Conference are, in fact, closely related."
"The grievous impact of Aids on economic growth and the close relationship between the fight against poverty and the fight against Aids requires coordination and closer and more effective cooperation between the WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations, with the involvement of the civil society of the countries concerned, the local Churches and the non-governmental organisations."
"Madam President, despite significant scientific progress in treating Aids, the Aids epidemic is still ravaging more and more poor countries, thereby compounding problems in dealing with its multiple and serious consequences."
"There is no doubt that preventive measures and treatment over recent years have considerably improved patients' chances of survival in developed countries; however, the same cannot be said of poor countries."
"The spread of the disease has exceeded every worst-case scenario, especially in Africa; as has already been mentioned, five people a minute die from Aids, which has now reached the point at which it is a threat to public health."
"Every day, children infected with this virus are born in these countries due to a complete lack of suitable programmes for mothers-to-be."
"Similarly, the cost of treatment is so high that few patients receive this, their rudimentary right."
"In this context, I think that the proposed reduction in the price of drugs for the victims of Aids in these countries is extremely important and I should like to urge the Commission and the Council to support this endeavour by exerting pressure on pharmaceutical companies."
"Similarly, a concerted effort must be made to develop integrated educational, preventive, treatment and welfare programmes for developing countries, at least until the vaccine is safe to use, which is what we are all hoping for."
"Until then, prevention and therapy are the most important factors in controlling the spread and dealing with the disease and these are services which all citizens should receive, irrespective of where they live."
"Madam President, everyone in this debate has emphasised the importance of preventive measures."
"As we know, there is an old saying, prevention is better than cure."
"With the approximately 15 years' experience we have had of this epidemic - I myself have been active in connection with both the UN and the Red Cross - I can, however, see that we have not listened especially carefully to that saying."
"As long as ten years ago, it was extremely clear how serious this epidemic could become in certain developing countries, but too little was done both in those countries and by the international community."
"It is debatable what the reasons are why this epidemic hit poor countries especially hard, compared with how it affected countries in our own part of the world."
"It obviously has to do with poverty, with lack of information and education, with patterns of sexual behaviour and, specifically, with young girls' lack of education of a kind which would better enable them to resist sexual advances. It also has to do, of course, with the shortage of money within the health care sector."
"I welcome the fact that both Commissioner Nielson and the French Presidency now regard and describe the work on combating the HIV epidemic as a main priority."
"Money is not enough, however. Instead, we must ensure that the Commission obtains a sufficient number of qualified staff so that it is not isolated employees who are trying to push ahead with these issues."
"It is also important to have new kinds of cooperation with the pharmaceuticals industry so that we can produce not only vaccines, but also medicines."
"This applies not only to HIV but also to malaria."
"We need to be guided by innovative thinking in this area."
"When, finally, we talk about partnership, it is, as Commissioner Nielson said, extremely important to seek out whatever proves to have worked and to support it."
"There is a whole host of programmes which are crying out for money and where contributions from the EU could be of use."
"We talk a very great deal about Africa."
"I am afraid that, in five to ten years' time, the situation will be similar and very serious in parts of Asia."
"I welcome Commissioner Nielson' s conference on 28 September 2000 and hope that it will lead to something of a crash programme for tackling these problems still more vigorously in the future."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up the debate on this statement."
"Before closing the debate, I invite the President-in-Office to reply to the debate or at least conclude it."
"Thank you, Madam President, for giving me a moment to say how moving it is to hear such powerful words spoken in this Parliament today, clearly demonstrating that we are of one mind in recognising that Aids truly reveals the state of poverty and injustice reigning on our planet."
"We Europeans have a moral obligation to mobilise and it comes through from all these speeches that we are ready."
"We are very grateful to the Commission for preparing its communication which we impatiently await and which will allow us to pool our energies and unite in a determination to act."
"The time for thinking really is over."
"We must act without delay because this is an emergency, and the French Presidency stands ready to put that determination to act into practice at European level."
"To respond to the immense challenge we face, we need to mobilise all the partners, as I said in my earlier remarks, which drew a wholly positive echo from Parliament."
"I can tell you that the presence on the Durban platform of the Director General of WHO, the European Commission representative and the President of the Health Council created immense hope."
"We have no right to disappoint that hope and I will be at your side."
"We will meet the challenge together."
"We must denounce campaigns of disinformation, combat obscurantism, but not abandon any field of action."
"I believe we must be conscious always of the need to promote information and training, prevention, access to care and treatment, and research - particularly into vaccines and medication."
". I just want to thank you for these contributions."
"We are aware of the enormous challenge facing us."
"Prevention works, but it takes time."
"Uganda is a good illustration of this."
"For us as donors, this means that we have to be able to show what I would call donor stamina."
"We have to be able to continue and to support the right strategies."
"Mr Mantovani said that we should forgive debt and use the money instead to combat Aids."
"When we forgive debt, we have used the money."
"You are suggesting that we use it twice."
"That is a good innovative approach, but still not that easy."
"This is, in fact, why I mentioned that the offer the United States has made is to make available on a loan basis USD 1 billion for buying medicine from US companies."
"That is in my view not the right approach, because it will actually increase the already double problem of Aids and existing debt in African countries."
"That is why I made the point that Europe is actually providing funding that does not increase the debt of our partner countries."
"Finally, I would warn against the dream of a quick fix in terms of new medicine."
"We are supporting this."
"We are trying to crack the code of protective rights for the companies but it is not easy."
"In the meantime, the scale of the costs here makes it more necessary to emphasise prevention rather than cure."
"A cure is still far too expensive."
"I want to thank the President and the Commissioner for their understanding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at12 noon."
"Creating a monitoring centre for industrial change"
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on creating a monitoring centre for industrial change."
"I invite Mrs Péry to speak on behalf of the Council, and I know she will feel at home in this Chamber as she served as Vice-President of Parliament for many years."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say how delighted I am to be speaking here, discovering these acoustics, as this is in fact the first time I have spoken in this Chamber."
"First, I must present apologies from Martine Aubry who very much regrets not being here personally."
"I want to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the parliamentary Group of the Party of European Socialists for the draft resolution to be debated, and the rapporteur, Mr Hughes."
"I very much hope that our debate will contribute to progress on setting up European arrangements for monitoring industrial change, something the French Presidency takes a particular interest in."
"You will note, Commissioner, that I said European arrangements, and I am deliberately non-specific about the name, because it is the principle that is important."
"Before talking about the arrangements themselves, I think it is useful to give a brief review of the context in which this proposal was born."
"The Special European Council in Luxembourg on 21 and 22 November 1997 tasked a high level group of experts with analysing industrial change in the European Union and looking at ways of anticipating and managing change as well as its economic and social repercussions."
"The closure of the Renault Vilvorde plant is still a vivid memory."
"All of us, in our own countries, are experiencing the radicalisation of certain social conflicts reflecting despair - I do mean despair - and incomprehension before the challenges of globalisation."
"In its final report to the European Commission, the group of experts drew up an inventory and made recommendations."
"These include the interesting proposal to the Commission to create a European monitoring centre for industrial change."
"This centre would be a tool to help identify and analyse change in order to anticipate its consequences and ensure positive management of those developments."
"This recommendation was received without comment as to the principle, the monitoring centre being perceived as a tool to assist restructuring, but debate arose around the work on its creation."
"I believe there was also debate in the Commission and amongst both sides of industry."
"I am now being told that positions have moved very close together on both on the tasks and on the structure of the centre, and I think that is a highly important factor."
"Recognising this, and with your help, ladies and gentlemen, we need to create the conditions for rapid establishment of the European monitoring centre for industrial change."
"The acceleration of the process of mergers and acquisitions in Europe is forever prompting us to think about the social and legal aspects of the issues raised."
"The emergence of new information and communication technologies in the organisation of relations between the great principals and their sub-contractors - I am thinking of aeronautics, the motor industry - is bringing in its wake new ways of organising work liable to alter the industrial fabric substantially and promote the arrival of new territorial systems going beyond national frameworks."
"As regards the future of employment, we need clarification to be able to make real forecasts successfully."
"But clarification is also needed for developing vocational training both for learning a trade and for lifelong learning, which should become a right for everyone."
"I very much hope, as the draft resolution underlines, that this will be included in the Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The nature and importance of the social dialogue accompanying these transformations goes hand in hand with the extent of restructuring or technological evolution."
"The European monitoring centre for industrial change may respond to this problem if its tasks and structure are defined in that way."
"The centre should identify and collect information relating to economic, technological, and labour market developments."
"It should also identify and disseminate positive practical solutions to be implemented at various levels and promote exchange of experience on the evolution of and adaptation to change."
"These tasks should respond to the needs of the European institutions, the social partners at all levels, the national and regional institutions and business."
"There remains the question of how this monitoring function should be organised."
"It is useful and necessary to remember that this centre should be a tool, not a place for political decision-making and industrial negotiations, and should be available to the publics I mentioned earlier."
"It must be organised so as to fulfil its missions, and in our opinion that means a light, flexible structure."
"For logistics it could rely on the existing European institutions."
"In our opinion, European social partners and the Commission should naturally be involved in the management of the centre in appropriate ways."
"A scientific council could determine the main guidelines and underwrite the work done."
"A proposal that this European monitoring centre and the Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin should be close together makes sense and would receive our support."
"In fact, the experience of that institution, its scope, the results of its work and its tripartite management, represent solid foundations for launching the centre."
"In the view of the French Presidency, that proposal for a foundation should facilitate the rapid establishment of the centre."
"France will do everything possible to ensure that it can be in place before the end of this presidency."
"Madam President, I have not forgotten how precious time is in this institution, so I have made a point of respecting my speaking time."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"In 1997, the closure of one Renault factory near Brussels employing 3 200 people focused public attention on the negative consequences of industrial change."
"After this, in response to the European Council, the Commission invited a high level group of experts to report on the economic and social implications of industrial change and make recommendations on ways to prevent consequences of the kind witnessed at the Renault factory."
"In its report the high level group recommended the creation of an observatory."
"This report has been endorsed by the Council."
"It is true that mechanisms and structures for the anticipation of change exist in the majority of Member States."
"But at European level there is no kind of observatory or mechanism to support policy makers and social partners in responding to these changes."
"I am convinced of the need to provide European social partners and policy makers with a tool which enables us to adopt a forward-looking approach where industrial change is discussed at European level, with a view to managing it through positive and preventive action."
"We have already discussed it three times in Parliament."
"We really believe that there is an urgent need for a new structure, an observatory or whatever we like to call it."
"The Commission has already proposed in the social agenda presented in 28 June 2000 to invite the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin - which is an existing structure - to put in place an information mechanism for change."
"This mechanism could also serve as a forum on change."
"What is the role of this mechanism?"
"This information mechanism should assist the social dialogue between employers and employees and it could support public authorities by providing information data and analysis of existing information on industrial change."
"We all agree that it must be a lightweight and cost-effective structure and that it must be established as quickly as possible."
"The social partners indicated their interest in this mechanism in the forum of 15 July and committed themselves to finalising their approaches and presenting their ideas on the possible structure for this mechanism."
"Of course we shall take their opinion into account before our final proposal."
"My last point is that anticipation of change and response to it must be multidimensional."
"Coordination across all policy areas has been central to the Commission's deliberations in this area."
"So what we could say is that we can ensure that the employment DG will collaborate with other DGs, in particular the internal market, education, culture and enterprise DGs, to present an integrated approach for this mechanism."
"We believe that the output of this mechanism will be available to support the decisions of EU institutions and EU partners and this could be done in a flexible way within the European Treaty."
"Mr President, may I say from this side of the House as one who served in the last Parliament that it is a great pleasure to see Mrs Péry here in this Chamber in Parliament."
"I would like to make several points about this issue of an observatory or monitoring centre."
"First of all, existing bodies within the EU institutions are already doing this work and are capable of doing it."
"It seems curious to me to propose another agency, more machinery, and more budgetary expenditure to duplicate work that is already taking place."
"For example, the Joint Research Centre Institute in Seville that deals with prospective future technologies is looking at this area."
"The Dublin Institute has been mentioned already."
"Secondly, governments and other types of public sector organisations do not have a particularly good record or an aptitude for predicting change in industry, in commerce, in business and in enterprise."
"Nor, in my view, should they try to do that."
"Let the economy and market forces get on with it."
"I am curious about the socialist emphasis on industrial change when we in the developed economies now live in a situation in which 20% or less of the work-force is employed in conventional industry and everyone else works in the services sector in the new economy."
"I am surprised because that emphasis denotes unawareness of this particular form of change."
"In other words, it is all happening, it has happened already and furthermore it has happened probably despite, rather than because of, the fact that governments second-guess what is going to happen and how it should happen."
"Moreover, if there is a need for study on an academic or research basis, then it is surely better to use existing bodies."
"By all means involve the two sides of industry in the research work, but let us not set up yet another EU agency or body."
"In short, we should not try to reinvent the wheel."
"Instead, we should leave the economy and the market to get on with it, since this is the best way to promote change and renewal and create new jobs."
"I too would like to welcome Nicole Péry back here in the Chamber and perhaps I could say, Nicole, that we miss you particularly when we have extremely difficult votes to transact."
"Perhaps you could pop back periodically."
"I would like to say that the compromise resolution tabled by my group and others has been cut down to the bare essentials to make it absolutely clear what we are calling for, but even so there seems to be a tremendous amount of confusion over exactly what we are calling for and I would therefore like to spell out two things that we are not calling for."
"First, we are not calling for the creation of a new expensive agency or institute."
"The tasks we want a monitoring centre to undertake can be handled at the Dublin Foundation and/or the Seville Joint Research Centre at little extra cost."
"Second, we are not seeking to stop mergers, transfers, restructuring or globalisation itself."
"That would be a ludicrous notion, but we want to see a socially responsible and anticipatory approach to these developments."
"We want the establishment of a coordinating centre for the monitoring of industrial change as a contribution to a more pro-active approach to the management of medium and longer-term industrial change in terms of its impact within the European Union and I would draw Mr Chichester's attention to the fact that service industries too are industries and we are looking at industrial change overall."
"This would be a centre to gather information and intelligence from all possible partners and actors, business itself, institutions of higher and further education, the employment services both public and private, the social partners from all relevant actors and again I would say to Mr Chichester, we are not saying here that governments should try to predict change."
"We want to work with all partners including business itself to try to assess the direction of change."
"The task of such a centre then should be to channel relevant information on anticipated changes to decision-makers at all levels to help increase our overall capacity to prepare the policy changes necessary to harness the opportunities to be gained from the perceived direction of change."
"This is not an idea we have plucked out of the air."
"As both the minister and the Commissioner have said, this follows on from the Gyllenhammar High Level Group following the Vilvoorde closure by Renault."
"The recommendation to create an observatory is one in fact that has been picked up in several EPP resolutions in recent months and I am therefore very surprised to see such a hostile resolution from that quarter here this week."
"The Liberal and EPP resolution says that such a centre would try to interfere in the markets and in commercial decisions."
"That is not the case at all."
"This is not about interference in commercial decisions but about making sure that we maximise the chances of us all being winners rather than simply the passive victims of change."
"But who knows, Mr Chichester, maybe even the world of commerce would benefit from the improved intelligence such a centre could provide."
"My final point is this: the resolution by the EPP and the Liberals is factually incorrect."
"It states that both Council and Commission have pulled back from the decision to create such an observatory, such a centre."
"We have heard from both the presidency of the Council here today and from the Commission that they are actively pursuing the idea."
"Your resolution is factually incorrect."
"It is missing the point and I hope even that at the eleventh hour you will recognise a good idea when you see it, withdraw your resolution and support ours."
"But perhaps I am a hopeless optimist."
"Mr President, the debate is most interesting but, as you can see from the screen, Question Time is due to start at 6.10 p.m."
"It does not matter if Question Time is late starting but can you guarantee that it will last one and a half hours because otherwise we shall run out of time and numerous questions on the agenda will not be discussed."
"And, while I have the floor, I too am delighted to welcome the representative of the Council presidency to the House."
"I greatly regret the situation, just as you do, because I am inheriting the problem."
"The fact of the matter is, however, that I can only guarantee us one hour here."
"I will communicate this problem - and you will probably do so as well - to the Conference of Presidents and to Parliament' s Bureau, because it may occur once as an exceptional case, but when it happens more than once we must tackle the problem and find a solution to it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and Mrs Péry, it was agreed at the Lisbon Summit that fifteen European Member States would be developing a common strategy for a smooth transition to a new economy."
"This is in the interests of our citizens as well as industry."
"The Liberal Group is totally against the setting up of a new administrative body that will further increase European bureaucracy."
"A European Monitoring Centre for industrial change is at odds with the liberal principle that governments should not interfere in commercial decisions."
"Do not pick the winners and let the winners pick."
"That was also the conclusion at the Lisbon Summit."
"I was therefore amazed to learn that less than three months after the event, both Mrs Péry, on behalf of the presidency and Mrs Diamantopoulou, on behalf of the Commission had completely changed tack."
"I was really taken aback by this."
"And there was I thinking we were dealing with reliable partners."
"Remarkably, European government leaders, including those of social-democratic persuasion, do embrace the liberal principles and the new economy while in this House, the left wing falls back on old reflexes time and again."
"The spectre of the repairable society is on the loose once again in Europe."
"Therefore, my group has also failed to achieve a compromise with the Socialist Group on the resolution before us."
"Europe and the European economy are doing well."
"The blessings of the internal market and particularly the introduction of the euro have given employment a shot in the arm."
"However, some large Member States are fearful to take the required measures, as a result of which they lose out on the benefits to be gained from economic growth."
"A new Monitoring Centre is no antidote to this."
"This is not the first time that this Parliament is discussing political interference in industry and business management."
"The same arguments crop up time and again."
"I do hope this time is the last time."
"Mr President, the European Union is facing far-reaching changes in our economy, globalisation, the new economy, the expansion of new technology and all kinds of demographic factors as well."
"These developments have a major impact on employment, the balance between rich and poor, social exclusion and the environment."
"There are all kinds of frictions within the labour market, we will have to adapt our education system and, at the end of the day, these developments also have all kinds of effects on individual companies, some of which are closing down while others are being set up again, etc. However, one minute we are pulling out all the stops to fight unemployment and the next we are attracting employees from third countries in order to solve the problems within the labour market, for example in the care or ICT sectors, just to quote a couple of odd examples."
"What we have noticed is that sometimes the policy is ad-hoc or belated and, in a sense, Lisbon, with its ""dotcom approach"" , is a good example of this."
"We need to take a more consistent line."
"Secondly we need involvement, involvement in the support networks, and this is the social implication that needs to be developed."
"We are of the opinion, therefore, that in order to accommodate this development within industry and sectors of industry, the advice of the working party must be followed at a high level and a coordinating centre set up to observe these changes. This centre should not be an unwieldy, new body but rather fall under the remit of an existing body."
"This type of industrial change relies completely upon the full involvement of social partners, citizens and politicians at local, regional and national level."
"Success will depend critically upon how well this change is managed. From this perspective, the Commission and Council should also ensure that topics such as the right to information and consultation, revision of the law on works councils and the role of employees and citizens in mergers and business closures with their serious social consequences can be brought up for discussion sooner rather than later."
"This too seems to us to be essential for the purposes of managing industrial change."
"We are not going to oppose the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change."
"The right' s unanimous opposition to it only confirms their rejection of the slightest transparency on the disastrous consequences for society of the factory closures and redundancies people have the nerve to present to us as inevitable responses to change."
"But this monitoring centre can only be a statistical instrument, and not even an objective one, in this class society."
"A monitoring centre cannot replace the political will to prevent big business sacking workers to make bigger profits."
"Calling for social cohesion amounts to asking workers made redundant by a firm which is closing down, and unemployed people who are victims of restructuring, to endure their fate patiently."
"Most of the mergers or restructurings are financial operations quite unrelated to industrial change."
"And it is always the workers who have to pay the price, never the shareholders."
"That is why I say to the workers that they can and must defend themselves, in particular by imposing a ban on redundancies on any company which is making profits."
"Accumulated profits should be used to finance the distribution of work amongst all, with no decrease in wages, no precariousness and no flexibility."
"I have received 7 motions for resolutions to close this statement, tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"My group would have preferred it if we had not concluded this, in itself interesting, debate with resolutions."
"This is in response to the comments made by Mr Hughes."
"I believe that the Council has indeed introduced new elements today."
"Judging from the discussion, the Council has made some progress."
"The Commission statement was also extremely clear and, in my opinion, we should all examine it very carefully once again. This would be the best way forward."
"Secondly, it is true that we need to avoid excessive bureaucracy."
"I fully share the view of my neighbour, Mr Chichester on this matter."
"This is a key point."
"However, I was also reminded of what happened to the Titanic."
"It sank because there was no observation system for icebergs in those days."
"Needless to say, after the sinking of the Titanic, such a system was introduced without delay."
"Surely over the past few years, we have seen a few cases, also in respect of industrial changes, where a little prescience might have prevented the worst from happening."
"I personally take the view that we could explore this route a little more, provided it does not lead to further bureaucracy, especially in our host country."
"We are constantly being faced with all kinds of states of affairs, blockades and such like, and I believe it would be of great benefit if more objective information on future changes could be provided so that we could perhaps prevent a few mistakes from being made, as might have happened in the case of the Titanic."
"I like the film, but I would hate to see it time and again."
"Mr President, let me start with a quotation: 'Unregulated mergers, based merely on dominant capitalist concerns, have a devastating effect on the Union's social cohesion."
"That face of the European Union is unacceptable to men and women who wake up one morning to discover that the company they work for has changed hands and that they are at the mercy of their employer's economic strategy options."
"The effect on the lives of those people, their families and their entire region is traumatic and, let's face it, inhuman."
"Among Parliament's various proposals, the idea of setting up an observatory for industrial change is of particular interest. In so far as such an establishment will be independent and will have appropriate resources to carry out its research, and its work is made public and can serve as a basis for democratic debate, it can make a powerful contribution to developing intergovernmental cooperation which, in this area of social policy, remains predominant.'"
"That is not a quotation from some irresponsible or lunatic left-winger."
"I am in fact quoting our President, Mrs Fontaine, who made those statements at the Lisbon Summit on behalf of us all."
"Now, listening to certain leaders of the uptight right, here, today, I wonder if these honourable Members of Mrs Fontaine' s group really want to spend their time giving the lie to what our President said before the Heads of State and Government in Lisbon."
"Of course, Mr Chichester and Mr Plooij-van Gorsel tell us, respectively, to 'leave it to the markets' and 'not pick winners' ."
"We know the old refrain only too well, privatise profit and nationalise losses."
"My friend Steven Hughes has explained that the Socialists and the two other political groups tabling a joint resolution do not want a bureaucratic monster."
"We do not want a new institution or agency but - as Mrs Péry, the representative of the presidency, says, and I welcome her too - a light arrangement, a light structure, which could coordinate the existing work."
"In fact, the Commission has plenty of documentation available, and Eurostat can provide very interesting statistics on industrial evolution in Europe and beyond."
"There are the national governments and research institutes."
"There must be no duplication of existing work but coordination of it and a report, at least every six months, which can be debated in the Council and in the European Parliament."
"We do not want to be mere spectators of the progress of industrial and social change."
"We want to shape the future, and shaping the future does not mean fighting a rearguard action or useless protectionism, but accompanying change."
"We are for the new technologies, we are for the new economy, but we also want to help the old sectors adapt."
"Our aim is a pro-active policy. We want to anticipate change, because the future, and especially the economic future, is being built now."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to put this debate into context."
"As a native of Auvergne, I would remind you that just about a year ago we were debating the Michelin crisis in this Chamber."
"Michelin announced massive redundancies in its European factories at the same time as record profits on the stock exchange."
"At that time, in this very House, we were collectively engaged in reviewing European regulations on company mergers."
"I would suggest to the Commission that it might be worth having another look at Directive 94/EC and Regulation 4064/89 to strengthen information to and consultation of employees before major change - a euphemism for redundancies - whether due to restructuring or merger."
"A year later, as a first concrete step, we are offered a monitoring centre for industrial change."
"Fine, but let it really serve the cause of the employees."
"For that, two conditions seem indispensable. The Commission must be allowed to evaluate the implementation of the directive on collective redundancies and closures of companies, and make proposals so that effective sanctions can be applied in case of non-respect of regulations."
"The two sides of industry must be associated with this initiative by means budgetary resources allocated by the European institutions."
"Minister, it is a great pleasure to see you here again."
"The new economy and globalisation are producing an acceleration of industrial change and Parliament has several times discussed this issue and has established -I myself was the rapporteur - a certain number of procedures and the European works councils, and has done work on information to and consultation of workers."
"We are awaiting the results of these, Commissioner, because you know we are very committed to them."
"We have also established procedures like the participation of employees in the capital, profits and results of the company, all indispensable procedures during industrial restructuring and change."
"Of course there is still a great deal to be done in this field, but it seems to me that if we need to improve this type of procedure, as my colleagues have said, and it is not uptight to say so - we now have bodies in Europe like the Foundation in Dublin and the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao, with which our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs cooperates, that are in a position to evaluate the consequences of these industrial changes effectively."
"And we should not forget that both sides of industry also have an indispensable role to play as regards industrial change at the European and the social level."
"More particularly, I hope the existing bodies will be required to contribute to making industrial change increasingly transparent and, Commissioner, I hope the texts we are waiting for, on information to and consultation of workers, and the European company, will one day be submitted to this Parliament."
"Mr President, Mrs Péry, Mrs Diamanopoulou, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Péry for the clarity with which she outlined the Council's proposal, which I fully support."
"As has been said, the European Parliament has on several occasions, at times of crises, restructuring or conversion of production plant, decided by a large majority on the need for the European institutions and social dialogue partners to intervene early enough to be able to find all the possible solutions in order to avert avoidable serious social conflict and prevent the deindustrialisation of entire territories and the triggering-off of processes of serious social exclusion."
"What Parliament was complaining of was the lack of information which would have made it possible to analyse these processes in due time and, more generally, to examine the changes taking place in production and employment in these firms before such an analysis lost its value due to the precipitous adoption of irreversible decisions."
"I feel that the creation of a monitoring centre - a centre coordinating all the information useful for predicting restructuring and conversion processes - could be a valuable service for the Community institutions and facilitate social dialogue at European level."
"For we are talking about a service activity, not a new institution, a service activity which would contribute to producing a high-quality, timely intervention which is the responsibility of the Union institutions alone."
"Therefore, I call upon all those Members who voted on the resolutions on the restructuring processes, from Verwoord onwards, and especially those who voted on the Michelin affair in a resolution which explicitly provided for the establishment of a monitoring centre for industrial change, to show consistency on this occasion."
"Mr President, with a tool such as this, it will, indeed, be possible not only to inform the workers concerned in advance and to explore the possibilities of averting or reducing redundancies - as stipulated by the Community Directive of 24 June 1992 - but also to facilitate at local and Community level dialogue which would make it possible to ascertain the existence of alternative solutions to those put forward by the companies."
"These could be partly implemented through public intervention as well as through initiatives to find alternative employment for workers whose jobs are under threat and, in particular, initiatives for the vocational retraining of workers."
"This is the only way we will be able to ward off the danger represented by restructuring processes or mergers of large companies for large numbers of workers and for certain areas which are undergoing a radical process of decline or exclusion, particularly affecting young workers."
"Without such a tool and without such preventative analyses, Parliament is destined to remain a centre of belated, ineffective claims."
"Mr President, Mr Hughes says he does not want a new agency and yet his resolution plainly calls for a new agency and to deny it is merely playing with words."
"He says he wants no interference in industry, and yet Mrs Diamantopoulou talks about preventive measures."
"She clearly thinks that change is a bad thing."
"She wants to keep loss-making industries on life-support systems when we should be releasing the resources of labour and capital so that they can work in viable new enterprises."
"If we want to survive and prosper in the 21st century then we must welcome and manage change."
"We must not monitor and prevent it."
"So I was deeply disheartened to hear of this proposal for an observatory."
"The rule seems to be: another day, another quango."
"For the benefit of colleagues I should perhaps explain that a quango is a recently-coined English word short for ""quasi non-governmental organisation"", in other words, a new piece of bureaucracy, more money spent, more jobs for the boys, more patronage for their bosses."
"And all for what?"
"To produce fat reports which will be translated into 11 languages but which nobody will read."
"We seem to have only two responses in the EU to any real or imagined problem."
"We either create a new regulation without any concern as to whether existing regulations are working properly or we create an observatory."
"Then we stand back proud and happy that we have solved the problem."
"But we have not solved the problem."
"We have simply postponed it."
"We have wasted time and money and we have raised expectations which will not be fulfilled."
"As with so many EU initiatives - I am thinking particularly of the proposed food standards agency - this observatory will simply duplicate the work of other organisations, of innumerable private research companies and accountancy firms, of academic and university institutes, of trade unions and chambers of commerce, and national and local government."
"I put two questions to colleagues."
"First, do we need this observatory at all?"
"I think not."
"But if we do, would it not be far quicker, cheaper and more cost-effective to commission one of our great European accounting firms to do the work?"
"I am sure it would."
". (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, just two sentences."
"I have listened carefully to the debate which has taken place in this Chamber."
"What I want to say is that all those who support the idea of a European monitoring centre agree on its mission and its form."
"I find that approach interesting."
"A mission of information, a mission of exchange, and as to the form, the structure, a flexible, light, efficient structure, relying on existing structures."
"I see Parliament, the Commission and the presidency united, so I shall leave here quite optimistic that the monitoring centre will come into being."
"Mr President, I shall be brief because I know time is short."
"It was a very interesting debate and there were two dimensions. The first is the political one and the second is the technical one."
"The political debate raised the question whether we should intervene in the new economy or not and I will make just a political point."
"The new economy is not a natural phenomenon, it is a political phenomenon."
"That is why there is a need for mechanisms and institutions - not to stop the changes but to manage the changes and to prevent their negative social consequences."
"As regards the second dimension, the technical dimension, I agree with the EPP Group that there is no need for a new structure and I agree with all the others who say there is a need for a lightweight and flexible mechanism."
"This is why we are not proposing a new institution or a new structure."
"We are proposing to cooperate with the Dublin Institute and to take account of all the other resources (the resources of the Commission and other European institutions such as EUROSTAT and the European Employment Observatory, the evaluations and other studies we have); all these will be taken into account and this mechanism will support the social dialogue between partners, employers and the public and will support policy makers in managing this change."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0535/2000). We will examine questions to the Council."
"You know that we have very little time."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, for supplementary questions - which are not obligatory - you have 1 minute, but there is a Parliament recommendation that only 30 seconds be used."
"I am not going to insist on 30 seconds, but I would ask you only to ask questions that are essential."
"I must point out that Question Nos 1, 3 and 4 were included on the list of questions for the July Question Time but could not be replied to by the Council, because there was not sufficient time to translate them beforehand into all languages, and they are therefore being presented once again at the beginning of this part-session."
"Since they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 1 and 2 will be taken together."
"Question No 2 by (H-643/00):"
"Subject: United Nations General Assembly Special Session for Children What action does the Council intend to take in order to ensure that the EU makes a positive and constructive contribution to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session for Children, in September 2001, when all states will review commitments and goals set ten years ago at the World Summit for Children?"
"Does the Council agree that it is important that Member States, the Commission and the Council have a coherent approach to this Summit?"
"Mr President, I would like to answer the questions from Mr Theonas and Mrs Kinnock together, because they both deal with the need to ensure that child labour is abolished for once and for all."
"As regards Mr Theonas' question, I must emphasise that the European Union fully recognises the importance of abolishing the exploitation of children, which deprives them of their right to a normal childhood and education, and their right not to be subjected to forced labour."
"The European Union actively supports the action of the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations Children' s Fund, better known here as UNICEF. It salutes the adoption of the ILO Convention concerning immediate prohibition and action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, ratified by the United States on 2 December 1999, and it will work to ensure that this convention does indeed help eliminate the most intolerable forms of child labour."
"The European Union regrets that the United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"Our representatives have been urging the United States to ratify it in bilateral contacts."
"The Convention has been ratified by the Member States and is of capital importance for the European Union which is actively involved in the current preparations for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, scheduled for September 2001, to assess progress achieved in the field of the rights of the child over the last ten years."
"The European Union often raises human rights issues in the context of its political dialogue with the United States and the Council takes note of the case raised by the honourable Member."
"On Mrs Kinnock' s question, the Council entirely agrees with her on the importance of good preparation of September' s UN General Assembly Special Session devoted to follow-up of the World Summit for Children."
"The European Union has started actively preparing for the event."
"It is one of our priorities for the 55th session of the UN General Assembly."
"Although the success of the event depends in large measure on the commitment of the international community as a whole, the Council recognises that the European Union can and must play a major role in the preparations, a role encouraged during informal contacts held with representatives of UNICEF."
"In addition, the Council is constantly attentive to the rights of the child wherever issues relating to human rights are dealt with."
"The preparations for the special session are on the agenda of the Council' s human rights group, and it intends to devote a special section of the European Union' s annual human rights report to this issue."
"Finally, the French Presidency has proposed holding a European Day of the Rights of the Child to its partners, possibly on 20 November 2000 - but I say that with reservations, because it has not yet been made official."
"One last point: the Council is promoting the signature of two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted and opened for signature by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 May 2000, and we hope a lot of countries will sign at the Millennium Summit, which opens tomorrow and will implement these two optional protocols."
"Mr President, I really must thank Mr Moscovici for the quality and content of his reply and for the fact that the European Union feels that the international conventions of the United Nations Organisation, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, should be ratified."
"I should just like to observe, by way of a supplementary question, that ratification is extremely important, but often it is not enough."
"Because, if I am not mistaken, the United States have ratified the new International Labour Organisation Convention on Child Labour but the convention is not being applied."
"And where I think the minister needs to add to what he has told us is on whether the European Union, whether the Council will also demand at a practical level during the two days of contacts that the United States apply the provisions of the International Labour Organisation Convention and the United States convention on the Rights of the Child."
". (FR) It is true that the important thing is implementation, but it is difficult to implement a convention which has not been ratified."
"That is why we want to start having a much more determined political dialogue with the United States on this issue and press for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the United States."
"We will also hold informal consultations to try to convince them of the need not just to ratify that convention but to adhere to it."
"Question No 3 by (H-0627/00):"
"Subject: Involvement of labour and management In various Member States there is no dialogue of substance or effective cooperation between government bodies and representatives of labour and management on employment-related issues or, in a broader context, efforts to modernise the European social model."
"The conclusions of the European Council held in Santa Maria da Feira referred to the need for labour and management to play a more significant role."
"How does the Council envisage strengthening the role of labour and management?"
"How will it monitor their involvement more effectively?"
"The Council has always regarded social dialogue as enormously important."
"But you will appreciate that it is not up to the Council to advocate any particular model of social dialogue at national level, because that lies entirely within the competence of each Member State."
"However, in terms of the social dialogue at European level, both sides of industry in Europe are already heavily involved in two aspects of Community action: coordination of economic policies, and the effort to implement the European strategy for jobs."
"On the latter aspect, both sides of industry participate, with the Council and Commission, in the work of the standing committee on employment with a view to facilitating coordination of employment policies in the Member States by harmonising them with Community objectives."
"Our social partners are also associated with the work of the committee on employment, consultation of both sides of industry in this context being informal."
"As regards the efforts to strengthen the European strategy for jobs, when the employment guidelines are revised in 2001, both sides of industry, including those at national level, will be invited to play a more important role in their definition, and in implementing and evaluating the guidelines which fall within their scope."
"The stress will be on modernising the organisation of work, education for lifelong learning and raising the employment rate, especially for women."
"There are also grounds for suggesting that it is up to the Commission, pursuant to Article 138 of the Treaty, to consult both sides of industry on the possible orientation of a Community action before presenting proposals in the area of social policy."
"As an example, the Commission has recently consulted its social partners on the possible orientation of a Community action on modernising and improving working relations."
"As regards the modernisation of the European social model, both sides of industry will be associated with the work of the new committee on social protection, just as they are already associated with the work of the old committee on employment and the labour market and its successor, the committee on employment."
"Following the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, the Fifteen are due to adopt a European social policy agenda at the Nice European Council in December 2000."
"That is an important priority for the French Presidency."
"The working document for that agenda is a communication from the Commission adopted on 28 June."
"There will be contributions to it and consultations on it under the French Presidency, and naturally both sides of industry are expected to be closely associated in drawing up the social policy agenda."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the minister for his reply; I naturally endorse the fact that the importance and value of the social partners in shaping a new model are much greater than anyone can imagine."
"But what I should like to ask is this: when a tripartite dialogue takes place between the two sides of industry and the national government, how far can the national government ignore what was jointly agreed and proposed by the social partners?"
"Or, taken the other way, how binding on a government are proposals decided jointly by the social partners, who know better than anyone what the problems of society and the causes of unemployment are and what problems need to be solved in order to deal with unemployment, or how binding should they be on any national government?"
"Council. (FR) Mr Folias, it would certainly be desirable to make things more restrictive, but this is not the route which has been adopted within the European Union."
"On the one hand, there is the subsidiary nature of social problems and, on the other, the selection of a method we call the open method of coordination."
"We are currently succeeding in reconciling the problems of economic coordination, the major objectives of economic policy, the problems of coordination in social terms, the guidelines for employment and the various methods, and the various bodies working on it."
"I think that this is an approach which must be continued because, as we know, Europe is very diverse."
"Europe must not and cannot interfere in everything."
"At the same time, the involvement of both sides of industry must be continually intensified."
"Mr President, the social partnership should be a forward-looking partnership."
"The first priority should be to implement what both sides want for themselves, and I believe that dialogue is an essential and important prerequisite in this respect."
"What do you perceive the role of the existing Economic and Social Committee to be in this context, and what changes do you think will need to be made here, to enable it to become more actively involved in the work in future?"
"The Council does not have any response to this question at this stage."
"Question No 4 by (H-0697/00):"
"Subject: Professor A Pelinka and Austria Is the Council aware of the case of Professor Anton Pelinka who has had his work in the European Monitoring Centre deliberately impeded and sabotaged by the Austrian Government and who has consequently had to resign from his position as Vice-President and member of the Management Committee of the Monitoring Centre?"
"Does the Council not believe this to be a clear case of political interference of the kind many of us believed would follow from the entry into government of the Austrian Freedom Party?"
"Does the Council not believe that this case justifies the imposition of sanctions and makes it all the more important for the sanctions to be maintained?"
"The Council is indeed aware of Professor Pelinka' s resignation from his post as Vice-President of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia on 31 May this year."
"However, the measures adopted by the 14 Member States on 31 January, which are going to be reassessed, or, at least, which are due to be reassessed in the light of the report of the Wise Men, are of a strictly bilateral nature."
"As such, they do not implicate the institutions of the European Union and, consequently, the Council is not justified in declaring an opinion on whether or not they should be maintained."
"As you know, three experts were designated by the President of the European Court of Human Rights on 12 July in order to check specifically whether the Austrian Government had contravened common European values since taking office on 4 February, and also to look into the decidedly unique political character of the Austrian Freedom Party."
"The Member States will, of course, be very interested to peruse the experts' report when it is published, which, according to my information, should be very soon."
"Mr President, I had the privilege of being a member of the Council of Ministers' Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia, along with Professor Pelinka."
"He was a highly valued if not slightly boring member, who tried to prevent us going too far in our recommendations and acted as a brake on some of us who were more enthusiastic about pushing forward."
"Is the Council aware that the management committee of the Monitoring Centre has passed a resolution expressing regret at the resignation of Professor Pelinka and the events leading to that resignation and is the Council prepared to draw the attention of the Wise Men to this particular incident and ask them to include that in their report because it clearly seems to be a possible example of how our common European values are being undermined by the current government in Austria?"
"Mr Ford, I have my own personal opinion on the matter."
"I imagine that you know something of my views as a member of the French Government."
"They are known to Austria at least."
"The fact remains, however, that I am speaking right now on behalf of the Council and, let me repeat, these measures are bilateral measures, not measures undertaken in the context of the European Union."
"As far as the report of the Wise Men is concerned, it is, by definition, a matter for them alone. I have no doubt but that in the detailed study they make of the Austrian situation, after a number of consultations, they will be able to take the diversity of individual situations into consideration, or, at least, I hope so."
"That, in any case, was the mandate given them."
"I have listened to the French Presidency' s answer with a great deal of interest."
"The Pelinka case is a very serious legal case which may be said to constitute direct interference with freedom of expression in so far as the legal apparatus is being used in practice to silence political criticism."
"The Council has now explained that it cannot comment ""in its capacity as the Council of Ministers"" , but the French Government may perhaps comment in its own capacity."
"Is this matter not thought to be serious and to need to be included in the assessment being made in the Wise Men' s report?"
"I believe that the stance of the French Government and even the French authorities on this matter has been known from the outset."
"We were by no means the last to demand the bilateral measures which were taken."
"The fact remains that I am speaking right now, let me repeat, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and that those measures are not measures undertaken within the context of the European institutions but rather a set of bilateral measures undertaken by 14 Member States with regard to the fifteenth."
"That, sir, is all I wished to say, and I repeat, once again, that, by definition, if we want the Wise Men' s report to be truly wise, we must allow them to work wisely, and not try to influence them one way or the other."
"I place my trust in these important political and legal figures, especially the former Finnish President, Mr Ahtisaari, since he has shown in the past that he is capable of assessing complex situations."
"Question No 5 by (H-0597/00):"
"Subject: Request for a documented assessment of the education of children in the countries applying for EU membership In view of the economic crisis and profound structural changes that the majority of the applicant countries in the enlargement process have undergone, will the Council say whether all children in these countries are receiving an education?"
"The Council is in possession of the latest statistics provided by Eurostat. I have them here and I am willing to offer them to the honourable Member."
"The data refer to the now distant school year 1997-1998, and show that in 11 countries which are candidates for membership of the European Union, the duration of compulsory schooling is nine or ten years, i.e. until the age of 15 or 16, depending on the case."
"It is therefore possible to estimate that the percentage of young people in education at 16 is approximately 90% and at 18 approximately 60%."
"Reliable statistics are not yet available for Cyprus and Malta, and Eurostat has not yet begun to collaborate with Turkey on educational statistics, but it is, understandably, not a simple matter where retrospective data is concerned."
"If she requires further details, the Honourable Member can also consult a collection entitled ""Key Data on Education in the European Union"" , produced by Eurydice in collaboration with Eurostat and published by the Commission in French, German and English."
"Let me do a little advertising by announcing that the 1999-2000 edition is now available."
"Finally, on the subject of the education of all European citizens, you should remember that it is up to every Member State and every candidate country to ensure that this objective is achieved."
"Once more, I should like to make the statistics, in the form in which I have them, available to Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines."
"In fact, I have consulted the statistics and I have consulted the information provided by the European Foundation for Education, and I am surprised by the rosy picture they paint of the situation in the countries of the East."
"The news we ourselves have received all indicates that, while the system has fallen, an enormous crisis has been declared. There are problems in very many places."
"In rural areas, many teachers are in practice not being paid, and I do not believe that, with the crisis of structural change suffered in the rest of the system, education has been kept in the wonderful state indicated in the statistics."
"It therefore concerns me that there is no way of searching or taking soundings."
"It is clear that, beyond subsidiarity, even beyond formal legitimacy, there is a moral legitimacy, which is based on our commitment to ensure that in the rural areas, in the new Europe, in the new countries which are going to join us, not a single child should remain without access to education or be deprived of the right to education which they deserve."
"I was basing my answer on the facts available to me, i.e. the statistics."
"I am not willing to make a qualitative judgement which might not be justified."
"Let me repeat to the honourable Member that I have available a table which, in effect, shows that what I have said includes the disparities."
"There is an average, of course, but there are also cases of greater or lesser advantage, which undoubtedly illustrate situations at grass roots level which are not at all equal."
"I can give you this summary table if you wish, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines."
"Mr President, I should like to take advantage of the question by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines to touch on an aspect of tertiary education in candidate countries which affects young people not from these countries but from other Member States of the European Union, such as Greece, who attend universities in candidate countries in large numbers."
"My question to the President-in-Office is this: is there any thought, are there any prospects, are there any plans to extend the scope of the directive on the mutual recognition of tertiary education diplomas which applies to the Fifteen to the candidate countries?"
"And if so, when?"
"Will this be done once the accession procedures have been completed or could it be done earlier in order to solve the present problems?"
"I understand that the President-in-Office may not be able to give me an answer right now but perhaps he could inform us if or when he has an answer."
"At this stage I can give you an initial answer, to the effect that one of the objectives of the French Presidency, as you perhaps already know, is what we call the European Research Area."
"It is something we are working on together with Jack Lang, the objective being to remove all obstacles to the mobility of students, teachers and researchers. This, of course, also involves harmonising the recognition of qualifications."
"This is what we wish to do for the European Union."
"It is not an easy task."
"I think that, as far as we ourselves are concerned, it would be ambitious to set a target of five years."
"For the rest, however, it is a complicated matter to attempt harmonisation with countries which are not yet members of the European Union."
"It must be considered, however, that if this is made a requirement within the European Union, then this is the requirement within the body to which the candidate countries wish and are going to accede."
"The question of whether it should be an approach like that used for the internal market or like that in use for the Schengen countries can be posed at a later date."
"The fact is, however, that we still have a few years to consider the matter."
"Question No 6 by (H-0605/00):"
"Subject: Negotiating mandate covering the agricultural section of the free trade agreement with the Maghreb The Commission has submitted its proposal for a negotiating mandate for the free trade agreement with Morocco, Tunisia and Israel to the Council' s 'Maghreb' Working Party."
"The proposal covers all theoretically possible liberalisation measures, from increasing quotas to reducing customs duties, with various formulas for handling entry prices."
"What are the scope and substance of the mandate?"
"Morocco, Tunisia and Israel are the three partners of the European Union whose Euro-Mediterranean association agreements have entered into force."
"These agreements include a periodic review clause for agriculture, according to which the parties undertake to plan for the increased liberalisation of their agricultural trade, with this process complementing the gradual dismantling of the tariff system in preparation for the setting up of the industrial free trade area due in 2010."
"It is strictly limited to agriculture."
"It does not, therefore, concern, for example, fisheries products which are dealt with as part of other negotiations."
"The Morocco, Tunisia and Israel association agreements make provision for examination of the agricultural trade situation, as of 1 January 2000, with a view to the establishment of gradual liberalisation measures, beginning on 1 January 2001."
"The negotiations which are due to open must therefore make it possible to strengthen this Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"They are also designed to achieve a better balance in agricultural trade with the three countries concerned, with regard to which the Union has a structural deficit."
"The European Union is the prime outlet for the agricultural production of its partners, and takes up two thirds of their exports."
"Currently, 95% of exports of agricultural products from Morocco, Tunisia and Israel to the European Union are exempt from customs duties."
"On 20 July 2000, the Council approved the Commission' s negotiating mandate, which comprises general guidelines."
"It is a matter of facilitating improved access to the markets of the partner countries for Community products and of greater balance in mutual preferences, including by means of exempting new products from customs duties."
"It also defines the room for manoeuvre the Commission is allowed in restoring balance in trade and concluding negotiations."
"At the request of the Member States, the measures which may give rise to concessions are strictly delimited."
"The mandate therefore authorises the Community negotiator, if necessary, to grant the Mediterranean partners tariff preferences for new products or to improve existing concessions, while, however, taking the vulnerability of certain products and the mechanisms of the common agricultural policy into consideration."
"In this respect, it specifies that the Commission is, in collaboration with the Member States, to carry out an assessment of the potential impact of the concessions on the economic and commercial interests of the European Union, and obviously the Council will not take a decision until it has consulted the results of this assessment."
"Mr President, I am happy that the Council is also taking account in this negotiation of the sensitivity of certain regions and certain products, especially in the agricultural sector."
"At the moment there are agricultural sectors in the Mediterranean and also in the outermost regions of the Community, which could be threatened as a result of the very generous proposed concessions by the Commission."
"I would just like to repeat what I said and encourage the Council to persist in maintaining the greatest possible vigilance so that those sectors are not fundamentally damaged by overly-generous concessions."
"I believe that this is exactly the philosophy which will be guiding our negotiations."
"I can therefore only endorse what is more a compliment than a question."
"Question No 7 by (H-0610/00):"
"Subject: EU-Turkey partnership In the process of adopting Regulation EC/764/2000 regarding the implementation of measures to intensify the EU-Turkey customs union, on a proposal from the Commission, Parliament's amendments concerning democratisation, respect for human rights and the rights of minorities in Turkey were effectively rejected."
"This development has given rise to fears as to whether the 'partnership', which will reportedly be discussed in the Council at the end of the year, will abide by the political terms and conditions laid down by the Helsinki Summit."
"Does the Council, therefore, intend to adopt the proposal for a Regulation (COM(2000)169) regarding the implementation of measures to promote economic and social development in Turkey, together with the partnership?"
"Can it give assurances that the Helsinki political criteria will be clearly defined within the partnership and that the mechanisms for monitoring Turkey's progress towards democratisation will operate as they do for the other states applying for membership?"
"Following the adoption, on 10 April this year, of the regulation regarding the implementation of measures intended to intensify the EU-Turkey customs union, on 13 June this year the Council adopted its common position on the proposal for a financial regulation on the implementation of actions to promote Turkey' s economic and social development."
"This common position was sent to the European Parliament for second reading at the July 2000 part-session."
"The Council awaits Parliament' s opinion with interest."
"You know that, in December 1999, the Helsinki European Council recognised Turkey' s candidacy on an equal footing with the other candidates in terms of rights and obligations and decided to implement a pre-accession strategy for Turkey."
"In Feira, the Heads of State and Government invited the Commission to submit proposals regarding the single financial framework for aid to Turkey and the accession partnership as soon as possible."
"As you know, at the end of July, the Commission approved a proposal for a Council regulation on launching Turkey's accession partnership. It is on the basis of this regulation that the Commission will, at a later date, submit its proposal for partnership, but it will include the short- and medium-term priorities and objectives to prepare for accession in accordance with the model adopted for the other candidates."
"The Commission will present its proposal on the implementation of a single financial framework at a later date."
"It goes without saying that, in working out this partnership, the Council will pay particular attention to compliance with the political criteria for accession, particularly in the areas of human rights, rule of law and the legal system."
"It will also ensure monitoring to verify that Turkish legislation is made compliant in this and in other areas, in order to ascertain that this is carried out in the same way as in the other candidate countries."
"In this connection, it should be noted that preparations for the examination of Turkish legislation in all the areas of the acquis communautaire have been undertaken within the EU-Turkey Association Council."
"In addition, the Feira European Council requested that the Commission submit a progress report to the Council on the work undertaken in this area."
"I would like to thank the minister for his reply; however, I note that, whereas I specifically asked if the Helsinki criteria would be defined within the partnership, he evaded the question."
"I should therefore like to repeat and specify and update my question."
"The 15, and first and foremost the presidency, received a letter from Mr Gem a few days ago asking for the partnership between Turkey and the European Union which is now on the drawing board not to mention Helsinki Articles 4 and 9 relating to Greek-Turkish relations - in his words, border differences - and the question of progress on the Cyprus issue."
"I should therefore like to repeat my question to the minister and again raise the issue which he evaded: will mention be made of the Helsinki criteria on the Cyprus question and Greek-Turkish relations or will Mr Gem' s proposals be accepted?"
"What is the Council' s reply to Mr Gem?"
"I do not have a specific answer on this issue."
"What I do recall is the European Council in Helsinki, as I took part in this discussion there, having just a short time before been on a brief diplomatic mission to Turkey and Greece, and the Helsinki conclusions are the ones which are binding upon us and upon everyone."
"That is the general rule."
"That is the basis on which we conducted our negotiations."
"Minister, nine months after Turkey was granted candidate status in Helsinki, and irrespective of my opposition to Turkey' s accession, do you believe that there has been any progress with democratisation, which was one of the criteria for accession, or have you concluded that what we forecast at the time has come true, i.e. the Helsinki resolution has encouraged the Turkish regime to continue its inhumane policy?"
"What we have concluded, as you too can see, is that there has been no progress whatsoever in democratising the constitution and the penal code, parties such as the Communist party have been banned, the prison situation is festering, political prisoners are being treated inhumanely, new F-cells have been created for harsh, inhumane solitary confinement, lawyers who defend political prisoners are being humiliated, Kurdish villages in Iraq have again been bombed, more beatings have been carried out and arrests have been made in Diyarbakir, Istanbul and elsewhere for the events of 1 September, which is the international day of peace."
"Similarly, not only does Turkey continue to occupy 38% of Cyprus following its barbaric invasion in 1974, contrary to repeated UN resolutions which Turkey disregards in the most provocative manner, but Mr Ecevit states that the Cyprus question was resolved in 1974 and refuses to apply resolutions to pay..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I do not share the viewpoint which seems to underlie your question, namely this opposition to the candidacy of Turkey."
"Turkey' s candidacy was in fact made possible by a welcome rapprochement between Greece and Turkey, which, I hope, will continue, particularly under the enlightened leadership of the two great diplomatic leaders, Mr Papandreou and Mr Gem, both of whom I consider my friends."
"Having said that, let me repeat, Turkey' s candidacy has been accepted on equal terms with regard to both rights and duties."
"In order for Turkey to become a member of the European Union, it must respect its values and therefore make the necessary efforts."
"At the same time, we must greet its efforts positively."
"Nine months may be a long time for a human being to develop before birth, but it is an extremely short time for a candidate country."
"Question No 8 by (H-0614/00):"
"Subject: US farm subsidies Has the Council of Ministers considered the recent substantial increases in agricultural subsidies provided for its farmers by the US Government, which now represent more than EUR 16 000 per farmer."
"Are these subsidies in violation of WTO agreements and does the Council propose to take any action on this?"
"The United States have not yet notified the WTO of the measures to which the Honourable Member refers, which could warrant investigation under Article 18 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture."
"Moreover, I should point out that agricultural subsidies are among the subjects dealt with in the WTO negotiations which commenced in June 2000."
"The implementation of the reduction commitments agreed at the time of the 1994 Marrakech Accord is also scheduled for examination in the course of these negotiations, which are based on the principles outlined in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture."
"The relevant Council bodies receive regular progress reports from the Commission with regard to the negotiations and other activities undertaken within the WTO' s agricultural bodies, and if the Commission considers it useful, the matter of the compliance of the United States' subsidy policy with the commitments signed in the Uruguay Round and other measures to be taken in this respect will be referred to the Council."
"I wish to raise the question with the President-in-Office of the change in American policy since we in the European Union changed the whole direction of the support we give to agriculture following the last round of GATT negotiations."
"The United States Government has more than doubled the level of subsidies per farmer."
"At the same time the European Union, in pursuit of its policies which were forced on us by the clearance group and the United States, has reduced its share of world markets in the dairy sector, in the cereal sector and in the meat sector."
"I consider that since the American Government has doubled the level of aid that it extends directly to its farmers the European Union has in fact been wrong-footed and that the policy which has led us to a reduction in our share of world markets is in fact outdated and should be reviewed."
"I shall not go into the details, but these are, in fact, the sort of considerations which justify our rejecting attacks which may have been made on the common agricultural policy and our own system, and that is also the reason why the European Union adopted an overall negotiating mandate designed to safeguard the social model and the farm model, not to mention the European cultural model, with regard to the WTO."
"Rest assured that, as far as we are concerned, the mandate is still the basis for further negotiations."
"Question No 9 by (H-0616/00):"
"Subject: Change to the unanimity required for cultural issues in view of the Intergovernmental Conference Europe' s common cultural heritage, alongside the development of the Member States' cultures and respect for diversity, has been considered an important aspect of European integration and has been incorporated into the EU Treaties, in Article 151."
"This article specifically provides for the encouragement of cooperation between Member States, in order to support and supplement actions in various particularly vulnerable areas."
"However, decisions in this area are subject to the unanimity procedure, which makes it difficult for important decisions on cultural issues to be taken."
"Cultural realities and cultural policies vary widely, and large cultural disparities can be seen in the field of infrastructure, which are exacerbated by the introduction of new technologies. I believe that more decisions should be taken in the cultural field, and that they should be taken in a more flexible manner."
"Therefore, in view of the Intergovernmental Conference, is there an intention to change the current legal regime and for the qualified majority procedure to be used for decision-taking? Secondly, how has Article 151(4) on the inclusion of cultural aspects in all the EU' s actions been implemented to date?"
"It is true that extending qualified majority voting to European Union sectors of activity which currently require unanimous votes is indeed one of the major issues of the Intergovernmental Conference currently taking place."
"This is a crucial issue of democracy."
"In a democracy, decisions are agreed by the majority not by unanimity."
"In this context, Article 151 is one of the provisions likely to be converted to the rule of qualified majority voting."
"I am sure that Mrs Zorba would agree that it is still too early to ascertain what direction the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference are going to take, even though I would hazard that, quite possibly, consensus will be reached quickly regarding Article 151, for not everything can be a source of disagreement."
"As regards the manner in which Article 151(4) of the Treaty has been applied, I shall simply respond by saying that respect for and furtherance of the diversity of the cultures of Europe remain at the heart of the entire Community structure."
"Minister, everyone who knows that we urgently need a cultural policy in the European Union also knows - and I agree with you - that the Intergovernmental Conference represents a huge chance to change the unanimity rule."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is not a procedure which is foreign or bears no relation to the Council and it obviously takes account of all points of view and all types of need."
"It does not operate in a vacuum."
"My question therefore is this: is the Council doing anything to change the unanimity rule and push for a change at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The more economic policies progress, the more we need to study their cultural impact and develop a structural cultural policy. That was the meaning of my question;"
"I do not think we should just stand around and wait because it may be too late by then and an agreement may not be so easy to reach."
"The Council as such is not, by definition, a member of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would urge you to trust the French Presidency of the Council and the European Council to further the cause of extending qualified majority voting."
"Let me abandon my official role for a second to say that we would like to see qualified majority voting become the general rule and unanimous voting the exception, rather than the opposite, which is the case at present."
"Question No 10 by (H-0617/00):"
"Subject: Cost of enlargement and Mediterranean agriculture In the light of forecasts and the most recent legislative proposals on Mediterranean agriculture, which concern products such as cotton, rice, fruit and vegetables, tomatoes, nuts and olive oil, among others, and will have adverse effects on employment and social development in these poor regions of Europe, and bearing in mind also the budgetary plans for EU enlargement, what will the Council do to ensure that Mediterranean agriculture does not end up bearing the brunt of the costs of the forthcoming enlargement?"
"Would you be prepared to make some sort of recommendation with a view to preventing the negative impact of enlargement on the Mediterranean?"
"In truth, through his actions and proposals, Mr Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture, has made the anti-Mediterranean impact of enlargement a reality."
"It is a fact that the whole of the Mediterranean area is frightened about this."
"As I can see that the Council is standing firm in its political will, and in order to prevent - as you say - anything like this happening, not through good intentions but through facts, I would like to ask you whether the French Presidency, before it ends, would be willing to make, in the way it considers appropriate, some kind of recommendation which would dispel these concerns, that is to say, which would ensure that Mediterranean production would in no way pay the price for enlargement."
"This is not a subject that I am prepared to make impromptu comments on."
"I can assure you of just one thing, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, and that is that, as far as we are concerned, the financial perspectives, which were the product of tough negotiating in Berlin, represent a framework which it would be extremely difficult for us to shift."
"We do not wish to do so, and so, once again, we shall discuss the matter again in 2005."
"Question No 11 by (H-0619/00):"
"Subject: Attack on Greek minority in the village of Dervitsani in Albania The Greek inhabitants of Dervitsani, a village in Albania, passed the night of 3 to 4 July 2000 in shelters after being attacked by anti-tank missiles from the neighbouring village of Lazarati."
"The police who arrived on the scene failed to make any arrests."
"This is not the first attack against the Greek minority."
"The previous week the Council of Europe had recommended that the Albanian government take measures to protect the minorities living in Albania."
"Given the fact that the Council of the European Union adopted the action plan for Albania on 13/14 June 2000, will the Council say what political measures it intends to take and what immediate measures it will promote in order to strengthen security in the region and ensure the physical safety and the fundamental rights of minorities in Albania?"
"The Council is aware of the armed attack upon the village of Dervitsani from the village of Lazarati which occurred during the night of 3 to 4 July 2000, during which automatic weapons and explosives were used."
"According to the information available, the firing was carried out by a small group of people allegedly wishing to prevent the Albanian policy carrying out arrests in their village."
"Even though the Greek minority was not the target of the attack in question, the attack nonetheless contributed to creating a climate of insecurity in the region."
"The European Union supports the efforts of the Albanian Government to restructure and modernise its police forces in order to increase the security of Albanian citizens and of the region."
"The Multinational Advisory Police Element in Albania, formed under the authority of the WEU Council and deployed in Albania since 1997, has widened and developed the scope of its mission following the adoption, in March 1998, of a joint action on the European Union' s contribution to re-establishing a viable police force in Albania."
"Following the adoption of the action programme for Albania and the neighbouring region, the Council is currently examining the proposed measures in order to identify those which can be implemented speedily."
"The action programme is basically devoted to matters relating to problems of migration and asylum."
"The proposed measures do, however, include projects in the field of human rights and the protection of minorities."
"The European Union is, moreover, already active in these fields."
"Since Albania is eligible for an association and stabilisation agreement, its performance in terms of respect for democratic principles and human and minority rights and in terms of public order and the rule of law, are closely monitored by the European Union, I can assure you."
"I should like to thank the Council representative for his reply."
"However, the purpose of my question was to draw attention once again to the huge problems in the Balkans, problems caused by economic and social deprivation and, more importantly, the fact that there is no democratic infrastructure."
"The attacks on the Greek minority were just one in a series of incidents which occur in Albania on a daily basis."
"My question therefore, minister, is how far are you prepared to give real support to Albania so that the rule of law can operate?"
"We saw no such support in the action programme decided for Albania."
"You place greater emphasis in the action programme on how to stop immigration and how to send refugees back to Albania, which is clearly not a safe country, than on how we can give his country the means to develop."
"We seem to have promised the Balkans a great deal but are unwilling to put our promises into practice."
"I should like answers to these questions, minister."
"I share your view, Mrs Karamanou, that the incidents mentioned appear, at first sight, to indicate a general problem of security and public order in Albania rather than a campaign of deliberate attacks on the Greek minority."
"This is a general problem which must be dealt with as such."
"The action plan for Albania to which you refer is a High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration action plan for Albania and the neighbouring region, adopted by the General Affairs Council on 13 and 14 June this year, intended, in effect, to define and coordinate European Union resources with a view to responding to the problems of asylum and migration in Albania and the neighbouring countries and, as such, it is not intended to promote the rights of any particular minority."
"Nonetheless, the suggested actions do include projects or programmes seeking to step up democracy and respect for human rights and minority rights in general."
"The Council working groups are currently proceeding to examine the various measures proposed in order to identify which of them could be implemented in the near future."
"An interim report is expected for the European Council in Nice in December."
"Question No 12 by (H-0622/00):"
"Subject: Reduction of TACIS aid to Russia The European Union has punished Russia for its military action in Chechnya by reducing aid paid under the TACIS programme."
"At the Feira European Council it was decided to relax sanctions."
"Under what conditions does the Council consider that the TACIS funds should be granted to Russia for this year and next year?"
"In the wake of the Feira European Council, the General Affairs Council on 10 July this year requested that the Commission resume preparations for an indicative TACIS programme in favour of Russian, to cover the years 2000-2003, and to draw up a proposal for a TACIS action programme targeted at the year 2000."
"The relevant management committee is scheduled to examine these proposals on 17 October this year."
"The priority objective of this programme will be to support the rule of law in Russia, complying with the democratic requirements of a modern democracy and benefiting Russian society as a whole."
"Special attention is to be paid to supporting institutional and economic reforms, schemes undertaken for the democratisation and reinforcement of civil society and the protection and development of independent media."
"Moreover, the Council has agreed to adopt further decisions on guiding cooperation with Russia and the use of the available instruments, in the light of the development of the situation in Russia."
"I would thank the President of the Council for that answer."
"I should like to ask a follow-up question: What conditions are being laid down for in fact providing this aid?"
"Does the Council believe that the present situation in Chechnya is such that it is reasonable to provide this aid to Russia?"
"Yes. In 2000, only EUR 34 million have been committed to date, following the reorientation of the Helsinki programme."
"A second tranche will be allocated to aid in support of the reform process initiated by the Russian authorities recently in order to establish a genuine rule of law, which will bring the TACIS appropriations allocated to Russia in 2000 to EUR 92 million at the most."
"The only answer I can give you regarding the budget released in 2001 is that it will depend on the decisions the Council is induced to make at a later stage in the light of development of the situation in Russia."
"This situation will be assessed in relation to the criteria for the progress to be achieved in terms of institutional reforms, democratisation, the strengthening of civil society and human rights protection throughout the territory of Russia."
"Examination of the situation in Chechnya will thus clearly be part of the assessment process."
"Question No 13 by (H-0624/00):"
"Subject: Incidents at the Matosinhos market During the night of 22 June 2000, various groups - probably coastal fishermen from Poboa de Varsím and Matosinhos according to various sources - used blunt instruments to break open the doors of four Spanish lorries containing sardines in front of the premises of the company Docapesa S.A. at Matosinhos market."
"They then removed the fish from the lorries and sprayed it with diesel oil or similar products in order to damage it permanently, while uttering threats."
"Apart from the damage caused to the four companies concerned - one of them calculated that the damage to the fish amounted to nine million pesetas and the damage to the vehicles to 300 000 pesetas - incidents of this kind should not be allowed to happen (a similar incident involving mackerel occurred in 1998)."
"What steps will the Council take to prevent any recurrence of such incidents, which are against the law but in particular are contrary to the spirit and principles underlying the European Union?"
"Does it plan to make any arrangements to compensate for the unfair and deliberate damage caused?"
"Mr President, the Council deeply regrets the incidents which occurred at the Matosinhos market during the night of 22 June 2000 and the losses incurred by the victims of these acts of violence."
"It is important to stress, however, in this connection, that it is up to the individual Member States to ensure compliance with the regulations of the common fisheries policy and the free movement of goods, and to take appropriate measures within their national legislative systems."
"The offences in question should be punished in accordance with the terms of the criminal and civil law of the Member State concerned."
"To this end, let me remind you that on 7 December 1998 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the Member States, establishing procedures for the Commission to take action to require Member States, who alone are responsible for maintaining public order, to quickly remedy serious barriers to the free movement of goods caused by the actions of private individuals."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to say that relations between Galicia and the North of Portugal have always been special, because the Miño river has never marked a boundary, it has not separated, but rather united."
"However, unfortunate events such as those which took place on 22 June, caused by a small number of people, must not become the general rule."
"It is therefore important to adopt measures which will prevent, in all events, their repetition and that the sanction adopted by the competent parties shall serve as an example."
"Therefore, those of us from the other side of the river - and we are all Europeans - wanted to know how this issue is being dealt with and whether exemplary decisions have been taken so that these events will not be repeated in the future."
"I can only repeat my previous answer, namely that the maintenance of public order and any application of penal sanctions are a matter, respectively, for the jurisdiction of the police forces and the legal authorities of the Member State concerned."
"Let me quote the relevant part of the Regulation, which stipulates that, ""Where the Commission considers that an obstacle is occurring in a Member State, it shall notify the Member State concerned of the reasons that have led the Commission to such a conclusion and shall request the Member State to take all necessary and proportionate measures to remove the said obstacle."""
"I therefore feel - and I am not saying that in order to duck the question, as we say - that the honourable Member would do better to address the question to the Commission, which does have the necessary means to provide a reliable and up-to-date response."
"Mr President, Mr Moscovici, very serious attacks have also taken place in Finland on one certain means of livelihood, namely fur farming."
"The principle of the freedom to pursue a trade is firmly upheld in the European Union."
"Now, however, one Member State, Great Britain, has just banned fur farming in its territory."
"Do you not think this might have harmful repercussions for the internal market in fur goods?"
"I would ask you to reply now, as President-in-Office of the Council, and not so much as a representative of the French Government. The French Government has already expressed its own views on the matter in the Agricultural Council."
"I am answering on behalf of the Council and not on behalf of the French Government."
"The situation you mention may share some of the features of the previous situation, but it is not the result of the same regulation, which is to do with fisheries issues."
"I consequently feel entitled to ask you, please, to submit your question in the usual manner, i.e. in writing, and the Council will be pleased to respond."
"I am not going to respond ad hoc to a question on such a difficult subject."
"In support of the President-in-Office of the Council, I must point out that the Rules of Procedure for this Question Time state that supplementary questions must be closely related."
"Question No 14 by (H-0625/00):"
"Subject: Public Council meetings One of the three goals of the French Presidency is to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"The logical consequence of this aim should, therefore, be to make Council proceedings more open."
"How many fully public Council meetings will be held during the French Presidency from 1 July to 31 December 2000?"
"The French Presidency attaches special importance to ensuring that Council proceedings are accessible to the European citizens and that its legislative decisions are made in a transparent manner."
"The public debates are, moreover, an established practice."
"They lead to the European Union' s long-term evolution towards greater openness towards civil society."
"Moreover, Rule 8 of the Council's Rules of Procedure provides for the organisation of public debates."
"One of the top priorities of the French Presidency was, therefore, to draw up a list of public debates, covering a wide range of subjects, which was adopted by the Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) on 5 July 2000."
"Two debates were held in July, a debate on the presentation of the presidency' s programme at the General Affairs Council on 10 July 2000, and a second debate on the presidency programme at the ECOFIN Council on 17 July."
"I must specify that six further public debates are scheduled to take place before the end of the French Presidency: a debate on general interest services on 28 September 2000 at the Internal Market, Consumers and Tourism Council - I shall have the honour of chairing this council meeting; a debate on maritime safety on 2 October 2000 at the Transport Council in Luxembourg; a debate on noise protection on 10 October 2000 as part of the Environment Council; and a debate on information, consultation of workers regarding employment on 17 October 2000, as part of the Employment and Social Policy Council, again in Luxembourg."
"On 9 November 2000, there will be a public debate on young people and Europe as part of the Education and Youth Council."
"Finally, on 20 November 2000, there will be a debate on food safety as part of the Agriculture Council."
"I should like to draw the attention of the Members of the European Parliament to the fact that a substantial effort has already been devoted towards informing the public about the Council debates organised."
"Over 3000 detailed reports of the public debates have been delivered by post."
"Furthermore, any interested parties will easily be able to access the Internet networks which deal with this subject."
"In addition, television channels have the opportunity to broadcast these debates, in total or in part, via the 'Europe by Satellite' channel."
"Finally, the French Presidency strives to make as much information as possible on all Council proceedings available to the public on its Internet website, as well as subject indexes for the main topics under discussion."
"I want to thank the Council for its detailed answer."
"In an ordinary democracy it is, of course, the rule that all decisions concerning new laws are made publicly in a parliament and that the debates too are held in public."
"The curious situation in the Council of Ministers is that the public only has access to certain debates."
"There is therefore an obvious risk of meetings being closed in cases where more controversial subjects are being dealt with."
"I therefore wonder whether the French Presidency, given its high level of ambition, will hold any entire meetings in public, that is to say ministerial meetings which, from beginning to end, with all the debates and all the decision-making, take place in public, without the doors being closed for any part of them."
"Quite the opposite. I think I have shown that the French Presidency is determined to open debates up to the public as much as possible, and I believe that our programme is perfectly sound."
"I should just like to remind the honourable Member of the different roles of the various institutions of the European Union."
"It is true that the Council is co-legislator alongside the European Parliament, which does not fit into the pattern of the clear separation between executive and legislative power in the form that it may exist in a parliamentary democracy in the context of a State."
"Let us be aware, at the same time, however, that the European Council is not just a legislative body but also an executive body, a function which, this time, is shared with the Commission, and that it undertakes a whole range of debates which have nothing to do with the legislative process."
"Consequently, in the same way that these things are managed within a government, for that is what we are talking about here, the intergovernmental aspect, debates often take place in camera."
"I am fortunate enough to be a member of the cabinet in the government of my country."
"The French Council of Ministers in the Elysée Palace is not open to the press, nor is it filmed."
"I consider this to be reasonable, as it is a context in which decisions must be taken which are then passed on to the citizens quite openly."
"So there you are. It is because of this concept of the separation of powers that debates are designated as either open or closed."
"I think that it is, quite frankly, to the Council' s credit that they have opened up some of these debates, running counter to what I was saying earlier about the operation of a government."
"This is the situation we have, if we take the hybrid nature of the Council into due account."
"Thank you very much, Mr Moscovici, for showing such dedication to Parliament this afternoon."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Question Nos 15 to 40 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Question to the Council."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)."
"Economic and social development of Turkey"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mr Morillon (A5-0206/2000) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation regarding the implementation of the measures to promote economic and social development in Turkey [7492/1/2000 REV - C5-0325/2000 - 1998/0300(COD)]."
"Mr President, the Council common position whose aim you have just stated has been referred back to Parliament for a second reading, not because of its content, but because of its form."
"This could seem ridiculous, but it is not at all."
"With regard to content, Parliament has agreed to commit EUR 135 million over the next five years to measures aiming to compensate Turkey for the sacrifices it has agreed to make in order to enter into a customs union with the European Union, and on this point there is no divergence with the Council."
"With regard to form, we wanted to specify a number of areas in which the corresponding measures should be agreed as a priority, and the Council did not want to accept three of our proposals regarding the wording of a precautionary principle on the development of nuclear energy, in particular in earthquake zones. The protection and recognition of the cultural identity of minorities and support for measures seeking to abolish capital punishment and, finally, perhaps most importantly, the development of any form of cooperation seeking to resolve the Kurdish problem."
"I say that these matters of form are not trivial in a debate that precedes the one which is due to take place on accession in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in October, and following which, in November, I shall have to present the report on the state of progress of the work and any changes in attitudes within the European Union and Turkey."
"Since the way to accession was reopened in Helsinki, nobody has been able to say where this newly-cleared path will lead, nor how long it will take to reach the end."
"I think I can say that there is a broad consensus for granting Turkey a privileged position for geographical, historical, economic and political reasons, but I would also say that this privileged position can and must be envisaged within the European Union itself just as much as in close cooperation with the Union."
"I say that this choice belongs, by democratic right, to the citizens of the European Union whom we represent here, and to the Turkish citizens themselves."
"I understand that this was probably your opinion, Commissioner Verheugen, and I think I can guarantee you the support of a large majority of my colleagues in this area."
"The decision on Turkey' s accession is too important for the future of the European Union and Turkey for it to be made in veiled silence, or even in secrecy, behind closed doors."
"Long debates will be necessary, both here and in national parliaments, which is why everyone agrees that the road will be long and hard."
"As rapporteur on enlargement, I was convinced of this, not only by the richness and passion of the debates that have already taken place in Parliament, but also by observing the reactions in Turkey itself, both in government circles and in civil society."
"I shall come back to these contrasting reactions in detail when I present my report."
"Today, I shall simply come to the main conclusion."
"The people of Turkey consider that entry into the European Union will require not only a painless revision of their legal arsenal and the partial loss of their sovereignty, to which they remain attached, but also a radical change in their habits and mentality, for which they do not seem prepared."
"This is why Parliament has proposed the creation of a Euro-Turkish forum, bringing together qualified representatives of the Turkish community and those Members of the European Parliament that have been given the task, for in-depth discussions."
"I shall repeat this proposal in my report and I think I can say that the Turkish Government is not hostile to this, but quite the opposite, it would seem."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this long road, aware of the realities, I think the time has come to leave hypocrisy behind and not to continue to ignore the most important obstacles, including the Kurdish problem."
"It would not occur to the French today to deny that a Corsican problem exists, even if the French citizens and their government are divided on the solutions."
"There is a Kurdish problem in Turkey."
"The Council must not forbid the European Parliament to propose its contribution to the solution."
"If the text of this regulation is referred back for a second reading, it is not purely for a matter of form, but because Parliament refuses to accept this kind of political sleight of hand."
"Mr President, I wholeheartedly concur with Mr Morillon' s suggestion that we abandon the hypocrisy with which we sometimes deal with certain real problems for reasons of political or other expediency."
"There can, in my opinion, be no doubt that the issues covered in the three amendments rejected by the Council are real issues and that the Council position, or the sub-text at least, indicates a hypocritical disposition to sweep them to one side or underestimate their importance."
"And yet, these three amendments, which reflect the firm views of the European Parliament, are all of fundamental importance and the rapporteur is right to insist that they be adopted: they contain a safeguard against the Turkish authorities' constructing nuclear power stations in earthquake zones, an express reference to the death penalty and a clear indication of Turkey' s obligation to recognise and protect the cultural identity of minorities, within the wider context of its obligation to respect the rule of law and human rights, and they highlight the undisputed Kurdish problem and the need to resolve it - but not, of course, by dropping Turkish bombs on civilians, as in the most recent bombings in the Kendakor region on 18 August."
"I should like to hope that Parliament' s insistence on certain points being adopted will also help the Turkish side to understand, even if - as Mr Morillon rightly comments - it appears to be somewhat unwilling to understand, that the road towards Europe is not a one-way street of determination and patient understanding on the part of the European Union in the face of Turkey' s so-called special circumstances; it requires the same measure of determination on the part of the Turkish authorities and Turkish society to adjust to the rules of law and ethics which govern the European Union and which apply indiscriminately to all candidate countries; rules which, unfortunately, continue to be violated by Turkey, not only when it comes to the Kurdish problem and its democratic shortcomings, but also in numerous other cases, such as the Cyprus question and Greek-Turkish relations."
"A real sea change in Turkey' s behaviour and attitude would go some way towards encouraging all those who, in a spirit of perhaps excessive optimism, opted to speed up Turkey' s advance towards Europe and would help to shorten the long and difficult road - to quote Mr Morillon once again - of Turkey' s admission to the European family."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like first of all to thank Mr Morillon very sincerely for the good work he has done and for his persistence in pushing through the demands and the most important amendments."
"I am able to support him on behalf of my group, and I believe it must be possible to reach an agreement with the Council."
"We are keen to use this instrument to promote economic and social development in Turkey."
"Naturally, we hope that, parallel to this - and perhaps even as a result of it - political development in Turkey towards democracy and respect for human rights, in particular respect for its own Kurdish population, will also be strengthened, and the death penalty abolished."
"However - and I have to say this again and again in this Chamber, and I also say it in Turkey- we are very dissatisfied with the pace of political development."
"We could of course say that it is not our problem, and the fact that it is not prepared to make progress in this area more obvious and is not creating the political institutions for doing so is indeed Turkey' s own biggest problem."
"Not so long ago, Turkey elected a new State President - a judge, and a highly respected one at that, and in fact with the support of the government."
"And what does the government do as one of its first acts?"
"Over the summer, it sends its new State President a kind of emergency decree with a view to restricting some of the rights of people in government service. Then it wonders why, as a former high court judge, the President rejects the decrees he has been sent and says that the matter in question is one which Parliament must deal with, as is in fact fully to be expected in a democracy."
"Now, I have as little sympathy for Islamic militants as many others in this House, especially when they adopt the fundamentalist approach much in evidence in these regions and also manifested today in the debate between the Presidents of the Israeli and Palestinian Parliaments."
"The issue in question is one which has to be settled on a legal basis."
"It is just not on, using an emergency decree suddenly to remove all Islamic fundamentalists from office, as the government wants to do."
"Is there really a problem here?"
"Then it is one for Parliament to deal with."
"The Kurdish problem has already been mentioned."
"In that area too, scarcely any progress has been made."
"Again and again, we see first positive, then negative signs."
"Those who know that this is a crucial problem lack the courage to do anything about it."
"You mentioned the Corsican problem."
"I have to say that, in France too, the necessary courage is called for to tackle the problem after so many years."
"I should like to see just a little of this courage in Turkey with a view to finding a real solution to the Kurdish problem too."
"Of course, there are also other problems involving minorities."
"The death penalty was mentioned."
"How many times have we heard the conviction voiced that it must be abolished, and how long will it be before the relevant steps are taken?"
"The fact that Turkey is not taking these steps is something which cannot but disappoint those in this House - and I count myself among them - who would dearly like to see Turkey become a member of the European Union."
"I nonetheless believe that, if we persist, we shall achieve what we have pledged."
"Our pledges can, and will be, fulfilled, and precisely on the issue of promoting economic and social development."
"We are now waiting with bated breath to see whether Turkey will push ahead with political development on its own initiative."
"Mr President, our relations with Turkey should promote democracy, stability and consistency."
"The path to those goals is partly by way of social and economic development, and the way to social and economic development is partly by means of foreign investment."
"The Union' s finance package will be an incentive to further investment in Turkey and, in the process, will also promote and consolidate democracy and human rights."
"We have seen this strategy succeed in former dictatorships in Southern Europe, we shall see it work in Eastern and Central Europe, and it ought also to work in Turkey."
"Parliament should support this strategy, and we should, at the same time, insist that, before there can be any question at all about membership negotiations, the Copenhagen criteria should be met as these relate to democracy and human rights."
"Finally, I would emphasise the need to rebuild the thousands of Kurdish villages razed to the ground."
"This ought to be an express priority in our policy on Turkey, and we must insist that the Turkish Government too make it a high priority. In the same way, we must insist that the rights of the Kurdish minority are respected, just as the rights of minorities are respected in the countries of the Union and in the other candidate States."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his recommendation for second reading."
"He is very familiar with the situation in Turkey."
"He is aware of the problems of this country and of the people who live there."
"It is no secret that Turkey cannot be democratic in our sense of the word until such time as the economic and social problems there have been solved."
"It is also widely appreciated that Turkey will not be able to get on top of these problems alone and without our aid."
"The demands contained in the rapporteur' s amendments - he talks of the protection of minorities, rightly demands the abolition of the death penalty and calls for a solution to the Kurdish problem - are in no way conditions designed to stand in the way of aid. Instead, they are valuable proposals for the necessary democratic reforms in Turkey."
"At the very end of the day, Turkey will benefit from these reforms being put into practice."
"To that extent, we support the rapporteur' s recommendation and thank him again for the work he has done."
"Mr President, just nine months - or perhaps I should say already nine months - have passed since the Helsinki resolution granting Turkey candidate status."
"At the time, we predicted that this resolution would not help, as many maintained, to bring about democratisation and improved living conditions for the Turkish people and that it would only encourage the regime to exercise ever greater oppression."
"Nine months later, we are sorry to say that we were right because, to tell the truth, we would have preferred to have been proven wrong."
"Now the Council has proposed releasing EUR 135 million for the economic and social development of Turkey."
"We fear that a substantial proportion of this sum will be used, despite any controls carried out, to strengthen the machinery of oppression."
"Allow me to give you some facts and figures."
"As we all know, despite promises made from time to time, the constitution is still seriously undemocratic, the death penalty remains, Turkish jails currently house over 15,000 political prisoners in inhumane conditions, which are now being modernised with the introduction of solitary confinement, provoking outrage in Turkey, including in the Law Society of Istanbul, which has issued a special paper condemning these measures."
"There were arrests recently during events for world peace day on 1 September, Cyprus continues to be occupied and, as we are preparing to release funds, Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit has said that the Cyprus question was resolved in 1974, i.e. with the barbaric invasion and continuing occupation, demonstrating his disdain for UN resolutions."
"And, I would add, Mr Gem says the same about Greek-Turkish relations."
"Some people would do well not to boast and brag because these Greek-Turkish relations constantly result in the Greek Government' s backing down and that in itself is a source of further tension."
"So do you want to use this money as bait so that you can penetrate the Turkish economy even further, so that you can plunder the Turkish people' s wealth even more?"
"We do not intend to say give it or withhold it, we simply want to point out the conditions under which and the reason why this money is being given."
"Mr President, I fully support Mr Morillon' s excellent work, as presented by him and supplemented by Mr Swoboda."
"I do not therefore intend to repeat arguments which I accept overall."
"However, I should like to make a few comments."
"The strange nature of relations between the European Union and Turkey, which we have experienced for many years, from the beginning and throughout, is due to the political problem which we call Turkey."
"Thus, 9-10 months ago, Helsinki set a procedure in motion, essentially with an eye to resolving the problem which we call Turkey."
"In this sense, and because Commissioner Verheugen, the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, is here with us, and given that there is a whole atmosphere surrounding the text which will shape the partnership between the European Union and Turkey, a text which we shall receive at a later date, I am certain that he will advocate incorporating everything included in the Helsinki resolutions on human rights, on Cyprus, on the Aegean and on crises in the text of the Treaty rather than in the preamble."
"Take a look at Turkey."
"It is a law unto itself."
"It radiates crisis on every side."
"Those of us who live in the region are sick and tired of crises."
"It is because of its political system that Turkey radiates these crises."
"We recently heard statements by Turkish-Cypriots in Cyprus, who have at last come forward and condemned Turkey as an occupying force."
"Only yesterday on the BBC I heard the head of a party of Turkish-Cypriots - Turkish-Cypriots, not settlers - half of whom have remained in Cyprus, appealing to the Turks to let them join the European Union. Turkey wanted to join and he felt that it should let them join earlier."
"In this sense, given that these relations gamble with the political face of Europe and with Europe' s prospects and principles, I am certain that Commissioner Verheugen will want to assure us that the Commission, as the guardian of these principles, intends to base the integration process for Turkey firmly on these principles."
"And I think that the main issue is precisely this process and this road."
"Because I do not think, Mr Verheugen, that we can all agree to vote for parliaments, to vote for governments, on the one hand, and yet still have military rule dictating political terms on behalf of us all on the other."
"From this viewpoint, the Morillon proposal is an encouraging prospect."
"We, as Greeks, want Turkey in the European Union, we want a democratic Turkey, because a democratic Turkey will be the beginning of the end of crises in the region as a whole, crises which we have lived with for many, many years and from which none of us has profited."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Morillon, most sincerely for his most thorough report."
"I am glad that we have been able to achieve far-reaching agreement."
"I am also pleased that Parliament has responded very quickly to the common position unanimously adopted in the Council. Above all, I am glad that Parliament is able to accept far and away the greater part of this position, as proposed by the Commission."
"The report now proposes adding three points to the draft regulation."
"I am able to tell you that the Commission shares Parliament' s view on these points."
"The Commission will therefore examine the relevant amendments proposed by the European Parliament, inform the Council as soon as possible of its position and ask it to conclude the legislative procedure."
"A special importance attaches to this draft regulation for it constitutes the last of the three pillars of financial aid for Turkey, the others being the measures in favour of Turkey in the framework of the MEDA programme and the regulation issued by the Council in April."
"All these financial resources are designed to support implementation of the pre-accession strategy."
"The purpose of the strategy is to equip Turkey for entering into negotiations."
"That will only come about when basic political, economic and social reforms have been implemented."
"Improvements in relations between the Union and Turkey following the European Council, meeting in Helsinki, have enabled us to speak openly and frankly with each other on all issues."
"The strengthened political dialogue at all levels characteristic of the climate following Helsinki has made a decisive contribution to this state of affairs."
"I also have to say that open and frank discussions which sometimes address painful themes and touch upon sensitive issues are indispensable if we want to travel all the way down the path which lies before us."
"I should like to take the opportunity to re-emphasise that we await a firm commitment on the part of Turkey to continuing with the process of reform that has been begun."
"A few weeks ago, Turkey signed both UN conventions on civil and political rights and on economic and social rights."
"I believe that this is of a piece with the decision we made last year and may be regarded as a successful outcome."
"I welcome Turkey' s signature of these documents as an important step in the right direction."
"However, I should also like to emphasise that it is now a question of both conventions quickly being ratified by the Turkish Parliament and of the commitments contained in these also being put into practice."
"On my last visit to Turkey in July, I was informed in detail of an inter-ministerial commission' s report, then before the government, on the reforms needed if the Copenhagen criteria are to be fulfilled."
"The report contains a host of proposed reforms for improving the human rights situation."
"However, it is now a question of the Turkish Government' s putting the proposed reforms into effect within the framework of a consistent legislative programme."
"I also expressly insisted upon this in the course of the discussions in Turkey."
"As you know, the European Council, meeting in Helsinki, has confirmed that it is essential for Turkey firstly to comply with the political accession criteria if its relations with the European Union are to become any closer."
"This will also be the theme in preparing the Accession Partnership which the Commission is to submit in the autumn of this year on the instructions of the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Community audiovisual policy in the digital age"
"The next item is the report (A5-0209/2000) by Mr Veltroni, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Principles and guidelines for the Community's audiovisual policy in the digital age [COM(1999)657 - C5-0144/2000 - 2000/2087(COS)]"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document on the Community's audiovisual policy in the digital age, presented by the Commission, is important because this technological innovation has, to a certain extent, a direct bearing on our cultural future and therefore on sensitive issues such as pluralism and the quality of democracy in our continent."
"The digital age and convergence of media will change everything: our way of gaining knowledge, communicating, working, producing and understanding."
"There are risks - as there always are when innovation bursts forth - but the transition to digital technology will bring with it huge opportunities for pluralism and massive production possibilities for the system."
"It is no coincidence that the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, proposed a few days ago to put digital television frequencies up for auction in order to speed up the process, revolutionising the prospects of the conventional management of the electromagnetic spectrum."
"And it is also no coincidence that Mr Blair also proposed free distribution of set top boxes, perceiving that this would benefit both the economy and the information and cultural pluralism of his country."
"Changes in technology bring changing perspectives and therefore changes in legal approaches as well."
"The Community therefore has to keep up with progress and endeavour to ensure that digital technology fulfils its potential as an opportunity for culture, pluralism, cultural and linguistic diversity and for the European economy and technical innovation and research in Europe."
"We consider that the instruments which have already been defined in the Commission's text will make it possible to achieve these goals."
"However, the debate generated in Parliament, which has looked at different points of view and has pulled out all the stops, as did the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, in order to find a common point of agreement with the result that the report was adopted unanimously, proposes a limited number of nevertheless important supplements."
"Firstly: the need for a rapid revision of the legal instruments governing the sector, in particular the ""Television without Frontiers"" Directive which has been in need of revision for a long time."
"Secondly: in order to avert the risk of dependency of our cultural industry in the event of expansion, of growth of the number of channels, we would like to introduce the possibility of production investment in the audiovisual sector."
"It is vital for the media to be financed but I feel that, following the example of certain countries, we should also provide for the television broadcasting companies themselves to set aside funds, dedicating a proportion of their revenue to the production of European programmes."
"I consider that this is a useful, important action for it both supports the industry and acts as an incentive for it."
"Thirdly, monitoring the concentration of media ownership, in the future maybe on the basis of specific regulations at European level safeguarding pluralism, taking up once again the idea of a media directive and a body which would monitor at European level the application of the rules in this sensitive sector; in addition, a policy which, in the age of convergence, would also safeguard a universal service with regard to access to content, which is taken to mean non-discrimination and affordable access to services."
"As the importance of the role of the public broadcasting service in the digital system is recognised, the service will, of course, have to be reviewed and revamped in the light of changes in technology, but it will also have to perform the function of guaranteeing the quality of services to a large public, which will continue for a long time to use its common or garden television sets and wireless reception on a daily basis; therefore, strategic recognition of the role of land-based digital television, whose growth can only be considered to be an opportunity here as well."
"Finally, the report proposes a supplement to ensure that particular attention is paid to safeguarding cultural diversity, international negotiations and the need to consolidate the European audiovisual industry to make it competitive on the global market."
"This is therefore the spirit of the report and its attempt to operate within the bounds proposed by the Commission's report."
"The TDI Group has tabled amendments characterised by a different vision, a different legitimate cultural and political inspiration."
"My opinion is that, if these amendments were to be adopted, the report would then be devoid of those characteristics which prompted agreement in the Committee, the very characteristics which are our basis for considering that the report could be a positive supplement to the Commission's report."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Tajani, as a member of the same delegation and the same committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Commission on the complicated content of its initiative, but we must not let go of the importance of regulating the audiovisual policy in the age of high technology in which we live and which will become more and more important for our lives in the near future."
"Due to the complexity of the material and the short time available to me, I will restrict myself to a few recapitulatory statements which I consider essential and which I hope the Commission will take into due consideration."
"The free movement of information and freedom of expression serve now to safeguard rights and freedoms and will always do so."
"The citizens' confidence in the audiovisual service must be won through compliance with the principles of the protection of human dignity and of minors."
"The area in question, which is constantly developing, is in need of detailed rules, but they must not be too rigid or they will rapidly become obsolete."
"Technology and content cannot be governed by the same legislation: technology must be neutral and content must be regulated."
"The system of funding must comply with the principles of proportionality and transparency and must not influence the market or competition."
"Where a commercial activity is associated with a public service, the keeping of separate accounts will make the compensation for the service rendered transparent, making it possible to prevent any disguised State aid and to allow private firms to provide the public service as well."
"No national restriction must be placed on transposition, in order to achieve genuine European harmonisation, both now and in the event of future growth."
"Including self-regulation codes in the legislative framework will ensure transparency, responsibility and the equal status of public and commercial operators."
"Clearly, in the context of new technologies, a situation where State subsidies to public service broadcasters are used for commercial ends must be avoided, as this would distort the principle of competitiveness with private companies instead of ensuring compliance with specific content obligations."
"Lastly, we must guarantee multiplicity and pluralism of bids and provide all operators with the possibility of playing an innovative and leading role, thus liberalising access to public financing."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Veltroni."
"As rapporteur, he has done some very good work, including work of a very cooperative nature, and I should like to thank him very much for that."
"However, thanks are similarly due to the Commission which has provided an outstanding basis for the discussions between the Committee and Parliament."
"The audiovisual sector basically faces the task of having to develop in two main fields."
"Firstly, it is a means of generating future jobs. Secondly, however, it is also of great significance for securing cultural diversity and freedom of speech in Europe."
"It is therefore important always to keep both perspectives in view."
"I should like briefly to illustrate this by way of three examples."
"Firstly, it is necessary to regulate content and methods of transmission differently and independently of each other."
"We need a form of technology which can respond very quickly and very flexibly to the technological revolution."
"I would just mention the buzz word 'Internet' at this point."
"However, we not only wish to guarantee people universal access to all networks but also need to ensure that young people are protected and human dignity assured by means of legal regulations which, independently of the method of transmission, safeguard these values that are indispensable to us all."
"Secondly, consider the level at which decisions are made."
"Where the issue of technology is concerned, we need increasing cooperation among the Member States at European level."
"When it comes to issues of content, however, we want to know that, in the first place, the Member States are willing and able to safeguard cultural pluralism and diversity of opinion."
"Thirdly, television in Europe."
"We have both commercial and public service broadcasting which both require clear statutory frameworks in order to be able to develop in competition."
"We therefore say a clear yes to the protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam on public service broadcasting and to the Member States' responsibility for commissioning and for securing finance."
"We are also, however, saying just as clear a yes to the task of developing and promoting commercial television companies in Europe so that they can compete effectively worldwide."
"That is the crucial precondition for safeguarding European cultural content, with the conditions of future technology in mind."
"Thank you very much to Mr Veltroni for giving us such a valuable report."
"It is a welcome clarification on where Parliament stands on digital and audiovisual sector issues for the forthcoming revision of TV without frontiers."
"However, I want to confine my remarks this evening to public service broadcasting in the digital age because there are some very important public access issues that we need to address when defining the principles from the crossover in our current media to the development of digital broadcasting."
"Defining the values and principles underlying public broadcasting gives us some difficulties anyway, as Member States, corporations, and broadcasters all have very different ideas of what public broadcasting constitutes."
"However, this should not prevent us from defining it in the digital age, because these principles are very important to us all, and, as infrastructure has developed, so content is going to develop as well."
"We are all being told that we are entering a knowledge-based society, and if that is the case, then knowledge in a sense becomes power that defines the powerless and the powerful, the information poor and the information rich."
"Overcoming that divide, to my mind, should be one of the key points that we emphasise in this report."
"There are a number of reasons why this is important to us from the perspective of European content."
"First of all, if we are in a knowledge-based society, we need growth in knowledge-based and creative skills."
"Secondly, we are a democratic society, and digital policy in the audiovisual sector can connect our local citizens to our citizens at the centres of power."
"In terms of cultural richness and diversity, it is important both that we should have individual centres of cultural excellence and that we be bound as a European continent."
"And, finally, we have to ensure that the switchover from analogue to digital is attractive to all of our citizens: that is the end which we should work to achieve."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the airwaves are buzzing."
"You cannot open a newspaper or put the radio or television on without being confronted by new developments in the IT or digitalisation sectors."
"Things are happening fast, in fact they are happening at the speed of light, which is why my group is delighted with the communication from the Commission and with Mr Veltroni' s exhaustive report, which looks into every aspect of these new developments."
"As the rapporteur rightly points out, the AV sector is an extremely important sector in terms of employment, but also in terms of freedom of expression, democracy and cultural diversity in Europe."
"But as far as the Liberal Group is concerned, that does not mean that Europe should set about regulating absolutely everything."
"This would not be possible, and nor would it be desirable."
"It is a self-aware sector and is perfectly capable of standing on its own two feet."
"As the Liberals see it, for one thing this means that there is no need for yet another additional subsidy over and above Media Plus for the European film industry."
"Complementary measures and cooperation with the business community, and fiscal measures, these are the key words of a more effective policy intended to increase the financial resources and to improve the marketing and distribution."
"That is why we have requested split voting for Recital N. Nor are we in favour of quotas."
"The TV operators must decide for themselves, on the basis of quality, what programmes they want to show."
"It is not Europe' s business to regulate this, so no artificial protection."
"The industry in Europe is more than capable of making interesting and quality productions that will attract viewers."
"As I have already said, it is only the marketing and distribution that need to be improved."
"On a final note: we attach a great deal of importance to the freedom of the user and therefore the same applies to parents."
"They have the right and the responsibility to decide for themselves what is suitable for their children."
"So we do not need complex censorship and filtering systems in programmes."
"It is often very doubtful as to where the boundary lies."
"And we certainly do not want a legal framework, where the powers that be set the rules."
"My group will vote accordingly."
"Mr President, first and foremost, I must apologise on behalf of my colleague Mrs Echerer, who felt unwell and has gone to see the doctor."
"So if I go over my allotted time slightly, I would like to pick up some of her speaking time."
"Needless to say, I can only congratulate Mr Veltroni on his first-rate report, which, as someone has just said, has come at a good time."
"In the past, as well as the present, Europe has taken a fairly progressive stance on the telecommunications front, when it comes to a European single market, and we are none the worse for that."
"I believe it is high time for us to take a look at the content side of things, because, unfortunately, Europe is still lagging behind a little in this respect."
"It is a marvellous idea to create a whole network that responds to the requirements of convergence, and which enables the public to receive information via a GSM, a computer or a television, but we must also be aware of what sort of information it is and, above all - and I am also thinking about what may be of positive value to our audiovisual industry - we must beware of being inundated by American products alone."
"After all, the fact is that our European cinema, as I have said on other occasions, is light years behind, and we cannot allow this situation to continue indefinitely, particularly in the light of the history of European cinema."
"I am not calling for quotas."
"I am calling for a European investment fund to be set up, which will enable the creative producers we have in Europe to at long last enter into real competition with America, in a manner which fully meets with the requirements of the free market."
"No, this is not regulation, it would simply be a means of enabling creative producers to get down to work in Europe, and a way of avoiding seeing all the talent, intelligence and capital - for this is the new trend - disappearing over to Hollywood."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she does not think that the time has come to work on a new directive for the cinema."
"Is it not time - since this is one of the distinguishing features of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which I belong to, - for us all to sit down together one day and consider how we are going to rescue the European film industry?"
"And I repeat, this is not a petition for rules and regulations, this is taking a long, hard look at how films are made, for there is no mystery about it."
"Films cannot be made without a major injection of capital, and that is where we fall down in Europe. I believe this presents a unique opportunity for the European Investment Bank."
"Mr President, the Commission has set itself the short-term task of defining what a European audiovisual work is."
"I am very interested by this definition, which naturally complements today's discussion."
"The effect of the ""Television without Frontiers"" Directive has been that a large percentage of national works are still broadcast in each country, without managing to have these works circulated between countries."
"The aim of defining European audiovisual works must therefore be to achieve the circulation of these works."
"In this context, we agree that the cultural diversity that is advocated today is not a simple addition of the respective identities of each Member State, but the exchange and circulation of these identities."
"However, the circulation of works, like the origin of their funding, will probably be insufficient to define the European audiovisual work."
"The issue of the work' s content concerns us all."
"What content can define a work, if it is not content founded on a pluralist approach to production?"
"Partnerships are necessary for current and future audiovisual creation, but hegemonic strategies and monopolies are counter to creation itself."
"There is nothing more dangerous than the current concentrations of operators who have both the broadcasting capacity as well as archives of material."
"At a time of digital revolution and technological change, Mr Veltroni's excellent report clearly shows the economic and cultural need for a European audiovisual policy."
"I would like to end by emphasising the essential points of this report."
"What could protect diversity and pluralism better than a ""universal service"" ?"
"What would ensure free access to information, entertainment and knowledge?"
"Public television is not a monopoly and should not be one."
"One of the goals of the public service, however, is the general interest, and for this reason it must be valued."
"Public television channels are developing autonomously in each Member State, pursuant to Protocol 32 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but they are agreed on taking on similar tasks, such as information, innovation, room for exchange and integration etc."
"All that remains is to make their funding transparent, not so much to conform to rules on competition as to enable public service to really diversify its activities and enrich its services."
"To put it plainly, not to die off in the digital age, but to perpetuate the accomplishment of its goals which should, it seems to me, constitute guidelines for the Community audiovisual policy."
"Mr President, I would like to start by complimenting the rapporteur on managing to combine so many proposals in one report."
"However, I would like to touch on a few points."
"In the first place, I agree that there is a need for policy-makers and the law to be able, or rather to be as good as under obligation, to adapt to the speed of technological progress."
"In the case of the audiovisual sector, clear and, most importantly, timely legal instruments will mean that the institutions are able to regulate these changes: to provide better protection for the public and for users, establish the necessary restrictions to protect minors, lay down new rules to protect copyright and set regulations in place before certain developments occur, such as the fact that electronic commerce will soon be taking place via the medium of television."
"Moreover, we must not be intimidated but take pride in the entire audiovisual sector in the digital age as a great vehicle of freedom, information and movement of ideas."
"We have a vast European heritage of culture and communications which must be fully exploited, and for this more funding will certainly be necessary, but this purpose could also be served by opportunities for discussion, such as the Forum proposed by the rapporteur: this would be an opportunity for discussion aimed at the creation of a future audiovisual policy which would take advantage of the infinite number of openings provided by the newest technology and use them to further progress towards the goal of producing increasingly high quality products."
"Therefore, our objective is to achieve an interactive audiovisual policy where there is more participation in order to give expression to the countless individual characteristics and differences in which our great European identity is rich."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Veltroni, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I cannot support the positive view you have expressed of the report under discussion on the Communication from the Commission on the guidelines for the Community's audiovisual policy in the digital age."
"I cannot support your view because the communication is a reproduction of the old European TV and cinema cliché: direct public intervention through State agencies, welfarism and disregard for the nature of the market, a cliché which is characterising the audiovisual sector more and more."
"All this has been dredged up and 'modernised' to suit the new digital age of multimedia convergence and the extraordinary spread of the Internet."
"The impression therefore persists that European audiovisual companies are incapable of growing or standing on their own two feet and that users are incapable of discerning from among the vast amount of multimedia products on offer which products are better and most suited to their needs, as if past welfarism and paternalism had not been responsible for the difficult situation in which the sector finds itself today."
"Everybody - companies and users alike - would benefit from the freedom of choice provided by a bold opening of the market and State withdrawal."
"Moving on to some specific points of the report under consideration."
"The regulation refers to the separation of infrastructures and content, serving up for content the old regulations once again."
"But what does this mean?"
"Perhaps Mr Veltroni could enlighten us."
"It may be, for example, that the intention is to extend the law governing the press, including related contracts and the need to be registered in the register of journalists and to be certified, to on-line publications."
"In my view, this would be a serious error."
"Or to extend the current stifling TV regulations to all the other programmes which are broadcast via the Web."
"This would be a serious mistake, an illusion, for which the European companies and citizens would have to pay the price all over again."
"The boom of the Internet was made possible by the State's inability to curb it with a mass of bans and regulations."
"This was the right way for things to happen and it is right that they should remain that way."
"With regard to intellectual property and copyright - another point covered by the report - I feel that it is pointless and damaging to the positive development of the Internet to strengthen the directive on copyright, as it is proposed to do."
"Remember the Napster and the New Tell cases."
"We consider that a critical revision of copyright ownership rights needs to be carried out in such a way as to facilitate and increase the transparency of the transmission of knowledge and products, and, on this point, the companies and the large corporations know that they will have to come to an agreement with the Web."
"With regard to cinema, additional funding is requested for European cinema."
"As Mr Veltroni is aware, there is a 50-year-old battle going on in Italy between the liberals, Sturzo and Ernesto Rossi, and those who want to continue with cinema subsidies."
"We are of the opinion that the freedom of choice of the citizens to determine the success or failure of a film is also the best and most efficient way of ensuring the growth of the cinematographic sector."
"We have tabled an amendment calling for a cost/benefit analysis of what has been done to date."
"Lastly, on the subject of the privatisation of television, we call for a revision of the Amsterdam protocol which is referred to here as if it is set in stone."
"The Financial Times has raised the issue of the privatisation of the jewel of European public television, the BBC."
"Public television networks must be privatised or increasingly high licence fees will be imposed for new investments."
"If we want to maintain a public service, the television broadcasting right must be auctioned off between all the operators: programmes will then be more efficient and there will be a saving for license payers."
"I call upon you to consider the amendments we have tabled, which would change the intention of the report, following a system of aid incentives which has not worked in the past and will not work in the future either."
"Mr President, I believe that the work carried out by the Commission and also by the rapporteur, Mr Veltroni, contains many important elements."
"It is clear that a great effort has been made to introduce new issues and to take new steps in European audiovisual policy."
"However, I believe that we still have a lot to do on certain points, both in the Commission and in Parliament."
"We are very much lagging behind in relation to the huge changes taking place in the audiovisual sector, particularly as a result of digitalisation."
"To fail to act would be like an ostrich burying its head in the sand."
"I am sure that that is not what we want."
"We all know that digitalisation began about five years ago and therefore this work on audiovisual policy is timely to say the least."
"There are five points I would like to highlight because I believe that sooner or later they will have to be reviewed:"
"First is the definition of public service."
"This is important if we want to have a public service in Europe in an environment which is truly competitive - and this can be seen from the audience for public services - and also for the good of the private audiovisual service."
"There are still many issues to be resolved: one of them is the separation of the requirements established for each of these."
"Secondly, it seems to me essential that there be a review of the ""Television without Frontiers"" Directive."
"In this respect we are behaving like the aforementioned ostrich."
"Thirdly, we must define in some way - and I believe that this document does not deal with this adequately - what is to happen with interactive TV services, what is to happen with the Internet on television."
"The fourth point refers to the transfer from analogue TV to digital TV and its consequences for users in terms of the use and acquisition of new terminals."
"Lastly, there is the implication of the laws on competition and mergers."
"The audiovisual policy should tackle these points and also go into more depth in the field of competition."
"Mr President, Mr Veltroni' s excellent report received firm support in Parliament' s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and the same seems to be happening here, too, in plenary."
"The move into the digital age is a massive revolution for the media."
"This technical development offers the consumer still greater opportunities for using audio-visual products, in terms of time, place, content and equipment."
"At the same time, it means a splintering of the media and more pressure on development and commercialism."
"The audio-visual sector is of the utmost importance to competitiveness, employment, and culture, too, in Europe."
"The Commission' s initiative in this is also very welcome, as is the clarification of roles in respect of the information society and the main areas of culture."
"Amid this technological revolution it is vital to bear in mind the social and cultural importance of media communications."
"It cannot be a matter of equipment or financial gain."
"The importance of the equality of information must not be underrated."
"For that reason, I wish to stress the importance of safeguarding public service broadcasting in the future as well."
"In that connection we must honour the Additional Protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam, according to which Member States decide how to organise public service finances."
"We also have to make sure that people' s rights to receive information and cultural services in their own language are protected."
"As a certain European historian said, a person' s native country in Europe in the future will be that person' s native language."
"Television and film, as cross-border media, attract more interest than radio."
"However, the importance of radio, particularly in minority language areas, should not be underestimated."
"For radio to remain part of the digital age development it is important to establish a DAB standard for it."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the ""Television without Frontiers"" Directive."
"At the same time, we know that the transition to digital TV involves a risk of its being precisely TV with frontiers that we end up with."
"It will not be possible to watch the BBC in the Irish Republic."
"It may no longer be possible to watch Swedish television as easily in Finland."
"It has in the past been possible to watch television across national borders."
"It is difficult to buy digital cards for existing pay TV."
"I appeal to the Commissioner to bear in mind the urgent request made unanimously by the groups in Parliament in conjunction with the reading of the technical directive on digital TV and really to examine this issue which has a very great deal to do with the fact that the copyright organisations have not agreed upon sensible conditions for selling TV rights."
"I would therefore urge the Commissioner to bear this in mind."
"At the same time, I want to support a good deal of what Mrs Iivari said about minority language areas."
"Those of us who are interested in defining public service on a national basis must be watchful."
"We must be careful that, for example, competitive aspects do not have the unfortunate effect of undermining our national right to define the kind of public service we want to provide."
"Not all languages are in fact equal in the EU in this respect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ever since they came into being, audiovisual means have been an important factor in ideological intervention."
"Controlling them is of strategic importance in the digital age in order to mould consciences and a modus vivendi, because whoever controls them decides what information they should carry."
"In the view of the Communist Party of Greece, they should be controlled by the public sector."
"Not because we are labouring under the illusion that governments in a capitalist system will allow full and fundamental information, but because then we can have maximum possible social control."
"The Commission, however, has relegated the public sector to the role of poor relation and market legislation to the role of basic regulator."
"The purpose of this apparently anti-monopolistic policy is to create oligopolies, which will be equally unconducive to objective information but which will guarantee huge profits and more secure ideological orientation, with the flow of information controlled by a few European monopolies, to the detriment of any notion of freedom and democracy."
"As far as we are concerned, the problem is not whether information will be controlled by American or European monopolies."
"The real problem is that the people need to develop their resistance and enforce their right to fundamental information."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, digital technology is changing our lives, and this change is taking place whether we like it or not."
"We have to make use of it and create the relevant statutory framework."
"I should like to add to what the previous speakers have said by expanding briefly upon a few points."
"The Lisbon Seminar on Digital Television, held under the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, unfortunately came up with little apart from an incomplete overview of the subject."
"That is why I am calling for a Digital Europe initiative with clear plans for the harmonised introduction of digital television and the digitalisation of content."
"Merely setting deadlines according to a motto to the effect that the whole of Europe is to go digital by 2010 is not enough."
"Secondly, the industry should be given a fair chance to regulate itself along the lines of the code of conduct for added value telecommunications services in Austria."
"Not everything needs to be over-regulated by the legislator."
"Thirdly, audiovisual policy concerns infrastructure and content."
"We know that, where the latter is concerned, we have fallen far behind the United States, despite quota rules."
"Only those who provide exciting content for a large number of viewers are taken notice of."
"We must therefore do everything to support European content suppliers and to make their work easier instead of more difficult."
"Fourthly, the approach according to which content and infrastructure are closely regulated should be maintained."
"In my own country, the blueprint for the media authority KOMMAUSTRIA presents an exemplary way of doing this in line with the eight draft EU directives we have on the information society."
"We need to keep pace and ought not to lose any more time."
"Mr President, the document presented by the Commission in relation to its policy in the audiovisual sector in the digital era includes, amongst other things, two ideas which I consider to be fundamental."
"Firstly, we must safeguard the future of the dual system of public and private television, and it is essential that European public operators can make full use of the possibilities offered by the new information technologies."
"Secondly, cultural and linguistic diversity is a fundamental objective of Community policy in the audiovisual sector."
"To this end, I wish to propose that the Commission, in its action and aid, prioritise positive discrimination in favour of the audiovisual sectors of the regional and minority cultures and languages of the European Union."
"A good way of favouring diversity is to give particular support to the weaker elements."
"Similarly, I propose that Community legislation and the decisions of the Commission itself favour the idea that broadcasts of all mass events - ceremonies, shows, sport, etc. should be considered to be of general interest and can therefore be followed in all the languages of the European Union, including regional languages."
"That is the only way we can make Europe into a true union of diversities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a glance at German cable television, where some 30 channels are now already jostling for attention, is enough to show that multiplicity is not the same thing as diversity."
"In competition with commercial suppliers, there is easily a danger of succumbing to demands for mass appeal and neglecting less lucrative areas of interest."
"That is why it is so important for audiovisual strategy to be linked to protection of the pluralism and diversity of opinion which are now the crucial bases for democratic opinion-forming, as well as for public service media to be guaranteed an equal opportunity to develop in the media market of the future."
"There must be non-discriminatory access to this future market for all citizens, and there must also be non-discriminatory access for suppliers of all types of content."
"Specifically, this means market transparency and preventing developments whereby economic power turns into the concentration of media ownership and finally into the abuse of political power."
"These key considerations define the most important premisses for the further development of statutory frameworks."
"Mr Veltroni's report makes important proposals in this area."
"However, not everything can be regulated by law."
"I should therefore like to address a matter which has still not been mentioned in this House, namely the acquisition of media-related skills."
"You have to get to know your way around what the multimedia world has to offer in order to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, select what is of value and hone your judgement."
"The transfer of media-related skills must become a component of the Community' s audiovisual strategy."
"To that extent, the Commission' s communication still does not go far enough."
"Mr President, as Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would also like to personally acknowledge the extremely valuable work carried out by Mr Veltroni."
"I am pleasantly surprised that such a major, essential measure has been able to obtain the unanimous consensus of the Committee, for I honestly did not think that it would have been possible."
"Digitalisation will enable citizens to access a substantial quantity of new, innovative content and this is why I can only fully support Mr Veltroni's consideration that all this has implications for democracy, the organisation of Europe and the States and the quality of the communications that we provide for our citizens."
"This is why I consider that the period of transition from the analogue to the digital system must be our opportunity to entice the user to sample a series of new programmes on offer, not just a mere duplication of the programmes currently available on unencrypted line-aside channels."
"Mr O'Toole is right in saying that simulcasts would not make it possible to attract a group of substantial users and he therefore believes that a trial period for new audiovisual products on channels made available through digital transmission, possibly only over sections of territory, will enable operators and users to achieve the same objective."
"The Commission is right to say that the system of funding adopted by the Member States must comply with the principle of proportionality and must not influence market conditions and competition in the Community in a way contrary to the interests of society."
"In the audiovisual policy, the two fundamental criteria to be applied when drawing up provisions for funding are proportionality and transparency."
"Transparency implies that the Member States should define a clear public service mission, that financial transparency should be guaranteed and that, if public service operators carry on purely commercial activities, separate accounts should be kept."
"I consider that this separation has prompted the Commission to produce the best policy currently possible for the States and Europe, a policy worthy of the changing technologies and which will lead to the switchover of the entire system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is pleased with the report drawn up by Mr Veltroni and the draftsman of the committee' s opinion, and I would like to thank the chair of the competent committee and its members for the pleasing unanimity they have managed to create within their committee on this draft report."
"As you know, the Council also supported the Commission's approach in the conclusions approved at its meeting of 16 May this year, which makes for pleasing unanimity."
"For once, the three institutions seem to be on the same wavelength and in perfect agreement, which makes me very happy."
"In particular, the Commission welcomes Parliament's support on the regulatory principle described in the communication."
"As you are aware, the Commission is to carry out a series of studies on the audiovisual sector and an extensive consultation with all the interested parties before proposing any revisions of the ""Television without Frontiers"" Directive, if the analyses suggest a need for this."
"At this stage, before the research and consultations have been carried out, it would be extremely imprudent to speculate on any changes that might be decided by the experts and politicians."
"The Commission takes note of Parliament's comments on this directive and will take due account of them in carrying out the examination planned for the end of 2002."
"Just one detail, Mr Veltroni; in the Commission' s communication, it did not state that legislation on advertising needed to be revised in order to take account of the new digital technology."
"It only said that it would carry out a study of this technology in order to verify whether or not a revision was necessary."
"They will all decide together, however, whether or not a revision is necessary."
"The Commission also agrees with Parliament that the principle of a clear demarcation between editorial content and advertising should be maintained in all forms of media."
"With regard to the comments on the draft report concerning the pluralism of the media, it should be noted here that digital technology and in particular the Internet presents unprecedented possibilities for creating and developing a pluralist society."
"For example, digital technology allows for a colossal increase in the number of channels, thereby reducing barriers to access for content producers."
"This - and another speaker has said this - would mean ensuring that access does not end at borders, be they hypothetical or real."
"The Internet also, at least potentially, allows each citizen to become a content producer themselves and creates the opportunity for a world-wide forum in which anyone can take part, with the advantages and dangers that that implies."
"I think that one day we will have to discuss in depth what this advantage may also imply."
"All of this changes the issue of pluralism, however, and makes it more complex."
"The obstacles to pluralism in the digital world include poverty and a lack of education and training."
"This issue was also raised by some Members and is something that prevents the general public from fully participating in the digital age."
"The issue of the digital divide has been raised."
"It is clear that we should all make a great effort to ensure that the gap between the information rich and the information poor, between those who participate and those who do not, is not too great."
"I also agree with Mrs Junker when she says that we need to think, but also to propose plans of action to learn to read the media."
"This is something that is very dear to me, and also to Jacques Lang with whom I have already discussed the possibility of developing this approach."
"We will succeed, Mrs Junker, because we think that it is very important, not only to know how to read, write and add up, but also to know how to read images."
"That is something we do not teach our little darlings."
"With regard to the operators of digital media, the application of competition law currently seems to constitute an effective means of ensuring pluralism."
"Nonetheless, other measures could, obviously, also be adopted, in the light of experience of the digital age and in response to Parliament's questions, the Commission will carry out consultations on these issues during its examination of the ""Television without Frontiers"" Directive."
"I would also like to warmly welcome the quasi-unanimity on the MEDIA programme."
"The digital revolution will open up many new ways of exploiting audiovisual works: video on demand via the Internet, for example."
"The European industry must be able to make the most of these opportunities."
"Nonetheless, we know that the European industry is still fragmented and weak in comparison with its American competitor."
"Progress has already been made, however, in the past ten years."
"For example, in almost all the Member States now, the most successful television programmes are national productions and not American productions."
"A change has therefore already taken place."
"At the same time, with regard to cinema, we can see a significant increase in the number of European successes."
"So we must not stop, ladies and gentlemen, and I know that I have your support in this, but I need money to be able to carry out the new MEDIA plus programme."
"This is the great danger that will affect the final decision on this project."
"I hope that in the interests of European cinema in all our Member States, we will obtain good results in this area at the forthcoming 'Culture' Councils."
"I would also like to draw the attention of those who are not here now but who have expressed criticism, saying that MEDIA and MEDIA plus only work at European level in addition to national systems that invest in production."
"The MEDIA plus programme invests in promotion, distribution and digital training."
"It is not, therefore, redundant, it is not something superfluous, but something that is absolutely necessary if we want our European films to circulate beyond the borders of their country of production."
"With regard to certain proposals contained in Parliament's report on the cinema, the Commission has announced in its communication that it intends to draw up a communication dedicated specifically to the cinematographic sector, which will deal with questions such as the definition of European works, and although Mrs Fraisse is no longer here now, I would nonetheless like to say to her that this will not be easy and that if she wants to give us a hand, it would be very welcome."
"The Commission communication will also consider State aid to cinematographic production, an issue that concerns us all."
"Furthermore, this communication could also assess the need for intervention in this field at Community level and the opportunity to develop financial engineering mechanisms in favour of cinematographic productions."
"One of today' s speakers has already referred to this."
"You are well aware - I have said this to you several times - that discussions are underway with the European Investment Bank to create a capital risk fund in the autumn, if appropriate, with the intention of remedying the under-financing of our industry."
"At this stage, the Commission takes note of Parliament's comments, but is not yet able to provide any further details."
"But it must be clearly understood that we fully recognise the importance of public financing for audiovisual production and the need to provide for specific treatment in this area."
"I would like to emphasise this last statement, as it is of primary importance for our whole political future."
"Now, you all know that public service broadcasting is a very sensitive and highly complex issue, and the Commission has clearly explained its position many times, in particular in this communication."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I agree that public service broadcasting plays a fundamental cultural and social role in our Member States and must therefore be safeguarded and authorised to play its role."
"In light of technological developments and changes in the market, this role could change, but this subject must be debated in the Member States since, as the Amsterdam Protocol clearly specifies, it is up to the Member States to define the public service broadcasting mandate and decide on its financing system."
"The Commission does not intervene in this area and the text on transparency is clear on this point."
"By virtue of the Treaty, nonetheless, the Commission has a duty to ensure that the financing system does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to the detriment of the common good."
"For the Commission to be able to do its job and in order to assess whether the advantages granted to the businesses in question correspond to the public service goals which are their responsibility, these goals must be defined by the Member State and their financing must be transparent."
"Any commercial activity practised by these businesses must not, directly or indirectly, benefit from funds intended for public service."
"Transparency requires this, and I believe that the recent texts issued by the Commission contribute to making these principles understandable, clear and transparent to all."
"On this topic, the informal 'Culture and audiovisual' Council, which was held in Lille on 20 and 21 July this year, debated the future of public service broadcasting."
"Certain ministers considered that a new additional stage of the Amsterdam Protocol was necessary, given the rapid technological development in this sector, and I have stated my readiness to discuss this issue with you and with those Ministers in the near future."
"It should also be noted that the Commission recently adopted a revised version of the directive on transparency, as I have already mentioned."
"This directive, most importantly, does not apply to public service broadcasting companies that do not practise any commercial activity."
"Therefore, the public services defined by the State, with public financing clearly contained in the definition of public service, are not affected by the directive on transparency."
"The concept of universal service is mentioned in the report."
"In this respect, it should be noted that universal service is a concept borrowed from the telecommunications service, which in my opinion cannot be automatically transposed to the audiovisual sector."
"Guaranteed access for citizens to certain broadcasting services and certain types of content is a question of defining the public service broadcasting mandate and, in accordance with the Amsterdam Protocol, is therefore the responsibility of the Member States."
"The call for a European forum for discussing matters concerning all types of audiovisual content is an interesting proposal which the Commission will consider and study with the interested parties in its examination of the ""Television without Frontiers"" Directive."
"It should be noted that, within the framework of the current directive, a contact committee has been created to examine all aspects of audiovisual policy linked to the directive."
"With regard to international commercial negotiations in the audiovisual sector, I can tell you that there have been no developments."
"The Commission has clarified its position many times."
"It should retain its freedom, acquired during the Uruguay round, to draw up and implement financial and regulatory provisions in the audiovisual sector with a view in particular to safeguarding cultural diversity."
"In its conclusions of 26 October 1999, the Council gave the Commission to undertake the forthcoming negotiations on services and I can frankly assure you that my colleague, Commissioner Lamy, is in full agreement with this direction."
"We can be sure that he will safeguard and assist the European audiovisual sector in the way we want, the way you want, and if each person carries out the task assigned to him or her, we will all succeed in future in safeguarding and strengthening our audiovisual service, which is crucial to creating jobs and maintaining cultural pluralism."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Socio-economic background of Erasmus students"
"The next item is the report (A5-0199/2000) by Mr Heaton-Harris, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the report from the Commission: ""Survey into the socio-economic background of Erasmus students"" [COM(2000) 4 - C5-0146/2000 - 2000/2089(COS)]."
"Mr President, it is not often that a politician of my calibre gets to speak to such a packed and huge audience."
"I should like to thank all the interpreters for staying behind."
"I understand that my speech leaked out to the rest of the Members of Parliament beforehand, hence their disappearance in mass numbers."
"Many of the interpreters, I am sure, would have liked to have studied on a Erasmus course when they were learning their languages and studying at university."
"I, as a British Conservative, often find fault - and it is very easy to find fault - with many of the programmes organised and paid for by the European Commission and the European Union."
"However I have a soft spot for Erasmus because it is very difficult to find fault with that particular programme."
"It seems to achieve some of the results that it actually expects."
"This survey is a fascinating one, carried out in 1998."
"It was fascinating that so many students actually bothered to take part in filling out a form and sending it back to the Commission."
"The one problem, I suppose, with the results of the survey was that they were reported after we had decided on the Socrates II programme and the Erasmus parts of it."
"We could have drawn some very useful information from this survey on the socio-economic circumstances of students on Erasmus courses at that time."
"There are a number of interesting facts and figures."
"I could bore you with them but they are all contained within the explanatory statement of the report and in the Commission report itself."
"But there are a few that I have a great deal of interest in."
"Certainly of the people who took an Erasmus course in 1998 and bothered to reply to the questionnaire 98% found that the programme was extremely positive or at least very positive."
"Ninety-one percent were over the moon with what had happened to them on the course."
"It is a shame that 57% of them experienced financial hardship as a result of their particular Erasmus course."
"One wonders whether, when only half the money is being spent on the Erasmus places being taken up, (half are left open at the end of each year) the money could not be better redistributed within Erasmus itself."
"When I initially tabled my report I put forward a few controversial ideas just to see if anybody bothered to read what was going on."
"Fortunately two or three Members (and the Commission as well) did read them."
"A number noticed little points that I had to then retract."
"But one which is still there in point 4 of my report, which I would like to underline, is the part that condemns any internal discrimination practised in Member States."
"If you had trouble getting on a higher education course in Austria for example, because you were of a certain race, this place would have been in a complete uproar."
"But that is exactly what is going on in my own country at the moment, with English students who want to study in Scotland being penalised financially by the Scottish Executive."
"So I really wanted to keep that in my report."
"I sneaked it in there and it stayed pretty much hidden until now, and I would like to reveal it to the very few people who are in the Chamber tonight."
"I look forward to my new Labour colleagues voting on this particular matter."
"I believe it is slightly too late to ask for a split vote."
"I have also tabled a couple of amendments."
"One helps with a bit of punctuation, a bit of grammar on the particular passage in point 4, the second in point 6."
"In the committee stage of this report part of a sentence was added which said: ""considers that the survey's findings should be taken as an opportunity to review national higher educational policies""."
"I do not think it is in the remit of this report or this place or the Commission to ask for that."
"So I have tabled an amendment which would delete that."
"A third amendment which I have tabled has changed just one word in the English language version from ""regrets"" to ""notes""."
"I really enjoyed working with the Commission and all the people that have helped me."
"I would like to end by thanking those who helped me with this report, especially my researcher Nicky Smith, who waded through every single statistic."
"We contacted every university and vice-chancellor in the UK and many across Europe to ask for their comments on this report."
"I commend it to the House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I know it is very late and not a lot of people are here."
"That should be no surprise to you, however."
"It happens not only, thank heavens, where cultural and educational matters are concerned but also in many other areas."
"I think, though, that, as you yourself have already said, quality speaks for itself."
"You have briefly commented upon your report and your amendments yourself."
"I am an Austrian and know from experience that, in Austria, there is very good access to all universities and courses of study."
"I should also like to make it clear that we have no problem giving ethnic minorities access to these, either."
"We certainly do not lag behind England, or Great Britain, in that area."
"On the subject of the Erasmus programme, which is, after all, a part of the Socrates programme, I should like to say that - given the need not only to set up the programme but also to evaluate it - it is quite important to examine the efficiency of what is being offered and to carry out an assessment of the resources, if new knowledge is to be obtained and, above all, the defects in the programme removed."
"It has already been said that new knowledge of this kind will unfortunately not have any impact upon the Socrates II programme."
"I think we could have done to update things in this area, since 40% of the Socrates budget is, after all, being allocated to the Erasmus programme and, in that way, to students at European universities."
"It was, and remains, the goal to make it possible for 10% of students to spend a part of their degree courses in other Member States."
"Unfortunately, a figure of only 1% was achieved in the first year."
"The participation rate has risen and is now just under 50% of the figure aimed at."
"The report has shown that the reasons for this are both structural and cultural, as well as economic to quite a significant degree."
"So far, there has been no success in complying with what is also laid down in the Socrates programme and giving a special boost to groups that are weak in socio-economic terms."
"On the contrary, the programme is instead used by students whose parents have both a high level of education and a corresponding level of income."
"Fifty-seven percent of Erasmus students had considerable difficulties financing their stay abroad."
"I think there needs to be coordination between the Erasmus scholarships and the countries and the universities concerned. In that way, reform can be implemented and an information campaign launched in order to question, and shed some light upon, why so few people are able to participate in this programme."
"Above all, it is a question of preserving equality of opportunity in all countries."
"That is why it is worth showing some commitment."
"I think that making equal opportunities available to young people is quite important for us all."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on this, his first report, which succeeded straightaway in achieving unanimity."
"I feel this is a very promising beginning, although undoubtedly the subject lends itself to unanimity; indeed, I do not think that, amongst the impressive number of European programmes available to our citizens, there is a report that is as well-known and as much appreciated by the public, and not just by the students; recently, a grandmother stopped me in the street to thank me for what I was doing for her grandchildren, who were travelling abroad thanks to an Erasmus grant."
"So, you see, these programmes also achieve the unanimity of the whole population and naturally, they can always be improved."
"This year, 110 000 students are receiving the special attention that we give to all aspects of their Erasmus trip and to the smooth running of this section of the Socrates programme, and we thank Parliament for supporting this measure."
"Admittedly, there are problems."
"It is often said that only the children of fairly comfortably off families can travel as the others cannot live on this modest grant."
"If we consult our statistics, however, 4 out of 5 Erasmus students were the first members of their family to study abroad, which does illustrate the role that this programme plays in the opportunities for mobility available in Europe to students of new social backgrounds."
"Therefore, it is untrue that only children from privileged backgrounds can benefit from Erasmus grants."
"Furthermore, even if the latter have more to live on because they receive additional help from their parents on top of their grant, in other respects it seems that these financial difficulties are the only criticism made."
"Ladies and gentlemen, like you, I would have liked the amount of the loans allocated in the negotiations with the Council over the budgetary appropriations for the Socrates programme to be set at a higher level than they were since I am limited in my ability to increase Erasmus grants as much as I would like."
"What conclusions can we draw from this?"
"Well, quite simply, the national bodies with decentralised responsibility for student mobility have to take the national situation into consideration and adapt the grant policy accordingly."
"I have asked the Ministers for Education, each in their own country, to take the necessary steps to grant supplements and advantages for Erasmus students in order to offer those who are not fortunate enough to have a benevolent father or generous grandmother the chance to travel too."
"I also urge each one of you to contact the Minister for Education in your country so that he will do all he can to remedy this financial problem."
"I have asked the ministers to make sure that a larger grant is given to the poorest students."
"I have asked the regional authorities to make an effort to assist their students and I have asked university rectors to provide for financial resources within their universities to enable students on lower incomes to still benefit from grants, if they want to and if they are eligible."
"I think that in future, I will once again have to request the help of all the national and regional authorities in this area."
"Furthermore, I shall consider this question in a moment as the French presidency wishes to develop a real action plan to foster mobility and together with the minister, Mr Jacques Lang, I have just set a specific meeting of the Ministers for Education on the theme of mobility."
"On this occasion, we will not only talk about what we would like to do and what we should do in future, but we will cite examples taken from certain countries as models, but not necessarily at national level."
"I will give you an example at random."
"In one region of Germany, a regional Minister for Education has created a 'mobility' savings scheme in conjunction with banks and building societies so that parents, friends and families, instead of buying vast numbers of toys for children, invest in this scheme which will be available to the child when he is old enough to study abroad."
"As you can see, there are good ideas, all sorts of good ideas."
"I hope that the discussion on 'mobility' that the French presidency wanted will get this situation moving and that goodwill will be sought both at a private level and at regional, European and national levels so that the great success of Erasmus will encompass a growing number of students."
"This is the price to pay for creating Europe, since students who have got to know another country within the framework of Erasmus, who have made friends in another country, at another university, are the true Europeans who will make European policy tomorrow."
"A greater number of happy Erasmus students is in the interests of our society as a whole."
"So let us all work together so that there will be a large number of them in future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Fisheries agreements"
"The next item is the joint discussion of the following reports:"
"by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (A5-0194/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation relating to the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing possibilities and the financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea on fishing off the Guinean coast for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001. [COM(2000) 304 - C5-0315/2000 - 2000/0154(CNS)]"
"by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (A5-0188/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation relating to the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period 3 December 1999 to 2 December 2002, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Mauritius on fishing in the waters of Mauritius [COM(2000) 229 - C5-0253/2000 - 2000/0094(CNS)]"
"Mr President, today we are discussing two new international fishing protocols between the European Union and third countries: Guinea and Mauritius, the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean."
"However, at the end of the day, they are two important agreements which will add to the already significant network of international fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries, the basic pillar of the common fisheries policy, since it is essential to cover our supply requirements, both for the European consumer and for our industry, and it is also essential to do so by means of our own fleet."
"The fisheries agreements with third countries therefore fulfil a crucial objective of the common fisheries policy, and they also contribute to employment and, in most cases, in European regions which are very dependent on this activity."
"They therefore create commercial balance, employment and preserve the competitiveness of Europe' s own significant fishing fleet."
"In its opinion on the 2001 budget, our committee has this afternoon approved the draft which our Vice-Chairman, Mrs Miguélez, had presented us, to increase budget line B7-8000 (International fisheries agreements) by EUR 7 million, thereby re-establishing the amounts in the preliminary draft budget presented at the time by the European Commission."
"Morocco, Mauritania and Greenland are great negotiating challenges for the European Commission and we all hope that these negotiations will soon conclude successfully."
"For the moment, we are happy today with the agreements with Guinea and Mauritius, which will cover important needs of different fleets, of different States of the European Union, in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans."
"Notable in both cases is the constant and worrying increase in the payments by shipowners while, curiously, these are not included in other agreements, as is notoriously the case with the agreement with Greenland."
"For example, in the case of Mauritius, there is an increase in the amount that shipowners are to pay for licences, of EUR 5 per tonne of fish, that is to say, they are increased from EUR 20 to EUR 25, and there is also an equivalent increase in the case of catches by ship."
"The European Union' s contribution is reduced by 29%, payable by shipowners which, in the case of complete exploitation of the fishing allowances, would mean a contribution of 23.5% of the total cost."
"In the previous protocol it was 7%, that is to say, there would be an increase from 7% to 23.5% of the total cost payable by shipowners."
"In this context we also wish to highlight the imbalances in the internal distribution of these fishing allowances by the European Commission amongst the Member States, as was the case with cephalopods in the agreement with Guinea."
"Both agreements give significant support to the local authorities for the conservation of their own fishing resources and furthermore advocate agreements between states as opposed to private agreements - which is very important in agreements such as the one with Morocco, which we are trying to negotiate - as well as the contribution of the European Union to the establishment of modern control systems, which forms part of the conservationist position of the European Union in all of the world' s seas, in accordance with its internal approach to its own Community waters."
"On the other hand, there is an important direct relationship between the financial compensation and the objectives and cooperation actions that have been agreed."
"In the case of the agreement with Mauritius, we are talking about 50%, as opposed to 30% in the previous agreement."
"As is so often the case, there is a lack of documentation for comparing figures and data between the protocols, although in this case we should thank the European Commission for including the minutes of the negotiations, in the case of Guinea, which makes more data available and ultimately makes the process more transparent. This is welcome and the European Parliament is grateful for it."
"The Committee on Fisheries has voted in favour of these agreements, and this has become the norm, since it considers that they are both highly beneficial to both parties, that is to say, the European Union and the third countries."
"The Liberal Group has now presented Parliament with an amendment of similar content to each of the reports which would mean - in the view of the rapporteur - that the common fisheries policy would cease to be common and would mean a departure from an important pillar of external policy. It would mean that only the direct beneficiaries of the agreement negotiated by the European Commission would pay for it, on behalf of the fifteen Member States of the European Union."
"The rapporteur is against this amendment, since, if only those who benefit directly from Community policies are to pay for them, that would quite simply be a way of breaking up the single market and dismantling the European Union itself."
"We are therefore in favour of both fisheries agreements, which we hope may continue in the future, and we are anxious, Commissioner, to be able soon to hold a debate in our Fisheries Committee, and to repeat what we are saying now, in relation to the extremely important fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"Keep up the hard work - I can see from the conversation we had this afternoon that you are working hard - and I encourage you also to move forward with that important negotiation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in principle I approve the new protocols to the fisheries agreements with Mauritius and Guinea."
"The Commission and the rapporteur have done some good work."
"However, the effects of fisheries agreements upon the EU budget are not something to be sneezed at."
"If we are to draw the correct conclusions, no more time must now be lost in involving Parliament, because trouble is brewing."
"Allow me to explain what I mean."
"We are concerned here with mixed agreements."
"It is not just a question of how many fish are to be obtained for how much money, but also about employing the precautionary principle to achieve the sustainable use of fisheries resources."
"We want to help Mauritius and Guinea develop fisheries management, as well as offer financial support in the fields of education and research."
"In Mauritius, for example, just under 50% of the total volume of available finance is to be used for these measures."
"I myself consider it a good thing for us also to be promoting development measures in connection with fisheries."
"Fisheries is the ideal field for such a combination."
"Yet, in the Committee on Fisheries, we are repeatedly confronted by the issue of whether the price paid by the European Union to third countries for its fishing rights is not too high."
"There is a danger of the European Union' s one day being ridiculed and taken advantage of internationally because of its generosity."
"Moreover, to what extent are third countries now really all dependent upon EU funds?"
"Bilateral agreements are increasingly coming into force because ship owners or others offer more money than the EU."
"If the latter were to become a day-to-day occurrence regulated by the market itself, might not consideration have to be given to the question of whether the EU ought not progressively to withdraw from the current agreements and perhaps spend its subsidies in other ways?"
"Obviously, that would have to be compatible with the common European fisheries policy."
"I welcome the agreements that are before the House."
"Only, we ought not to be blind and, above all, not issue any blank cheques."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the proposal for a Council Regulation on the European Community fisheries agreements with Mauritius and the Republic of Guinea."
"Both agreements fall within a general European Community policy based on our presence in the rest of the world."
"The fishing sector forms part of the Community' s economy and, in order for the Community fleet to be able to fish and carry out its activity, the Community must reach agreements with third countries and international organisations, so that our fishermen can enjoy adequate fishing allowances."
"Both agreements have been renewed regularly."
"In the case of Guinea we have had an agreement since 1983 and in the case of Mauritius since 1989."
"There can be no doubt about the cost-effectiveness of these agreements for the European Union, as demonstrated in the study commissioned by the Commission on their cost-benefit relationships."
"Nor can we doubt the beneficial effects for the other contracting parties, in this case Mauritius and the Republic of Guinea."
"Both countries gain valuable resources for their development in exchange for the fishing allowances which they grant to our fleet."
"These are agreements which benefit both parties and which have been amended over time, being adapted to the demands of the sustainable exploitation of resources and of actions supporting the efforts of the authorities in the third countries to develop their own fishing sector."
"The protocols that periodically renew the agreements have been adapted to the true situation, to the quantities of fish actually caught and the state of resources in those fishing grounds."
"Despite reducing the quantity of catches in the agreement with Guinea, the economic compensation to be received by the African country will be maintained, since the new protocol increases the amount of the tariffs and the licences which must be paid by Community shipowners."
"Therefore, the contrast with other agreements - I would like to highlight, for example, the agreement with Greenland, in which the shipowners do not contribute to its cost - is the all the more drastic."
"In the case of Mauritius, it also reduces the volume of authorised catches and specifies the number of vessels authorised to fish."
"The approval by the European Parliament of these two fisheries agreements sends a political message demonstrating our support for the signing and renewal of other fisheries agreements which are of much greater importance for our sector because of the number of ships and fishermen which depend on them."
"I am referring in particular to the agreement with Morocco."
"Seven hundred ships out of action is excessive, and 8 000 fishermen not working for 10 months are far too many, given that the contacts so far between the Commission and the Moroccan Government have offered little hope of success."
"Everybody must do their duty and fulfil their obligations."
"This institution has done so, with its Committee on Fisheries approving today, in a special meeting, the amounts proposed by the European Commission in the B7-800 line on fisheries agreements with third countries."
"It now falls to the European Commission to negotiate hard in order to reach a reasonable agreement with Morocco."
"We are still waiting for that to happen."
"Mr President, may I first of all thank the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela, for a particularly good piece of work on these reports."
"In principle, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party support the EU' s having fisheries agreements with third countries, but I should also like to point out that what we in the Liberal Group want - and this is why we have tabled a number of amendments - is for the fishermen or ship owners to make more of a contribution to financing the fisheries agreements."
"It is, of course, only right that they should be involved in financing those agreements from which they themselves benefit more than anyone else."
"The fisheries agreements are extremely important for certain regions in which, in addition to employment in the fisheries sector itself, there are a range of associated businesses wholly or partially dependent upon the fishing industry."
"By means of the fisheries agreements, the EU is able to develop its activities in this sphere and exchange fishing rights with third countries."
"The effect of the EU fleets upon fishing resources - in terms of structural policy and the financial situation - ought to be analysed much more than it is at present."
"I want to conclude by asking the Commission to provide the Committee on Fisheries with a report on what for third countries are the positive and negative consequences of the EU' s fisheries agreements."
"Mr President, last October I spoke here against the EU-Angola fisheries agreement."
"My reason for doing so was simple."
"All the evidence shows that agreements between the EU and third world countries have been conservation disasters."
"They also seriously damage the indigenous populations."
"This time we have proposals for agreements with Guinea and Mauritius, which will have similar effects."
"In a way, that much is recognised in the current proposals."
"More stringent checks are being called for."
"Inspection vessels are to be provided, and greater note taken of the needs of local fishermen."
"But that is not enough."
"There is no guarantee that these agreements will be properly policed."
"Policing of fishing effort in European waters is woefully inadequate, and it is therefore hard to believe that things will be any different in foreign climes."
