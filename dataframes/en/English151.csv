"Text"
"These are only a few examples of the wonderful 'progress' promised by the European Commission's Green Paper on public procurement."
"Not content with endorsing such nonsense, this text makes the fight against any protectionist measure the central piece of its argument. So many policies that I object to."
"I shall vote against."
"A properly functioning procurement market is of essential importance in order to foster the Single Market, to stimulate innovation, to boost employment, growth and competitiveness, to promote higher levels of environmental and climate protection and protect social rights throughout the EU, and to achieve optimal value for public authorities, citizens and taxpayers."
"With the objective of overcoming the financial and economic crisis, and of protecting against any future crisis, public procurement is of crucial relevance, serving as a catalyst for the revitalisation of the EU economy and, accordingly, for employment and welfare in the EU."
"Therefore, a sound and properly thought-out process of optimising the legal framework for public procurement is of vital importance for the welfare of EU citizens, EU consumers and businesses, and for national, regional and local authorities."
"A properly functioning procurement market is of crucial importance to promoting the Single Market, to stimulating innovation, to promoting a high level of environmental and climate protection, and of social inclusion across the EU, and to achieving the highest possible value for public authorities, citizens and taxpayers."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution on equal access to public sector markets in the EU and in third countries, and on the revision of the public procurement legal framework, including concessions."
"In this sense, I join the proponents of this resolution in calling on the Commission to prioritise the modernisation of the procurement rules and to address service concessions in order to avoid the further fragmentation of EU law on public procurement, in line with the principles of 'better law making'."
"Public procurement plays a vital role in stimulating the Single Market, promoting innovation, strengthening growth and supporting EU employment and competitiveness."
"However, to achieve this, these must operate effectively."
"For that to happen, as pointed out by the text of this resolution, which I endorse, it is important that the question of simplification and clarification of the rules for awarding public contracts finds answers quickly."
"It also seems essential to me that access to public contracts by SMEs - who account for 99% of all European businesses and over 100 million jobs - be improved as soon as possible."
"Moreover, in order to support their business, I invite the European Commission to implement the principle of reciprocity and to think of new ways of improving access by European companies to public procurement outside the Union, in order to ensure equal conditions for European and foreign companies who are competing for the allocation of public contracts."
"in writing. - We finally abstained due to the fact that several EPP and ECR amendments, inadmissible to us, were adopted."
"With a view to overcoming the economic and financial crisis, public procurement appears to be a catalyst for the revitalisation of the European economy, and of enterprise, employment and consumer welfare in Europe."
"Due to a gradual liberalisation of special sectors (water, electricity and gas), in order to protect the enterprises that operate in these areas, we need a qualification system for clients, aimed at ensuring that the competing enterprises are selected efficiently."
"I am in favour of the motion for a resolution, since it is necessary, in a transparent regime, to keep the fragmentation of EU public procurement law in order to achieve the highest possible levels of competitiveness and efficiency, as set out in our targets."
"in writing. - Public procurement provides a unique opportunity to channel investment into projects for the common benefit of citizens whilst, at the same time, achieving wider public policy objectives."
"I would like to underline the importance of public procurement contracts in promoting environmental standards in buildings and transport, and the potential that this has to improve energy efficiency and therefore reduce carbon emissions, operating costs and air pollution."
"I urge the Member States to use public procurement contracts to pursue these objectives, which will have wide-reaching and long-term social, economic and environmental benefits."
"A properly functioning procurement market is of essential importance in order to foster the Single Market, and to stimulate innovation and investment."
"With a view to overcoming the economic and financial crisis, public procurement is of crucial importance in boosting the EU economy and it contributes to job creation."
"The European Union rejects the possibility of implementing protectionist measures, and seeks equal access to public sector markets in the EU and in third countries."
"As such, the EU firmly believes in the principle of reciprocity, mutual benefit and proportionality in this area."
"To that end, I advocate better coherence between common trade policy and practices in Member States accepting exceptionally low bids from companies whose countries are not signatories to the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), to the disadvantage of companies from EU Member States."
"I therefore reiterate this House's call to prioritise the modernisation of public procurement rules in such a way as to avoid its fragmentation and to encourage companies to choose this option."
"This vote is important because the Commission has to take the necessary measures to prevent unfair competition and non-reciprocity of access to public contracts in relation to third countries."
"This is not about erecting protectionist barriers, but the Union can no longer be the only one to play by the rules."
"Indeed, we can no longer ignore the social and economic dumping practised by companies in emerging countries who are winning contracts in countries of the Union, in defiance of social rights and legislation on State subsidies, while, in the meantime, the markets of these countries are closed to European companies."
"However we must also not forget that the large industrialised countries, despite signing international agreements, do not play by the rules either!"
"After years of inaction, the Commission seems intent on acting, and that is necessary: the survival of our companies and jobs depends on it."
"Finally, I welcome the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with regard to compliance, in the context of public procurement, with working, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States."
"It is now for the Commission to size up this call."
"I am voting for this joint motion for a resolution."
"I would highlight the measures I consider necessary: making use of all the possibilities and financial margins available under the EU fisheries budget in order to finance emergency support measures for this sector, thereby enabling it to overcome the difficulties posed by the rise in oil prices; continued European Fisheries Fund (EFF) aid to improve the selectivity of fishing gear and to replace engines on safety grounds, to protect the environment and/or fuel economy, above all, for small-scale coastal and traditional fishing; the drawing up by the Commission of a medium- and long-term plan aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the fisheries (including aquaculture) sector; and calling for the Commission to propose an action plan for coastal regions and islands which have an active fisheries sector to improve fuel efficiency in the fisheries and aquaculture sector."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The recent rise in oil prices has affected the economic viability of the fisheries sector and European fishermen find themselves in a difficult situation."
"Furthermore, owing to the European Union's high degree of dependency on imports from third countries (60%), producers have very little or even no influence on the price levels of fisheries products."
"I agree that the ceiling on de minimis aid should be raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for a transitional period of three years, while ensuring that environmental and social sustainability are not undermined and that competition between Member States is not distorted."
"I should like to express my deep sympathy with European fishers, whose salaries have been directly affected by an increase in oil prices, which has seriously exacerbated the economic fragility linked to the irregular nature of activity in this sector."
"I consider it essential to introduce mechanisms that promote the boosting of prices paid at the production stage, whilst keeping prices paid at the final consumption stage as low as possible."
"I am therefore voting for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which duly emphasises the above points."
"in writing. - While it is not a good idea to subsidise the fossil-fuel industry, fishermen across the EU are suffering due to the economic downturn and, unlike other modes of transport, they do not have any real alternative to fossil fuels."
"Energy accounts for a significant proportion of the fisheries sector's operating costs and the recent fuel price increase has caused the situation of the fisheries sector to deteriorate, with a direct impact on production costs in this sector."
"In view of these facts, I believe that the European Commission must consider the means required to devise urgently and adopt suitable measures for easing the difficult economic situation which many European fishermen are in, also taking into account the financial difficulties currently facing a number of countries which have large fishing fleets."
"The Commission must adopt urgent measures to remedy the difficult economic situation in which many European fishermen find themselves following the rise in oil prices."
"In particular, it is about raising the de minimis public subsidy threshold from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per three-year period and per beneficiary firm."
"Beyond this compensation, we must put in place a longer term strategy to enable fishermen, but also professionals in other sectors, such as farmers and road hauliers, to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels."
"That is why the Commission must provide incentives, both at European and national level, for investment in new technologies, in order to increase energy efficiency in maritime, land and air transport."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices, as it has affected the economic viability of the fisheries sector, with a direct impact on fishers' incomes."
"Temporary emergency measures are needed that will enable European fishers to overcome their difficult economic situation, but the Commission should also draw up a medium- and long-term plan aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the fisheries sector, including aquaculture."
"Fishing is an essential economic activity for the countries of Europe, particularly for maritime countries like mine. As such, Parliament should be particularly mindful of the conditions affecting professional fishers."
"The increasing price of fuel - an unavoidable cost for those involved in fishing - has enormously affected fishers' incomes."
"At a time of savage economic and financial crisis, in which there is little aid available to sustain companies and jobs, I welcome the proposal made in this resolution by my colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to support EU fishers by increasing the ceiling for de minimis aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per company for a three-year period."
"This will enable the fishing industry to face increased operating costs linked to the price of oil."
"This joint motion for a resolution of the European Parliament addresses the European fisheries sector crisis due to continually increasing fuel prices, which is having a very significant impact on the sector's operating costs."
"This increase is being felt, above all, by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - often family companies - whose workers are starting to see that their jobs are in danger."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the Member States will soon be able to increase aid for fishers, and that the European Union, through the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), will increase its subsidies aimed at improving and modernising vessels and equipment, and will create a fund to which SMEs can turn if they are in trouble."
"Support for small-scale fishing is particularly important."
"It is positive that Parliament has adopted this resolution."
"The significant rise in oil prices has seriously exacerbated the crisis facing the fisheries sector and its economic viability, and has very significantly reduced the already scarce incomes of those working in the sector."
"The current sales dynamic does not allow fluctuations in production costs, including oil, to impact on fish prices; the current import policy contributes to this, amongst other factors."
"In many cases, average first-sale prices have been stagnating or dropping for a number of years, and this has not resulted in a decrease in price for fresh fish for end consumers."
"The current common market organisation (CMO) for fisheries products has not managed to contribute sufficiently to improving first-sale prices or to better distribution of added value across the sector's value chain."
"The economic situation of a large number of companies has deteriorated in recent years, even leading to many of them going out of business."
"There is a real risk that thousands of fishing companies could go out of business and thousands of jobs could be lost because of increased oil prices."
"Small-scale coastal fishing sectors are particularly vulnerable."
"These measures need to be applied."
"The fisheries sector is one of the sectors most affected by oil price increases, because fuel is a significant part of the operating cost of the fisherman, estimated at 30-50%."
"I fully support any measures that could be put in place to assist fishermen in this regard, particularly those engaged in small-scale fishing on coasts and islands."
"The adoption of a Parliament resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices is an opportunity for me to remind you how urgent it is for us to come to the aid of fishermen."
"In a context where recruitment is becoming more and more difficult, and where the practices that fishermen must adopt continue to become ever more restrictive, the increase in fuel prices makes conditions even more difficult in this crisis-hit sector."
"The substantial increase in oil prices is having a strong impact on fishermen's operational costs, and this caused their revenue to fall between 2008 and 2010."
"As the elected representative of a port town, it is all the more incumbent on me to call on the Commission to authorise an increase in the ceiling of the de minimis aid."
"This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work without hindering the replenishment of stocks."
"The upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy will have to gain the support of fishermen."
"To show them today that the European Union is alert to their needs would be a good start."
"I voted in favour of this document because the recent rise in oil prices has affected the economic viability of the fisheries sector and left many fishermen worrying about how to offset these additional costs, as the rise in oil prices is directly affecting fishermen's incomes."
"We need to make use of all the possibilities and financial margins available under the Community fisheries budget in order to finance emergency support measures for the industry, thereby enabling it to overcome the difficulties posed by the rise in fuel prices until such time as other types of measure are implemented."
"The European Fisheries Fund (EFF) should continue to grant aid to improve the selectivity of fishing gear and to replace engines on grounds of safety, environmental protection and/or fuel economy, above all, for small-scale coastal and traditional fishermen."
"In my opinion, the Commission must urgently propose investments, at both European and national levels, in new technologies in order to increase the energy efficiency of fishing vessels and so reduce fishermen's dependency on fossil fuels."
"The resolution is an expression of Parliament's concern for the state of the fisheries sector, the financial condition of fishing firms and the market price of fish."
"It is an important sector, and fish is an important part of our diet."
"I think Article 3 of the joint motion for a resolution, which expresses the will to increase aid to fishermen, is crucially important."
"It is a solution which offers more advantages than the new guarantees proposed for the sector."
"I hope the Commission and the Council will give the resolution serious consideration."
"in writing. - I voted against this resolution because I do not believe the EU should increase subsidies for the European fisheries sector or any other sector on the basis of a rise in oil prices."
"The recent rise in oil prices has affected the economic viability of the fisheries sector and left many fishers worrying about how to offset these additional costs."
"We cannot forget that the rise in oil prices is directly affecting fishers' incomes."
"The incomes and wages of people working in the fisheries industry are insecure as a result of several factors, such as the irregular nature of fishing, the marketing approaches employed, and the way in which first-sale prices are set, which means that certain forms of national and EU public aid need to be maintained."
"Moreover, the financial and economic crisis is having an impact on industrial sectors and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, and is jeopardising activity and employment in primary and secondary sectors."
"As in the past, we must now adopt temporary emergency measures to overcome the difficulties faced by the fisheries sector against the backdrop of rising oil prices."
"I voted for the resolution and against all the amendments which were tabled."
"New support measures need to be adopted in the fisheries sector, bearing in mind the combination of two factors: on the one hand, the high price of oil and, on the other, the low price of fish at first sale."
"Fishing is an important economic sector for the European Union and needs to receive support at a time when the average price of a barrel of oil will remain at USD 80-100."
"The established global economic crisis, exacerbated by the political crisis in the Maghreb and the Middle East, has led to further oil price increases, with the price per barrel exceeding USD 100."
"Given the political instability that has been rocking the Arab world, this figure could still shoot up."
"Its energy bill represents the fisheries sector's most significant operational cost and, unlike other activities, the sector cannot offset the additional cost by increasing production because of the ceilings established by total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas."
"Despite the diversity of opinions regarding how the sector should be managed, there is a point of agreement which it is important to stress: fishing is extremely important to the European population's food supply and a source of employment for the majority of the EU's coastal communities, where there are no other jobs."
"In order to ensure the continuity of fishing, and avoid falls in supply and increased unemployment in the sector, the EU must raise the ceiling established by the De Minimis Regulation to closer to EUR 60 000, as well as adopting other measures capable of alleviating the recent oil price increase."
"The cost of fishing is very dependent on the price of oil."
"As such, and since the recent rise in oil prices has affected the economic viability of the sector, it is important to adopt emergency measures that will enable European fishers to overcome their difficult economic situation."
"The real problem with fishing today is that 70% of stocks in Europe are overexploited, as a result of the fact that our fleet is clearly oversized."
"It is an irresponsible mistake to spend public money to maintain this fleet."
"In the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy, it is necessary more than ever before to restructure the European fishing fleet in order to discontinue the use of ships that use large quantities of fuel and release large amounts of CO2 emissions, and also of fishing gear and practices that clearly destroy the environment, so that we can make headway towards a model that is less energy dependent, less destructive, and more sustainable in environmental terms as well as in social and economic terms."
"Awarding more money to this sector to compensate for the rise in oil prices will only be an even greater incentive for fishermen to use high fuel consuming ships, particularly at a time when the increase in these prices is not transitory but clearly structural."
"As a result of the deep economic and financial crisis that is affecting the industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, the price of a barrel of oil has increased, and its price is still uncertain because of the risk of political instability in the Arab world."
"This crisis has also profoundly affected European sea fishing, because we import 60% of our fish from third countries."
"I support the resolution because I believe it is important to strengthen the security of our energy supply, informing the markets and giving consumers greater guarantees about the state of oil reserves."
"I also think it necessary to implement a joint action plan in support of coastal regions active in the fisheries sector."
"I was keen to vote in favour of this resolution, which calls on the Commission to take strong measures in support of the fishing industry."
"The rise in the price of oil is causing a real crisis in the sector."
"This crisis started off as a cyclical one but has now become structural and threatens the economic viability of the industry."
"Operating costs have rocketed and are having a serious effect on fishers' incomes, to such an extent that the whole production sector and all coastal regions are now affected."
"Consequently, I welcome the call by our Chamber to introduce greater flexibility in the de minimis subsidy scheme."
"Despite a difficult budgetary context, fishermen would not understand if the Union failed to address their concerns."
"Furthermore, the resolution calls for special attention to be paid to small-scale coastal fishing and to the regions concerned."
"To my mind, this is indispensable since, although the whole sector is being affected, rising energy bills will have a greater impact on traditional fishing than on industrial fishing."
"I believe exceptional situations demand exceptional measures."
"Therefore, I shall remain alert to the proposals that the Commission will put forward to reassure and support our fishermen."
"I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution of the European Parliament since it expresses its dissatisfaction with the Commission due to the fact that, by the end of 2009, only 75% of the total amount of EUR 21 billion worth of financial support had been made fully available for only 50 000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"The excessive administrative bureaucracy that is an obstacle to the majority of SMEs must be removed."
"There is a need, not just for simplification, but also for an improved system for companies to access this financing."
"The Commission is paying great attention to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): the 23 million SMEs that form the EU's economic fabric and are a source of innovation and creativity, allowing Europe to continue to distinguish itself in world markets."
"Little by little, red tape and legislation - which, until recently, nipped in the bud the development of innovative small companies - has been stripped away and young people are starting to see a glimmer of a stable future that is hopefully full of opportunities."
"Entrepreneurship, training, flexibility, smart regulation and access to credit are the key words of the Small Business Act, a framework that defines the EU policy for SMEs through targeted assistance and training activities for young people."
"Now that many initiatives have been defined, it is the responsibility of Member States and the European Union as a whole to implement them properly, providing SMEs with a greater freedom in their actions, allowing them to participate in public tenders, adopting the single European patent in the future and quickly implementing the directive on late payments."
"Lest we forget, investments are necessary to avoid the efforts made so far being thwarted, because only investment can affect the proper functioning of the mechanism and European competitiveness."
"The Small Business Act is based on a number of pillars, such as access to finance and access to the Single Market, international markets and public procurement."
"The progress made within Member States in terms of taking concrete steps to improve the business environment for small and medium-sized businesses is variable and sometimes negligible, in spite of the declared political commitments featuring in this document."
"In the European Union, 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide more than 100 million jobs, make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation."
"SMEs face significant problems in expanding their activities and improving their ability to innovate and their access to markets."
"This is why I urge Member States to adopt without delay the proposal on the European Private Company Statute, which would enable SMEs to trade throughout the EU, while cutting costs and encouraging growth in this area, promoting a 25% reduction in administration and stimulating business."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"There are 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs."
"They make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation, are a major source of innovation, and play a vital role in sustaining and increasing employment and helping to achieve the main aims of the flagship initiative EU 2020."
"The Small Business Act adopted in 2008 was a significant political step aimed at improving the business environment for SMEs, ensuring better and simpler regulation and simplifying market access."
"However, SMEs continue to face serious problems expanding their activities and innovative capacities and it is difficult for them to access markets, above all, due to difficulties obtaining financing and administrative obstacles, which should also be reduced further."
"The Member States should implement all the provisions of the Small Business Act as a matter of urgency in order to establish a clear and consistent business environment."
"The Small Business Act (SBA) is the strategic framework for better exploitation of the potential for growth and innovation of EU small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"There are around 23 million SMEs in the EU, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs, playing a key role in economic growth, social cohesion and job creation."
"This resolution, for which I voted, acknowledges that several of the SBA's initiatives have been launched."
"Nonetheless, much more can be done to help European SMEs, specifically: the swift implementation by the Member States of the Late Payments Directive; better Commission mechanisms for encouraging the Member States to apply the principles of the SBA; adoption by the Member States, without delay, of the last remaining proposal on the European Private Company Statute; the regular application by the Commission and the Member States of the SME test as part of impact assessments; the urgently needed reduction of the bureaucratic and administrative burden on SMEs; and putting 'Erasmus for young entrepreneurs' on a permanent footing, with a sufficient budget."
"I voted for the draft resolution because I welcome the 'Single Market Act' initiative, and especially the legislative measures enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to make use of all the advantages of the Single Market, such as the European rules for venture capital funds, the revised VAT regulations and the simplification of the directives on accounting."
"At the same time, I feel there is a need to strengthen dialogue between SMEs and public procurement bodies in order to simplify the involvement of SMEs in public procurement procedures."
"I would consider it appropriate in these circumstances to examine the options for helping SMEs to create partnerships and consortia, and to participate jointly in public contracts."
"The Commission should produce an assessment of the impacts and consider the possibility of increasing the ceilings for EU public contracts, which would allow SMEs to take part in contracts that would otherwise be subject to special requirements, on account of which SMEs would not be able to participate."
"I would also like to call on the Commission to consider how it might be possible in Europe to improve the publication of all public procurement notices and to eliminate the administrative burden which prevents European firms from taking part in transboundary public contracts."
"The Member States then face the task of more systematically applying the European Code of Best Practices Facilitating Access by SMEs to Public Procurement Contracts."
"I welcome the creation and development of the Small Business Act (SBA), which, in my opinion, provides timely solutions for the main obstacles encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as regards expanding their activities and becoming established."
"Many of these obstacles are due to excessive bureaucratisation and difficulties in obtaining finance."
"The SBA calls on the Member States to improve the business environment for SMEs, so its principles should be duly implemented and adopted."
"in writing. - The Small Business Act has been one of the most proactive acts of the past three years, and it is important that the EU continues to focus on SMEs."
"I voted for the European Parliament's resolution on the Small Business Act Review as there are still further important steps to be taken to facilitate the proper operation of SMEs in the EU."
"In economic terms, SMEs are what we call the 'backbone of the EU'."
"Indeed, 99% of all businesses in Europe are SMEs, providing more than 100 million jobs."
"The European Union encourages their development."
"However, at domestic level, SMEs constantly encounter difficulties in obtaining financing or in coping with administrative tasks which often exceed the requirements under EU directives."
"This is why I voted in favour of Member States stepping up their efforts in terms of implementing properly the principles featuring in the SBA."
"SMEs are essential to the European economy's dynamism."
"There are 23 million SMEs within the EU; they employ fewer than 250 people and their turnover does not exceed EUR 50 million; they account for 99% of European businesses and employ nearly 70% of the workforce in the private sector."
"In a context of difficult recovery and of increased international economic competition, establishing a European strategy would be welcome."
"The 'Small Business Act' is aimed at increasing entrepreneurship in Europe and helping businesses grow."
"Therefore, it is an absolute requirement that we reduce administrative formalities and put in place a modern administration adapted to the needs of SMEs."
"That is why the Commission must establish a unified system for setting up a business."
"It would also be useful to introduce an 'SME test' to assess the impact of all future legislation on SMEs and check that this legislation will not stifle the potential these businesses have for growth."
"I welcome the adoption of the European Parliament's resolution on the Small Business Act Review, which adapts the European support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the new context resulting from the 2008 economic crisis, and ensures that they are able to meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"SMEs were the first to be affected by the financial and banking crisis that has taken place these last few years, which reduced their access to financing and to the markets."
"This new version of the Small Business Act must therefore give more support to innovation among SMEs by diversifying the financing instruments and by reducing as much as possible the administrative burdens that they face."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on their own account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs in the European Union."
"Their role in economic growth, social cohesion and job creation is therefore vital."
"The Small Business Act (SBA) is based on key principles, such as access to finance, access to markets and better regulation."
"However, it is undeniable that SMEs continue to struggle against a series of problems, like the difficulty of expanding their activities, problems accessing markets, or the innumerable difficulties in obtaining financing."
"As such, I welcome the conclusions of the Commission's review, and I am very pleased to see the new proposals aiming to improve access to finance and markets, and to move forward with the process of cutting red tape."
"This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a review of the Small Business Act (SBA)."
"The SBA is a series of political principles aiming to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of access to finance and markets, as well as of improved legislation."
"The social, economic and financial role of SMEs in the European Union is unquestionable."
"There are around 23 million of them in the EU, accounting for 99% of all businesses and providing over 100 million jobs."
"The current financial crisis has had a negative impact on these companies."
"That is why there is a need to review the current legislation, so as to facilitate access to financing; to reduce administrative costs and all bureaucracy; to encourage energy saving, as only 24% of companies currently recognise its importance; to improve businesses' technology through eco-innovation; to promote improved levels of qualification, education and professional training; and to promote internationalisation and good governance."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this resolution, and I hope that all SMEs will benefit from these measures and become prosperous, as all Europeans would benefit."
"We have another resolution full of contradictions before us."
"On the one hand, the appointment of the new Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Envoy by the Commission is to be welcomed, and his mandate to monitor the progress of the Member States in the implementation of the Small Business Act (SBA) and to promote SMEs' interests throughout the Commission, ensuring, in particular, that the 'Think Small First' principle is being applied effectively, is to be supported."
"It makes a positive recommendation by calling on the Member States to appoint national SME Envoys to coordinate SME policies and control the implementation of the SBA across the various administrations."
"We also think that it is positive that it stresses that the administrative burden is relatively higher the smaller the company is, and therefore calls for differentiation between micro, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"On the other hand, however, the resolution does not tackle - or fails to tackle sufficiently - a number of the constraints, direct and indirect, with which SMEs are currently burdened, many of which are the result of the policies dominant at EU level."
"On the one hand, it 'welcomes the appointment of the new [Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME)] Envoy by the Commission, and supports his mandate to monitor the progress of the Member States in the implementation of the [Small Business Act (SBA)] and to promote SMEs' interests throughout the whole Commission, ensuring, in particular, that the 'Think Small First' principle is being applied effectively; calls on Member States to appoint national SME Envoys to coordinate SME policies and control the implementation of the SBA across different administrations'."
"On the other hand, however, it does not criticise or propose alternatives to the neoliberal and restrictive policies of the Stability and Growth Pact, which are causing so many problems for SMEs and the general public."
"Nevertheless, it is positive that it stresses that the administrative burden is relatively higher the smaller the company is, and therefore calls for differentiation between micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; and that it underlines that microbusinesses - with fewer than 10 employees - constitute 91.8% of all EU businesses and therefore deserve more attention and the corresponding tailored approach."
"We will monitor how its implementation turns out."
"There are 23 million small and medium enterprises in the European Union, and they employ over 100 million people."
"The Small Business Act is an important policy, and it aims to simplify access to funding and to the market and to improve regulation."
"A very important part of the Act is reducing the red tape affecting SMEs in Ireland and the EU."
"Today, the European Parliament has shown support for the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union, which represent more than 100 million jobs and provide an essential contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and the creation of jobs."
"The goal was to assess the progress made and to plan new actions with the aim of responding to the challenges associated with the economic crisis."
"We can note a marked improvement in the situation of SMEs, but progress still needs to be made."
"SMEs continue to come up against considerable problems in expanding their activities, and sometimes even in surviving."
"It is therefore necessary to reduce bureaucracy through strengthening control and through intelligent regulation."
"A decision must therefore be made quickly on the European Private Company Statute, and similarly we must urgently move towards adopting a single European patent."
"At the same time, we must make sure that the 'SME test' is applied properly in all new legislative proposals, particularly at national level."
"Finally, SMEs play an essential role in European innovation."
"We should continue to simplify the financing of research and development in order to increase their capacity for innovation throughout the innovation cycle."
"SMEs represent 99% of businesses in the European Union."
"As a result, I voted in favour of the review to the Small Business Act, which is a resolution that recognises the crucial role of SMEs in the European economy."
"I support a strategic framework that goes even further in the help granted to SMEs in times of recession, and this in many areas."
"Thus, I welcome an intelligent regulation which lightens the administrative burden borne by these key economic actors and which facilitates their access to finance and to new markets, so that they are able to invest and grow."
"Finally, it is important to point out that research, innovation and training should be supported so that our SMEs can enjoy the full benefit from the Single Market."
"As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I took part in the work and negotiations on the Late Payments Directive, which is one of the key legislative proposals announced in the original version of the Small Business Act."
"I hope the Member States will take pains to implement its provisions as quickly as possible and correctly."
"The Small Business Act is a good proposal for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"However, I do have doubts over the qualitative assessment of work which has been done."
"As an example, I would like to mention the Annex to the review drafted by the European Commission."
"The Annex contains examples of some good practices, and among them, in the part concerning the Single Market, it mentions the fact that 22 Member States have set up operational one-stop shops (points of single contact)."
"I would like to remind everyone that these points were set up pursuant to the Services Directive."
"Barely three months ago, this House adopted a report on implementation of the Services Directive, in which we draw attention principally to the fact that the one-stop shops are not fully operational, that in most cases, they do not allow completion of formalities by electronic means and that they are not working in the way which businesses expect."
"I hope that drawing attention to individual one-stop shops which are good examples will be followed by greater efforts to improve the operation of all of them, so that they really will serve small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I voted in favour of this document because it welcomes the Commission review of the Small Business Act (SBA) and expresses support for the new proposals focused on further improving access to finance, enhancing market access and reducing the administrative burden, by strengthening governance and monitoring through smart regulation."
"I believe that the Member States should adopt without delay the last remaining proposals on the European Private Company Statute, which would enable SMEs to trade throughout the EU while cutting costs and encouraging growth in this area."
"We also need to promote the 25% reduction of administrative burden indicated in the SBA, which would contribute to the effectiveness of the SBA, would counteract any protectionist economic policies of Member States and stimulate business across the EU."
"Member States must swiftly implement the revised Late Payments Directive to effectively combat late payments and their negative impact, particularly on SMEs."
"Member States should also avoid 'gold-plating' by exceeding the requirements of EU legislation when transposing directives into national law."
"The administrative burden is relatively higher the smaller the size of the company - a disproportionate and incorrect provision which reduces the setting up of SMEs."
"There needs to be a differentiation between micro, small and medium-sized businesses."
"I believe that small businesses should be assisted to increase their ability to compete in international markets by enhancing their ability to export, disseminating information concerning programmes and initiatives facilitating international market access and penetration of SME goods and services, and ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented."
"in writing. - I welcome the Commission review of the SBA and express support for the new proposals focused on further improving access to finance, enhancing market access and continuing debureaucratisation through strengthened governance and monitoring and through smart regulation and measures such as the SME performance review"
"in writing. - (RO) I voted to review the Small Business Act project as I think that the European Union needs to continue the process of strengthening its support mechanisms with a view to removing the obstacles blocking the sustainable development of small and medium-sized businesses so that their potential can be tapped to the full."
"Bearing in mind the crucial role which SMEs play in the European economy and their contribution to boosting economic growth, employment and social cohesion, measures must be implemented which aim at providing an ideal framework for the development of SMEs."
"In this context, I would like to stress that Member States need to step up their efforts in supporting the policies aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and creating a favourable business environment for SMEs."
"Consideration must also be given to the key role played by exchanging good practices within these policies."
"Improving SMEs' access to funding and the Single Market, cutting red tape, as well as ensuring better implementation of the Small Business Act by Member States, must be priorities at national and EU level."
"The review of the Small Business Act (SBA) and the new proposals it contains are necessary tools to strengthen and revitalise the 23 million European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have proved to be the real bulwark against the economic crisis."
"Within the European economy as a whole, SMEs account for 99% of all businesses and provide jobs for almost 100 hundred million Europeans."
"We need to continue working to strengthen and support SMEs to reinvigorate growth, while also focusing on improving competitiveness and innovation."
"These proposals faithfully reflect these needs."
"Of particular importance is reviving the SBA in accordance with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and all actions to facilitate SME growth through simplification and support, not only for investment, but also for the challenges that globalisation and climate change bring today."
"Yet another text seeking to lower the standards of public authorities for the benefit of entrepreneurs."
"The European 'Small Business Act' and its review are concerned neither about the general interest nor about SME employees."
"The only virtue of this resolution, which is supported by all political groups except mine, is to deplore this state of affairs and boast about energy efficiency that it undermines elsewhere by promoting unbridled exports."
"Hypocritical and malevolent."
"I am abstaining to encourage the intention and denounce the hypocrisy."
"We cannot forget that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs, make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation, are a major source of innovation, and play a vital role in sustaining and increasing employment, and contribute to achieving the main goals of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives."
"The Small Business Act (SBA) is based on a number of important policy pillars, such as access to finance, access to markets - the Single Market, international markets, public procurement - and better regulation."
"We must encourage the Member States to adopt its guidelines so as to help SMEs at this time of crisis."
"I am very positive about this resolution concerning the Small Business Act review, as it contains the correct measures to undertake in order to make it easier for over 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises to do business."
"The main points include the application of a new series of measures giving easier access to credit through public support for guarantee systems and a strong commitment to encouraging the cofinancing of micro-credit."
"More than a raft of incentives and targeted funding, our small and medium-sized enterprises need greater and simpler freedom of action, hence less bureaucracy, and also certain guarantees."
"On this latter point, we should call upon Member States to resolve the issue of late payments, which has created and continues to create serious problems and difficulties."
"Finally, I would like to underline that internationalisation may be the new frontier for relaunching small and medium sized enterprises, and therefore any tools for permitting expansion beyond their borders will be very welcome."
"It is a difficult challenge, particularly for smaller enterprises, and for this reason, it requires greater attention and more support from the European Union."
"I voted in favour of this document because I believe that the incentives for small business set out in the Small Business Act are the way to increase the competitiveness of the European Union."
"In particular, I would like to draw attention to two aspects of the resolution we adopted."
"Firstly, attention to education and vocational training."
"It is precisely young people who will create and participate in the EU's future."
"It is therefore particularly important for them to be enterprising and ready to create a vibrant and competitive EU economy."
"Efficient use of resources is another aspect also related to the future quality of life in the EU."
"We are always talking about this, but so far in practice, we have unfortunately taken too little action for our words to be translated into reality."
"On the other hand, efficient use of resources as a measure on its own is not enough - in general, there needs to be a sustainable attitude to the environment at every stage of business development."
"I therefore call on both the European Commission and the Member States to pay as much attention as possible to developing greater youth entrepreneurship and promoting efficient use of resources and other energy saving initiatives."
"This resolution aims to provide the European Parliament's perspective on the analysis of the Commission's 'Small Business Act'."
"As such, Parliament is using this resolution to express its support for the new proposals aiming to improve access to finance and the markets for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); for the measures to continue the process of cutting bureaucracy through strengthened governance and monitoring; for smart regulation; and for measures such as the SME performance review."
"As I have previously stated, strengthening SMEs is key to promoting economic growth."
"In this regard, what Parliament is proposing in terms of research and innovation - specifically simplifying funding for research, development and innovation (R&D&I), and promoting appropriate programme management, especially for SMEs - is particularly important, as is strengthening innovation capacities over the full cycle, including non-technological innovation within the future financial framework for research and innovation."
"I also support investment intended to support local SMEs through, for example, the involvement of innovation centres, chambers of commerce, business associations and innovation clusters across the Single Market."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for around 99% of all EU businesses and make a key contribution to economic growth: as well as a source of jobs and wealth, they are particularly suitable vehicles for innovation."
"As such, it is essential to continue offering them conditions to be able to develop and become secure in the market, by guaranteeing them access to finance and to the potential benefits of the Single Market."
"It is therefore important to congratulate the Commission on its analysis of the Small Business Act and support the new proposals put forward to pursue the objectives of supporting the SMEs."
"Ninety-nine percent of European companies are SMEs."
"Two-thirds of jobs in the private sector are provided by the SME base."
"More than half of European added value is produced by SMEs."
"There will be no genuine recovery of the economy, or long-term economic growth, without substantial action on the part of public authorities, whether local, national or European, in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"By adopting the 'Small Business Act' in 2008, the European Commission made the first decisive step towards small and medium-sized enterprises by introducing the 'Think Small First' principle in all areas of legislation."
"Despite the many proposals that have been seen through in the last three years - I am thinking of the Late Payments Directive in particular - a lot of progress remains to be achieved to make things easier for small and medium-sized enterprises, not only in respect of the administrative burden they have to deal with, but also the difficulty in accessing funding that they experience."
"The European Commission must continue on the path it defined with the SBA in 2008."
"This is what this resolution, which I lend my support to, calls for."
"in writing. - The resolution focuses, in particular, on: (1) the regulatory environment, calling for better implementation of the SME test - in particular, in Member States - and for a reduction in bureaucracy and administrative burdens; (2) improving SMEs' access to finance through additional funding and instruments within the EIB (such as the RSFF and equity financing) and an enlarged (and independent) CIP; (3) improvements needed to ensure the participation of SMEs in public procurement; (4) simplification and better targeted R&D&I programmes to promote SMEs' innovation management capacity, access to R&D&I services and knowledge-based business services, through, for instance, technology transfer centres and universities; (5) the need for more attention to be paid to skills needed and other social and labour market issues affecting entrepreneurship and SMEs' capacities to fulfil their employment potential, in particular, managerial skills, digital skills and sustainability skills; (6) action to improve resource efficiency: sectoral SME projects to identify resource efficiency innovation in the value and supply chains; the adoption of an ambitious eco-innovation action plan and more funds for it through the CIP; more cost-effective energy efficiency measures to help SMEs reduce energy bills;"
"I support the report reviewing the Small Business Act as it aims to improve access to credit and access to the market for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"At this time of crisis for European businesses, we need to give assistance to SMEs, enabling them to increase their abilities and know-how, asking them to support management programmes designed to implement research, development and innovation."
"The report acknowledges the key role of SMEs in the transition to an economy characterised by resource efficiency and it is also essential to acknowledge the role of young entrepreneurs."
"For the latter, the EU should commit itself to institutionalising the Erasmus programme in order to give them an opportunity to develop."
"I welcome the adoption of the resolution on the review of the 'Small Business Act' with a resounding majority of the European Parliament."
"SMEs, which represent 99% of European businesses, provide two-thirds of jobs in the private sector and generate over half of the added value created, in total, by businesses operating in the EU."
"SMEs play a key role in innovation, research and development."
"By adopting the 'Small Business Act' in 2008, the European Commission made the first decisive step for these SMEs by introducing the 'Think Small First' principle in all areas of legislation."
"Many proposals have been seen through in three years, such as the Late Payments Directive."
"However, we still have a lot to do to make life easier for SMEs with respect to the red tape they are faced with and access to funding that is often difficult."
"This resolution appeals to the European Commission to continue on the path of greater consideration for the engines of prosperity and economic growth that are SMEs."
"As the rapporteur accurately observed, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of European society and the engine of our economy."
"This is also true of Lithuania, where 99.4% of Lithuanian companies employ fewer than 250 people."
"According to government statistics, in January 2011, there were more than 66 500 SMEs operating in Lithuania."
"What Lithuanians desperately need is smarter regulation, less bureaucracy and fewer administrative burdens."
"Obtaining planning permission is one of the greatest problems faced by investors in Lithuania."
"According to a report by the World Bank, 17 procedures need to be carried out in order to obtain permission and this may take 162 days."
"In this area, according to the World Bank's classification, Lithuania ranks 59th in the world."
"Investor protection in Lithuania is an even greater problem; in this area, Lithuania ranks 93rd."
"This really is no good."
"I believe that a successful strategy for promoting innovative SMEs should not just be supported by subsidies, but by the creation of a business environment, where SMEs would have more freedom and improved access to various sources of financing."
"I also believe that SMEs should pay more attention to social and labour market issues, which have an impact on entrepreneurship and SMEs' abilities to employ workers with the relevant skills."
"in writing. - I welcome this resolution, which warns against too much bureaucracy and red tape for SMEs."
"The 23 million SMEs in the EU provide over 100 million jobs and make a huge contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation."
"We need to make sure that these vital businesses are not hampered by red tape and bureaucracy, and I agree that the EU needs to renew its efforts to reduce administrative burdens."
"I am pleased that almost all legislative proposals under the Small Business Act have been adopted but urge Member States to implement the revised Late Payments Directive without delay."
"The resolution also outlines the energy savings potential that SMEs have - currently only 24% of SMEs are engaged in actions to reduce their environmental impact-energy efficiency; if SMEs applied cost-effective energy efficiency measures, they could reduce their energy bills and increase reinvestment."
"I voted against the resolution on the Small Business Act Review, put forward by the European Commission in February 2011."
"This review - in particular, the reduction of administrative and bureaucratic costs and burdens - is consistent with the Act as it currently stands."
"Its proposal to harmonise taxation systems must not result in yet another reduction in taxes on businesses - admittedly, small businesses - while salaries are hit by the austerity plans."
"It is true that the review aims to improve SMEs' access to financing, but it fails to mention social and environmental issues and does not even refer to the European Commission's plan for a Social Business Initiative, announced for the end of this year."
"It is true that the Small Business Act Review, in making this proposal, moves us a little way towards a social economy, but it does so through its weakness with respect to the challenges associated with these other forms of action."
"Like the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the Small Business Act Review does not learn the lessons of the Monti report for re-establishing citizens' confidence in the European Union."
"It therefore still conforms to the same ultra-liberal logic of European integration that we have been condemning for years, a logic which is, first and foremost, centred on the market and its needs."
"The small and medium-sized enterprises of Europe are the lungs of our economic activity."
"We must put their development, their modernisation and their competitiveness at the heart of our economic strategy."
"I therefore voted in favour of the resolution on the Small Business Act Review, the aim of which is to liberate the growth potential of SMEs."
"There is still much to be done to simplify the regulatory environment and the administrative procedures that are weighing too heavily on the activity and dynamism of our businesses."
"I welcome the actions proposed in this report, such as the creation of a European Private Company Statute."
"This would help our SMEs to draw the full benefits of the Single Market by allowing them to carry out their cross-border activities without requiring them to fulfil obligations which are often onerous and discouraging."
"I therefore call on the Council to give its opinion on this initiative quickly."
"Finally, we must come to the aid of innovative SMEs by facilitating their access to diverse forms of financing."
"That will be achieved, in particular, by significantly simplifying the use of European credits, which are still lacking in flexibility."
"These credits exist, and I think that they must be utilised in order to provide more effective support for the development of the real economy, innovation and employment."
"I am voting for this proposal, as I agree with the rapporteur when she says that union is strength."
"Joining forces to innovate and solve common problems in Europe means faster developments, efficiency (cost-efficiency), and greater creativity."
"The Innovation Union should also increase Europe's competitiveness, to help find a way out of the economic crisis."
"As Europe is very dependent on imports, the Member States are united in feeling the need to use intelligently and sustainably the raw materials and commodities required to generate energy or for use in industry or food production."
"The ageing of the population is another challenge facing nearly every country in the EU."
"With the aim of giving people more years of healthy life, with the appropriate care and medicines, but, at the same time, controlling costs, a joint approach may yield results more quickly."
"Europe's economies have become so interlinked nowadays that it is not only the stability of the euro that requires a common approach: so do efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Member States."
"What is needed is a common path towards an equitable and stable economy."
"Europe has been, is and will remain a cradle of global civilisation, education, research and culture."
"What is certain, and is also mentioned in the Commission communication, is that Europe does not lack in potential, whether human, technical, commercial or financial."
"My question is: what is Europe doing to utilise primarily its human resource potential?"
"How does Europe intend to keep its human resources, which are so essential to innovation in Europe's schools, universities and research centres?"
"Before focusing on attracting experts from outside the European Union, I feel that our priority is to halt the exodus of researchers from Europe to other important centres across the world."
"Establishing a modernised education system throughout the whole of Europe, placing strong emphasis on substantive research results and, of course, simplifying access to cross-border research programmes in Europe can raise the level of innovation in the EU."
"However, to ensure that human resources remain here, Europe must focus on the following aspect: making researchers attractive offers, proposals which they cannot refuse."
"In fact, it must persuade them that, at every level, there is nowhere better than home."
"I endorsed this report."
"The Innovation Union flagship initiative is the most significant and targeted Community attempt so far to introduce a strategic, integrated and business-oriented European innovation policy to supplement Member State efforts, whereby innovation is steered and progress monitored at the highest political level."
"Innovations are particularly important for combating global challenges such as climate change, energy and food security, etc., where there is a need to innovate and reinforce the existing scientific and technological base."
"It is also necessary to modernise education systems and adapt them to the needs of the times."
"Member States must take action to improve the entrepreneurship and skills of young European citizens and entrepreneurs by incorporating entrepreneurship and innovation into all areas of education and improving human capital."
"Such action would enable them to play an active role in innovation."
"The 'Innovation Union' initiative still remains the most important Union initiative for developing an integrated European strategy in relation to research and innovation."
"Increasing the pace of research and innovation is crucial for introducing a fair and competitive economic model, ensuring jobs for the future, moving towards sustainable resource management, facing up to energy challenges and stimulating a knowledge-based society."
"In terms of jobs, the environment and development, innovation is thus one of the major challenges facing the European Union and will have concrete repercussions on citizens."
"From now on, European citizens, as both the engines and the beneficiaries of innovation, must be able to participate fully in this 'Innovation Union' in order to ensure that it is successful, as we emphasised in this report."
"Finally, we wanted for that reason to highlight how essential an innovation policy is, as well as the added value of a coordinated approach at European level."
"In order to face up to the shared major social and economic challenges that European society faces, we need ambitious initiatives."
"Now, therefore, we await the legislative phase of the Commissioner's actions on research and innovation."
"The concept of innovation is multidimensional: it includes not only scientific research and experimental and technological development, but also the development of new processes, methodologies and organisational and behavioural models."
"While welcoming the Commission communication on Innovation Union as a flagship initiative of the EU 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, I think there are still priority areas where we need a greater commitment to building capacities in science, technology and innovation: efficient resource use, recovery and recycling of waste, food quality and safety, and new epidemics."
"According to the conclusions of the 2009 European Innovation Panel, the recent economic and financial crisis has had disproportionate effects in different countries."
"I am concerned that the current budgetary constraints imposed on Member States may lead to greater restrictions on investment in research and innovation, with obvious negative effects on European growth and competitiveness."
"I therefore call on the Commission to consider leveraging the resources of the common strategic framework for funding these sectors, particularly the research and innovation sectors of the European Union."
"I have voted in favour of the 'Innovation Union' initiative because it represents the only possibility to overcome the crisis in a global world."
"Innovation means creating jobs, knowledge, technology, caring for the environment, extending social cohesion and public welfare."
"All of the Union's Member States must make a firm commitment to innovation, and they must bolster it by working together, sharing good practices and improving the dissemination of successful experiences."
"There is a future provided that there is innovation."
"Having said this, I have voted in favour of Amendment 1 because I am completely against using common agricultural policy funds to provide the resources needed for the programmes."
"The agricultural sector, which is also immersed in the crisis, deserves those funds to drive its own innovation."
"An innovative Europe can bring innovation to agriculture, so that it may build a future just the same as that of the other strategic sectors."
"Everyone is aware that economic growth is closely linked to technological progress, which, in turn, is generated by people's innovative aspiration."
"However, this aspiration and potential are restricted by financial, bureaucratic and other kinds of obstacles. I fully support the report on the Innovation Union because I think that it will allow us to knock down the barriers preventing innovative thinking in the European Union."
"However, I feel that the most important aspect is for us to avoid the development of a two-speed Europe, which can be done, specifically by incorporating the Union's economy into the common aspiration for innovation."
"The call in the report for the introduction of the single European patent and the satisfaction it expresses over the adoption of enhanced cooperation regarding the introduction of the patent prevent me from voting in favour."
"The introduction of an Anglo-Franco-German European patent is unacceptable for at least two reasons."
"First, trilingualism would have a negative impact on the competitiveness of companies in the Member States not represented in the system."
"These companies, including Italian ones, would have to await the completion of the translation process before being able to obtain the documents, at the expense of the ability to act quickly, which is of the utmost importance in business."
"They would also have to shoulder the additional costs of translation."
"In contrast, Anglo-Franco-German companies would not have to put up with any of these barriers, which would give rise to discrimination on the basis of language."
"Furthermore, the introduction of a trilingual system does not seem to conform to administrative requirements and does not even seem to reflect the demographic weighting of the Member States, because in that case, Italy should also be represented. Instead, it seems like an attempt to impose the prestige of Germany at the expense of the principles of parity and equality between Member States on which the EU is founded."
"I have therefore decided not to support the report."
"I voted for the resolution on the Innovation Union because, apart from other things, I believe that we must adopt measures both at the European and national levels for improving the entrepreneurial skills and professional training of Europeans by incorporating business studies, creativity and innovation into all areas of education."
"It is necessary to make more use of Commission programmes such as 'Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs' and, at the same time, to protect skilled trades as a source of innovation."
"In my opinion, the Commission should cooperate more with Member States in drawing up medium-term and long-term outlooks in relation to the qualifications needed on the job market and in supporting partnerships between universities and the business sector, with the aim of making it easier for young people to enter the job market and helping in the creation of innovative companies based on knowledge, the development of applied research and better prospects for graduates on the labour market."
"In this context, I support the proposal of the Committee of the Regions to create a 'virtual network of creativity' which would be open to all (businesses, local and regional bodies, the private sector and citizens) and would provide advice, support and access to venture capital and technical services."
"I would also like to draw attention to the current lack of improved and proactive interactions between universities and businesses, and I would like to call on the Commission to launch a new Europe-wide programme for professional training and education for senior staff at universities, and officials dealing with technology."
"I welcome the focus given in this report to research and innovation as a means of overcoming the economic and social crisis Europe is currently experiencing."
"In fact, new, sustainable ways for smarter and more efficient use of resources and commodities are increasingly necessary."
"We therefore need to create space for new ideas and, most important of all, to create the mechanisms necessary to implement these ideas."
"As such, I support the report tabled on Innovation Union, and would stress its importance with regard to the current situation and to European success in times to come."
"Innovation in many respects is the key to economic growth."
"Already by the second half of the twentieth century, the most respected growth economists had understood that innovation is one of the main variables for leveraging falling profits."
"This is how we made the transition from the growth models of the 1950s, according to which the economy sooner or later stabilises and loses its momentum, to the endogenous growth models of the 1980s, in which technology and the design of constantly different and innovative products allow the economy to maintain a positive growth rate over the long term."
"In order to set these leverage mechanisms in motion, which, from now until 2020, will take the form of research, energy efficiency and internationalisation targets, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, there needs to be a strong political desire to activate incentives and orientation mechanisms."
"These are the responsibility of the Member States, and European funding can provide them with valid support."
"Resources are limited due to the crisis, and the directives in Europe 2020 need to go hand in hand with strong fiscal and industrial policies on the part of the European governments."
"I voted for the report on Innovation Union as it highlighted the importance of innovation in terms of laying the foundations for a sustainable, competitive economic model and creating new jobs in the European Union."
"At the same time, I tabled an amendment to this report, along with other fellow Members, in which I expressed my disagreement about funding the innovation policy with money hitherto earmarked for the common agricultural policy."
"I voted for this report as I feel that it offers viable solutions for improving research and innovation in the European Union and, by extension, provides the conditions for a return to economic growth and the creation of new jobs."
"Stimulating investments for research, facilitating access for SMEs to diverse sources of funding, and improving cooperation between universities, research centres and government are measures which will generate creativity and innovation in the medium and long term."
"Particular attention must be focused on balancing the innovation and research potentials between the various Member States and regions as, at the moment, there is a great disparity between them, which affects the whole Union."
"I voted in favour of this report as it introduces a range of measures to successfully address a number of societal challenges, specifically climate change, energy and resource scarcity, population ageing, and problems accessing public services and quality healthcare."
"The EU must fully commit to achieving the proposed objectives."
"It is estimated that 3.7 million jobs can be created by 2020, and that annual gross domestic product (GDP) can be increased by around EUR 800 billion by 2025."
"This own-initiative report follows in the wake of the Commission communication on Innovation Union and is one of the initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, whose objective is to encourage innovation and competitiveness by creating robust policies that stimulate the exchange of ideas and solutions to a number of problems that cut across all the Member States"
"The kernel of this idea is to encourage and promote activities that are efficient and competitive, both during and after the crisis, enabling the Union as a whole to overcome the weaknesses that a number of sectors are demonstrating, especially industry."
"Undoubtedly, then, this is an ambitious report, given the issues it tackles, from intellectual property rights to increased cooperation among the Member States and the Commission."
"I would therefore congratulate the rapporteur on her commitment and hope that, with more such contributions, we will be able to achieve all the objectives proposed in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This report, drawn up by Mrs Merkies, proposes an Innovation Union as a means of preparing Europe for the world in the wake of the current economic and financial crisis."
"The unprecedented global crisis, which is stubbornly persisting and could threaten the European project, requires everyone and, in particular, the European Union, to take a firm stance that motivates the public."
"Therefore, as well as voting for this report, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work, which provides us with an optimistic view of the future and calls for the innovation capacity that we all possess."
"It is important to implement the proposals advocated in this report, such as better access to credit and financial support, more investment in research and development, clearer legislation, less bureaucracy, a 'one-stop shop', better inter-regional cooperation, and a simple and cheap European patent."
"The report addresses the importance of innovation in all its forms to the development of societies."
"It does so whilst making significant contributions to a number of areas and making proposals - for example, on the increased dissemination and absorption of innovation in a number of sectors - which we consider opportune."
"In the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which I drafted, I sought to summarise the main points of our view and concerns in this area."
"On the basis of this draft opinion, it can easily be said that there are clear points of disagreement with the Commission communication."
"In particular, these focus on aspects also included in this report, which is where some of the contradictions it contains are to be found: the view of innovation as essentially a business opportunity; the emphasis given to the market, to competition, and to harnessing innovation for business purposes; the advocating of the Internal Market and EU patents."
"Those are the aspects with which we disagree."
"As we said during the debate, another issue that was not tackled sufficiently was the risk - very clear from the results of the European Innovation Panel of 2009 - of an 'innovation divide' between the countries and regions that innovate most and the rest."
"The report sufficiently highlights innovation, which constitutes a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humanity today."
"It should be a key element of public policy in areas like the environment, water, energy, transport, telecommunications, health and education, and should help resolve problems like the scarcity and efficient use of resources, waste recovery and treatment, food quality and security, demographic changes, new epidemics, and conservation of nature and biodiversity."
"However, the report includes a number of contradictions because it is founded on neoliberal ideas, defending the Internal Market and advocating EU patents, with which we disagree."
"The constraints currently imposed on the Member States could result in increased restrictions on investment in science, technology and innovation (STI), particularly in the most vulnerable countries."
"Instead of the announced 'Innovation Union', the result could be a veritable 'innovation divide' between the countries and regions that innovate most and the rest."
"Where there should be public interest, development, cohesion, progress and social welfare, what has ended up predominating are so-called business opportunities, the market, competitiveness, competition, and the harnessing of innovation for business purposes."
"We must encourage third level institutions, research organisations and private sector companies to seize the opportunities available under the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7)."
"FP7 is the largest publicly funded research programme in the world and we must continue to highlight the benefits associated with it for SMEs."
"From an Irish perspective, this FP7 programme is helping to develop research, research that is creating jobs and making goods and services available that are necessary and in demand."
"Irish organisations have already availed of EUR 270 million from this programme, in the agricultural, food, fishing, health, energy, transport and ICT sectors."
"This is crucial for both Ireland and Europe, especially in the present difficult economic times."
"in writing. - I am in agreement with the Merkies report because I strongly believe that innovation and creativity are key to the economic recovery of the Union and that the importance of converting the Union's scientific technological breakthroughs into new goods and services cannot be overstated."
"Moreover, I am convinced that in a post-crisis Europe, any Single Market strategy has to be formulated in such a way as to maintain and enhance social cohesion, ensure market integrity and economic sustainability and foster innovation."
"This is why I endorse the Commission's initiative for a European Social Innovation pilot which ensures that innovative ideas for the creation of products, services and business models are linked to and, more importantly, meet the social needs of the EU's citizens and consumers."
"Confronted with a global economy which is in crisis, the European Parliament has stressed the importance of making Europe more innovative and efficient by adapting to the new challenges of the 21st century."
"It is essential to encourage maximum involvement from all of the actors involved, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), industry, universities and governments."
"All have their role to play."
"Thus, we must, for example, modernise our education systems and fill in knowledge gaps in the sciences and in engineering."
"We will only emerge from the crisis if we support innovation."
"The European Union must enable the creation of new financing instruments promoting research spending and private investments."
"Furthermore, collaboration between the public and private sectors, through the implementation of partnerships, is an important way of encouraging a more innovative economy."
"I believe that it is essential to adopt the single European patent in order to encourage a move towards commercial exchanges outside the Union."
"Patents are currently far too expensive; we absolutely must reduce the costs associated with creating them."
"Finally, faced with the 'brain-drain' phenomenon, it is important to encourage the retention of researchers in Europe."
"Without them, financing and other mechanisms are of no use."
"European scores in terms of innovation have remained rather poor until now."
"Yet innovation should help us rise to society's main challenges, such as an ageing population, the need to manage resources sustainably, or economic recovery."
"That is why I voted in favour of this own-initiative report, which highlights, in particular, the concept of social innovation and emphasises the active role that regions and local authorities can play in innovation."
"Finally, we must promote a system for protecting intellectual property rights that is balanced and respects inventors' rights while, at the same time, offering our citizens the widest possible access to knowledge: such are the challenges to be met and which innovation could contribute towards in future."
"I voted in favour of this document, because under Article 179(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Union shall 'encourage undertakings, including small and medium-sized undertakings, research centres and universities in their research and technological development activities of high quality; it shall support their efforts to cooperate with one another, aiming, notably, at permitting researchers to cooperate freely across borders and at enabling undertakings to exploit the internal market potential to the full, in particular, through the opening up of national public contracts, the definition of common standards and the removal of legal and fiscal obstacles to that cooperation'."
"I am utterly convinced that the EU must take an offensive stance and take a firm front runner position in competitiveness, and must therefore invest in an innovation blast."
"The European Commission must translate the current 'Innovation Union' strategic document into an action plan with specific objectives and with measurable and time-framed targets."
"The Commission must monitor progress regularly, assessing obstacles and putting forward a mechanism to improve the regular provision of reports to the European Parliament and the Council."
"The Spanish Socialist delegation has voted in favour of the Merkies report on the Innovation Union: transforming Europe for a post-crisis world, because we agree with and are committed to the fundamental principles the report sets forth, which lay down the groundwork for transition to an intelligent, sustainable and fair European economy."
"Nonetheless, I wish to point out that our vote in favour of the report as a whole does not mean that we support the agreement reached by the majority of the Council on enhanced cooperation, as it excludes the Spanish language from the European patent."
"Our vote against the section introducing enhanced cooperation bears witness to our strong opposition to this matter."
"The instrument for enhanced cooperation will have a direct impact on the internal market, territorial cohesion and the right of the citizens of the Member States to an EU patent governed by language regulations that provide sufficient legal certainty."
"Further to this, the proposal to create a European and Community Patents Court is 'incompatible with European Union law' according to the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"Innovation may result in the development and reinvention of the European Union once the current crisis is over."
"However, we must be totally realistic and propose specific working instruments which will allow the correlation of innovation efforts at European, national and regional level."
"European innovation policy must be focused mainly on devising and specifically meeting objectives relating to the major challenges which the European Union is facing."
"I think that a reassessment is needed of the complexity of the tasks and responsibilities which local and regional government authorities have."
"In future, we will have to provide good quality technical assistance and financial support to ensure sufficient administrative capacity is available where required."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Joining forces to innovate so as to solve common problems in Europe means more focus, more rapid development, efficiency, including cost-efficiency, and greater creativity."
"The Innovation Union is intended not only to provide an answer to shared problems facing our societies but, at the same time, to increase Europe's competitiveness and point to ways out of the economic crisis."
"Innovation is solving common problems in Europe, meaning greater focus, faster developments, efficiency (cost-efficiency) and greater creativity."
"The Innovation Union should not only provide an answer to shared problems, but also increase Europe's competitiveness and find a way out of the economic crisis."
"As Europe is very dependent on imports, the Member States are united in feeling the need to use intelligently and sustainably the raw materials and commodities required to generate energy or for use in industry or food production."
"Europe's economies have become so interlinked nowadays that it is not only the stability of the euro that requires a common approach: so do efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Member States."
"What is needed is a common path towards an equitable and stable economy."
"Only a united Europe will be able to realise the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In the past, innovation has primarily been envisaged in the field of research."
"It should not be forgotten, though, that innovation can come from any EU citizen."
"These concepts - which often start out simply as ideas - should be supported at EU level by means of easier access to funding, simplified authorisation procedures and cheap and straightforward patents, amongst other things."
"That will enable the citizens themselves to exercise influence and help shape a sustainable society."
"Moreover, innovations of this kind, where the focus absolutely should remain on research, would help to maintain high living standards in Europe."
"The report received my vote because allowing individual citizens to play a part in shaping society represents a positive step."
"Furthermore, the signs of the electronic era point more and more towards personal innovation, which is very much worth noting."
"The report clarifies what goes without saying; that it is impossible to support innovation without supporting research and education."
"Although there are no foregone conclusions as to when the economic crisis will abate, the targets set by the Member States for 2020 in the research sector will not be achieved as things currently stand, just as the targets set in the previous European strategy, the Lisbon strategy, were not achieved."
"Data available to date illustrate that - roughly - a mere 2.7% of European GDP will be channelled into research at the end of the decade, despite the Member States' clear commitment to spend at least 3% for that purpose."
"At the same time, the Member States are citing the crisis as the reason for cutbacks in spending on education."
"In other words, the two basic pillars of innovation are being undermined, rather than strengthened, and this should be a source of concern to national governments."
"This report 'on Innovation Union: transforming Europe for a post-crisis world' includes a series of measures that constitute major social challenges."
"The rapporteur introduces the key idea of creating a union between all Europeans for innovation."
"Indeed, as is argued, finding solutions for common problems in Europe is a challenge for faster development, greater cost efficiency and increased creative strength."
"Innovation Union also aims to boost the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, in order to find a way out of the economic crisis."
"Given the widespread dependence on imports, the Member States feel a common need to seek methods for the smart and sustainable use of those resources and raw materials needed to produce energy, as well as for industry or food production."
"The ageing population issue is another challenge being faced by almost all EU countries."
"A joint approach on issues like health could ensure a longer life, with proper care and medication, all while reducing costs."
"These are only the major examples of common standards among the 27 Member States, as encouraged by this initiative, and are the basis of my vote for it."
"in writing. - More investment in research and innovation is essential to guarantee a sustainable and competitive future for our economies."
"As a share of GDP, the EU invests less than the US and Japan in research and development, and venture capital investment is also lacking."
"We need to be able to hold on to our best researchers and innovators."
"Reaching our target of investing 3% of our GDP on R&D by 2020 could mean a return of 3.7 million jobs and almost EUR 800 billion."
"Given its importance for improving quality of life and well-being, there is a role for both public and private initiative in innovation."
"Innovation is essential to any area or community."
"In fact, the ability to recreate something offered to us and, on that basis, give rise to something new, is fundamental to the development of any economy and, above all, to achieving social welfare."
"That is why Innovation Union is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It is a path that clearly needs to be followed in order to establish Europe on the international stage and satisfy the needs of the European public."
"Those are the reasons why I am voting in favour."
"Innovation is to European politics what education is to young people: a passport to the future, a virtually comprehensive insurance for a society that is making progress and preserving social cohesion."
"This phrase takes on its full meaning in this post-global recession period during which we are seeing speedier economic recovery in the United States and still unashamed growth in the emerging powers referred to as the BRIC group."
"One thing is clear: the European Union is lagging behind and the labour market is struggling to recover."
"The ultimate irony is that Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, remains the European champion of innovation."
"That is why the call today by the European Parliament (the Merkies report) for a genuine 'change in mentality' is important, because innovation is not just about technological inventions or the number of patents filed per inhabitant."
"First and foremost, it is about building on the SME base, which is the main generator of wealth in Europe, through venture capital, guarantee facilities, assistance with loans and simplification of the legislative environment."
"On this condition, perhaps the aspiration of 3% of GDP to be devoted to R&D will become a reality?"
"in writing. - We broadly supported the draft report and submitted a series of amendments which have mostly been included, for instance: an emphasis on green priority objectives: energy and climate change, resource efficiency, regeneration of biological resources and promoting social cohesion; addressing eco-innovation at all stages, including design, through the adoption of a properly funded and ambitious eco-innovation action plan, as well as the adoption of a strategy for promoting product/service systems and function-oriented business models; promoting the use of open standards as drivers for innovation and open access to publicly funded research, as well as focusing public financing on socially valuable fields where knowledge is created as a public good, such as inducement prizes in the health sector (we also tried, with varying degrees of success, to propose better wording for IPR issues); we managed to retain the wording welcoming the Commission's efforts to prevent IPR from constituting a barrier to competition and innovation."
"Europe has been emerging from a crisis in recent months and also has to deal with very strong global competition."
"In this context, innovation is a necessity but, above all, it is a priority."
"If we fail to transform Europe into an Innovation Union, the economies of the 27 Member States will, in fact, be destined to decline, resulting in a loss of talent and ideas."
"Innovation is the key to achieving sustainable growth and helping to create a more just and environmentally friendly society."
"Innovation is essential to create a modern economy and it is the main tool for creating new jobs."
"We need a shared commitment to a deep-seated change in Europe's capacity for innovation."
"Only then will we be able to create stable and well-paid jobs that can withstand the pressure and the competition inherent to globalisation."
"The Union is about innovation."
"It is not just a play on words but a real hope that must materialise."
"in writing. - I support this report as it is key to the post-crisis recovery and to addressing the major challenges in society."
"During the vote on the parliamentary report on Innovation Union, I was keen to support the amendment rejecting the idea of controlling innovation by channelling towards innovative activities the resources from the structural funds and from certain sections of the common agricultural policy funds."
"Of course, innovation should be encouraged, but this should not be done in a manner that is detrimental to other fundamental policies for the European Union's future, such as the common agricultural policy."
"The CAP should be reformed by concentrating on a few fundamental objectives, but the only integrated policy of the European Union must not be plundered."
"The Research and Innovation Union scoreboard mentions that Japan and the United States invest a greater percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in innovation than the EU, with the gap increasing over the last four years."
"Compared to the BRIC countries, the EU invests more, with the differential having decreased for Brazil and China, and increased for India and Russia."
"I therefore consider it essential that the European Union adopt a true innovation strategy, taking into account the Europe 2020 strategy of smart specialisation, with a view to reinforcing support for research, development and innovation (RDI) as a key element of the Union's future, extending it into all the areas, sectors of activity and social agents of which it is comprised."
"An innovation policy that is consistent and integrated, and has a long-term vision will enable us to leverage strengths and resolve weaknesses detected at regional level."
"It is vital to adapt and simplify development policy, for example, the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)."
"The new strategic agenda will enable the construction of an increasingly modern and competitive Europe that plays a leading role in the world."
"As innovation is a fundamental objective of regional policy, in future, Europe must adopt a strategic management approach, establishing appropriate policy instruments that will enable its evolution to be monitored and the necessary adjustments to be made."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the Innovation Union can help to address today's societal challenges."
"It is also essential in increasing competitiveness as the EU overcomes the economic crisis."
"I agree with the report that Member States should make use of the structural funds to support research, development and innovation (R&D&I) objectives that target social challenges, with the aim of increasing prosperity in Europe."
"Enhancing cross-border cooperation is also imperative, as is encouraging citizens to create innovative new businesses."
"This can be achieved by cutting red tape and establishing a simple and coherent system that focuses on societal challenges."
"The Union has not been able to make up its shortfall in terms of innovation, in spite of the Lisbon strategy."
"In a context of budgetary restrictions - which rules out public money as a solution - and increased global competition, Europe must react in order to get itself back into the innovation race."
"I think that it is essential to focus on structural reforms that will eliminate the obstacles holding back the considerable potential for innovation in Europe."
"I therefore supported this report, which notably points the finger at the high costs associated with the filing of patents in all Member States, and calls for a speedy agreement on the single European patent."
"I am also pleased to see that proposals by my political family have been taken up - in particular, the creation of a European innovation fund, which will simplify access to European credits for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"Liberating the capacity for innovation in Europe requires setting a minimum spending threshold, in terms of research and development, in each Member State."
"This would ensure an equitable division of efforts and prevent the development of a two-speed Europe, which would disrupt the cohesion and governance of the EU."
"This is essential if Europe wants to remain at the highest level of the global economy."
"I voted for Mrs Merkies' report because the final version provides a better balance than the original version, which was too focused on the enabling roles of citizens instead of enterprises."
"Indeed, enterprises deserve a leading role in research and innovation, partly because we must remember that EU policies on the subject grew and developed through the promotion of policies aimed at strengthening collaboration between industry, educational systems and research institutions."
"I therefore believe that the report we have voted on represents a useful contribution to the ongoing debate on a future joint strategic programme to support research and innovation in the EU."
"I am voting for this proposal given that the crisis has been wiping out millions of jobs and has increased job insecurity and poverty; that 17% of EU residents are at risk of poverty; that 23 million EU residents are unemployed; that much domestic work takes place in the informal economy, under precarious employment conditions and/or as undeclared work and that, in addition to this, in industrialised countries, domestic work accounts for between 5% and 9% of all employment; that the vast majority of the people employed in that sector are women; that such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal; and that domestic workers' vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and subjected to unfair or abusive treatment."
"I welcome and support the International Labour Organisation (ILO) initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers."
"I call on the EU countries that are members of the ILO to adopt these instruments at the ILO conference in June 2011."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The crisis has wiped out millions of jobs and has aggravated job insecurity and poverty - 17% of EU residents are at risk of poverty."
"In some countries, much domestic work takes place in the shadow economy, under precarious employment conditions and/or as undeclared work."
"The vast majority of the people employed in this sector are women and such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal."
"Domestic workers are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment."
"I welcome the ILO initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by recommendations on decent work for domestic workers."
"The Member States must ratify and implement this convention and recommendations quickly, because its implementation would address the needs of one of the most vulnerable categories of worker and would tackle the problem of undeclared work."
"While most domestic workers are precarious workers, who are often discriminated against and sometimes exploited, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to press for the adoption of a resolution while questioning the European Commission about its actions in relation to this category of workers."
"In June, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which is to have its annual conference, should adopt a convention on domestic workers requiring that they enjoy equal treatment with other workers, and that all the conditions for dignified work are met."
"Through our resolution, we support the ambition displayed by the ILO."
"Note, however, that this is only the first stage: now we must ensure that the Member States ratify this convention once it is adopted."
"I fully support the ILO's initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers."
"Many of these workers are undocumented migrants, which means that they are more likely to be mistreated, paid irregularly or subjected to violence."
"Moreover, undocumented workers do not dare to contact the authorities to seek protection, claim their rights or access health services because they fear being returned to their home country and/or punishment by their employer."
"All domestic workers, regardless of their origin, must have decent access to work."
"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is currently working on drawing up a convention on domestic workers."
"Adopting this ILO convention on domestic workers will be an essential element in ensuring that domestic workers' human, social and employment rights are respected."
"Domestic work makes up between 5% and 9% of total employment."
"This work is often insecure, undervalued and undeclared."
"I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union."
"All those who work with our elderly people must be able to enjoy freedom of association and rest time, and must not be subject to harassment and arbitrary practices."
"That is why we wanted to send a strong message of support to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the trades unions prior to the negotiations on the adoption of these new instruments, which will commence in June at the 100th International Labour conference."
"We regret, however, that the right is happy to express concerns about illegal domestic workers while refusing to recognise that all too often, such situations involve workers with no papers, who are the main victims of precarity and abusive practices."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution on the ILO convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers."
"This convention aims to provide legal recognition for domestic work as work, to extend rights to all domestic workers, and to prevent violations and abuses."
"The European Parliament resolution further calls on the EU countries which are members of the ILO to adopt these instruments at the ILO conference in June 2011 and calls on the EU Member States to ratify and implement the convention and recommendation quickly."
"In some countries, much domestic work takes place in the informal economy, under precarious employment conditions and/or as undeclared work."
"In industrialised countries, domestic work accounts for between 5 and 9% of all employment, with the vast majority of the people employed in that sector being women."
"Indeed, the trend towards an increase in the proportion of non-standard or atypical contracts has a strong gender and generational dimension."
"The adoption, ratification and implementation of the ILO convention can have an impact by reducing the numbers of working poor and improve the position of the large number of women on the labour market."
"In Europe, close to two immigrant women out of three have low-skilled jobs, often in the sector of healthcare or domestic work."
"These women contribute to our economy, yet they suffer very poor working conditions and violations of their most basic rights."
"The International Labour conference, which will take place in June this year, will be the chance for members of the International Labour Organisation to adopt a 'Convention on decent work for domestic workers'."
"This instrument is a step in the right direction for the rights of workers across the world since it extends labour law standards to domestic workers, a category who, until now, were excluded from these standards."
"The ball is now in the court of the Member States, as they have to commit to ratify this convention."
"At European level, we will also need to stop considering separately and systematically the immigration and labour policies."
"It is not right for domestic workers to be coerced into informal work, regardless of their rights, because of an immigration regulation that is too strict and ill-adapted."
"It is well known that domestic work is often insecure and informal, and this insecurity and informality seriously jeopardises the rights of those providing these types of services, even though they participate in the economic activity of their respective countries and should be considered workers like anyone else."
"The level of trust between employer and employee required by such activity makes it advisable not to overload the working relationship with excessive formality but, at the same time, means that the worker should be able to exercise their profession with dignity."
"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention, supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers, could be another step in the right direction."
"This European Parliament resolution addresses the proposed International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention, supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers."
"In June, another ILO conference will take place in Geneva at which the problem of domestic work will be tackled."
"Although the EU is formally barred from participating because it is the Member States that are members, it is aware of its responsibilities to cooperate with the ILO and did not therefore want to fail to contribute to an area that we could say comes under the heading 'fundamental rights'."
"The importance of domestic work is indisputable."
"It is work carried out in the home - childcare and elderly-care facilities - that is included in the Europe 2020 strategy and represents 5% to 9% of all work undertaken in the EU, with the trend being towards growth."
"However, domestic workers - the majority of whom are women and immigrants - are often subjected to exploitation by their bosses, who do not guarantee their social rights."
"That is why I voted for this motion for a resolution."
"The adoption of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention, supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers, is a significant step forward, and we view it positively."
"In the various Member States, as was clear during the debate, the majority of these workers are women, and an increasing percentage of them are illegal immigrants."
"These two groups are the most vulnerable and the most susceptible to violence or sexual abuse."
"It is important that measures be taken in this regard at the upcoming ILO conference."
"The severely exploitative and discriminatory conditions under which they work are well known."
"Many of these domestic workers work in scarcely decent conditions, are subject to intense exploitation, and are not guaranteed rights such as the right to social security, to health and safety protection, to maternity protection, working time limits, to rest, and to freedom of association and representation."
"There is therefore an obvious need to regulate domestic work."
"As such, effective measures to combat insecure jobs, falsified invoices, undeclared work and illegal work urgently need to be taken."
"We consider it important to move towards the adoption of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers, the majority of whom are women, and an increasing percentage of them illegal immigrants."
"These two groups are the most vulnerable and the most susceptible to violence or sexual abuse and it would therefore be very positive if a decisive step were taken on this matter at the upcoming ILO conference."
"The severely exploitative and discriminatory conditions under which many of those engaged in domestic work operate are well known."
"There is therefore an obvious need to regulate domestic work, so that they do not remain exposed to scarcely decent conditions, and are entitled to rights such as the right to social security, to health and safety protection, to maternity protection, to working time limits, to rest, and to freedom of association and representation."
"As such, effective measures to combat insecure jobs, falsified invoices, undeclared work and illegal work urgently need to be taken."
"It is therefore essential to transform all unstable jobs into stable ones with rights and decent wages."
"I fully support the adoption, ratification and implementation of a convention on domestic work by the International Labour Organisation (ILO)."
"For the most part, domestic workers work under precarious conditions, frequently find themselves in legally dubious administrative situations which make their situation even less stable, and are often victims of discrimination, inequality and unfair or abusive treatment."
"However, their services are essential to our society, from infancy to help for elderly people."
"We must obtain a legal framework which enables us to improve the rights of these workers and to promote decent working conditions."
"I voted in favour of this document because the crisis has wiped out millions of jobs and has aggravated job insecurity and poverty - 17% of EU residents are at risk of poverty and 23 million EU residents are unemployed."
"In some countries, much domestic work takes place in the shadow economy, under precarious employment conditions and/or as undeclared work."
"The vast majority of the people employed in this sector are women and such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal."
"Domestic workers' vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment."
"Domestic work should be legally recognised as work, we should give all domestic workers more rights and prevent violations and abuses in order to establish a legal framework for all domestic workers and ensure that their work does not take place outside the regulatory framework."
"The adoption, ratification and implementation of the ILO convention would not only improve the position of a large number of women on the labour market for domestic work by guaranteeing them decent working conditions, but would also enhance their degree of social inclusion."
"It might be necessary to adapt legislation to create flexible and secure contractual arrangements which guarantee equal treatment."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which 'considers that the problem of undeclared work needs to be tackled; states that the domestic work sector is characterised by a high level of informality and undeclared work, that many migrant workers are employed in this sector, and that their rights are often violated; further, considers it essential to combat precarious work in general, given that this problem affects migrant workers in particular, thus worsening their already vulnerable position'."
"The casualisation of male and female workers is at the heart of the oligarchy's domination logic, in Europe as elsewhere."
"Among the various forms of organised insecurity, there is one that is more difficult to eradicate than others: domestic employees."
"This report supports the drafting of an ILO convention to protect the rights of these workers and especially of these hidden female workers."
"It also condemns the growing number of atypical contracts, a sign that work is increasingly becoming insecure."
"I give my vote to this initiative, while deploring the fact that this initiative will have no real impact."
"Given that domestic work accounts for between 5% and 9% of all employment; that the vast majority of the people employed in that sector are women; that such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal; and that domestic workers' vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment, solutions must be found to eliminate this type of situation."
"I therefore welcome this International Labour Organisation convention, which warns of problems involving domestic work."
"With this resolution, the European Parliament intends to express its support for the initiative of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers."
"In fact, migrant workers accepting low-skilled temporary jobs on the edges of the labour market or jobs as domestic workers are exposed to multiple forms of discrimination."
"These workers are often exposed to poverty and irregular conditions, are more likely to be victims of mistreatment, paid irregularly, or subjected to violence or sexual abuse, and are less likely to approach the authorities to seek protection and claim their rights, for fear of being returned to their country of origin and/or punished by their employers."
"This situation is the reason why I voted for the resolution."
"I support the aim of the convention to take steps towards legal recognition of domestic work as a professional activity, extending rights to all domestic workers in order to prevent violations and abuse, and in order to establish a legal framework that guarantees that work cannot take place outside a regulated setting."
"in writing. - I support this resolution on the proposed International Labour Organisation convention on domestic workers."
"A significant part of domestic work is undeclared, precarious and underpaid, and domestic workers, mostly women, are vulnerable to abuse, especially when working abroad."
"The adoption of this ILO convention can help reduce the numbers of working poor, improve working conditions and facilitate the social inclusion of some of the most vulnerable workers."
"We need to apply core labour standards to domestic work and ensure that those performing it are entitled to social security and protection against abusive practices."
"Domestic workers are often penalised for the informal nature of their work."
"Therefore, since they are outside the formal structures of economic activity, there are often restrictions on their rights as workers."
"This situation must be fought determinedly."
"in writing. - With this, the EP: (1) welcomes and supports the ILO initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation for decent work for domestic workers; calls on those EU Member States which are members of the ILO to adopt these instruments at the ILO conference in June 2011; calls on the EU Member States to ratify and implement the convention and recommendation quickly; (2) considers that the adoption, ratification and implementation of an ILO convention on decent work for domestic workers can have an impact by reducing the numbers of working poor; (3) considers that the adoption, ratification and implementation of such a convention would address the needs of one of the most vulnerable categories of workers;"
"Yesterday, Thursday, 12 May, the European Parliament voted through the resolution on the proposed ILO convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers."
"Throughout the world, and in poor countries in particular, domestic services are among the lowest paid jobs."
"These jobs often lack correct contracts and social benefits."
"Highlighting this service sector separately in a recommendation in association with an ILO convention is therefore right and proper."
"The reason why I voted against the European Parliament's resolution is the wording in paragraph 13, in which the EU Member States are called on to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, something that no EU Member State has done as yet."
"In my opinion, the six key UN conventions, which are universal and cover all people, do not need to be supplemented by further instruments."
"There would then be a high risk of the legitimacy of the conventions that have already been adopted being undermined, which is something that I do not wish to be party to."
"I would rather work to increase compliance with the key human rights conventions, the content of which clearly also applies to domestic workers."
"This is something that far too many signatory states seem to be ignoring today."
"Domestic work, often insecure, undervalued and undeclared, represents 5% to 9% of total employment in industrialised countries."
"The majority of these domestic workers are women and immigrants, who are easier to exploit and underpay."
"Adopting this ILO convention on domestic workers will be an essential element in ensuring human and social rights are respected, by granting domestic work the same status as any other work and by providing a legal framework for domestic workers."
"The parliamentary resolution adopted today sends a strong signal to all the Member States for them to sign this convention, which has the power, I sincerely hope, to strengthen workers' social inclusion by granting them access to standard social rights to which all workers are entitled."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament's resolution inviting the Member States to commit regarding the ILO's draft convention on domestic workers."
"This convention will enable us to better fight against the unacceptable working conditions of too many employees in this sector, who are overwhelmingly women and, for many, immigrant workers, in particular, undocumented immigrants."
"It will supplement other conventions of the ILO or of other international organisations."
"The European Parliament also advocated the ratification by the EU and its Member States of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers."
"Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) managed to pass, in particular due to the abstention of a number of socialist MEPs, an amendment which refuses to put immigrant workers, especially undocumented immigrants, on an equal footing with other workers."
"This amendment is consistent with this ever more negative perception of immigrants which fuels xenophobia."
"It will then remain for the provisions of this convention to be actually implemented, which will not be easy, but let us consider nonetheless that the approach is positive."
"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations and acts on behalf of social justice, human rights and workers' rights."
"The main function of the organisation is to establish international labour and social standards."
"For the ILO, 2010 was the year of domestic workers."
"Minimum standards have therefore now been established, as domestic workers form the largest unregulated sector in the world."
"I am voting for this proposal, given that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, especially when treatment failure occurs; that guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials have already been issued in several Member States, which has led to a reduction in the usage of antimicrobials; that the livestock sector - dairy, beef meat, pig and poultry meat, eggs, sheep and goat milk and meat production - plays a major role in the European agricultural economy; and that farmers' primary goal is to keep their livestock healthy and productive through good agricultural practices relating to hygiene, proper feed, appropriate husbandry and responsible animal health management."
"I therefore call on the Commission to develop a broad, multiannual action plan against AMR within the framework of the EU animal health strategy (2011-2015)."
"Antibiotic resistance is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, especially when treatment failure occurs."
"Guidelines on the prudent use of these substances have already been issued in numerous Member States, which has led to a reduction in their usage."
"When used properly, antimicrobials are a useful tool to help farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and ensure their well-being."
"Although these substances are prescribed for use in animals, they affect both humans and animals."
"The ultimate objective of this motion for a resolution is to maintain antimicrobials as an effective tool for combating disease, both in animals and in humans, while restricting their use to cases where it is strictly necessary."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The main aim of farmers is to ensure the health and productivity of their livestock, and it is through employing good agricultural practices that they achieve it."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because it requests that further research be done on antimicrobials and other options, which will help farmers to achieve the abovementioned objectives."
"An agenda must be established for sharing research, knowledge and best practices."
"I support the request that further research be done on animal welfare and agricultural practices, such as improving herd management, early prevention of disease and the breeding of robust varieties of animals."
"It must be ensured, however, that the financial and administrative burden on farmers is not increased because of any increased surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in food producing and companion animals."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major animal health issue for the European livestock sector."
"Given the huge importance of the livestock sector for the European agricultural economy, it is essential to address this issue properly."
"I agree that the Member States should perform regular systematic surveillance and monitoring of AMR in food producing animals, without creating additional financial or administrative burdens for farmers or other animal owners or veterinarians."
"The Food and Veterinary Office and the European Food Safety Authority should carry out further inspections and analyses in this field and submit recommendations."
"I agree that the Commission must hold talks at international level in order to ban antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed, and to bring this matter up in its bilateral negotiations with third countries."
"It is positive that a reduction in antibiotic use has been recorded, and the publication of guidelines on the prudent use of antibiotics in a number of Member States has contributed to this."
"Any decision leading to the administration of antimicrobials, whether to humans or animals, should be carefully considered and take into account the potential threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)."
"In fact, this resistance affects both humans and animals, and can be transmitted from human to animal and vice versa."
"I am well aware that AMR in humans is often caused by inadequate doses of antibiotic medicines and incorrect treatments, but it can also be through the transmission, via animals, of pathogenic bacteria carrying AMR genes, with serious consequences for public and animal health."
"We are therefore faced with a truly cross-cutting issue requiring a coordinated approach at EU level that must seek to ensure that antimicrobials can remain an effective tool for combating disease, in both people and animals, must encourage prudent and responsible usage, and must limit any recourse to them to cases where it is strictly necessary."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, especially at a time when guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials have already been issued in several Member States, which has led to a reduction in the usage of these substances."
"Since farmers' primary goal is to keep their livestock healthy and productive through good agricultural practices (hygiene, proper feed, appropriate husbandry, responsible animal health management), I think that more research needs to be carried out on the new antimicrobials, as well as on other alternatives (vaccination, biosecurity, breeding for resistance) and on evidence-based strategies for avoiding and controlling infectious diseases in animals, which are deployed in the European Union's research framework programmes."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution on antibiotic resistance because I believe that the Commission and the Member States need to adopt measures to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animals, given that the use of antibiotics in animal feed also contributes to antibiotic resistance in humans."
"Resistance to antibiotics is a serious problem affecting the livestock industry, so I share the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's concerns on this issue and agree with its proposals, not just to reduce animals' resistance to treatment with antibiotics, but also to encourage other means of combating animal diseases that do not necessarily involve the use of antibiotics."
"As regards the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed, I would draw attention to the fact that this endangers the health, not only of the animals, which become resistant to the antibiotics, but also of people, as products of animal origin enter the food chain, thereby affecting humans."
"A study of the possibility of banning the use of antimicrobials in animal feed is therefore urgently needed, as is promotion of measures to reduce resistance to antibiotics, thereby ensuring better animal health and increased food safety."
"This European Parliament resolution tackles the problem of animal resistance to antibiotics, which is a situation with disastrous consequences."
"This issue has implications in terms of human health, particularly for those who work with these animals, but also of economics, as the competitive future of EU animal husbandry is at stake."
"Parliament has already debated this issue more than once and has adopted a number of initiatives, like the database, which should be continuously updated."
"However, the time has come to move from words to actions so that the legislation in force ceases to be a dead letter."
"Therefore, it is essential that the new common agricultural policy (CAP) takes this problem into account and encourages good animal husbandry practices."
"As such, I voted for this joint motion for a resolution, adopted by a broad majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it is a very balanced text whose proposals not only protect human health and defend animal welfare, but also ensure companies' viability."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, covering dairy, beef, pig and poultry meat, eggs, sheep and goat milk and meat production."
"Antimicrobials, when used properly, are a useful tool to help farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive."
"AMR in humans is often caused by inadequate doses of antibiotic medicines."
"Transmission of pathogenic bacteria constitutes a particular threat to farmers and farm workers, who are in a daily contact with animals."
"This report contributes to orienting joint data collection activities in this area, analysing results and proposing solutions."
"Its aim is to create a full picture of when, where, how and on which animals the antimicrobials are actually used today, without creating additional financial or administrative burdens for farmers or other animal owners, taking into account the fact that farming practice and intensity is different from one Member State to another."
"We would stress the importance of developing systems for animal husbandry, which reduce the need for antimicrobials to be prescribed, as well as research into new antimicrobials."
"We consider the content of the resolution positive, as it is oriented towards the prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, covering dairy, beef, pig and poultry meat, eggs, and sheep and goat milk and meat production."
"Antimicrobials, when used properly, are a useful tool to help farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive."
"AMR in humans is often caused by inadequate doses of antibiotic medicines, whose transmission of pathogenic bacteria constitutes a particular threat to farmers and farm workers, who are in daily contact with animals."
"This document contributes to orienting joint data collection activities in this area, analysing their results and proposing their respective solutions."
"As such, its aim is to create a full picture of when, where, how and on which animals the antimicrobials are actually used today, without creating additional financial or administrative burdens for farmers or other animal owners, taking into account the fact that farming practice and intensity is different from one Member State to another."
"It is also important to undertake research into new antimicrobials, as well as into other alternatives, and we would stress the importance of developing effective systems for animal husbandry which reduce the need for antimicrobials to be prescribed."
"I voted in favour of this document because the ultimate objective is to maintain antimicrobials as an effective tool to combat disease, both in animals and in humans, while only using antimicrobials when absolutely necessary."
"In my opinion, we need to establish good practices for animal husbandry which minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)."
"These practices should apply, in particular, to young animals which are brought together from different breeders and thus increase the risk of communicable diseases."
"The Commission should work towards an international ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed, and bring this matter up in its bilateral negotiations with third countries such as the United States."
"We must emphasise the logical connection between animal health and the use of antimicrobials, as well as the link between animal health and human health."
"Today, the most important thing is for us to ensure a maximum level of food safety."
"For a long time, antibiotics were seen as a wonder drug that cured infectious diseases."
"In most European countries, antibiotics are the most-used class of drugs after analgesics."
"Around 50% of the antibiotics prescribed in Europe are used in veterinary medicine."
"If antibiotics were not used, animal diseases and epizootics could quickly spread and become epidemics, causing enormous economic damage."
"Unfortunately, the uncontrolled use of antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine comes at a very high cost."
"The excessive use of antibiotics leads to resistance and adaptation among pathogens."
"Many of the well-known antibiotics have today become either ineffective or unreliable."
"I therefore strongly endorse the resolution of this House that expressly calls on the Commission and the Member States to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance amongst animals in a responsible way."
"in writing. - This resolution recognises that antimicrobials, when used properly, are a useful tool to help farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and to ensure the animals' well-being."
"However, it also acknowledges the need for tight control and monitoring, and I was therefore able to vote for it."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, especially when treatment failure occurs."
"Guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials have already been issued in several Member States, which has led to a reduction in the use of antimicrobials."
"Despite positive results, there is still much to be done in relation to this problem."
"That is why common European policies leading to the eradication of this problem are needed."
"Today, Parliament adopted an important decision on antibiotic resistance."
"In my opinion, it is very important to collect and analyse information on the use of animal health products, including antibiotic substances."
"It is also necessary to ensure that these products are used effectively and moderately and do not pose a risk to the effectiveness of measures for combating human illnesses when antibiotic agents are chosen as a treatment in medicine."
"Although, from 2005-2009 in the EU, tests for monitoring the residues of antibacterial agents in animals and animal foodstuffs show positive results, we can still say that there is no controlled trend towards reduction, only fragmented fluctuations."
"Particularly worrying is the fact that according to 2009 data, the majority of discrepancies as regards antibiotic agents were found in honey, rabbit and farmed fish samples, in other words, products that are frequently considered to be valuable foodstuffs and are often used in Europeans' daily diet."
"Thus, the aim of carefully applying antimicrobial treatment and implementing comprehensive monitoring in order to better coordinate sources of human and veterinary research is very important for guaranteeing human health and animal welfare."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Every year, 25 000 people die across Europe from causes linked to or associated with antimicrobial resistance."
"Animals and food of animal origin could play a role in the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to people."
"This is why antibiotics need to be used with caution in animal husbandry."
"The measures proposed by this resolution on providing more information to vets and farmers must be implemented as vigorously as possible."
"The resolution on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) comes at a time when AMR represents an animal health problem for the European livestock sector, which needs to be able to rely on antimicrobial treatments being safe and effective in the near future."
"The administration of antimicrobials to animals has to take into account the potential threat of AMR in humans, frequently caused by inadequate doses of antibiotic medicines, by incorrect treatments and through the constant exposure of pathogens to antimicrobial agents in hospitals."
"I voted for the report because the transmission of pathogenic bacteria carrying AMR genes constitutes a particular threat to people, through the intake of said bacteria and/or through daily contact with animals."
"I believe that commitment to research is essential, as it contributes to the development of antimicrobials as an effective tool in the fight against diseases afflicting both people and animals."
"However, the use of antimicrobials should be limited to cases where it is strictly necessary."
"in writing. - Antibiotic resistance is a serious public health issue."
"Antimicrobial administration to both humans and livestock entails the risk of resistance when used incorrectly and at inadequate doses."
"Antimicrobial resistance can be transmitted from humans to animals and vice versa."
"Hospital patients and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to resistant bacteria."
"There is a need for better coordination of human and veterinarian research on resistance, as well as further research on new antibiotics, alternative treatments and animal disease prevention and control practices."
"Animal husbandry plays a key role in the European economy."
"Antibiotics are used frequently to ensure animal health."
"The problem that can arise is that both humans and animals can develop antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the human health impact of which could be serious."
"It is therefore necessary to adopt appropriate strategies as a precaution against such risks."
"Welcomes the efforts made by the Commission and its agencies as regards joint data collection activities in this field, in particular, the initiative in 2009 to create ESVAC (European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption); regrets that not all Member States have yet joined the ESVAC network and calls on more countries to do so; calls on the Commission to provide the ESVAC network with sufficient financial resources to perform its tasks; calls on the Commission to without delay provide an adequate legal framework in order to give Member States the authority to perform an efficient data collection; 2. Calls on the Commission to strive for a data collection which is harmonised and comparable, also with activities undertaken in third countries such as the United States."
"Antibiotics are naturally occurring metabolic products of fungi or bacteria that are used to counter bacterial infections."
"Amongst other uses, they are fed to animals on a preventative basis."
"Resistance means the loss of an antibiotic's ability to kill bacteria or inhibit their growth."
"In order to prevent this, it is necessary to follow medical instructions."
"Resistant animal germs can be passed on to humans, however, and represent a major health risk - the result may even be antibiotic resistance in humans."
"It was therefore only right to vote in favour of this report in order to finally promote livestock production that manages without antimicrobial substances."
"It is common knowledge that, just like humans, animals that are given antibiotics are sometimes resistant to their effect."
"This resistance may be transferred from animals to humans, and thereby pose a risk to health, or complicate the treatment of some diseases."
"It is therefore important to monitor in detail the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and the keeping of pets."
"This is about consumer protection and the security of food production, which must be ensured to an equally high standard in all EU Member States."
"It is appropriate for a European Parliament made up of the elected representatives of the people to demand that the Commission take action."
"We can react rapidly and effectively only if we know the true situation."
"I have therefore supported the report submitted and I expect the Commission to submit in the near future a proposal for measures to monitor the use of antibiotics in the animal husbandry sector."
"I am voting for this report because culture can be a key element in international relations by contributing to development, inclusion, democracy and conflict prevention."
"It should therefore be included in the development of the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"In this new digital economy, the cultural and creative industries (CCIs) represent great potential and are capable of encouraging the expression of European cultural diversity and the spread of economic and social progress."
"In addition, culture and creativity are the keys to safeguarding and enhancing our cultural heritage and landscapes and are useful in raising the cultural level of citizens."
"We should not underestimate the fact that these industries make up one of the most dynamic sectors in Europe and contribute 2.6% of EU gross domestic product by offering quality employment to some 5 million European citizens."
"With the Green Paper published by the Commission one year ago, the cultural and creative industries obtained their rightful recognition, carving out a crucial role in a European vision of culture based on the information society, innovation and entrepreneurship."
"Unfortunately, a lack of investment, under-capitalisation of companies, the lack of a regulatory framework to set aside hurdles to the mobility of artists and creatives and the increasing prevalence of piracy are some of the factors that weaken the establishment of a European cultural space."
"We must not forget that the worldwide success of European industry is founded on the great professionalism and creativity of our artists, who should be protected and encouraged via tangible incentives to keep up their good work."
"The fundamental aspect of European culture is that it is not intended to be promoted in external relations in a simplified way, but as something vibrant and alive thanks to its particular features."
"Just as we talk about European values, rights and freedoms, we must also talk about Europe's cultures, their diversity, creative plurality and the role of European ambassador which each creative element of national culture can play to promote Europe as a whole."
"Before we start promoting these cultures outside Europe, even we ourselves have to want to become familiarised with all those cultural elements which are typical of Europe."
"In this respect, I believe that every citizen of the European Union is the best ambassador for Europe's cultures."
"The only condition is that they should be offered beforehand the simplest possible opportunity to find out about the cultural wealth in the area where they live."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The EU is a culturally diverse community of values in which successive EU enlargements, personal mobility in the shared European area, established and new migratory flows and exchanges of all kinds with the rest of the world help foster that cultural diversity."
"Culture plays a role in bilateral agreements on development and trade, and through measures such as the European instruments for Development Cooperation, for Stability, for Democracy and Human Rights and for Pre-Accession, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the Eastern Partnership, the Union for the Mediterranean and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which mostly allocate resources to various cultural programmes."
"I agree that there is a need to strengthen cultural and educational exchanges with third countries, which would strengthen civil society, foster democratisation and good governance, promote human rights and fundamental freedoms and provide building blocks for lasting cooperation."
"This report sends a clear message: the European Union must incorporate a consistent and coordinated cultural strategy into its foreign policy."
"The bonds that unite more specifically Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean are going through deep changes."
"A wind of freedom is blowing on the Arab world."
"Culture is a significant asset."
"It contributes to a lively and long-lasting democracy."
"Cultural and educational exchanges encourage the emergence of an organised civil society."
"Cultural cooperation is also one of the keys to the Union's success for the Mediterranean."
"It leads nations to share and interact with one another, respect and better understand each other every day."
"It was important for the European Parliament to provide a strong reminder of how much we must promote diversity, heritage and cultural exchanges in all the EU's external actions."
"As a creator of integration, tolerance and mutual comprehension, culture is an essential component of our societies which we must promote in our diplomatic efforts in favour of human rights and democracy."
"This report emphasises, however, that the cultural dimension of external actions still remains underdeveloped and undercoordinated, and that it is necessary to adopt a common and coherent strategy in this area."
"We have also renewed our support for a free Internet by condemning Internet censorship and the threats that it poses to human rights, as well as to access to and sharing of global cultural heritage."
"While European citizens share a range of common cultural values, we will be best placed to serve European interests if we speak with a common voice."
"The European Union is known for its variety of cultural forms."
"In my opinion, European values such as respect for human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms, are also conveyed by our cultural products."
"Knowledge and international skills, as indicated in the EU 2020 strategy, are critical to the education systems."
"Multilingualism, e-skills and cultural awareness allow us to seize many opportunities offered by today's global labour market."
"Culture should therefore be integrated across the board in the wide spectrum of actions that make up the EU's foreign policy."
"A coherent, coordinated EU strategy on culture in the EU's external actions does not currently exist."
"We also see fragmentation and diffusion, not only between Member States, but also between different departments and institutions of the European Union."
"This fragmentation, without a common strategy, prevents the efficient use of resources and budget allocations for the cultural sector."
"I therefore urge the Commission to consider the integration and simplification of culture both in the EU's external actions and within the European institutions."
"I support this report by my group colleague because it underlines the cross-cutting nature and the importance of culture in all aspects of life, and argues that culture needs to be taken into consideration in all EU external policies."
"I consider the cultural aspect of European policies which strives for increased European cohesion important."
"I therefore welcome all cultural programmes whose objective is to create a European identity from shared values and mutual understanding."
"As such, I believe in the power that certain cultural initiatives can have on relations within the Union, as well as diplomatic relations with third countries."
"The cultural elements of the various countries can be used as bridges towards peaceful cooperation with a view to stability."
"in writing. - The cultural dimensions of EU external actions should not be overstated, and it is important that Commissioner Ashton continues to build this into her work with the EEAS."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon led to the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS), whose activities should include a coordinated and consistent cultural diplomacy strategy."
"This report, which I support in general, is on this important issue."
"In fact, many of the proposals included in this report, such as promoting exchanges for young people and strengthening ties with civil society organisations in third countries, are proposals that I advocated in my report on the Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Southern Dimension and were adopted by this House."
"From this report, I would also stress the respect for the preservation/promotion of linguistic/cultural richness in every Member State; the importance of disseminating European cultural values as a means of promoting fundamental rights, democracy and good governance; and, finally, the importance of there being a cultural 'attaché' in each of the EU's representations abroad."
"There are many who wonder whether there is such a thing as a European culture, often contrasting it with a Europe of cultures or a 'Europeanisation' of cultures."
"For those, and I am one of them, who think that Europe has an identity, values, the answer is obvious: there is indeed a European cultural identity."
"It is this cultural dimension that the EU should take more into account in its diplomatic efforts, particularly with a view to promoting human rights, democracy and development in third countries."
"To achieve this, the High-Representative should set up a 'Cultural diplomacy' Directorate-General within the European External Action Service, and appoint someone to be responsible for cultural relations and for promoting European culture in every EU representation in third countries."
"At the same time, we should consider introducing cultural visas for artists and for all those working in the cultural sector."
"As well as an economic power, the European Union is also a cultural power whose influence goes far beyond its borders."
"The fact that various countries have traditional historical ties with European Member States strengthens Europe's ability to permeate other cultures and to make itself understood in other parts of the world."
"The importance of the factor of language as a vehicle for maintaining and deepening these contacts cannot be overstated."
"I regret that, despite all the declarations of intent, the European Union continues not to understand the extent to which it should promote the teaching of the European languages that are particularly suitable for communication in its institutions."
"Instead, the EU has chosen an inward-looking language policy."
"I should like to see this trend reversed."
"A foreign policy like the one that the Union is proposing to develop cannot neglect the cultural dimension, but rather must keep it in mind as an asset; as a value that is not always tangible but is particularly important in a world increasingly susceptible to the 'soft power' of states and international organisations."
"The European External Action Service (EEAS) will have an important role to play in this regard."
"I hope it will be up to the challenge."
"This report, by Mrs Schaake, is on the cultural dimensions of the European Union's external actions."
"Although it may seem strange to talk about culture, which is a non-essential good, when many Europeans are faced daily with problems obtaining goods essential to their survival, we cannot neglect it: instead, we must think that, in addition to being fundamental to our quality of life, it can and must be an opportunity for economic development and creating jobs for young people, as well as being, obviously, a factor of unity and cohesion between peoples."
"The EU has to be a community of cultural values in which diversity is an asset, and a factor in unity and cohesion, or, as the rapporteur puts it, 'an instrument for global peace and stability'."
"We therefore urgently need to review the lack of a foreign policy on culture."
"I am voting for this report, as I agree with its proposals and hope that culture helps find solutions for emerging from the crisis, and that it will be an asset to the welfare of the European public."
"This report confirms the understanding of culture current in the European Union: an exploitative vision of culture that considers it at the service of foreign policy through the concept of cultural diplomacy."
"In other words, culture is seen as a sort of vanguard for advancing and communicating the interests of the European Union and the Member States in the world (point 22), and look where this vision is headed: for promoting international trade (point 23)."
"How often is this not synonymous with policies and practices that cancel out or disrespect each country's identity and cultures?"
"This report also has an underlying fallacy that keeps cropping up in EU discourse on culture: that there is a single European identity and a single European culture, and, even more so, that it is based on values like liberty, democracy, tolerance and solidarity."
"Culture, like all historical phenomena, is not founded on any homogenous and shared identity: quite the contrary, it is the expression of antagonisms, conflicts and situations of cultural domination."
"European culture is, as is well known, indebted to many cultures in various parts of the world, like the people subjected to European colonialism, for example."
"This is a report that misrepresents and exploits the notion of culture."
"This report confirms the understanding of culture current in the European Union: an exploitative vision of culture that considers it at the service of foreign policy through the concept of cultural diplomacy."
"In other words, culture is seen as a sort of vanguard for advancing and communicating the interests of the European Union and the Member States, and promoting international trade."
"How often is this not synonymous with policies and practices that cancel out or disrespect each country's identity and cultures?"

"Culture, like all historical phenomena, is not founded on any homogenous and shared identity: quite the contrary, it is the expression of antagonisms, conflicts and situations of cultural domination."
"European culture is, as is well known, indebted to many cultures in various parts of the world, like the people subjected to European colonialism, for example."
"The European Union cannot put our cultural diversity at risk, or misrepresent and exploit the notion of culture"
"I voted in favour of this resolution because cultural diplomacy is a cornerstone for building trust and long lasting relations with citizens in third countries."
"Culture should be a vital and horizontally integrated element among the broad spectrum of external policies which make up the EU's foreign policy: from the EU's trade relations to its enlargement and neighbourhood policy, to its development cooperation policy and its common foreign and security policy."
"Culture equally has economic value: Europe's cultural industries contribute to European entrepreneurship, innovation and business and the EU's diverse cultural landscape makes it the most attractive global tourist destination in the world."
"A vibrant cultural climate makes living in the EU attractive for businesses and people alike."
"A coherent, coordinated EU strategy on culture in the EU's external actions does not currently exist and needs to be developed."
"It is not a luxury but a necessity to sustain and foster Europe's attractiveness in a globally connected and competitive environment."
"Fragmentation and diffusion is seen not only among Member States, but also between different departments and institutions within the EU."
"This fragmentation without a common strategy hampers the full and efficient use of cultural resources and budgets."
"Consequently, this strategy is absolutely essential for the EU."
"Europe is the cradle of an exceptionally rich and varied culture."
"The European Union should make use of this heritage in the promotion of integration and cooperation in countries which do not belong to the Union."
"We should not forget that the European Union is made up of 27 very different Member States."
"It is important that we cultivate and preserve this multiculturality."
"I agree that a common European policy requires the development of a coherent strategy on external cultural actions."
"It is important for Europe to make good use of its potential in the process of promoting itself in the world."
"'United in Diversity' is the motto that we all share as European citizens and that represents the sense of belonging to a great European community: a crossroads of peoples, cultures and customs that are united despite their economic, religious and other differences."
"My support for Mrs Schaake's report is dictated precisely by the boost that we need to give to reinforcing this shared awareness."
"Culture should play a unifying role externally as well as internally, and therefore, in the relations of the Secretariat for Economic Monitoring (SEAE), European culture could be the standard-bearer of European values, which, through dialogue with cultures outside Europe, should contribute to peaceful cooperation and constructive understanding between peoples."
"I would like to express my approval for the inclusion of cultural matters in the actions of EU diplomacy."
"It is important for the world to experience the culture of the EU's Member States in the diversity of its content and form."
"Personally, I hope this presentation will be geographically balanced in character, so that the culture of each of the Member States will be present in the right proportion."
"To this end, the Commission should present a proposal for such actions, which will then be recast as an official document."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Europe is a community of freedom, responsibilities and democratic values."
"Culture, identity, values and the EU's position on the global stage are intertwined."
"European interests are served when cultural aspects are strategically devised through cooperation and partnership: both through cultural programmes and when cultural aspects are an integral part of economic, foreign and security and development policies."
"Through the sharing of literature, film, music and heritage, doors of understanding are opened and bridges between people are built."
"European identity in all its diversity, as well as European values, are manifested through these cultural expressions."
"In addition, the EU has important experiences to share when it comes to overcoming conflict and building stability through shared interest and mutual understanding."
"The report on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries is closely connected in many respects with the report on the Innovation Union."
"I would like, in particular, to draw attention to the significance that is given to the education of citizens, involving, among other things, a better understanding of the issue and respect for the protection of works involving intellectual property rights."
"We must strongly support and develop this broadly neglected area not just of education but also of training, both at the EU level and where Member States are concerned."
"I have reservations over the current labelling of cultural works as goods and services."
"This is misleading and can be seen as a manifestation of economic neoliberalism in the cultural sphere."
"For example, a literary work, or even a work of art or music is, first and foremost, an essential manifestation of the talent of the artist and a social response."
"It is not only philistine but also aberrant to regard them merely as goods or services."
"Unfortunately, a coherent, coordinated strategy on the role of culture in the EU's external actions does not currently exist."
"As is well known, our interests can be best served when we speak with one voice."
"Our common foreign policy must be based on cultural diplomacy as Europe's position in the world can be strengthened through culture, as an integral part of its economic, development and security policies."
"We will provide a better understanding of our continent by means of distributing films, music and literature."
"Furthermore, the EU's diverse cultural landscape gives us the distinction of being the most attractive tourist destination in the world."
"I welcome the concrete suggestions presented in this report for the involvement of civil society, artists, educators, students and entrepreneurs in shaping the content of external cultural relations."
"At the same time, we absolutely need to take into account the huge potential offered by new technologies, which are both a source of information and a channel facilitating the freedom of expression."
"I think that it would be useful for the European Parliament to include culture on the agenda of discussions with other parliaments in the world, in order to help establish a general practice for European external action."
"Europe is a community of freedom, responsibilities and democratic values."
"Culture, identity, values and the EU's position on the global stage are intertwined."
"European interests are served when cultural aspects are strategically devised through cooperation and partnership, both through cultural programmes, and when cultural aspects are an integral part of economic, foreign and security and development policies."
"Through the sharing of literature, film, music and heritage, doors of understanding are opened and bridges between people are built."
"European identity, in all its diversity, as well as European values, are manifested through these cultural expressions."
"In the development of the European External Action Service (EEAS), it is important to explore and anchor the role culture has and should have in the EU's external actions."
"Mainstreaming culture can lead to mutual understanding, peaceful cooperation and stability, as well as to economic benefits."
"If globalisation has incontrovertibly favoured the proliferation of exchanges, we must fight against the danger of a uniformity of cultures."
"Culture is a vector of openness and a motor of democracies, counteracting every nationalist reaction, racist temptation and the exclusions that are nourished by the economic and financial, and climate and food crises."
"Cultures have a calling to enrich one another in a spirit of mutual respect."
"They are a source of inexhaustible renewable energy."
"Most of the time, cultural creation describes or expresses a vision, a commitment, a taking of sides that can be pertinent or impertinent."
"It represents the exercising of a right, including the right to denounce."
"We have a great need of artists, of their critical view of the world, of their role as the educators of our societies."
"They anticipate the future and forecast the evolution of society, because they see more quickly and further than politicians."
"We must work to create a pluralistic world that keeps its aptitude for creation intact and that can give rise to the new and to diversity."
"We must rethink the system of global governance."
"We must create a new political space of global dimensions, taking account of the political dimension of cultural diversity."
"Europe's cultural riches represent a precious commodity that it is important to preserve."
"We always hear that cultural diversity must be promoted."
"We have hitherto been concentrating far too much on promoting cultural diversity via the Muslim immigrant population without ensuring that our own culture, in turn, is recognised in the countries of the Islamic world."
"If European cultural aspects are to be more prominently included, as is proposed, as an integral part of economic, foreign, security and development policy, it depends on what explicit form this is to be given."
"Certainly, there is no reason to oppose an exchange of literature, film, music and the like, but the expectations in respect of the Islamic world must not be overly inflated - you only need think of the ban on music, which stems from the Koran."
"What will be most important is to keep Christian roots in mind and to give greater priority in foreign and development policy to the protection of Christians in other countries, as they are, in the end, the most persecuted minority around the globe."
"There can be no doubt that cultural diplomacy helps to build trust and cultivate lasting relations between citizens of the EU and citizens of third countries, and there can be no doubt that Europe's comparative advantage in the culture sector is strong and is therefore a valuable political tool for its foreign policy."
"New technologies bring new opportunities to spread the European cultural heritage and strengthen transnational ties."
"As the Internet is a global meeting place, the EU should develop specific policies to promote European culture."
"The Europeana website is a move in this direction; unfortunately, however, it has not realised its potential as yet."
"Nor should the contribution of culture to the economies of the European countries be overlooked."
"It is estimated to account for 2.6% of European GDP at present."
"Clearly, countries with a rich history, tradition and culture, such as Greece, have nothing to lose by promoting their cultural heritage and values."
"This report is on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions."
"I agree with the rapporteur in that we need a common strategy for the cultural dimension."
"It is not a question of more investment but rather one of better investment."
"To promote culture is to promote democracy."
"The proposed coordination may help ensure the more efficient use of resources, especially at a time when budget cuts are being made, particularly in the cultural sector."
"The existing European Union National Institutes for Culture network should function as an important partner for the sector."
"The members of this network have significant experience, not only of working in the field, but also of organising cultural activities with appropriate distance from the governments, which is crucial in this sector."
"In addition to coordination, there is also cultural diplomacy at Member State level."
"However, there are many third countries seeking to specifically address the European Union and not solely the individual Member States."
"As such, only a common strategy will prevent the existing fragmentation, which impedes the complete and efficient use of the resources and budgets dedicated to culture."
"For all these reasons, I voted for this report."
"Culture plays an extremely important role in the European Union, which is an area aiming to be 'united in diversity'."
"First of all, we should stress its undeniable integrationist aspect, which enables the existence of shared areas: that is, points at which people with different cultural perspectives find themselves with shared representation."
"It is no accident that the report's explanatory statement begins with an interesting citation: 'Rock and roll, culturally speaking, was a decisive element in loosening up communist societies and bringing them closer to a world of freedom' (Andras Simonyi)."
"Secondly, the undeniable economic impact that could result from a commitment to disseminating European culture should be stressed."
"It is, then, a case of disseminating and protecting European values at global level, and of guaranteeing, on the widest possible range of levels, respect for their core aspects, such as freedom of expression on the Internet."
"Those are the reasons why I am voting in favour."
"In voting for the report by Mrs Schaake, I am making a plea for the institution of a genuine European cultural diplomacy in order to promote our values outside the EU."
"Thinking of culture as a strategic element of foreign policy would, in fact, enable Europe to make up the deficit with regard to certain states."
"China, in particular, invests heavily in cultural diplomacy to improve its image and attract tourists."
"Europe must do the same if it is to continue playing a major role on the world stage."
"This report contains several proposals to achieve this: the proposal to designate a person in every EU representation in third countries, for example, to coordinate cultural relations and interaction between the EU and those countries, or the proposal that the draft European External Action Service (EEAS) organisational chart contain posts tailored to cultural aspects and that a coordination unit be set up."
"Moreover, it seems opportune that third countries be involved to a greater extent in EU programmes devoted to culture as much as mobility, youth, education and training: the accessibility to these programmes on the part of young nationals of those countries must be facilitated."
"in writing. - The report did envisage at first the field of external relations at the EU level almost exclusively under the new media perspectives."
"This is still quite present, as well as the idea that the EU should export its culture."
"The Greens insisted on the promotion of 'cultural cooperation' instead."
"Some of the recommendations adopted in the Committee on Culture and Education do not really create something new, like an information website on EU culture programmes and external relations, together with the calendar of EU events in the whole world plus contacts with Civil Society."
"Some articles, like Article 44 on supporting national efforts to implement the protection and preservation of cultural heritage, illegal trade of heritage or products of cultural creation, do not give much sense to the issue itself."
"In a nutshell, the report fails really to tackle the issue and assembles bits and pieces alongside the present existing possibilities to put culture on the agenda both for the EU and between the EU and third countries."
"It is a new chapter in an effort to fully use culture as a tool for peace."
"The sharing of cultural heritage between individuals is important both within the EU, for the consolidation of a European identity, and in terms of the Union's relations with third countries."
"This is why I support strengthening external action in that direction."
"Resources for culture are often scattered across a host of projects."
"Efficient use of these funds is further hampered by political fragmentation."
"We therefore need the European External Action Service to immediately adopt a coherent and unified strategy of cultural diplomacy, including the appointment of an EU special representative to third countries."
"Lastly, I believe that we should increasingly emphasise the use of new technologies, which can increase the number of ways to access cultural content."
"It is essential for the EU to play a leading role in this context, developing definite policies that can protect the Internet against forms of censure typical of repressive regimes."
"In 1990, in his book Bound to Lead, the eminent American professor, Joseph Nye, invented the concept of 'soft power'."
"What does it mean?"
"Soft power is the capacity an international player has to influence others by non-coercive means, such as cultural dynamism."
"Why, after a quarter of a century, does the United States remain the superpower that we know it to be?"
"Because, besides its military arsenal, it succeeds in exporting its culture and its ideas and in making them attractive."
"Europe must do the same; it must defend its cultural model and its values on the international stage."
"Thanks to this report, the European Union is taking stock of the influence Europe can have if it succeeds in adding a cultural dimension to its diplomacy."
"I therefore support the recommendations contained in this report."
"It is the case that, in waiting for the implementation of a genuine common diplomacy and a genuine European defence policy, European soft power and its cultural diplomacy are some of the few means of influence at our disposal."
"I endorsed the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions."
"In particular, I would like to stress the necessity of conducting a review of existing programmes with a cultural component and of drafting a Green Paper and a communication from the Commission outlining concrete policies for the role of culture in the EU's external actions."
"Currently, cultural cooperation of Member States with third countries takes place on a bilateral basis."
"There is a lack of shared and coordinated principles and actions, which renders it impossible to make effective use of Europe's cultural resources and the Union's creative potential."
"A common strategy can foster the development of Europe's cultural resources, the forging and deepening of social relations, the exchange of good practices and improvement of the EU's cultural position in the international arena."
"I strongly support inclusion of cultural aspects in the draft organisation chart of the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"It is also important to provide for the appropriate training of EEAS staff with regard to cultural and digital aspects."
"Culture is also an important factor in the fight for human rights and the support of democracy."
"Cooperation in this area will help to establish dialogue with societies from different cultures."
"I am also a supporter of what is called 'brand Europe', and the development and promotion of this, in such areas as support for talent, tourism and the propagation of universal values, for example, should be based on closer collaboration between the EU's Member States."
"I am pleased that the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions, which affirms that culture must be at the heart of European diplomacy, has been adopted."
"For all their diversity, Europeans share a great number of strong values, such as respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, which must be extended to the international stage."
"This 'brand Europe' must be borne by true ambassadors."
"I also welcome the new proposals, such as creating a cultural division within the European External Action Service or the nomination of a 'cultural attaché' for every Member State."
"It is by coordinating national initiatives that a cultural Europe will be able to emerge."
"The development of new information technologies is making culture accessible to the greatest number."
"The European Union must, in my opinion, seize this opportunity to assert its cultural uniqueness and encourage creativity."
"I am bound to vote in favour of this report, which regards our culture no longer as a heritage of the past but as one of the driving forces of the European diplomacy of tomorrow."
"I am voting for this proposal as I believe there is a need for EU-wide momentum to encourage cultural and creative industries (CCIs), which is why they must adopt innovative economic models and have access to new, legal on-line service provision."
"It is therefore necessary to create a genuine single market for on-line content and services, take specific measures aimed at increasing the role of the CCIs as catalysts for innovation and structural change, bring together actors at regional, national and European level and create new products and services to generate growth and jobs."
"In Europe, the cultural sector plays a key role and attracts citizens, enterprises and investment, thereby highlighting Europe as a dynamic, stimulating place to live and work."
"An energetic, growing cultural sector is clearly necessary for Europe's success as a creative, knowledge-based economy."
"The cultural sector also attracts well-qualified, creative people."
"Cultural and creative industries are currently also important drivers of economic and social innovation in many other sectors."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"Cultural and creative industries (CCIs) should be at the centre of a new European policy agenda, in line with the economic needs of the sector and measures aimed at adapting to innovations in the digital age."
"I agree that in order to increase this sector's potential, the European Digital Agenda initiative must be implemented successfully in order to enable European CCIs to benefit fully from, and to adapt successfully to, all the opportunities created by far-reaching, high-speed broadband and by new wireless technologies."
"It is very important to expand the European digital library and develop it as a focal point for Europe's cultural heritage and creativity and to protect and support its cultural heritage."
"The cultural and creative industries are crucial for European citizens because of their economic and cultural nature."
"This is because these industries, as well as participating in the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity and the development of a European cultural heritage, also contribute to economic development by stimulating jobs, economic growth and wealth creation."
"Through this vote, we are clearly committing ourselves to a greater recognition of the cultural sector by emphasising that its potential remains great because it always copes with legal or economic obstacles."
"In order to increase this potential, therefore, we are proposing concrete solutions such as a pan-European licensing system and the improvement of access to credit and microfinancing."
"We also note the considerable progress that the Internet represents for our societies, even if it brings new challenges such as guaranteeing access for all and the economic model of the cultural sector."
"Thus, the European Parliament, which is aware of the crucial role of culture in European society, has made a clear appeal for increasing support for cultural actors."
"It is important to unlock the potential of cultural and creative industries (CCIs)."
"We need to analyse CCIs and the impact of their activities on the European economy, identifying, defining and describing them each in turn, in order to highlight their characteristics, better understand their goals and problems and implement more effective measures."
"I voted in favour of this report, which aims to acknowledge and enhance the economic and social importance of the cultural and creative industries (CCIs)."
"Focusing EU attention on these industries and organising their potential through a coherent strategy, including funding, meets at least two of the priorities that Lega Nord has always upheld."
"These are, firstly, the promotion and revival of local cultural heritage, which may be linguistic, musical, architectural or artistic in the broadest sense, in order to safeguard diversity and individuality of intellectual horizons in an age of generalisation, or rather trivialisation and devaluation of the cultural message."
"Secondly, an institutional commitment to cultural and creative industries would enable talented young people to constructively channel their skills and ambitions, offering them launch platforms, some professional, that would then lead to new job opportunities, while saving them from frittering away their talents in areas that are culturally stagnant or simply unfit for purpose."
"I therefore support the report in question."
"The cultural sector plays a crucial role in Europe and is a source of attraction for ordinary people, businesses and investment, thereby highlighting Europe as a dynamic, stimulating place to live and work."
"An energetic, thriving cultural sector is clearly necessary for Europe's success as a creative, knowledge-based economy."
"The cultural sector also attracts well-qualified, creative people."
"The cultural and creative industries are currently also important drivers of economic and social innovation in many other sectors."
"There are states which are already tapping into the multifaceted resources of the cultural and creative industries to a broad extent."
"However, the European Union still needs to develop a strategic approach to make its cultural assets the basis of a powerful creative economy and a cohesive society."
"This is a good time for the European Commission's Green Paper to prompt discussion on unlocking 'the potential of the cultural and creative industries', officially endorsing the importance of this sector."
"The growth of the cultural and creative industries in the European Union since the 1990s has been exponential in terms of job creation and their contribution to GDP."
"I voted for the report by Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, which contains proposals for encouraging the development of cultural and creative industries."
"The report asks for the creation of the status of European artist, so that artists may be able to enjoy satisfactory working conditions and appropriate measures with regard to tax systems, their right to work, social security rights and copyright, in order to improve their mobility across the EU."
"I am also at one with the rapporteur in emphasising the need to preserve the specific nature of certain trades and the transfer of know-how, especially in the cultural, creative and crafts sector, and to guarantee mechanisms for knowledge transfer."
"I welcome the interest shown in the potential of cultural and creative industries (CCIs)."
"I believe in the positive impact that their development can have both in economic terms, by creating jobs and contributing to gross domestic product (GDP), and in social terms, through the social and cultural integration of members of the public."
"I therefore welcome the intended support for the creative sector, because I think this is the right path towards the lasting and sustainable growth of the European economy, given the global situation these days."
"Innovation, structural cohesion and creating new products and services must be a priority that is considered when constructing any European policy."
"I welcome the adoption of the Sanchez-Schmid report concerning the development of the cultural and creative industries."
"With almost 14 million jobs involved, and with sustained growth even during the crisis, it remains essential to show unfailing support for these industries, so great is their economic and cultural contribution."
"Creating a European statute for artists, introducing a reduced VAT rate for cultural goods and improving the distribution of legal digital offers are appropriate and essential measures for ensuring the international cultural influence of the European Union."
"In the last two decades, the growth of the cultural and creative industries (CCIs) has been exponential in terms of job creation and contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Member States."
"It is for that reason, and because of the extremely favourable time in which we find ourselves, that it is important to exploit and increase these industries' potential."
"There is therefore a need to exploit the potential of the digital age, to create an EU-wide momentum, and to stimulate the cultural sector, in order to equip these industries with innovative economic models."
"I should like, therefore, to congratulate the rapporteur and get behind her call for a more ambitious Commission Green Paper that leads to the appearance of a true Internal Market, making it possible to create jobs and guarantee greater social cohesion."
"This report, by Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, addresses how the European Union can unlock the potential of cultural and creative industries (CCIs)."
"This is a debate launched by the European Commission Green Paper at a time when the digital age is invading our lives and globalisation is becoming a challenge for the CCIs."
"If the EU can create an EU-wide momentum that stimulates these companies by supporting innovation and modernisation, we will be able to promote employment and social cohesion and, as the rapporteur mentions, make the European Union 'the economy which is founded on the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-base in the world'."
"I therefore voted for this report, because I believe in the potential of these creative industries and in their promising future."
"Nevertheless, so that they are not in a position to be overtaken by international partners, there is a need to commit, quickly and firmly, to new technologies - in particular, information technology - and to development and innovation factors."
"The EU should also support and encourage artistic creation, as well as the mobility of culture professionals, so that it becomes increasingly universal and globalising."
"I voted in favour of this document because unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries necessitates the development, inter alia, of high quality artistic and cultural education, territorialisation, local partnerships, creation and creativity, the sharing of expertise, financing, public/private partnerships and the exchange of good practices."
"We must create competitiveness between cultural and creative industries (CCIs), whilst bearing in mind the characteristics of each branch and the fact that they require different forms of support."
"The European Union must introduce measures to support the creative sector."
"We would like to see this Green Paper having a short and long-term impact through specific developments at European level in such areas as taxation adapted to on-line cultural goods and services and the possibility of exploiting the financing facilities available through the EIB and the EIF."
"If cultural and creative industries are to maximise their role as a driving force, financing facilities backed up by solid expertise in the characteristics of cultural industries and an adapted taxation system must be introduced."
"Member States must be strongly committed to protecting and supporting their own cultural heritage."
"In view of the ever-increasing importance of CCIs, as well as the objective of strengthening this sector, which is of strategic importance for the achievement of the Europe 2020 goals, the Commission should draw up a White Paper which would unlock cultural and creative potential."
"I voted in favour of this report because I consider it essential that the Commission pursues its efforts to ensure a better definition of the creative cultural industries (CCIs) as part of their greater recognition by civil society."
"I foresee great potential for the CCIs, especially if we consider the possible and necessary cooperation with universities, research centres and art schools, with which we can set up a network of joint training programmes and lifelong learning."
"It is essential and important, ladies and gentlemen, to disseminate practices and know-how and enhance learning through ad hoc vocational training programmes dedicated to the cultural and creative sector."
"I think we need to ensure multi-disciplinary teaching programmes and insist on cooperation and partnership not only between educational institutions, students and professionals in the cultural and creative sector, but also between businesses of all sizes, between the public and the private sector, and between craftspeople and financial institutions."
"The cultural and creative industries contribute in terms of both growth and jobs in the EU."
"They are part of the plan for meeting the 2020 objectives, and it is therefore important that we create good conditions for this sector - particularly within the area that I would like to highlight, namely copyright."
"As pointed out in several places in the report, we should, of course, ensure that artists receive fair remuneration for their work."
"At the same time, it is absolutely crucial that we ensure that a large number of online services are available to consumers."
"The best way to do this is to create good conditions for legal, operationally sound alternatives."
"There are currently already several good examples, and they should be made more visible."
"Creating effective alternatives is the best way to combat piracy."
"At the same time, it is vital for the Commission to come up with an ambitious proposal on copyright - something that we look forward to with anticipation."
"One of the things we point out in the report is that a pan-European approach should be taken."
"It is no good us operating with 27 different systems in this important area."
"I therefore believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach and look at the connection between licensing, private copyright fees and piracy."
"I hope that this report can help to get this started and I look forward to an ambitious proposal from the Commission."
"in writing. - I voted for this report because I believe this is a good time for the Commission's Green Paper, officially endorsing the economic and social importance of the sector, to prompt discussion on 'unlocking the potential of the cultural and creative industries'."
"The growth of cultural and creative industries in the European Union since the 1990s has been exponential in terms of job creation and of their contribution to GDP."
"It is precisely the cultural aspect of our common heritage which differentiates Europe from the other regions in the world."
"At a time when we are faced with major economic challenges, it is important for us to think about ways in which to tap the potential offered by the cultural and creative industries, especially as a significant number of European citizens are involved in such activities."
"Let us not forget the significant contribution the creative sector makes not only to the development of information and communication technologies, but to economic and social innovation as well."
"However, this sector raises a number of issues which need to be clarified."
"One important aspect is the digitisation of cultural productions, along with the need to create a proper single market for online content and services which will generate additional jobs."
"In this same context, we also talk about resolving the issue of copyright, funding the cultural and creative industries, artists' mobility or the release of cultural productions."
"One relevant example is cinematography, where European films, including a number of Romanian productions, have won prestigious prizes at high-profile festivals."
"There is a need for EU-wide momentum to encourage cultural and creative industries (CCIs), which is why they must adopt innovative economic models and have access to new, legal on-line service provision."
"It is therefore necessary to create a genuine single market for on-line content and services, take specific measures aimed at increasing the role of the cultural and creative industries as catalysts for innovation and structural change, bring together actors at regional, national and European level, and create new products and services to generate growth and jobs."
"By developing the CCIs, we are contributing to sustainable economic development and job creation."
"It is doubtful, given the multiplicity of wrong turns taken by the EU, whether information and communications technologies are enough to create a European identity."
"Just as unconducive to this European identity is the EU's democratic deficit and the unidirectional understanding of democracy among the Brussels elites, who simply let the populace keep voting until it gives the 'right' result."
"When it comes to direct democracy, the European Union could learn much from Switzerland, which stands up for democratic decisions even when the rest of the politically correct mainstream world criticises it to the hilt."
"It is doubtful whether, as it is so eloquently put in the report, an 'energetic, growing cultural sector' represents an 'important driver of economic and social innovation'."
"Rather, a trend can be perceived whereby migration and migrants are being increasingly placed at the heart of support for culture while native culture and tradition are pushed to one side."
"Yet the much-discussed topic of integration must not take the form of doing without Christmas, Easter, St. Nicholas' Day and similar traditions in the name of adaptation to Muslim immigrants in our nurseries and schools - to do so would mean the loss of our cultural identity."
"We need to go back to paying more attention to ensuring that our customs, traditions and moral values are upheld, and respected by others."
"As this report fails to offer any reversal of the trend, I decided to abstain."
"The culture and creativity sectors have a dual role: they have an economic role, by supporting employment, growth and the creation of wealth and, above all, they have a cultural role, by contributing to the social and cultural development of citizens."
"However, two basic conditions need to be satisfied if they are to realise their full potential."
"Firstly, we need to encourage the mobility and attractiveness of cultural factors, such as the mobility of artists, cultural workers and works of art and, secondly, we need to ensure that specific funding and economic support policies are put in place in the cultural sector, such as access to funds via the European Investment Bank."
"This report on 'unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries' (CCIs) is based on the European Commission Green Paper on the same topic and I voted for it, as it is official recognition of the economic and social importance of this sector."
"Within the European Union, and since the 1990s, the growth of the CCIs has been exponential in terms of job creation and its contribution to gross domestic product (GDP)."
"Coordinating and leveraging synergies in this growing sector may be crucial to the EU's economic development."
"The cultural and creative industries have great potential to be one of the engines of growth in the EU."
"in writing. - Cultural and creative industries are not only a source of wealth and employment but also contribute to Europe's social and cultural fabric."
"Artistic trades are part of our heritage and this knowledge needs to be passed on."
"We should foster multidisciplinary education and allow for more exchanges between higher education institutions in this sector."
"The Commission needs to ensure legal security in information and communication technologies so as to protect consumers and innovative creators."
"It should also help local and regional authorities to develop networks to cooperate in the field of cultural tourism."
"Ireland, in particular Ireland South, has a rich cultural and creative history."
"We need to help to ensure that these cultural and artistic trades are encouraged and made available to a wider audience."
"The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) make a number of contributions."
"Firstly, their intrinsic value in the recreation of cultural templates and in contributing to the construction of a common European identity."
"Secondly, however, they constitute an economic activity that enables the creation of jobs and of products in circulation: in other words, it is a source of wealth in economic terms, too."
"Nevertheless, there need to be incentives for this type of activity, such as the recognition of the rights to exploit these products economically, whilst fully protecting the position of the creators."
"Moreover, it is a commitment that will allow the affirmation - and differentiation - of the added value that the EU is able to offer."
"Therefore, I voted in favour of this report."
"The cultural and creative industries represent 5 million jobs and 2.6% of the EU's GDP."
"They are also one of the principal drivers of European growth, since they create new jobs and stimulate innovation."
"They also bring an added value as a factor of social cohesion and play a major role in the promotion of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the EU."
"It is therefore crucial from an economic as much as a social viewpoint to support these industries."
"That is why I am voting in favour of this report."
"In this way, I should like to encourage Member States and the European Commission to promote both artistic and cultural education among all age groups, from primary education through to higher or vocational education, and the entrepreneurial skills of professionals in the cultural sector, including in the context of lifelong learning."
"In order to enable the deployment of these industries, it is equally essential to improve access to funding for professionals in this sector: to introduce microfinancing, develop patronage and public/private partnerships, consider introducing new, innovative funding instruments, and train professionals in the banking sector in the specific characteristics of these industries."
"in writing. - This is a good time for the Commission's Green Paper, officially endorsing the economic and social importance of the sector, to prompt discussion on 'unlocking the potential of the cultural and creative industries'."
"The growth of cultural and creative industries (CCIs) in the European Union since the 1990s has been exponential in terms of job creation and their contribution to GDP."
"The challenge of globalisation and the arrival of the digital age are providing these industries with major new opportunities to develop, and can improve their hitherto largely untapped potential to create growth and jobs."
"There is a need for strategic investment to enable cultural and creative industries to invigorate cultural diversity, social and territorial cohesion, growth and employment."
"To this end, there must be adequate funding, support for CCIs to develop in their local and regional environments, and a move towards a creative economy by catalysing their spillover effects on a wide range of economic and social contexts."
"The greater the availability of European audiovisual content, the greater the potential of characteristically European content to influence cultural diversity."
"In addition, the creative sector makes a significant contribution to the development of information and communication technologies, and plays a major role at local, regional and national levels."
"I voted for this report because I believe that the cultural and creative industries should constitute an added value for the Union."
"A European statute for artists based on favourable working conditions and tax regimes would promote Europe as a dynamic and challenging environment in which to live and work, making it attractive to skilled and creative individuals."
"Furthermore, a knowledge-based economy will help to protect European cultural diversity and to carry us towards social cohesion and employment."
"In this context, to unlock this potential as well as possible, we must facilitate both the transfer of creative knowledge to new generations, but also the mobility of artists throughout Europe."
"The cultural and creative industries sector is made up of enterprises with great economic potential because they generate employment, growth and wealth, and are responsible for the social and cultural integration of citizens."
"In accordance with the European motto, 'United in diversity', the presence of industries that use culture as an input is essential as they promote intercultural dialogue, thus safeguarding European diversity."
"Promoting these industries will create significant new opportunities for regional development, local partnerships and possible partnerships with the private and public sector."
"The European Commission Green Paper on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries (CCIs) aims to contribute to the European Union's economic growth and to job creation in its Member States."
"In the report adopted today, the European Parliament advocates a genuine EU-wide strategy in this sector through the creation of new areas for experimentation, innovation and entrepreneurship; of support for mobility; and of promoting access to finance, to new financial instruments, and to greater involvement in regional and local collectives."
"The rapporteur proposes the creation of pilot projects under the Erasmus and Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programmes, as well as the creation of a European-level platform to promote the exchange of experiences."
"The initiatives, which are of great interest to the regional- and local-level crafts sector, also include the development of a best practices network for regional and local collectives, and the implementation of consultation services on finance, to offer the sector's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) better information on producing and distributing cultural and creative goods and services."
"Today in the European Parliament, we have voted through the report on the potential of the creative industry."
"It is a report which shows clearly that the creative industry is responsible for 5 million jobs in the EU and for generating almost 3% of the EU's GDP."
"The creative industry, in principle, influences every sector of the EU economy, instilling innovation wherever possible - the innovation without which it would be difficult to speak of an improvement in the competitiveness of the EU on the international arena, which we all desire so much."
"I voted against this report, which draws cultural goods into a logic of the market and competition."
"The 'cultural industries' and, as a consequence, the cultural goods that they produce, cannot be likened to enterprises like any other, on the grounds that they are producers of wealth and potentially job creators."
"They must first, and above all, continue to be recognised as means of liberation for the greatest number of people and as instruments for sharing knowledge and know-how."
"There is therefore an urgent need to reassert the principle of cultural uniqueness in all areas, if the fine phrases on the creative industries as driving forces, the recognition of the status of artist or the desire to find an equilibrium between the dissemination of digital works and fair reward for creators, are not to remain pious wishes in the face of the cultural desert that will ensue."
"The evolution of our model of development, focused from now on on the knowledge economy, makes culture a strategically important sector."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which proposes ways of making better use of European cultural resources."
"In my view, unlocking the potential of creative industries must particularly involve a reform of the European system of managing copyright, in order to enable the creative industries to draw a greater benefit from the single market."
"Licensing procedures, as the report emphasises, are far too complicated, and it calls for the introduction of a one-stop shop for the clearance of rights."
"It is also necessary, I believe, to stimulate creation by adopting a specific tax system for innovative products, such as digital cultural content."
"It is not right that these products should be subject to VAT at the full standard rate while other cultural products benefit from tax reliefs."
"With my vote, I wanted to call on the Commission and the Council to respond to the European Parliament's demand for specific measures to enable us to enjoy the full benefit from the growth potential of this sector."
"Only an ambitious and joint approach can preserve the uniqueness of European culture."
"I voted for Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's report on the potential of the European cultural and creative industries, which has not yet been fully unlocked."
"These industries are an asset for the EU, partly because their exponential growth over the past 25 years has created tens of thousands of jobs."
"It is therefore necessary to build a European strategy for these industries in which they have the opportunity to express their potential and gain recognition for their dual role as bearers of culture and entertainment and as creators of business and jobs."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution, and would express the same conviction as the rapporteur that awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending historical European divisions and showcasing the new Europe."
"I endorsed this resolution."
"The European Capitals of Culture project helps to support the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share, as well as to promote greater mutual understanding between European citizens."
"Although the decision on the European Capital of Culture for the years 2007 to 2019 applies only to the EU Member States, I agree with the resolution's call to award the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014."
"I believe that this would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions by awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the scene of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century."
"Anyone who followed with horror the events that made victims of the inhabitants of the martyr city of Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia, and which damaged its buildings, cannot fail to welcome the city's designation as European Capital of Culture 2014."
"Without forgetting what happened, I hope that this event will enable Europeans to have other, more agreeable memories of Sarajevo, and that it will contribute, above all, to bringing together the various ethnic groups of the country itself."
"I hope that the programme of Sarajevo Capital of Culture will celebrate life, and the human capacity for survival and rebuilding, and that it will prove to all of us the extent to which the human spirit can cultivate and transmit the good and the beautiful, even after experiencing the most profound suffering."
"This resolution addresses Bosnia and Herzegovina's application for its capital, Sarajevo, to be considered European Capital of Culture in 2014."
"The EU initiative 'European Capital of Culture' was created to highlight Europe's cultural richness and diversity, sharing it out and promoting mutual understanding amongst Europeans."
"In 1992-1996, Sarajevo - the martyr city where, in 1914, the First World War started - would become the victim of destruction during the time it was besieged."
"It now has images that are known the world over, like the one of 'The Cellist of Sarajevo' who, dressed in black and in the midst of the destruction of war, wanders the streets seeking to ease the suffering of a martyred people who cannot leave the city."
"Despite adversity, the city maintains its cultural spirit."
"I consider it positive and fair that Sarajevo be European Capital of Culture."
"I voted in favour of this document because a Community action entitled European Capital of Culture has been established in order to highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share, as well as to promote greater mutual understanding between Europeans."
"In addition, it is noted that Sarajevo has a special place in European history and culture and will commemorate several important anniversaries in 2014, and the City Council of Sarajevo and local cultural operators have undertaken extensive preparations in their candidature for this title."
"I therefore believe that the Council should award the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014."
"This would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions and showcasing the new Europe by awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the scene of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which calls on the Council to award the title 'European Capital of Culture' exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014."
"I believe that awarding the title to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions and showcasing the new Europe."
"Sarajevo was a magnificent city in which three peoples, three cultures and three religions cohabited."
"The siege of the city and the ethnic and religious war which lasted for four years (1992-1996) profoundly disrupted this capital, which was 'Islamised' in religious terms and 'Bosniakised' in linguistic terms."
"Our challenge now is to rebuild the bridges between the communities."
"Culture can contribute to this."
"By the way, it was culture that helped them to endure four years of war."
"Culture is a vector of openness and a motor of democracies, counteracting every nationalist reaction, racist temptation and exclusion."
"It can help them now to achieve European multiculturalism once again."
"This mosaic-like city was and can once more become the living metaphor for Europe."
"We must work to create a pluralistic world that keeps its capacity for creation intact and that is able to give rise to novelty and diversity."
"I am using my vote in favour to express my support for the European Parliament's call to the Council for Sarajevo to be named European Capital of Culture in 2014."
"In fact, I agree with what the resolution says about how awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the scene of such tragic events during the 20th century represents an important step towards overcoming Europe's past divisions and promoting the new Europe."
"Although the decision establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture 2007-2019 only currently covers EU Member States, the truth is that the opportunity to win the title of European Capital of Culture has already been granted to cities of third countries on a number of occasions."
"As such, and given the special place that Sarajevo occupies in European history and culture, I believe awarding it the title of European Capital of Culture 2014 would be justified, even for its symbolic value."
"Sarajevo, a multicultural city embodying a genuine model of tolerance, incontestably occupies a particular place in history and in European culture."
"It was in Sarajevo that the assassination that sparked off the First World War in 1914 was carried out."
"It was also in this city that, between 1992 and 1996, during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the longest siege that a capital city has endured in the history of modern warfare took place."
"As the city, which wishes to turn its back on the past and looks forward enthusiastically to its future in Europe, will be marking several important anniversaries in 2014, I should like to see Sarajevo designated as the European Capital of Culture for that year."
"in writing. - With this resolution, Parliament: (1) calls on the Council to award the title 'European Capital of Culture' exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014; and (2) asserts its belief that this would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions and showcasing the new Europe by awarding the title 'European Capital of Culture' to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century."
"As a member of the delegation from the Committee on Culture and Education to Sarajevo, I support the city's candidacy as a European Capital of Culture 2014."
"Sarajevo deserves to be given the chance to demonstrate its huge potential."
"It is an exceptionally multicultural city."
"Sarajevo is surrounded by an atmosphere which is both multicultural and European."
"It is the only city in the world where in an area of one square kilometre, you can see buildings belonging to five religions: there are mosques, a Roman Catholic cathedral, an Orthodox church, a synagogue and a Protestant church."
"Bosnians, meanwhile, are characterised by great friendliness and hospitality."
"I recently read the reminiscences of a Polish student who took part in a student exchange in Sarajevo - she did not meet a single foreign student who was there as part of the exchange who did not like Sarajevo."
"Since the end of the war in 1995, Sarajevo is also being rebuilt, mainly with financial assistance from the European Union."
"Sarajevo is looking to its European future with great enthusiasm."
"It wants to demonstrate its huge potential and promote itself to Europeans."
"There is no doubt that this city deserves this chance, and we should support it in this."
"Sarajevo occupies a very important place in Europeans' historical consciousness."
"I support awarding the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to the city in 2014."
"The initiative, which, for over 25 years, has allowed promotion of the riches and diversity of European cultures, will also help rebuild the city's tourist industry and economic base."
"Sarajevo witnessed important historical events and was severely damaged as a result of the hostilities in the 1990s."
"It was also the scene of the murder which started the First World War."
"The 100th anniversary of that event falls in the very year we are talking about - 2014."
"Awarding the city the title of European Capital of Culture at this juncture would not only help in the cultural regeneration of the city and in improving the city's image in other countries, but would also help to commemorate important aspects of European history and identity."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."

"1."
"Sri Lanka: follow-up of the UN report (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Sri Lanka."
"author. - Mr President, in the brutal war of the Sri Lanka Government against the Tamil minority, at least 40 000 Tamils were killed within the space of a few weeks and hundreds of thousands were detained in open air prison camps."
"The UN report at long last publicly acknowledges the crimes that were committed against the Tamil people."
"Unfortunately, there should be no illusions that the report will change the conditions of Tamils in Sri Lanka."
"The day after its publication, it was reported that the UN Secretary-General would only launch an international investigation if the Sri Lankan Government agrees or an international forum such as the UN Foreign Security Council calls for an inquiry."
"Given the nature of the Sri Lankan Government, it is obvious that it will not allow any international investigation."
"It highlights once again the need to campaign for a genuinely independent inquiry into the war crimes and for the Rajapaksa regime to be held responsible."
"On 18 May, there will be protests around the world organised by many groups, including the Tamil Solidarity Campaign, to mark the second anniversary of this bloody war."
"A united struggle of Sinhalese and Tamil people is still needed to defeat this regime and fight for the right of self-determination for the Tamil-speaking people."
"author. - Mr President, we only have to hear those opening remarks to understand why I very much regret that we are having this debate today."
"It is being promoted by extremist elements in the Tamil diaspora, the same people who have helped sustain the LTTE terrorist campaign over many years through political activity, and often from the proceeds of crime."
"Of course, the final stages of the LTTE campaign were awful."
"The UN's Darusman report, which is the immediate pretext for this debate, states clearly that in those final stages, the LTTE used the civilian population as human shields, intensified the forcible recruitment of civilians, including children, into its ranks, executed civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone and deployed artillery in proximity to displaced civilians and civilian installations such as hospitals."
"This does not excuse the shelling of civilian targets, but it does put it into context and shows where the blame lies."
"Instead of trying to bring together the peoples of Sri Lanka, there are those who seek to continue a campaign of hatred and division."
"They see this Darusman report as a weapon in this campaign, and just want to put the Sri Lankan Government in the dock."
"This approach is malicious and counter-productive."
"The government of Sri Lanka and the Commission have set up the LLRC to investigate human rights allegations."
"Let us do all that we can to support them and the peoples of Sri Lanka, instead of attacking them."
"Mr President, from the very first words, you have all understood that the debate would be quite lively and that there would be two views."
"I should say that my group aligns itself neither with one side nor with the other, but simply with the side of justice and of reconciliation."
"I believe that there can be no reconciliation, in those countries, like Sri Lanka, but there are certainly many others, which have experienced atrocious wars, unless justice is done."
"Well, what does this United Nations report to which Mr Van Orden refers do?"
"It simply restates the facts and calls for there to be a mechanism for international justice, which one knows must be approved by the government."
"That is the very least."
"How would you like there to be reconciliation of a people?"
"It is on both sides, Mr Van Orden."
"It is not only on the Tamil side."
"There have been crimes on both sides."
"Both sides are responsible."
"It is by both sides that justice must be done."
"The report also states, and I apologise for this, that the reconciliation commission that has just been mentioned did not have an investigative element of a sufficiently high standard."
"Finally, I fear that a national organ of justice will not finally result in a clarification of the facts."
"That is why, quite simply and in the name of all those who have suffered on both sides, I say that this House can only support this report in order to shed more light and have more justice."
"That is the only message that I should like to pass on today."
"I shall not have used up all my allotted time, but that is the essential message for this House."
"Mr President, in February, I went to Sri Lanka with the Delegation for Relations with South Asia."
"Whilst there, we witnessed the enormous efforts to overcome the consequences of a 25-year civil war."
"The European Union, the United Nations and NGOs are providing help, from the clearing of landmines by the HALO Trust through to the resettlement of the Tamils in their former home."
"We call on the government there to respond positively to the recommendations of the UN's panel of experts, which highlighted war crimes and crimes against humanity on the parts of both the Sinhalese and the LTTE."
"It is encouraging that the government has set up a commission to deal with reconciliation, establish legal jurisdiction, solve language problems and deal with former front-line soldiers."
"The consistent willingness to cooperate, the will to integrate minorities and the assurance of maintaining international legal norms form the basis for the development of a country that, without violence and terror, has a real future."
"We emphatically call on the EU's High Representative to support efforts of this kind."
"author. - Mr President, the conflict in Sri Lanka may be over, but many questions remain unanswered."
"An end to a conflict does not necessarily mean that the conflict is over in people's minds."
"Victory is not the same as peace."
"It takes time, effort and especially commitment and strong will to overcome the scars of a conflict."
"Reconciliation is imperative."
"Justice is vital for a new beginning."
"Therefore, the Sri Lankan Government should immediately start investigations on the violations of international humanitarian and human rights law."
"Both sides need to be investigated."
"International conventions to which Sri Lanka is a party require investigations on the alleged violations and the prosecution of those who are responsible."
"Only by means of an open and honest investigation and through justice can the Sri Lankan people heal the wounds of a long and difficult conflict and continue their lives in peace."
"The ALDE Group applauds UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's report and initiative on Sri Lanka."
"We fully support the UN recommendations."
"author. - Mr President, on 23 May 2009, the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the President of Sri Lanka, Rajapaksa, signed a joint statement in which Sri Lanka agreed to guarantee accountability for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war which ended in May 2009."
"After this agreement was not honoured by the Sri Lankan Government, the UN Secretary-General appointed a panel of experts to advise him on modalities for an accountability process."
"The report, which was published very recently, made credible allegations that both government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam failed to respect the norms of international law."
"The report stressed the need for accountability on both sides."
"The Sri Lankan Government has dismissed the panel's report, calling it illegal and biased."
"I believe that it is an objective reason for further investigations."
"At a time when the creditable and legitimate work of international human rights bodies is being discredited, it is for this House to step up and defend international law."
"War crimes must never go unpunished, no matter where they occur."
"Mr President, the civil war in Sri Lanka lasted 25 years and ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers."
"The last stages of the war were especially bloody and thousands died in its last few months."
"According to the new report by the UN, it is very likely that the Tamil Tigers and government troops will be found guilty of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights committed in the final stages of the conflict."
"The Tamil Tigers are suspected of shooting civilians trying to flee."
"The government killed civilians in shellfire."
"These are both serious crimes and they cannot be ignored."
"That is why it is important that the UN can carry out an impartial and open investigation into the matter."
"Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan Government has been unwilling to allow the investigation to go ahead without its approval, unless the UN Member States unanimously insist."
"It is extremely important that Sri Lanka adopts a constructive attitude and is willing to cooperate."
"A sense of responsibility is vital for the reconciliation process."
"The EU must support efforts to strengthen Sri Lanka's sense of responsibility."
"The conclusions of the Darusman report for the United Nations (UN) point to the massacre of tens of thousands of civilians, war crimes and crimes against humanity, alongside other terrible humanitarian law violations, committed by both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan Government."
"Carrying out an independent investigation and bringing those responsible to justice is not a political choice but an obligation under international law."
"The Reconciliation Commission established by the government does not meet basic requirements for independence."
"Therefore, the international community - specifically the European Union and the UN Security Council - must offer their unconditional support for the report's recommendations and take urgent steps towards the creation of an independent international mechanism to monitor the Sri Lankan Government's actions, ensure that crimes committed on both sides are investigated, and seek justice for the Sri Lankan people."
"Mr President, I wish to support this resolution on human rights violations and war crimes committed in Sri Lanka."
"It is crucial, in addition to expressing our solidarity with the victims and condemning the violence, and given the concerns regarding the judiciary's lack of independence, to promote a serious, impartial, transparent investigation to be undertaken by an independent body so that the people responsible on both sides of the conflict can be identified and punished."
"Impunity for war crimes must end if we want to prevent them from being repeated in the future."
"In Sri Lanka, the civilian population was bombed, among other atrocities."
"Seventy-four years ago in my own country, Franco's troops bombed the town of Guernica, killing more than half of the population, an episode famously depicted by Picasso."
"Ever since, Guernica has been a universal symbol for peace and resistance."
"However, it is everyone's wish to make progress towards reconciliation."
"We must therefore encourage, help and also push the Sri Lankan Government to continue these prosecutions so that true peace and justice can be attained."
"Mr President, the United Nations report, published on 11 April, throws light on the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed in Sri Lanka in the conflict between the government forces of Mr Rajapaksa and the Tamil Tiger independence movement."
"The clashes in May and June 2009 gave rise to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and thousands of civilians lost their lives."
"We cannot accept the impunity of those responsible and of the authors of these crimes."
"The government of Mr Rajapaksa has done everything in its power to prevent publication of the UN report and it even contests its conclusions."
"In Sri Lanka, the press is muzzled, and journalists are subject to intimidation and arbitrary detention."
"The main opposition Internet information site has had its access blocked by the judicial authorities, while access to refugee camps is still currently extremely restricted, including for the United Nations."
"The Tamil minority is the victim of a genocide that dare not speak its name."
"We must urgently send European Parliament observers to the north of Sri Lanka to see what is really happening there and reassert the principle of the self-determination of peoples."
"(The speaker agreed to take two blue card questions under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President: I heard it directly in French and the word used was 'génocide', which means 'genocide', and that has a particular significance in international law."
"If such were the intent of the Sri Lankan Government, how come they have just released 200 000 Tamils who were prisoners?"
"It is absurd to accuse the Sri Lankan Government of genocide."
"I would hope that the Member would retract that statement."
"(FR) Mr Tannock, I used that word by way of a metaphor, above all, to label the phenomenon."
"However, I have made it clear that it was not the name."
"The facts have to be established."
"In any case, what is happening to the Tamil minority cannot be shrugged off as a simply anodyne act."
"Mr President, the previous speaker mentioned that she is calling for some sort of commission to go to Sri Lanka to look at what is going on on the ground there."
"Could I just remind her that the South Asia delegation has just been to Sri Lanka - and I see several members of that delegation in the Chamber."
"Indeed, my colleague, Mr Mann, referred to the visit there: the previous speaker is obviously not listening to what is going on in this debate."
"People have been to Sri Lanka."
"They know Sri Lanka and they know what is going on."
"I do not know where Ms Delli is getting all this nonsense from."
"(FR) You are right, we have already sent a mission and I acknowledge the formidable character of that mission, seeing that you worked on it."
"However, we can also exert pressure, which means that we must absolutely repeat this type of operation."
"Mr President, Sri Lanka is a ravaged land."
"The civil war officially ended nearly two years ago, and we know in what conditions it took place."
"In that country, the United Nations failed badly."
"The reports from non-governmental organisations are damning."
"Thousands of civilians were killed between January and May 2009."
"Atrocities were committed by both camps, but it seems to be accepted that the pro-government forces knowingly shelled zones where they had encouraged the civilian population to take refuge."
"Since that time, the Sri Lankan Government has been manoeuvring to exonerate itself and impede access to justice by those who must be called, at the very least, victims of war crimes."
"It has not ceased to try and underestimate the number of civilians present in the war zone while it has even deprived them of all humanitarian aid, including food, water and healthcare."
"The Tamil Tigers have their share of the responsibility for these horrors."
"They conscripted child soldiers and used the civilian population as a human shield, but that does not in any way alleviate the responsibility of the governmental authorities on the spot."
"It justifies nothing."
"The UN waited for a long time before denouncing the situation in that country."
"What is worse, the Sri Lankan Government has multiplied its machinations to prevent the publication of the latest report in particular and to have its conclusions rejected."
"We can only welcome the report of 11 April."
"The resolution before us today is going in the right direction."
"For my part, I should have liked it to go even further."
"It is high time that international justice did its work, in Sri Lanka as elsewhere."
"Mr President, the long-running military conflict between the government forces and the armed groups of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has had very cruel consequences for the civilian population living in the conflict zones, came to an end in 2009."
"After the end of the war, the Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, promised to investigate all suspected violations of military law and international humanitarian law during the military conflict."
"The UN report published in April this year states that both sides in the conflict carried out military operations without taking steps to protect the rights and lives of civilians."
"Despite this, the responsible bodies in Sri Lanka have not held to account the people responsible for serious violations of humanitarian law, two years after the end of the war."
"The judicial authorities are, in many cases, inactive, and we therefore need to support through our resolution UN efforts to uphold the law and establish accountability for the killing and torture of thousands of civilians during the vicious fighting between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and government forces in Sri Lanka."
"(PL) Mr President, the dramatic events in Sri Lanka which are described in the UN report show what kind of problems can be caused by armed conflict."
"What took place there is further proof that solving differences by violence and force of arms generates other colossal problems."
"In Europe, there has, for centuries, been reflection about the concept of a just war."
"What is particularly painful is the fact that in the modern world, even a war which is theoretically just inevitably entails the suffering of innocent and unjustified victims."
"This happens irrespective of how we define a just war."
"In the case of Sri Lanka, growing amounts of data show that the war was not a just one for either side."
"The victor is not always right, although they always try to prove they are right."
"If there is really to be a reconciliation, as the Sri Lankan Government has declared, then the basis of such a reconciliation must be the truth about what happened during the struggle with the Tamil Tigers."
"There will be no genuine reconciliation without exposing the war crimes which were committed, irrespective of which side it was that committed them."
"There will be no reconciliation if the sides consider their own sins to be taboo and do not allow them to be mentioned."
"Mr President, many in this Chamber have been involved in the politics of Sri Lanka, and indeed the politics of the diaspora of Sri Lanka and of the Tamil community."
"What we are discussing today is a report by the Secretary-General's panel of experts on accountability in Sri Lanka."
"I have not heard anyone in the Chamber as yet cast doubts on the intrinsic integrity of that report."
"I have read the report and I have spoken to many about the report on both sides."
"If we are saying that we should leave the report on the table, and we should not have investigations into what happened between January and May, and indeed not open the door to investigate many allegations on both sides, what is the point of a report of this nature?"
"Indeed, I find it compelling that one diaspora organisation of the Tamil community, the Global Tamil Forum, has said that credible allegations against the LTTE - and they have made this very prominent - should also be investigated."
"We have a report which ought to have a follow-up, and I speak firmly in favour of the need for a genuine process of accountability which would bring truth, justice and reconciliation to Sri Lanka following what will be a painful investigation, but an investigation which must happen."
"Mr President, it is appalling that during the protracted military conflict in Sri Lanka that ended in 2009, nearly 100 000 people were killed, including tens of thousands of civilians, most of whom died in the final phase of the conflict."
"The international community should demand a robust international investigation into credible reports of atrocities committed on both sides."
"It is a pity that countries like China and Russia opposed discussion of the issue in the United Nations Security Council and the UN Secretary-General taking more robust action to investigate the crimes committed."
"The UN Panel of Experts clearly indicated that both the government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil rebels committed serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, possibly amounting in some cases to war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"So I fully support the immediate establishment of an international justice mechanism as proposed by the UN report."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, it is apparent from the UN report that in the final bloody months of the civil war in Sri Lanka, which went on for 25 years, thousands of civilians died in artillery fire from government troops."
"The UN also said that Tamil rebels had used more than 300 000 civilians as human shields and shot civilians trying to escape."
"Both sides therefore seriously contravened human rights and international laws in a war situation."
"It is important now that reconciliation talks get under way, so that an impartial and independent investigation into war crimes can be carried out by the UN."
"Parliament's resolution is wellbalanced in its wording and will encourage the parties to achieve reconciliation and build peace."
"(RO) Mr President, the conclusions from the UN report published on 25 April 2011 level serious accusations concerning the numerous violations of human rights and norms of international law, both by the Sri Lankan Government and by the rebel forces defeated in the civil conflict which lasted well over 28 years."
"Indeed, the report states that government forces killed tens of thousands of civilians by bombing populated areas, hospitals and even humanitarian aid centres belonging to the UN."
"On the other hand, the rebel forces used numerous civilians as human shields, with those who tried to escape the conflict zone being shot on the spot."
"Like other speakers before me, I think that an independent international mechanism needs to be created to investigate the war crimes in this country, as well as the other serious human rights violations."
"An impartial, transparent investigation is required, which will shed light on who is responsible for these crimes that have shocked the international community."
"Mr President, this well-researched report shows us - in addition to all its conclusions - that, once again, the first casualty of war is truth."
"What it fails to do is to outline the policies needed to heal the hurts of that nation."
"Too many countries for too long turned a blind eye to what was going on."
"The right policies are needed now, through a concerted effort by the international community, to seek release and justice for all of those who have been so terribly affected."
"Mr President, Mr Watson is quite right in saying that the first casualty of any war, and specifically this one, is truth."
"Obviously, we also have to admit that the civilian population is a victim in this kind of conflict, and the UN panel has shown clearly that there are responsibilities on both sides: mainly that of the government but also that of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, and both need to be investigated."
"What we are saying is that a proper inquiry is very unlikely if the investigating commission comes from the government."
"What we are asking for is an independent commission to investigate these allegations, identified by the UN panel, of war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"If we do not understand the need for this, we will not have a solution, because peace will come only when justice arrives; justice is possible only on the basis of truth; and truth will come only if we have an independent investigation."
"Mr President, finally, Sri Lanka is enjoying peace after a quarter of a century of terrorist insurgency, and the UN report on the Sri Lankan army's defeat of the Tamil Tigers is heavy on criticism and light on substantive, proven facts."
"The approach taken in the report seems to be undermining the efforts now undertaken by the government of Sri Lanka to promote truth and understanding, not least through the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, and the government actually having released more than 200 000 detained Tamil prisoners."
"Of course, any deliberate atrocities against civilians by the military must be punished."
"I agree with that, but there is no clear evidence that this was deliberate government policy."
"I would like to remind the House that the LTTE refused a supervised international surrender offer and preferred instead to choose a bloodbath as their kind of exit strategy, which was appalling."
"The consequences now of the international community's ambivalence towards Sri Lanka are clear: a loss of influence and an inability to shape developments."
"Meanwhile, China has stepped into the breach and become Sri Lanka's closest friend and defender at the UN."
"I hardly need remind colleagues here of China's approach to human rights."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on 25 April 2011, the United Nations made public the advisory report of the panel of experts appointed by the UN Secretary-General on accountability in relation to the armed conflict in Sri Lanka."
"The panel found credible allegations which, if proven, would indicate that serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE, some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"The panel also makes a series of recommendations to the UN Secretary-General and to the government of Sri Lanka which, in the panel's words, will serve as the framework for an ongoing and constructive engagement between the Secretary-General and the government of Sri Lanka on accountability."
"Recommendations include the launch of genuine investigations by the government of Sri Lanka and the establishment of an independent international mechanism by the UN Secretary-General."
"The UN has stated that the UN Secretary-General is carefully reviewing the reports, conclusions and recommendations, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged the Sri Lankan Government to quickly carry out the measures suggested by the panel and ensure justice."
"The government of Sri Lanka, on its side, has rejected the report in the strongest terms."
"Earlier this week, High Representative Catherine Ashton issued a declaration on behalf of the EU reiterating the EU view that an independent process to address these extremely serious allegations should contribute to strengthening the process of reconciliation and ensuring lasting peace and security in Sri Lanka."
"The High Representative has stressed that the issue of accountability should be seen as an essential part of the process of national reconciliation."
"The EU therefore hopes that the government of Sri Lanka will recognise the constructive objectives of the report, and encourages it to engage with the UN Secretary-General on its contents."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ended in May 2009 and resulted in more than 90 000 deaths."
"Numerous Sri Lankans who had been displaced by the violence in their country have returned to their homes following the end of hostilities."
"However, there are still 75 000 refugees who continue to lead difficult lives in camps in Tamil Nadu, India."
"Sri Lanka has a double challenge to overcome."
"It has to recover from a long-lasting crisis."
"The United Nations' experts' report, made public on 25 April, found the allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights credible."
"In the interests of justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, it is essential to set up an impartial, transparent and independent enquiry."
"It also has to prepare for the various natural disasters, such as flooding, landslides, cyclones and also drought, to which the country is exposed."
"2."
"Azerbaijan (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Azerbaijan."
"Mr President, this is another occasion when we find ourselves looking into the situation in Azerbaijan."
"The democratic situation in that country is dramatic enough."
"However, this is a country that is a not insignificant partner within the European Union's Eastern Partnership."
"Opposition parties and non-governmental organisations continue to denounce attacks on human rights and the political repression which is rife there, not to mention the corruption of the regime in power."
"The values of democracy and human rights form an integral part of the values of the European Union, in theory."
"Should we not draw lessons from what is happening in what are called the Arab countries and not demand of our Eastern partners what we did not demand of some governments, notably those of Tunisia, Libya or Egypt?"
"Should we not, Mr Andor, see to it that democracy can finally rule in those countries, that we have minimum requirements in the matter?"
"For my part, I find that the resolution we have before us is, at best, a resolution with as low a profile as it is possible to have."
"For this reason, we have dissociated ourselves from it and we shall make do with abstaining on the vote."
"author. - Mr President, Azerbaijan is, regrettably, a one-party, semi-authoritarian state where political opposition to the dynastic rule of the Aliyev family is barely tolerated."
"Last December's elections predictably delivered an overwhelming majority for Heydar Aliyev's New Azerbaijan Party."
"In response, the OSCE stated that the conduct of these elections overall was not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country."
"The OSCE's report went on to say that freedom of expression was limited and that normal political discourse was almost impossible, partly because of tight constraints on the media."
"Now we are hearing new reports about the targeting of opposition parties and journalists."
"This is nothing new, but it is good from time to time in this House to remind ourselves of the true nature of the Aliyev regime."
"After all, this is a country which, like all EU countries, enjoys membership of the Council of Europe and is part of our eastern EU partnership."
"Supposedly, Azerbaijan is committed to democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"The truth is quite different."
"Azerbaijan spends countless petro-dollars trying to convince outsiders of the benign nature of the regime but I, for one, am not fully taken in."
"Mr President, I will begin with some encouraging news."
"I am referring specifically to the release of the two bloggers, Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli, whom we have discussed in this Chamber."
"Otherwise, however, the situation is more than worrying in Azerbaijan."
"We are hearing about the harassment of journalists and the intimidation of human rights activists, who are facing criminal charges."
"In addition, there were 200 arrests made in the wake of the recent protests in Baku in March and April."
"All these incidents raise serious question marks with us, especially as we must not forget that Azerbaijan has signed up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"The Azeri authorities have seemingly failed to understand that dialogue needs to be established between them and civil society, and not pressure being exerted by the authorities on society."
"Nevertheless, I hope that ultimately, we can establish cooperation within the Eastern Partnership and in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly."
"author. - Mr President, while we welcome the release from prison of Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli, the good news about Azerbaijan ends about there."
"The European Parliament is very concerned about the massive crackdown on freedom of expression and assembly carried out in Azerbaijan following the peaceful protest against the government in March and April of this year."
"Young people, civil society activists, media professionals and opposition politicians are being harassed and intimidated."
"Some demonstrators have been sentenced in mass trials which took place late at night and while people did not have access to a lawyer."
"Most of these lawyers, in turn, were not informed of the locations where the trials were being held."
"The Human Rights House of Azerbaijan has been closed down by order of the Ministry of Justice."
"This climate of fear and intimidation and the breaches of human rights must end."
"The Azerbaijani Government is losing its credibility by breaching conventions it has itself signed up to, such as the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"We want President Aliyev to keep his word."
"Europe also loses credibility if we do not act upon these breaches."
"They should have real consequences for the relations between the EU and Azerbaijan."
"Mr President, a few days ago, we celebrated the grand opening of Euronest at the European Parliament in Brussels."
"Azerbaijan is a founding member of that assembly and as such, has committed itself to democracy, human rights, the rule of law and freedom of assembly and the media."
"This is also a fundamental element of the negotiations on an association agreement between the EU and Azerbaijan that have been taking place since July 2010."
"In light of this, it is really quite staggering how the Azerbaijani Government has behaved towards peacefully demonstrating people over the last two months."
"Here we have young people - who organised themselves via social networks like Facebook - arrested and sentenced to up to two and a half years imprisonment because they peacefully demonstrated under the slogan 'drug abuse'."
"Others are threatened with a similar fate."
"At least 30 people, who likewise protested peacefully, have been sentenced to five to eight days of imprisonment without being able to contact their legal representatives in a cloak and dagger operation that excludes the public."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is unacceptable!"
"In a joint resolution of the five largest groups in Parliament, we are calling for all these people to be released immediately and for the rule of law, freedom of expression and of the media to actually be ensured so that, as President Aliyev assured us years ago - in 2005 - 'No journalist is persecuted in Azerbaijan'."
"He must finally keep these promises."
"I really hope that, by the time of the inter-parliamentary assembly scheduled for June, we will succeed in having all these people released, including newspaper editor Eynulla Fatullayev, and that the government and the governing parties finally keep to their promises."
"Otherwise, there must be consequences."
"Mr President, the democracy and human rights situation in Azerbaijan is raising legitimate concerns."
"These include freedom of expression, media freedom, freedom of association and many other areas."
"We are monitoring incidents involving arrests and political pressure on democratic activists, journalists and the political opposition."
"Azerbaijan and other countries in the region need to get a clear signal that violations of human and civil rights cannot be tolerated under any circumstances."
"If they want to be partner countries of the EU, they must respect its values."
"The debate on violations of human rights and democratic standards should therefore cover the entire region of the South Caucasus."
"In this context, I would also like to draw attention to the re-escalation of tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh."
"This situation now represents a security risk for the entire region."
"It is therefore important for this reason as well to adopt the resolution now."
"The Union should take a more active and more responsible approach, not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the whole region."
"We should learn from the experience of the conflict between Russia and Georgia, and prevent a repeat of similar tragedies."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, it is true that the situation in Azerbaijan is difficult, and we have reasons for concern."
"Here, I would specially mention the case of Mr Hajiyev."
"I think the authorities should understand that peaceful demonstrations are a natural part of political life in any democratic country and that the pluralism of opinions and political beliefs is a fundamental part of a democratic society."
"On the other hand, I must say that it is rather unfortunate that we have put the urgent issues of Azerbaijan and Belarus one after the other - one week after Azerbaijan became - and was welcomed as - a founder of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly together with us, the European Parliament."
"We need engagement both with the authorities and with civil society, and we have to do more, in addition to adopting urgent measures and resolutions."
"The Eastern Partnership and the Euronest Assembly are a good platform for such an engagement, and I feel that there is a new wind coming from Azerbaijan, a renewed wish for political dialogue."
"The PCC, which is going in June to Azerbaijan, should use this opportunity to raise the human rights issue but also to establish a more consistent dialogue with the country."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I venture to suggest that were Azerbaijan known as Azeria, as with Georgia and Armenia, European citizens' concern for democratic standards there would be higher."
"However, my group cannot share Mr Vigenin's view."
"The media in Azerbaijan is not free."
"Its elections are not fair."
"Its people are subject to arbitrary and sometimes violent treatment by officials."
"Peaceful demonstrations in recent weeks have met with repression more common to an Arab than to a European country, from an 18-year-old regime which has slowly stifled hope of progress."
"This country's continued participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy must be made conditional on democratic reforms rather than on its willingness to supply oil for the Nabucco pipeline."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law are an integral part of the new association agreement which is currently being negotiated between Azerbaijan and the European Union."
"Without respect for these principles, it is impossible to see how Azerbaijan can have a common future with its European partners."
"Let me also join those colleagues who point out that we need to be very clear and objective when we talk to our partners in the Eastern Partnership countries."
"We should not believe that we can get away with simply bashing Belarus, because there are severe problems in Azerbaijan and in several other Eastern Partnership countries, and I hope that the forthcoming study commissioned by the Subcommittee on Human Rights will give some guidance on how we should talk to these countries about their human rights situation."
"Mr President, Azerbaijan is one of the special partners of the EU and a founding member of the Euronest grouping, and therefore benefits considerably from privileged relations with the EU."
"As a country with such an exceptional status, however, it has promised, in the signing of mutual agreements as a partner of the EU, to uphold the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which are fundamental preconditions for such cooperation."
"The unjustified arrests of journalists, representatives of youth organisations and civil activists, the banning of peaceful protests and the use of physical force against protestors are therefore unacceptable."
"I expect that the High Representative and Vice President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton, as well as the Commission itself, will convey and represent to the Azerbaijani Government our disquiet over the suppression of democracy in the country, and demand immediate corrective action."
"By adopting the drafted resolution, we will give both the Commission and the High Representative the necessary mandate for this."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, it is somehow grotesque that our Euronest partners, Azerbaijan and Belarus, are both being discussed in succession here as urgent human rights cases."
"Surely the partnership ought to require a respect for European values."
"According to the human rights organisation, Amnesty International, the Azerbaijani authorities are trying to stifle critical voices with a view to preventing wider protests, the like of which have been seen in the Arab world in recent months."
"In the past few weeks, the Azerbaijani police have broken up several demonstrations in the country and have also arrested representatives of the opposition on trumpedup charges, frequently, the possession of drugs."
"The Savalan case and the cases of demonstrators arrested recently show how basic rights in Azerbaijan remain weak and how far the authorities are prepared to silence dissidents."
"Mr President, the situation in Azerbaijan is very disappointing."
"Here is a country that has not really moved forward in terms of political rights since the break-up of the Soviet Union."
"There are just too many examples of lack of freedom - freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which are fundamental to any properly functioning democracy - as well as evidence of the torture of prisoners, court cases where illegally acquired evidence is always admitted, and so on."
"Because we have a close relationship with this country, we certainly have to engage in dialogue, but my position is closer to Mr Watson's thinking: that we need to take a tough hand as well, because if you go 'softly, softly' on a continuous basis, you will get nowhere."
"So I would hope, yes, for dialogue and, yes, for engagement, but we have to up the ante in terms of making demands for freedom: freedom of expression, freedom of speech and, above all, freedom of the press."
"(FI) Mr President, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are universal fundamental rights and the cornerstones of a democratic society."
"It is sad that harassment, intimidation and arrests are used as a means of suppressing the diversity of civil society."
"Azerbaijan is party to the European Convention on Human Rights and a member of the Council of Europe, and it has a responsibility to safeguard its citizens' human rights and respect them."
"Bloggers, journalists and civil society activists are denied freedom of speech in Azerbaijan and peaceful protests are prevented."
"Young people are prevented from using new communications technology and social media, and are even punished if they do use them."
"This is ironical, because the state would definitely benefit from an active and diverse civil society."
"Azerbaijan should be supported in its democratic and human rights development within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership."
"Mr President, the resolution on Azerbaijan expresses our concern about eventual North African echoes in this, a European partnership country."
"The leadership there should avoid, in its approaches to the opposition and peaceful protestors, any similarity with the regimes in North Africa, Russia or Belarus."
"That suggestion and warning can be read in the document before us, certain points of which could express that criticism with more clarity."
"The wording on the worsening human rights situation and the increased number of incidents should be preceded by the word 'recently', as this is not about general developments over the years going from bad to worse."
"On the contrary, until the spring events, Azerbaijan was making relatively good progress and was not listed by Human Rights Watch among such poorly-viewed states as China, Iraq, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia or Uzbekistan."
"As it was not mentioned, Azerbaijan looked better, but now we need a little more balance."
"(RO) Mr President, not only as an active partner of the European Union within the European Neighbourhood Policy and Eastern Partnership, but also as a founding member of Euronest, Azerbaijan must fulfil the commitments it has made to the European Union."
"This includes having respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as well as for the basic freedoms guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and other international treaties to which Azerbaijan is party."
"A country aspiring to become a globally recognised democracy cannot operate without allowing its citizens to demonstrate peacefully, especially young people."
"It is not normal either to ban them from taking their exams just because they hold different political opinions to those of the country's current leaders."
"We European partners would like to see in Azerbaijan an ongoing dialogue with civil society, a press which enjoys freedom of expression and can report without any political pressure so as to provide the public with correct information, as well as free, uncensored access to the Internet to facilitate communication between Azerbaijan and Europe."
"(LT) Mr President, there are two faces to modern Azerbaijan."
"On the one hand, Azerbaijan demonstrates impressive economic growth, which highlights the huge amount of oil, progress in negotiations with the European Union on an association agreement and participation in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly."
"On the other hand, there are arrests, press restrictions, in other words, a situation that is dangerously reminiscent of the one in Belarus, which my fellow Members spoke about."
"I believe that the authorities in Baku must resolve to listen to public opinion, because sitting on the fence is not an option, and the European Union, with all its instruments, should help it choose the right direction."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, developments in Azerbaijan regarding democracy and human rights continue to be a matter of serious concern to all of us."
"Over the last few years, we have noted a worrying trend of increasing restrictions in this domain."
"Parliamentary elections held on 7 November 2010 were not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country."
"There are other areas where we believe that Azerbaijan needs to improve its record of meeting fully its Council of Europe and OSCE commitments."
"First of all, media freedom: overall, there is a lack of media pluralism."
"There are also reports of harassment of, and violence against, journalists, as well as questionable judicial proceedings against media representatives."
"Individual cases in this field remain a concern."
"Freedom of assembly is another area where I am deeply worried."
"The recent months have witnessed several severe actions taken by the authorities vis-à-vis organised protests, as well as attempts to organise protests inspired by the Arab Spring revolutions."
"The detention of activists and other repressive measures against protesters are deeply deplorable."
"The European Union has a responsibility to convey clear messages on the importance of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law."
"Such messages were passed on by President Barroso himself during his visit to Baku in January, and will be high on our agenda for future visits."
"Human rights and democracy are cornerstones in our cooperation with Azerbaijan under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Last year, we established a new Subcommittee on Justice, Freedom, Security and Human Rights and Democracy."
"Democracy and human rights are also a central theme in our negotiations on a new association agreement."
"I welcome the willingness of Azerbaijan to discuss these methods."
"I also welcome the role the European Parliament plays in advocating democratic values to the partners in Azerbaijan, including through its work in the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Committee."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Anyone in Azerbaijan criticising the government is silenced."
"The European Parliament resolution and reports from human rights organisations highlight serious human rights violations."
"One such violation which I have drawn the Council's attention to in a written question concerns the journalist Eynulla Fatullayev, who is still being held in detention, even though a decision was issued by the European Court of Human Rights for him to be released."
"I pointed this out then and I now urge the removal from the Criminal Code of the provisions concerning defamation, slander and insult (Art. 147-148)."
"A recent report about Azerbaijan from Transparency International indicates that the government is not taking measures to combat corruption and that the independence of the judiciary is not guaranteed."
"Furthermore, the authorities responded to the recent protests which took place on 11 March and 2 April with arrests and harassment."
"Democracy is based on people's freely expressed desire."
"I call on the Council and Commission to urge the authorities in Azerbaijan to respect human rights, especially those relating to the freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration, as well as to take concrete measures to combat corruption and reform the justice system."
"The European Union must support all those who risk their lives and freedom in this country for the values which we share."
"Azerbaijan actively participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy, is one of the EU's six Eastern partners, and is among the founders of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly."
"The core values of these three initiatives are respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"These initiatives are intended to foster a continuous political dialogue that can deepen ties between member countries and enable Europe to accompany them along the path to reform."
"We believe that the instrument of the emergency resolution may be inadequate or even counterproductive to the achievement of the desired goal, namely, Azerbaijan steadily progressing towards its objectives of full and modern democracy."
"The institutions set up under the agreements reached at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level are intended to achieve these ends; these are the right place to demand explanations for possible infringements of rights and effectively encourage good behaviour and democratic reforms."
"Once again, we are calling attention to the question of free speech and freedom of the press and to the general policy of treating journalists in Azerbaijan."
"Reports from a variety of sources indicate that the situation of journalists and every kind of political activist in Azerbaijan is becoming increasingly difficult."
"As far back as 2005, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, pledged that all the rights of journalists would be respected and that they would be able to count on help in the event of any kind of danger."
"The facts reveal, however, that those words are just an empty promise."
"As someone who, for many years, worked as a journalist and has a thorough knowledge of the job, this matter is of particular importance to me."
"In Azerbaijan, journalists are constantly hindered from fulfilling their basic role - the reliable and credible provision of information."
"It is unacceptable that journalists are carrying out their work under the threat of arrests and body searches."
"The Azerbaijani authorities have to realise that the activity of free and independent media is a clear signal to the international community that a country is a credible partner on the world stage."
"The message given by the European Parliament should be clear - the benefits of economic cooperation with the European Union must not obscure expectations regarding the need to move towards European standards of respect for fundamental human rights, in particular, free speech and freedom of the press, which are a pillar of democracy and without which it is impossible for a modern democratic society to exist."
"3."
"Belarus (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Belarus."
"Mr President, in evaluating, we must not forget that, just as we try to make an objective evaluation in our own countries, our partners or neighbours deserve exactly the same approach."
"I would like to say as a doctor that violence is still violence, wherever it happens."
"It is contrary to our shared values."
"We must try to ensure that those who are currently in prison are provided with proper conditions from the perspective of health and dignified treatment, wherever they are in the world."
"The newly established Euronest assembly should serve as an instrument of exchange and cooperation."
"In the case of Belarus, it is not possible to fulfil this aim in its entirety due to the measures adopted."
"The overall outcome of the decision means a breach of the Prague Declaration and a slowdown in potentially positive developments concerning mutual cooperation."
"Our efforts are directed towards the creation of the single Europe which young people most of all deserve, including those in Belarus."
"We should therefore reconsider our position, and reconsider whether restrictions are the right instrument for leading civil society in Belarus to see us as a true friend."
"In connection with the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, I would like to ask you to try and see Belarus through a different lens, as a country that has suffered greatly."
"The disaster particularly affected Belarus and, in my opinion, it is an insult to this nation to prevent the people of Belarus from participating in the official act of remembrance."
"I should like to address one further remark to Mr Tannock."
"I know how hard it is to speak quickly in English."
"I love English as the language of Shakespeare."
"Next time, try to speak quickly in the language of Johann von Goethe, and perhaps we will understand you better."
"I say that as a Czech."
"Mr President, in the five months since 19 December, the political atmosphere in Belarus has become dramatically worse."
"There is increasing repression of the democratic opposition, the free press and civil society."
"Belarus is also violating international treaties."
"I was always in favour of dialogue with Minsk, but under current conditions, it is becoming very difficult, if not impossible."
"All the more so, because arbitrary accusations addressed to the European Union are also coming out of Minsk, even harassment."
"The resolution calls for new measures to be found to help Belarusian civil society and the opposition, and this is only fair."
"Perhaps it is an illusion, but I think that even Moscow and Kiev could help by talking to Minsk about the release of political prisoners."
"Mr President, in the previous debate, I, too, along with a number of fellow Members, alluded to the session of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly held last week which the Belarusian MPs were absent from, as you are aware."
"Their absence is justified because MPs in Minsk are not elected freely."
"In addition, the human rights situation in this country remains more than critical."
"I believe that we were all appalled by the repressive measures taken against the protesters in December."
"At the moment, six of the seven candidates who stood against President Lukashenko are still being tried and harassed."
"Many other people, including these candidates' staff, are in prison simply for participating."
"I think that two important things need to be done:"
"1. an independent inquiry must be held into the acts of repression"
"2. I think that the economic sanctions must be extended against Belarus, applying to the state firms in this country which play an important role in shaping the region."
"author. - Mr President, we are discussing the situation in Belarus for the fourth time this year, yet the political prisoners who were apprehended in December have still not been released."
"We are grateful to the Council for reintroducing visa sanctions and an asset freeze on the high Belarusian officials, which demonstrated that our deep concern for the people of Belarus is not only empty rhetoric."
"Perhaps we have not been clear enough."
"Therefore, we are calling on the European Union to extend restrictive measures against Lukashenko's regime."
"Well-advised, targeted, economic sanctions against state-owned enterprises will have an effect that the Belarusian authorities cannot disregard."
"The criminal regime of Lukashenko relies greatly on the income from exports of chemicals, heavy industry and textiles owned by state enterprises."
"By cutting off the European market, we can demonstrate our determined intention to overthrow Lukashenko's regime."
"It is within our capacity to make a difference."
"Regime transition is desperately needed for the people of Belarus."
"We should not deny them their long-awaited liberty."
"Mr President, we are talking about politics and about human rights in the context of Belarus."
"I would like, today, to adopt a somewhat unconventional approach and recall the names of two people who are connected with this subject."
"One of them is my friend, Anatol Lyabedzka, a wonderful Belarusian and European, who only recently was released from prison after spending over 100 days under arrest, something which I am profoundly convinced was unlawful."
"Today, I would like to send him expressions of solidarity from this House - from the majority of MEPs, I am sure - because he is someone who definitely deserves this."
"The second person I would like to mention is Andrzej Poczobut, a journalist who writes for Gazeta Wyborcza, one of Poland's largest newspapers."
"I and hundreds of thousands of Poles would like to appeal for his release."
"He, too, is currently under arrest, and he, too, is being persecuted simply because the Lukashenko regime is afraid of free speech - it is afraid of free speech, which is the foundation of every democracy."
"I think that we Europeans, assembled in this Chamber today, have no option other than to say very loudly: 'yes' for a free Belarus, 'yes' for democracy in Belarus and 'yes' for the Belarusian nation in Europe."
"(Applause)"
"author. - Mr President, once again, I deplore the persisting climate of fear and intimidation towards political opponents in Belarus and the ongoing harassment and persecution of opposition figures since the presidential elections in December 2010."
"Secondly, I strongly condemn all convictions resulting from the criminal charges of mass rioting and find them politically motivated and of a questionable nature."
"I would like to stress that the trials were held behind closed doors."
"Detainees were refused the opportunity to call their witnesses and to meet in proper conditions and on a regular basis with their legal representatives."
"The lawyers of the accused received several warnings from the Ministry of Justice and some of them have been disbarred."
"I consider that this conduct of the trials lacked impartiality."
"Finally, I condemn the lack of respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of assembly and of expression shown by the Belarusian authorities and call for the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining protestors still in custody and for all charges against them to be dropped."
"Mr President, the situation in Belarus is indeed deteriorating, literally from one day to the next, in both political and economic terms."
"From the political point of view and in terms of civil liberties, we are seeing trials being started against the main opponents of Alexander Lukashenko in the last presidential elections, and we can see the scandalous procedure being applied in these trials."
"We are also witnessing the repression of independent media, including, in particular, the fact that Andrzej Poczobut has been detained for many weeks now."
"The economic deterioration can be seen in the redenomination of the rouble, the financial crisis and the problems with current payments."
"In addition, Alexander Lukashenko is losing control, not only over the situation in the country, but also over his own behaviour, which can be seen in the astonishing, shocking and offensive statements made in reference to the President of Ukraine and Mr Barroso."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commission, Council, it is time to stop the words and the appeals - it is time for action."
"Paragraph 8 of our resolution says clearly: it is time to introduce economic sanctions, because this is the only language which Lukashenko understands."
"If, today, we bring in economic sanctions, we can expect that the scandalous trials and the scandalous repression will finally end, because it is only this language which Lukashenko understands."
"It is, therefore, time to move to another and more resolute phase of reaction to what is going on in Belarus."
"Mr President, Belarus is not called Europe's last dictatorship for nothing."
"In Belarus, you can go to prison for standing for election or expressing your opinion publicly."
"The last presidential elections were not democratic."
"Furthermore, the laws of Belarus do not permit freedom of assembly, let alone freedom of speech."
"Harassment of the opposition and of independent human rights groups have now become a chronic problem in the country."
"Workable democracy depends on the active participation of the opposition and of civil society in the political debate."
"Human rights are universal, inalienable and interdependent."
"Belarus has a responsibility to safeguard its citizens' human rights and respect them."
"Belarus must be supported in every way possible in its development of workable democracy and human rights within the framework of the EU's Eastern Partnership."
"The EU needs to consider targeted sanctions and their use, since civil society should not be penalised given the current situation in Belarus."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, there is not a single indication that the Belarusian regime will change by itself in the coming months or years."
"It is only under very strong European Union pressure that we can expect anything to happen."
"Belarus keeps on violating all fundamental rights and civil liberties."
"Over the past month, we have seen the Belarusian authorities repeatedly demonstrating their disdain and contempt for the fundamental rights of freedom of assembly and expression."
"We could talk here about the matrix of the unchangeability of Lukashenko and his regime, but we cannot end on that pessimistic note."
"We should understand that a proper response would be a signal to Belarusians - to the Belarusian nation - that they are welcome in Europe, with, at the same time, pressure on the regime and some very principled words about their violation of human rights."
"We must not be misled by Lukashenko's occasional making up to the European Union just to infuriate Russia temporarily, or vice versa."
"This is unacceptable."
"What is happening in Belarus has to be evaluated in a very principled way, and more pressure has to be applied."
"Mr President, we have talked in this Chamber about what is happening in Belarus on average once every two months since the beginning of the year - this is now the third time."
"We have talked about cases of human rights violations, we have mentioned the names of opposition activists who have been put in prison and we have discussed how the ability of many civil and non-governmental organisations to operate is restricted."
"We should, indeed, condemn all these matters and we should protest very strongly against them."
"However, I think it is equally important, and perhaps even more important, for there to be specific and real involvement from the European Union in building civil society, providing financial support for non-governmental organisations and free media, and also in imposing economic sanctions."
"As for economic sanctions, I think the right moment has come and that we should introduce them as quickly as possible."
"Today, we are going to vote on a resolution which is intended to give moral support to Belarusian society."
"In my opinion, this should be followed by specific measures, including financial measures and economic sanctions, which will allow the restoration of freedom and democracy in Belarus."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two questions came to my mind during our discussion about the human rights situation in Belarus."
"The first one: what would you say if, one or two years from now, you were to see one of the members of the current Lukashenko government here in the European Parliament, in a place none other than the Vice-President's chair of the LIBE Committee in charge of civil liberties and human rights?"
"And my second question: when will we get to the point where, on these Thursday afternoon discussions, I will see on the agenda amongst non-EU countries the United States or Israel, for instance, particularly since we are already continuously discussing their human rights situations?"
"Let me mention a few additional details regarding these two questions in the remaining two minutes: There was the issue of the member of the Lukashenko government."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Kinga Göncz, member of the government of the Hungarian Lukashenko, Ferenc Gyurcsány, presides in the Vice-President's chair of the LIBE Committee, and is lecturing the representatives of Italy, France and other democracies about human rights."
"What was it exactly that made this Hungarian Lukashenko, Ferenc Gyurcsány, famous?"
"The same things, and, to a certain extent, even more pronounced, that this report here is listing in relation to Lukashenko and Belarus to which you are raising an objection, setting the bar considerably higher for Lukashenko and Belarus, a country outside of the European Union, than the one you were using for Hungary and Ferenc Gyurcsány, including the fact that the Hungarian Lukashenko forcefully broke up every significant anti-government protest."
"I myself have now received compensation and an apology from the police for having shot me, a European Parliament candidate, point blank in the face with tear gas."
"The most stupefying fact is that there are people still in prison today, some of them serving final prison sentences and some under preliminary detention, who were leading figures of the anti-government protests."
"My other question pertains to the United States."
"They have the death penalty as well, and the torture inflicted in Guantánamo is the same as in Belarus, to which you are objecting."
"Could it be that someone is intent on getting their hands on the national assets of Belarus?"
"Is not this the reason for this country being randomly selected, especially in view of the fact that you are threatening to use sanctions against its national assets and state-owned companies?"
"(DE) Mr President, I am not often of one mind with Mr Maštálka, but today I am."
"Firstly, I would like to say that all the parties need to fight for democracy and the rule of law to finally prevail in Belarus."
"Secondly, I want to make the case for multilingualism."
"Like him, I come from a mini-Europe, the former Habsburg Empire, which was no bad thing in many regards, but which fell apart because the biggest linguistic group - namely mine, the German speakers - always insisted on everyone speaking German."
"That meant the end of a multinational community."
"Charles, I hold you in a very high regard, but we are here for multilingualism and precisely for the rights of the minor languages."
"Turning to Belarus, I want to say that, 20 years ago, Croatia and Slovenia became free countries - I was there - and in the August, the Baltic States, Russia and Ukraine followed."
"Nobody would have thought that, 20 years later, there would still be a dictatorship in Europe."
"Unfortunately, there is not only one."
"There is Belarus, there is a trend towards a dictatorship in Russia, there is a sliding backwards in Ukraine and there are problems in Moldova and Transnistria."
"We need to see, therefore, quite simply, that our entire eastern neighbourhood is facing a threat to its freedom to varying degrees."
"We therefore need to be very clear, think strategically and make freedom and the rule of law the yardstick for our relations throughout our eastern neighbourhood, and particularly when it comes to Belarus."
"(PL) Mr President, I will begin on a personal note."
"The organisation Libereco Partnership for Human Rights has asked me to take over a prisoner's godparenthood for an opposition activist imprisoned in Belarus."
"I have been asked to adopt Dmitry Bandarenka."
"I would like to suggest that all of you who are involved in these matters could ask this organisation to allow you to take on the personal patronage of repressed Belarusians and their families - this would be something of a response to the problem of what we can do for those who are, in fact, not far away, in a country which shares a border with the European Union."
"However, I am sure that all of us support strong and clear steps."
"It has already been said in this Chamber that there must be sanctions and there must be strong words, because we can only talk to Lukashenko using a language he understands - well, he understands the language of his own interest, and he understands the language of strength."
"To rescue human rights, and to rescue democracy, we must use a language which is understood in Minsk."
"I have the impression that although we have already spoken many times about this in this Chamber, not much has come from these words of ours."
"This is, of course, an appeal both to this House and to all bodies and institutions of the European Union, but it is also a challenge which I propose that you take back to your countries and national governments, because they have at least the same power to persuade Mr Lukashenko to establish democracy and freedom in Belarus as we do as representatives of the European Union."
"FI) Mr President, following the elections in December, President Lukashenko of Belarus began purposely to crush the already weak political opposition and the independent media."
"Around 40 people who had taken part in the demonstrations following the elections were charged with civil disorder, which can carry a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment."
"The antidemocratic power in Belarus is concentrated very much in the President."
"Lukashenko is now in his fourth term of office, and for 16 years, he has shown that his moves in the direction of democracy are just a very cynical game."
"The restrictions on Belarus imposed by the EU are therefore fully justified and should even be stepped up."
"I strongly support the call issued yesterday by Parliament to the International Ice Hockey Federation for Belarus to lose its right to host the 2014 World Championships unless it frees all its political prisoners."
"The EU should also impose targeted economic sanctions and intensify its support for NGOs in Belarus."
"(RO) Mr President, the international community, which also includes the European Union, has been appealing to the Belarusian authorities for a long time to respect the international commitments which they have assumed, to stop the repressive measures used against opposition representatives, to free the protesters arrested during various demonstrations, to end the repressive measures against the free press, civil society and human rights activists, and to allow fair, transparent trials to be conducted."
"The Belarusian authorities need to understand that if they fail to respect human rights and the rule of law, in compliance with the joint declaration made at the Eastern Partnership Summit on 7 May 2009, of which the Belarusian Government is also a cosignatory, the European Union will not be able to offer any commitment of support."
"author. - Mr President, I asked for the floor because I wanted to refer to the words Ms Morvai used earlier."
"Kinga Göncz is not from my party but I am appalled by the way that Ms Morvai used a debate about the last dictatorship in Europe - Belarus under Mr Lukashenko - to discredit an honourable Member of this Parliament by calling her a Hungarian Lukashenko."
"(Applause)"
"This is not in keeping with the values or the honour of our common European Parliament, to which we have all been elected."
"Mr President, I wonder whether Ms Lunacek heard me while I was saying that Ms Göncz was a member of the Hungarian Lukashenko's government - Mr Gyurcsány's government."
"Please answer the question, Ms Lunacek."
"What do you know about the massive human rights violations that were committed in Hungary in 2006?"
"Please summarise it."
"They were no less serious and no fewer in number than those of Lukashenko, and as a human rights lawyer, I strongly condemn both - your comrades shooting at people's eyes and arbitrary detentions, as well as Lukashenko's violations of human rights."
"Both are intolerable and you, as Members of Parliament, should fight against both."
"author. - Mr President, I guess the previous speaker was simply confusing facts."
"In Hungary, there is no Lukashenko party."
"I am not from Hungary and I am not from a Social Democratic party or group here, but I refuse to accept that a Member of this Parliament can criticise somebody else in this Parliament as being a member of a dictatorship party in another non-EU country."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Göncz is an MEP in the same group as me."
"You can be against Ferenc Gyurcsány, or for him."
"You can disapprove of Mrs Göncz, or you can support her."
"It is absolutely up to every individual to decide for themselves, freely and independently, whether they are for or against a given person's political conviction."
"The debate that we are holding here concerns the last dictatorship left in Europe."
"We are holding it about one of the most brutal and bloodiest dictators on the continent of Europe."
"I find it totally unacceptable for a freely elected, democratic Member of my group to be compared with a bloodthirsty dictator."
"I feel that Parliament must also rebuff this, especially when it comes from the representative of a party that is characterised by a hate and persecution that it bestows on the Roma minority in Hungary that is unparalleled across Europe."
"If there is one person here who does not have the right to criticise Mrs Göncz, then that person is Mrs Morvai."
"(Applause)"
"author. - Mr President, I will be talking about Belarus and not Hungarian domestic politics."
"It is 20 years since the Soviet Union collapsed, but for President Lukashenko of Belarus, it is as if nothing has changed at all."
"Political repression is as rife as it ever was in the Soviet days, and Lukashenko's secret police - provocatively still called the KGB - are used as its enforcers."
"As we remember from the post-election protests in December last year, Lukashenko is intolerant of dissent and seems to take pleasure in using violence and intimidation against pro-democracy activists."
"As this resolution today illustrates in graphic detail, Lukashenko has intensified his campaign for persecution and harassment against those who dare challenge his iron-fisted rule."
"We call on him to end this futile crackdown, to release all political prisoners and instead to restore Belarus to the path of genuine, pluralist, multi-party democracy."
"At last week's constitutive session of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, representatives from Belarus were rightly missing."
"Belarus is the missing piece of Europe's democratic jigsaw puzzle, and I long for the day when it rejoins the European family."
"(LV) Mr President, I fully support the insistence of the European Parliament and of the Members present that human rights not only in the European Union, but also throughout the whole of the world, are fundamental rights, namely, the foundations of life."
"However, I do not support broadly charging a country (without citing any specific examples), its leader or all of its people with crimes that they have not committed."
"If we are talking about the fact that someone in the opposition (and not only from the opposition, but others too) is arrested after certain events, and see in that circumstance some sort of dictatorship, then what is the purpose of courts in a democratic system?"
"Let the courts deal with whatever happened there, and with who has been rightly and wrongly sentenced or arrested."
"The fact that you belong to the opposition is not yet grounds for allowing you to do whatever comes into your head."
"I ask for an extremely tolerant and balanced attitude towards everyone."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned about the situation in Belarus and particularly the developments in the wake of the violation of electoral standards at the presidential elections on 19 December 2010."
"The crackdown is now further intensifying, with a number of ongoing trials against ex-presidential candidates and most of the remaining detained activists."
"At the same time, proceedings are ongoing which could result in the closure of two of the remaining independent newspapers - Nasha Niva and Narodnaya Volya - and the harassment of the political opposition, civil society and the independent media continues."
"Vice-President/High Representative Ashton has made a number of general and specific statements on the situation in Belarus."
"We have in clear words condemned the deteriorating situation and have repeatedly called upon Belarus to end the ongoing crackdown on the political opposition and civil society, release all political prisoners and discontinue the politically-motivated trials."
"We have also expressed our grave concern at reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment, intimidation and court irregularities."
"Let me also remind you that in January, the Council adopted restrictive measures comprising a travel ban and an asset freeze."
"The list now comprises 175 individuals - which should be compared to the 40 names put forward for an asset freeze and visa ban after the 2006 elections - and we stand ready to include further names, as warranted by developments."
"In addition, we are considering options for further possible measures, including on the economic side."
"In our messages, we have made it clear that we want to continue our engagement with the Belarusian people and civil society."
"We are moving ahead on the issue of visa facilitation."
"Negotiating directives for visa facilitation and readmission agreements were adopted by the Council on 28 February, and we are encouraging Member States to make optimal use of the existing flexibilities offered by the Visa Code, in particular, the possibility of waiving and reducing visa fees for certain categories of citizens."
"In terms of assistance, the Commission is quadrupling its assistance to the Belarusian population and civil society."
"We remain committed to a policy of critical engagement in Belarus."
"This was made clear by the 31 January conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council."
"At the same time, it is clear that any deepening of our bilateral relations will depend on Belarus proving its willingness to respect the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"In conclusion, let me say that the situation in Belarus remains high on our agenda."
"I am glad to see that a large majority in this Parliament is committed to continuing a serious debate about this and to resisting distractions."
"We shall continue to monitor developments closely, and we stand ready to react as appropriate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"For a long time, we have been witnesses to the European Union's political impotence in the face of the tragic situation in Belarus."
"Successive appeals and resolutions have not been effective."
"The heavy-handed rule of Alexander Lukashenko gags the opposition, convicting its leaders and sending them to prison and to what are called 'penal colonies'."
"In this context, one need only mention the names of opposition presidential candidate Andrei Sannikau, whose trial began a month ago, and Mikalai Statkevich, who is being held under arrest by the KGB."
"What has the Union done to secure their release?"
"The key to a successful revolution in Belarus is Russia, which has always been an ally of the regime."
"It would, therefore, be a good idea at the next meeting with the leaders of the Kremlin to stop talking about a common zone of European security from the Atlantic to the Urals, as the leaders of France and Germany want, and to take up the real challenges which lie just over our border."
"The economic crisis in Belarus is the best time for change."
"All international aid should be made dependent on democratic change in Belarus."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law(debate)"
"1."
"Sri Lanka: follow-up of the UN report ("
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of Véronique De Keyser, I should like to move an oral amendment to paragraph 13, which would read:"
"'Calls on the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the Council and the Commission to support further efforts to strengthen the process of accountability in Sri Lanka and to support the UN report, in particular the immediate establishment of an international justice mechanism'."
"Mr President, we had long-drawn-out negotiations involving six political groups on this particular resolution."
"It is a compromise resolution and obviously it contains elements that many of us wish were not in it, and indeed it excludes elements that many of us wish were in it. But the agreement among the six political groups was that there would be no amendments - oral, written or in any other form - and therefore I think it is a breach of the understanding, and makes a nonsense of the negotiations, if we now have an amendment put forward in this way."
"We should therefore reject this amendment."

"Announcements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, on 4 June, we commemorated the 22nd anniversary of two important events."
"On this day in 1989, the authorities of the People's Republic dealt with the protesters in Tiananmen Square in such a way that the protests ended in bloodshed."
"We all remember this."
"Also on the same day, 22 years ago, the first partly-free parliamentary elections took place in Central and Eastern Europe, in Poland, where candidates of the democratic opposition won, taking almost all the seats which were open to a free vote."
"Of these seats open to a free vote, the representatives of the democratic opposition won every seat bar one in the Senate."
"They won all the remaining seats in the Sejm as well as the Senate."
"These two anniversaries remind us how much has changed in Europe and how we Europeans were able to push through changes in Central and Eastern Europe with minimal losses, which culminated in the reunification of Eastern and Western Europe."
"° ° ° °"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will now give you some very important information."

"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"[Monday]:"
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has submitted a motion for a debate on the selection process of a new Managing Director for the IMF and external representation of the euro, directly after Jo Leinen's report on European environmental economic accounts."
"The motion will be presented on behalf of the ALDE Group by Sylvie Goulard."
"You have the floor."
"Mr President, as a matter of courtesy, I would ask that Commissioner Rehn be allowed to sit in on the debate on European environmental economic accounts and then on the debate on the IMF."
"They are not political debates."
"I therefore hope that all the other groups will agree to this as a favour to our Commissioner, who, I might add, is working very hard at the moment."
"Mr President, I consider that the request can be granted because I do not see any reason to refuse it."
"The debate on the selection process of a new Managing Director for the International Monetary Fund and external representation of the euro area will take place directly after Mr Leinen's report on European environmental economic accounts."
"This is a slight change to the agenda."
"(The order of business was adopted)"
"Commemoration of deportations in 1941 in the Baltic States"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this month sees the 70th anniversary of mass deportations carried out by the Soviet authorities from the Baltic States, which they had occupied since 1940."
"These deportations were chiefly designed to deprive Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of their social and political elite."
"Scientists and representatives of political circles were eliminated, and people who were famous for being free thinkers were eliminated too."
"Today, it is our common duty to cherish the memory of the hundreds of thousands of victims of the Soviet terror in the Baltic States, and to condemn in the strongest terms the totalitarian system and the crimes against humanity committed by its leaders."
"The suffering of the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian nations gave them the determination and strength to fight for independence and to return to a united Europe half a century later."
"I also wanted to remind you that 22 June, in two weeks' time, will be the 70th anniversary of the attack on the Soviet Union by Hitler's Germany."
"This attack marked the severance of their previous alliance and the secret Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939, which divided up Europe."
"We thus have a series of anniversaries which are important for us to remember, and for Europe to remember, but I believe that the presence of our fellow Members from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia proves that Europeans are able to conquer adversity and overcome huge tension, which is why we are very pleased to see our fellow Members here with us, particularly today."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, thank you for your kind words of solidarity."
"Seventy years ago, about 50 000 Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian nationals were brutally deported from their homes in the Soviet-occupied Baltic States."
"If we compare that figure of 50 000 out of the then 5.5 million population of the three Baltic States to that of the UK or France, the 50 000 Baltic deportees would have meant proportionately 432 000 citizens deported from the UK or 363 000 persons deported from France."
"Happily, this did not happen in these countries."
"Already in May 1941, as the President has said, the Soviet leadership had decided to cleanse Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia of anti-Soviet elements in political and economic elites."
"The deportees were transported in cattle wagons to Soviet Siberia and the far north to face hunger, cold and forced labour."
"Men were separated from their families and brought to prison camps where many of them died or were executed."
"In many places, almost 50% of the deportees died."
"The 1941 deportations delivered a devastating blow to democratic civil society."
"This indiscriminate violence caused deep psychological traumas for the victims, resulting in long-lasting fears, suppressed emotions, self-censorship and passiveness."
"This led to the feeling that justice could never prevail."
"To quote Sakharov Prize winner, Sergei Kovalev, there is no doubt that in modern terminology, these acts were crimes against humanity."
"Therefore, the remembrance, 70 years later, of the Baltic deportations is an opportunity for a deepened understanding that your past is our past and vice versa."
"The full knowledge of the 1941 crimes against humanity should become an integral part of our common European history."
"Dear colleagues, I would like to thank you all for your attention and solidarity, which the nations of the Baltic countries have been looking forward to for so many years."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Kelam, Members from the Baltic States, ladies and gentlemen, today we are, in particular, commemorating the expulsions and mass deportations from the Baltic States."
"These expulsions are among the darkest events of European history."
"The last century has been described, not without justification, as the century of expulsions."
"We are showing respect today for all of the victims of these inhumane acts."
"In this regard, we are demanding a full investigation of Soviet history and, in particular, the atrocities of Stalinism."
"The Russia of today should not see this as a political attack, but as an offer of support in engaging with its own history, which, just like the history of the other countries in Europe, is characterised by positive as well as negative times."
"However, just as we remember the victims from the Baltic States, we also think of the Armenians, who were expelled from Turkey at the start of the last century."
"We remember the so-called population exchange between Turkey and Greece."
"Deportations in Europe reached a peak, in particular, in the middle of the century as a result of the Nazi regime and the Communist regime of the Soviet Union."
"The expulsions following the Second World War also left deep wounds, as did the expulsions during the war in the former Yugoslavia."
"However, we must not forget that many cases of colonial rule were also characterised by expulsions."
"We must call for a serious debate on the various forms of expulsions and the supposed reasons for them."
"This should also include an investigation of guilt and punishment of the guilty, as far as this is still possible in any case, as is now happening in the case of Mladič, for example."
"The decisive answer to this, however, is European unification, particularly with the independent Baltic States, and a clear commitment to continuing the European unification process, which is not yet complete."
"This historic task is something that we owe not only to ourselves, but also, and in particular, to the victims of the many expulsions that have occurred in Europe."
"Many politicians from all of the countries of Europe, from East and West, have worked to bring this about."
"One example is the Gdańsk Declaration, signed by President Kwaśniewski of Poland and President Rau of Germany."
"Since we want to learn from the past, we need to be vigilant and also watch out for the first signs of expulsions taking place, as in the case of the Roma, for example."
"We need to reject any statements like those that maintain that we must send Arab immigrants back across the Mediterranean in their boats, and we must defend ourselves against those who want to put an end to our achievement of a Europe without borders and return once again to narrow-minded nationalism."
"Let us express our deepest respect for all of the victims of expulsions and deportations, but let us be united in committing ourselves to continuing European unification as the only real guarantee against a policy that brought so much misery to the people of Europe and beyond during the last century."
"We must never forget."
"It must never happen again."
"These were calls that were made immediately after the Second World War."
"They are still just as valid today and the best response to them is a united Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the deportations of residents of the Baltic countries in 1941 was one of the most dramatic and tragic events of the 20th century."
"This blow to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, their political communities, and civilised life in general, isolated these nations and countries for five decades."
"It was equally a major blow to European solidarity and European togetherness."
"This isolation only ended in 1991 when it finally became possible to talk about the watershed in the history of the Baltic nations."
"However, it was 2004 - the year of the Baltic countries' accession to the European Union - that really marked the end of the division of Europe."
"The deliberate deportation of innocent civilians, usually the most educated and advanced, was an inseparable part of social engineering of the Stalin era and the struggle against individuals and nations, their memory and dignity."
"Despite this, we can end on an optimistic note."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that, today, we can mention the 70th anniversary of the deportation of innocent people in the Baltic countries, and that we recognise this, gives Europe back its dignity, solidarity and our collective political memory."
"Mr President, although the deportations in the Baltic states on 14 June 1941 and the second wave of deportations in March 1949 led to the subjugation of thousands of innocent people to many years of humiliation in Siberia and in death camps, Europe and world public opinion have not yet, to this day, recognised this fact."
"More than 65 years have passed since the Second World War."
"The evil crimes against humanity that were perpetrated by Hitler's totalitarian regime were long ago identified and prosecuted."
"However, the Stalinist regime's genocide in occupied Eastern European countries, as well as in Russia itself, are still, in some modern political circles, considered to be a theme best not discussed, and even the European Union has not completely evaluated this issue."
"The crimes of the Communist regime have left a lasting negative effect on the psychology of the people of the Baltic States."
"The Communist system, to borrow the words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, was based on lies and terror, and was a crippled system that was unacceptable to human nature."
"It destroyed people's moral values, traditions, solidarity, and self-confidence."
"Why do my compatriots still need to listen to Moscow's story that there really was no occupation of the Baltic countries, that the Baltic countries were not occupied as a result of the Hitler (Molotov-Ribbentrop) pact, and that it was the socialist choice of the Baltic countries in the summer of 1940?"
"Why do I, and why do my compatriots, still need to listen to the story of 'liberation' from these deportees, who were the most educated, and the best people in the Baltic States?"
"Therefore, I call on the European Commission to provide all possible support to proper research into the Communist regime's crimes, which has been called for by the Ministers of Justice of several Member States, including all the Baltic States, and finish this uncompleted task of evaluating the crimes of all totalitarian regimes."
"Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, in the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Hitler and Stalin laid down their spheres of interest in Central Europe, and the consequences, for the Baltic States, in particular, were devastating."
"Just as they did in Belarus, the Soviets soon planned the deportation of the leading sections of society in the Baltic States, and the first mass deportations took place during the night of 13 to 14 June."
"Without prior warning and without charge, people were taken from their homes."
"In 2002, the Estonian Parliament declared the deportations to be a crime against humanity."
"In Estonia, 14 June is a national day of commemoration."
"The day is one of remembrance and mourning, but it is also a sign of appreciation of the current democratic and independent Estonia."
"In Europe and around the world, 14 June draws attention to the often forgotten suffering of small states and peoples, particularly in the former Soviet Union."
"The debate is closed."
"European environmental economic accounts (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European environmental economic accounts - C7-0092/2010 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating, and tomorrow we will adopt, European legislation that, on first impression, seems rather unremarkable, but with this law on European environmental economic accounts, we are probably opening a new chapter in the measurement of progress and prosperity."
"We have known for a long time that gross national product is inadequate."
"The purely quantitative view of economic activity says nothing about the environmental balance sheet, nor about the social balance sheet, and therefore it is high time that we measured whether, year on year, we are doing well or badly in terms of our measures and efforts."
"We have monthly statistics relating to our labour market figures and we have annual statistics relating to our economic figures."
"We therefore know exactly what is happening in these areas."
"However, we have an incomplete patchwork of data on the environmental impact."
"This law on environmental economic accounts is intended to help us to draw up an accurate balance sheet in the 27 Member States and to establish whether we are making progress or, as is often the case, whether we are going backwards."
"As long ago as 2002, Parliament called for reliable information to be collected on the state of the environment and the most important trends in, influences on, and causes of, environmental change, and for the public to be informed of these things."
"We want a scientifically sound concept for measuring the consumption of resources to enable appropriate political decisions to be taken."
"We are pleased that the Commission took this legislative initiative in April 2010, but in our opinion, it was much too tentative in the way it went about it."
"We in Parliament and all of the groups have called for this to be done much more quickly, because the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have already been discussing these matters for 15 years."
"This is taking far too long."
"We have therefore made considerable progress in the negotiations with the Council."
"It was a very difficult situation in the Council, because some Member States do not produce an environmental balance sheet and we first need to create a foundation in all 27 Member States."
"The Commission proposed the inclusion of three modules."
"These modules are air emissions - in this regard, we are very well aware of which gases are emitted into the air."
"Then there is the financial expenditure arising from environmental taxes and environmental charges."
"Thirdly, there are the year-on-year national material flows, the input and output, measured in purely quantitative terms."
"This is a start, perhaps, but it is too simple a start, and Parliament has called for us also to produce water, energy and waste balance sheets and to find out about the status of our forests."
"These are the modules that we urgently want to see in the very near future."
"There was disagreement about whether statistics can also be produced for the marine environment, in other words, statistics on the status of fish stocks."
"In this regard, our methodology is probably still in need of improvement."
"Thus, we have achieved improvements in this area."
"In two years' time - by 2013 at the latest - the Commission is to present a report and, where possible, also propose a revision of this directive."
"I hope that, at the end of this decade, we will have a green national product in addition to the gross national product."
"That is our goal."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as the rapporteur, Jo Leinen, said, the purpose of the Commission proposal is indeed to establish a common legal framework for the collection, compilation, transmission and evaluation of European environmental economic accounts in order to facilitate more balanced decision making with the goal of sustainable development."
"With the presentation of this proposal, the Commission has delivered its first item on the 'Beyond GDP' road map."
"At a time when we are striving, in Europe, to achieve a resource-efficient and sustainable economy, this data will allow us to link environmental factors to economic ones and thus offers the possibility of more comprehensive and better-informed policy making."
"Following very fruitful cooperation between the three institutions, I believe we have reached our common objective, namely, the establishment of this framework regulation on European environmental economic accounts with its first set of three modules, which cover air emissions accounts, environmentally-related taxes or levies and material flow accounts."
"Currently, this data is collected on a voluntary basis by the majority of Member States."
"For the most part, therefore, the collection of the relevant data will not impose any additional burden on respondents, as the Member States concerned should be able to compile the data by using existing data sources."
"With this regulation, we have established an important basis for statistical information about the interplay between the economy and the environment, which we hope to expand with further modules in the future as included in the report and the draft resolution."
"As the various other possible modules are at different stages of methodological maturity, including, for instance, timber and fish as well as unused extraction, a modular structure has been adopted for the regulation with a view to possibly introducing new modules as annexes to the core text in the future."
"As agreed, the Commission will report to Parliament and the Council every three years on the development of new modules and, if appropriate, the Commission may also put forward new legislative proposals for the new modules."
"Let me conclude by thanking the rapporteur, Jo Leinen, the shadow rapporteur, Mr Martin, and all the members of the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their constructive approach and their very valuable contributions."
"Mr President, when Mr Leinen and I come back to political positions of the last millennium, we are mostly in agreement, and that is also the case with this report."
"This is something good, sensible and important."
"After all, statistics can be sexy, particularly at a time when the European Union has a huge credibility problem where European citizens are concerned."
"I would say that that is largely unjustified if we look at the major issues and not at the other matters on which Mr Leinen and I are divided."
"I think it is very good to be able to stand here, not only as a non-attached Member, but as someone who, with this opinion on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - it was not a shadow report, but a supplementary opinion that is even more comprehensive than that of the lead committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - is able to represent these positions that we have set out with a vote of 37 to 0."
"In specific terms, this means that we want - as I put it - to move towards a system of European sustainability statistics, nicely abbreviated to ESS."
"That would give us something to work with, particularly where young people are concerned and those who know that we will need new agreements on common goals in the future in order to be able to bring Europe out of the shadows and to the forefront in this brutal competition with the United States, China and many other powers."
"This clearly also means - as Mr Leinen has already mentioned - that we urgently need more modules."
"In this regard, we can look back to the 1970s and 1980s, when all of this had already been worked out."
"It would be very nice if the Commission could make swifter progress in this regard."
"I think it is very good that there has been movement in Eurostat with regard to the collection of data, even if it is under difficult circumstances in relation to Greece."
"With a vote of 37 to 0 to 0, we are of the opinion that the Commission clearly needs more money in this area for an ESS, for this system of European sustainability statistics."
"However, we can achieve that by reallocating funds: use the enlargement dividends at last."
"Take the officials who were so busy with the enlargement phase for the large states and put them where we so urgently need them, where they can help with the functioning of a European project."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I read the first proposal from the Commission, I was very sceptical about the way it dealt with this matter."
"However, what the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and my predecessor, Mrs Joly, have now presented is something that we are able to accept and also support."
"In most countries, environmental economic data - whether or not they relate to these three modules - are already collected on a voluntary basis."
"We need a clear overview of the results that are achieved in the individual Member States with regard to air emissions, environmental taxes and material flows."
"That is very important."
"It can give us a better understanding of the relationship between the environment and the economy."
"We can also examine how sustainable economic development in Europe is progressing and how we can refine our environmental policy."
"That is a very important point that we should include here."
"I would like to issue a word of warning, however: in our soapbox speeches, we are always talking about reducing bureaucracy."
"I would like to appeal to the Commission not to create additional bureaucracy in this area."
"That would be the wrong approach."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission whether it is planning to create new positions within the Commission for the collection of the data, or whether it will manage with its existing staff, because I think it is very important that the collection of this data does not result in new burdens."
"Only once we have the first implementation report in 2013 can and should we decide what other modules should be included, because we need to see how this new system develops and what impact it has on legislation."
"I was very shocked when I discovered that this was not intended to be debated here in Parliament today."
"That would have been a big mistake, because, as the rapporteur said, this is the start of something completely new."
"Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers."
"It is incredibly important that we have a climate and environment policy that is based on facts."
"We need access to clearer and more reliable indicators in this area."
"The same conditions apply to environmental policy as to economic, redistribution, development and industrial policy."
"We cannot take sensible decisions and bring about the necessary changes and adaptations in society if we do not have access to the facts."
"We now have an opportunity to obtain these facts."
"This is extremely important."
"The GDP yardstick does not work as well in this particular area because it is too narrow."
"We now have an opportunity to work with a broader perspective."
"There is also considerable value in coordinating environmental statistics at European level."
"It would make it easier to compare the effects of environmental policy between the Member States and it will give us a better picture of which policy measures actually work and which do not, and which ones may even be counterproductive."
"Once we have taken this decision during this sitting, I hope we will also be able to ensure that it becomes an important part of the basis for the decisions that Parliament and the Member States will take in the future."
"I hope that this method of determining the quality of a society is given high priority and that sufficient resources are earmarked to enable it to work properly and not to simply remain an unimplemented idea."
"Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, for his report."
"After many years of pushing and cajoling, we finally seem to be taking this step towards sustainable national accounts and that is highly necessary as - let us be entirely honest - the economic system that we have at the moment is simply not working."
"At the moment, you can still damage nature and the environment practically free of charge."
"The current system therefore does not work."
"These costs that no one pays are diverted onto society instead."
"Why is sustainable energy more expensive than conventional energy?"
"The answer is that nobody pays the social costs of burning coal, gas and oil."
"This report gives the impression of being entirely technical, but ultimately it is about really important matters."
"You have to measure something to know, as we say in Dutch, and that is what we are talking about here."
"These European environmental economic accounts are necessary for the switchover to a truly sustainable economy."
"However, I call on both the Commission and the Member States to actually do something with the data that these accounts will provide."
"You have to measure something to know about it, that is very important, but using the knowledge that we gain from doing so is even more important and that, surely, is the essential next step."
"I sincerely hope that this, for example, will lead to the removal of the hundreds of billions in subsidies that have a deleterious effect on the environment and nature that we still have in this world."
"Let me just offer my sincere thanks to the Commission and our rapporteur once again."
"This, however, is just the beginning."
"Let us also follow up on this by truly taking the steps that the knowledge provided by this measure makes possible."
"Mr President, it goes without saying, both from what we have heard today and from the report, that we need a substantiated evaluation of European environmental policy, based on reliable data."
"The collection of such data should therefore be compulsory and harmonised."
"However, conventional national accounts focus mainly on market transactions and on indicators that reflect important factors in creating prosperity, but do not measure prosperity itself."
"However, there are new shortages of natural resources."
"We need other incentives to boost productivity and quality."
"There is a charge on the physical recipients."
"By failing to provide accounts on the private and social cost of the use of natural resources and on the damage to the environment, conventional accounts may send the wrong progress message to the decision makers and this may put society on the road to non-sustainable growth."
"The introduction of environmental economic accounts is fundamentally important, but is no substitute for the creation of alternative indicators to GDP which cover the various environmental and social dimensions."
"The Commission should table proposals, before the start of the new Multiannual Financial Framework, so that a limited package of compound indicators can be adopted and used to supplement GDP in policy making."
"They should include a monetised indicator, such as adjusted net disbursements, and a physical indicator, such as an ecological or carbon footprint, for the environmental dimension, and social indicators which incorporate the social dimension, such as an inequality evaluation (for example, the Gini coefficient) and a social integration and human prosperity index, such as the Human Poverty Index."
"The initial proposal for an EU regulation only makes provision for data to be collected and collated on atmospheric emissions, the environmental terms imposed on various economic activities and macroeconomic material flow accounting."
"A series of proposals and amendments has been tabled and I believe that these will allow us to adopt an integrated report and to achieve progress on the question of environmental policy."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, a regulation on the European environmental economic accounts sounds very boring but, in my experience, that makes it the most dangerous kind of EU legislation, because you think that the taxpayer and the media will not bother to read it."
"Let us be frank."
"This is about - and I quote - 'air emissions and environmental taxes', just as the last speaker said."
"So the Sovietisation of the EU continues."
"The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and - let us be honest - you want this data to tax and control, which explains your thirst for ever more statistics."
"The worst thing of all is that this is a regulation, not a directive."
"Regulations are far worse than directives because they pass into UK law and bypass the UK Parliament."
"This is very dangerous and, my friends, this is the way democracy dies."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) We have been elected as Members of the European Parliament."
"If you only see yourself as a UK parliamentarian, you will perhaps only be able to answer my question from a UK perspective."
"With regard to statistics, you talked of Sovietisation."
"Is this really how you see it?"
"Do statistics mean Sovietisation to you?"
"Are you not in favour of specific figures on living standards and inflation - even if this relates to the control of the banks - being provided by means of statistics, and citizens and decision makers also having access to such information that will then enable appropriate decisions to be taken?"
"Or, as far as you are concerned, does that also fall within the realm of Sovietisation in the United Kingdom?"
"Mr President, let me make the first point."
"The fact of the matter is that this place likes to control things from the centre."
"Let us also make another point, that none of the Commissioners are actually elected by the people."
"Democracy matters for the whole of Europe so, yes, I do believe that we are seeing a Sovietisation of Europe."
"The fact of the matter is that these decisions should be taken at Member State level."
"The fact that regulations can bypass my own parliament, can bypass the people who were elected by the British people, is an absolute disgrace and, yes, it is the Sovietisation of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Nuttall is complaining about something that the United Kingdom, like many other States, has been doing since 2006."
"This process that we will conclude tomorrow at parliamentary level - Mr Leinen has done an excellent job in this regard - will enshrine in law something that has already been practised for a long time."
"Why do we need these data?"
"It has nothing to do with Sovietisation."
"Data are only as good as their comparability, and this comparability is the key element."
"That is why we have this European economic accounting and why we have used this system globally since the 1930s - including in the United Kingdom."
"It is such a good system because it is based on uniform standards and therefore, we can compare the prosperity of individual states and their economic and social success."
"The US dollar is usually used as the currency for comparison."
"Here we have a major opportunity to elevate the euro to the status of a comparison currency."
"I believe that is the second element."
"However, we also know that there are many gaps in these economic accounts."
"Consider Fukushima."
"Fukushima will now have a positive effect on the Japanese gross domestic product because a lot of investments are being made in this regard."
"They are flow accounts rather than stock accounts."
"We need to compensate for these things, and therefore the Commission subsequently put forward its 'GDP and beyond' proposal."
"These sustainability accounts that we will be adopting today and tomorrow will be the first step."
"Why is that?"
"It is because investing in energy efficiency and consuming less energy, for example, will have a negative effect on the gross domestic product."
"Even someone like Mr Nuttall cannot disagree with that."
"This is not so much about big policies; it is simply about us wanting to make our policies testable: what taxes are levied in this area, how much material are we using."
"Thus, we want to improve the legislative process, and if you were not in the Union, you would have to use the same system, otherwise your data would be worthless."
"Therefore, I would say that this is a positive first step."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the rapporteur."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate Jo Leinen on his excellent report."
"We really do need to proceed with environmental economic accounts."
"We can no longer consider the economy and the environment separately."
"The dual crisis hitting us - both environmental and economic - leaves us no such margin."
"The paralogisms of the past must stop."
"Mr Seeber quoted the example of Fukushima."
"Another, simpler, daily example is that of fires."
"A fire which destroys a forest and the biodiversity and eco-systemic services provided by the forest, by which I mean clean water, clear air and the framework for reproducing food, which destroys the cultural heritage of a place, which destroys agricultural production, is measured positively in terms of GDP, because investments are made to restore the damage, despite the fact that the country, the region, the area, will have sustained long-term damage."
"In the long term, it will be poorer than it was before."
"The environmental economic accounts we are calling for today are not perfect."
"However, they are an important step in the right direction."
"They are a step towards better policies based on a more complete, more objective view of reality."
"They are a step that will allow us to ensure that our policies are consistent, that will allow us to achieve international commitments and the objective of a greener European economy."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mr Leinen for the excellent and important work that he has done with respect to this report."
"This regulation on environmental economic accounts is very important, as has been said here more than once, because at last it establishes a statutory basis for a system of accounts integrating environmental and economic statistics that is crucial for environmental policy, and, in the broader context, social policy."
"As for its scope, it is very important that, during the first phase, the focus should specifically be on air emissions, material flows and environmental taxes."
"There are good reasons for this."
"Furthermore, it is probably a very realistic approach, considering the capacity that the Member States have, to start a system of accounts in these areas."
"Of course we need to realise that, among our various countries, we are at different levels with respect to statistics systems, and it is important that this does not create any additional red tape, as the Commissioner said."
"As far as new modules are concerned, it is important that they strongly emphasise themes that support the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"(IT) Mr President, this regulation forms part of the framework of measures designed to establish more comprehensive indicators to supplement GDP."
"European environmental economic accounts should contribute to the evaluation of policies, providing data about the interaction between environmental and economic factors."
"The Commission's proposal is commendable, although new and complex bureaucratic procedures are being created in order to be able to monitor the environmental policies that Member States actually develop."
"For this reason, we will abstain during the vote."
"We are against the report, however, insofar as the rapporteur wishes to add further accounting modules."
"A first-reading agreement was reached with the Council on the basis that the introduction of the new modules proposed by the rapporteur would be subject to evaluation under the review clause so that, where appropriate, changes or improvements can be made to the quality of the data and the methods by which it is gathered."
"In our view, all this represents a new and costly form of bureaucracy being imposed on Member States."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I see it, politics is about finding the best possible solutions to the problems that exist."
"How can this be achieved, however, if the problems and the potential solutions are not fully understood?"
"This is a fundamental issue, and it does not only concern environmental policy."
"Political decision makers must therefore have at their disposal data that is both reliable and as exhaustive as possible on the modern world and the environmental situation."
"That was the conclusion reached by the European Council in June 2006, when it called on the European Union and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development."
"I welcome this initiative and the European Commission's proposal, as it will help improve our knowledge of air emissions, environmental taxes and material flows in the economy."
"However, this proposal will have to be amended during tomorrow's vote so as to ensure that the data collected are reliable and conducive to debate, and also, and above all, to ensure that all the Member States are involved in this approach."
"Indeed, how can we draft European policies if we do not have data on the situation in each Member State?"
"Lastly, I should like to voice my support for two powerful ideas upheld by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats): the power conferred on the European Commission to adopt delegated acts should be reviewed every five years, and a verification clause should be introduced - the verification clause being the second powerful idea in this regulation."
"We will need new data in a few years, but everything in its own time."
"This draft regulation is a real step forward: let us continue in this direction."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Leinen for a long overdue regulation."
"Before we were elected to the European Parliament, many of us simply assumed that the decisions this Parliament took, these decisions that determine the future, were, in fact, based on these data, and we have discovered with a certain amount of dismay that, although these statistics and data exist in most Member States, in reality, they have not yet been brought together into a common framework, and this has therefore given rise to a certain lack of credibility in the eyes of the general public."
"From the media, we always get the impression that the economy and the environment are diametrically opposed."
"These data would help us to consider whether something benefits the environment, whether something benefits the environment and, at the same time, benefits the economy, or whether something benefits the economy and, at the same time, benefits the environment, and hence also our social environment."
"That is the main task that we as politicians should set ourselves."
"We want to establish and improve quality of life, not only in the workplace, but also in our environment."
"I can only agree with the desire expressed by Mr Leinen today when he said that, by the end of this decade, we should have moved away from gross domestic product and towards a green domestic product."
"By doing so, we will have taken the first crucial decision."
"I am very confident that we will succeed in strengthening the credibility of Europe and of matters relating to the environment and to the economy as a result of these environmental economic accounts."
"Thank you very much."
"Please continue with this good work."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, sound statistics, efficient data collection and evaluation - that is the basis on which to shape the future."
"It is obvious that we need to harmonise the Member States' existing statistics in order to take the right decisions for the future for the whole of Europe on the basis of the same data."
"Equivalent, comparable data from all of the Member States is the goal."
"The question arises as to what we can actually discover from this data."
"What additional conclusions can we draw in order for Europe to develop in a balanced way in terms of its social, economic and environment policy?"
"The Commission wants to extend the economic accounts to key aspects of sustainable development."
"To this end, it proposes three modules in order to collect data on economic activities that result in air emissions, on environmental tax revenue and on material flows."
"Products of plant origin, for example, cereals, leguminous crops, vegetables, fruit and wood, are also included in this."
"I wonder about the usefulness of such calculations - what will they actually tell us?"
"I am not as optimistic as the rapporteur and my fellow Members."
"Wanting something is one thing; putting it into practice is quite another."
"I have doubts about the efficiency of the red tape and I question the objectivity of the intention to produce environmental economic accounts, to record material flows and to evaluate individual products, including plants, in terms of CO2 emissions."
"Both the production of oxygen as well as the emission of CO2 during production and transport must be included in such calculations with regard to plants, for example."
"I welcome the fact that, in the compromise that has now been reached, it is clarified that additional data requirements may only be introduced following a flexibility assessment and that the competence of the Member States must not be encroached upon."
"Such programmes must also be developed without additional financial expenditure and bureaucracy."
"(HU) Mr President, my colleague, Jo Leinen, has prepared an excellent report, which is important from the point of view of the national economy, environmental protection, society, agriculture and other aspects as well."
"As a member of the STOA panel, a project aimed at more efficient management of natural resources, I consider it very important to compile a reliable statistical database."
"How can we measure the use of water and energy efficiency in the Member States of the European Union if we do not have reliable statistical information?"
"As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I consider it very important to have a clear picture, at last, of the real social benefits of the environmental public goods produced by farmers, in relation to the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"Without statistical data, we cannot determine how much farmers contribute with their agricultural activities to the protection of air, agricultural landscape, arable land and the environment, and how farmers produce environmental public goods that are not yet paid for by the market, nor by the CAP."
"Therefore, the current statistical report is very progressive and forward-looking from the point of view of environmental protection and agriculture."
"(DE) Mr President, when it comes to statistics, there is always a lot of debate and disagreement."
"Above all, they must not be decoded, because data protection is also clearly justified."
"On the other hand, we need transparency and comparability."
"I think that is important."
"We therefore need to collect the data in a fully automated manner using random samples, so that they are then comparable."
"We are aware of imaging processes, for example, that will also play a major role in this regard in future."
"Accordingly, automation of the process will simplify our political decision making in future."
"(DE) Mr President, European environmental economic accounts will provide us with important data to enable us to bring environmental aspects into all kinds of political decisions and, as a result, to have these aspects taken into consideration in a whole range of issues."
"The collected and analysed data will be crucial for providing effective countermeasures against the environmental effects of economic activities."
"The conscious need for sustainable policies in order to be able to deal with challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, increasing environmental pollution and the impending exhaustion of our natural resources is strongly supported today."
"Reliable data and the resulting predictions with regard to the use of natural resources will not only enable us to clearly measure the success of a sustainable economic policy, but will also provide very important added value for the Member States."
"(EL) Mr President, I, too, should like to take my turn in congratulating Mr Leinen on his exceptional report."
"I believe that Europe has now reached a point at which we rarely encounter clashes between development and environmental protection."
"On the contrary, we have entered an interactive phase."
"Europeans now have an environmental conscience."
"This report will help even more in ensuring that we have a better picture of what is happening to the environment in Europe."
"I should like to emphasise three elements: firstly, we need precise information on the state of the environment in the Member States; secondly, we need a procedure for renewing that information every five years; and, thirdly, we need to carry out a joint progress evaluation of all environmental actions undertaken in the European Union."
"(DE) Madam President, if we want to preserve our environment for future generations, we must not consider economic and environmental aspects separately."
"It therefore makes sense to supplement economic accounts with environmental factors, and the basis of any sound balance sheet is adequate and reliable data."
"However, when the EU calls for key data from the Member States, it should not baulk at sensitive issues."
"I am thinking here of nuclear policy, genetic engineering, adequate origin labelling of foodstuffs and, not least, an investigation with regard to the recent EHEC cucumber scandal."
"Interactions between the economy and the environment are clearly evident here."
"Here, too, it is clear where - unfortunately - the weight lies in the EU, namely with big business and the lobbyists."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, many thanks for a very substantive and responsible debate."
"I think we all agree on the importance of this proposal and of environmental economic accounts."
"We also agree that we need to take the next steps to define policies using the data, to keep us on the path to a more sustainable economy."
"Let me make a few points in response to a number of remarks."
"This is the first regulation, with three modules."
"It is the beginning in terms of legislation."
"The second batch of modules is now in preparation for a second, amending regulation towards the end of 2012."
"We are also already planning the third batch, so the work is ongoing and will be continued."
"Concerning the issue of red tape, this will not create a new burden for enterprises because we are using existing administrative and statistical data."
"In fact, the United Kingdom is a leader in environmental accounting, which is also worth noting."
"Moreover, concerning the statistics, and referring to what was said by Mr Leinen, Mr Martin and many others, we have made significant progress in improving the European statistical system over the past year and a half."
"For instance, the present Commission made the very first legislative proposal on 10 February 2010 - the day after you had voted in favour of setting up the present Commission - when we adopted a regulation on audit powers for Eurostat, which gives Eurostat the possibility of checking and verifying the quality of statistics at the source, which is very important."
"We have already started to use this, for instance, in the case of Greece."
"Secondly, the action plan for Greece is being implemented and within a year, it has brought a very profound overhaul of the statistical system in Greece."
"As a result, the quality of the statistics on the excessive deficit procedure has greatly improved already, and in the latest round, Eurostat could validate the data for Greece."
"Finally, on resources, although we do not need resources for this particular subject of environmental economic accounts, I agree with Mr Martin that we need sufficient resources."
"In fact, I took advantage of this part-session week to stop by in Luxembourg to meet Walter Radermacher, the Director General of Eurostat, to discuss resources just a few hours ago."
"We are on the way to redeploying and improving our resources in Eurostat in order to focus on our key priorities."
"But I would not take resources from enlargement, as Mr Martin suggested, and especially not from the Western Balkans."
"Stability, democracy and peace in that region continue to be a key priority for the European Union, for the Commission and, I trust, for Parliament as well."
"Please remember that without our soft power, and without EU enlargement policy, Ratko Mladić would not be in The Hague now."
"Please remember that as well."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate."
"I see broad support for the creation of environmental balance sheets in the European Union."
"With a few exceptions, this has found favour here."
"I also agree with Mrs Kadenbach's statement."
"Many of us thought that this was already in place, and we were surprised to find that a lot of data does not exist at all, and that in the statements we make with regard to the state of the environment in the European Union, we are therefore actually completely blind."
"One Member, Mr Gerbrandy, said that measurement brings knowledge."
"We then know something, and knowledge is the basis for taking measures and for all of our programmes."
"We quite simply need a better basis for the decisions that we take."
"These environmental accounts can help us in this regard."
"Of course, we have the EU 2020 strategy, in which sustainability is a planning goal."
"I hope that in the next few years, we will also have this basis so that in 2020, we will be able to see whether we were successful or not."
"We know that gross domestic product provides no information on the state of the natural world and the environment, on resources that we have used, or on the whole sustainability problem."
"That is why this is now necessary."
"We are also tackling this in stages."
"Mrs Klaß, we are not making excessive demands; rather, the modules are to be expanded gradually."
"After all, as the Commissioner said, the individual pieces of legislation - the water legislation, waste legislation and clean air legislation - already contain the requirement to collect this data."
"Europe is also under a global obligation, Mr Nuttall."
"If we sign the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change or any other convention, we must be able to tell the rest of the world whether we have done well or badly."
"Thus, all in all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also Eurostat, which will subsequently have to carry out the work."
"I hope that the necessary resources will be available in Luxembourg, because without funds, without resources, this balance sheet cannot, of course, be produced."
"Parliament should also help out in this regard."
"Thank you very much."
"This is an important political matter - as some people have rightly recognised - and it is a new chapter in the consideration of what we do in Europe year in year out."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, for the report he has submitted."
"I agree with its assessment of the Commission's proposal, and I would like to make a few observations on the importance of such activities."
"Measuring quality of life through indicators such as gross domestic product does not tell the whole story."
"Although experts have been in agreement on this for quite some time, the message has only recently got through to the political sphere, after considerable time and effort."
"In this respect, I very much applaud the Commission's proposal for European environmental economic accounts, because there is no need for the wholesale rejection of misleading indicators."
"Rather than assessing quality of life and the environment on the basis of impressions, we need to come up with better data and better methods of data collection and aggregation so that they deliver an improved service in gauging, for example, the environmental impact made by policies and economic activities."
"I join the rapporteur in calling for a greater emphasis in the Commission's proposal on monitoring and evaluation issues."
"Finally, I would like to note how very important it is for the Commission's proposal to incorporate and rely even more fully on the strategy document 'GDP and beyond: measuring progress in a changing world'."
"A consistent, systematic approach will perhaps be more crucial than anything else in efforts to improve the way quality of life is measured."
"in writing. - Recycling and prevention of waste, air emissions and climatic change and sustainable consumption and production could be monitored much more effectively if high-quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors."
"The relevant data collection, which has been made on a voluntary basis until today at EU level, should therefore become mandatory."
"Moreover, environmental data currently available should be expanded in the medium term to facilitate the necessary policy assessment of European environmental policy."
"The proposed regulation establishes in this respect a common framework for the collection, compilation, transmission and evaluation of European environmental economic accounts by providing common European-wide methodology, common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for compiling these accounts."
"The regulation concerns the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to various economic sectors and macroeconomic material flow accounting."
"Accurate and adequate statistical data on energy and resource consumption are fundamental if we want to get indicators for progress and well-being beyond the GDP."
"Moreover, a sound assessment of the European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available."
"Selection process of a new Managing Director for the IMF and external representation of the euro (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the selection process of a new Managing Director for the IMF and external representation of the euro."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, many thanks for your very pertinent questions."
"The Commission welcomes the decision of the Executive Board of the IMF on 20 May this year, which clarifies the selection process for the next Managing Director of the IMF."
"The Commission agrees that the selection process has to be open, transparent and merit-based."
"This will enable candidates from all IMF member countries to compete on the basis of their merits, taking into account all relevant aspects."
"The EU Member States have agreed that they will back the best qualified candidate who is able to meet the high standards required to fulfil the responsibilities attached to this very important position."
"Such a candidate will, in particular, need to have demonstrated strong capabilities, a commitment to multilateral coordination, and a great knowledge of international economic, financial and monetary affairs."
"The Commission supports this agreement."
"The Commission fully supports the candidacy of Minister Christine Lagarde."
"She is a competent and experienced candidate, who has gained the respect of our partners in the international community."
"She not only has a very good knowledge of the European economy and EU decision making, which is a merit in these times, but also very strong experience in global economic governance - through her successful management of the G20 Presidency, for instance."
"Let me also add that last year, an agreement was reached at the G20 summit in Seoul in Korea to reduce European representation in relative terms on the IMF Board by two seats, so as to increase the voice and representation of emerging market economies."
"The issue of the external representation of the euro area, while related to the general reform of the International Monetary Fund, is not directly linked to the selection of the Managing Director of the IMF."
"The Commission is of the view that it is in the common interest of Europe, the Union and its Member States, to move progressively towards a single seat for the European Union, or at least the euro area, in the IMF."
"Gradually and progressively."
"Mr President, honourable Members, as you know, I am fully committed to the reform and reinforcement of EU economic governance, both internally and externally."
"In achieving this, I prefer to apply the tested method of Jean Monnet: Europe is built through concrete progress in real life, one step at a time, taking larger and smaller steps."
"Therefore, let us first conclude the reform of our internal governance, which is urgently needed and which will be a huge step forward once implemented."
"Then let us tackle the challenge of external representation which will be another major step forward once agreed and implemented."
"One big step at a time."
"Madam President, when the former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into office, there were major question marks against the relevance and effectiveness of the IMF."
"We now know better, after finding out the hard way during the crisis just how interlinked we are internationally."
"It is precisely in such times of crisis that you also learn to better seek each other out, and we experienced just how crucial the role and the expertise of the IMF are, even for us here in Europe."
"It is thus also important that, in the coming years, the IMF should play a key role in terms of global governance and better financial and monetary stability in the world."
"Sadly, in this euro crisis, we have learned from experience in a very painful way."
"You can tell where I am going with this."
"Today, we are discussing the new candidate for the future position of Managing Director of the IMF."
"You quite rightly say that this must be an open process, but we do not need to hide under a bushel the fact that we, Europe, have an outstanding candidate."
"I am happy that we, in Parliament, are also able, through this debate, to give our express support to that candidate."
"In a time of crisis, it is important to have an outstandingly qualified woman in this top role as, in a crisis, female qualities could provide real added value, topped off with quality."
"Mrs Lagarde also has experience on both sides of the Atlantic and in multilateral governance."
"Viewed from this angle, too, she is an outstanding candidate."
"I hope that, with this backing, we are able to give you a little extra push to put forward Mrs Lagarde's case as the next occupant of the role of Managing Director of the IMF."
"Madam President, Commissioner, basically, I am wondering why you wanted to make that statement."
"Indeed, you ended your speech by saying: 'All our time is essentially taken up today by the reform of economic governance; the issue of the external representation of the euro area will be discussed at a later date'."
"Please forgive me if I disagree with your approach, because one of the main problems in the European Union today is the issue of the external representation of the euro area."
"It is clear today how the currency war could easily destroy all the efforts that citizens in the euro area are being asked to make in the name of austerity and of an improved sovereign debt situation."
"Therefore, Europeans cannot be completely demanding internally and, at the same time, fail to show any interest in how their currency, tossed about as it is by the markets on the international stage, is faring externally."
"There will be no internal protection without external protection."
"Please forgive me, then, if I disagree with your approach on this point."
"I know that the task is a difficult one, but the European Parliament has, for several years now, supported the idea of moving towards an external representation of the euro area, especially within the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"We must admit that, when Dominique Strauss-Kahn was appointed as the Managing Director of the IMF, the situation was very different: there was talk of people taking it in turns to manage the organisation."
"Mr Strauss-Kahn himself said that he may be the last European to head the IMF."
"Since then, however, the situation has changed considerably."
"The region in which IMF intervention is crucial today is Europe."
"We can see that, behind the IMF's intervention, the intervention of the large US investment banks has a significant role to play."
"We can also see that, sooner or later, the issue of the US economic situation could be raised and could legitimately be debated within the IMF."
"All that paints a much more complex picture than simply deciding whether this person or that person should preside over the future of the IMF."
"Of course Europeans should be represented - they should rightly play a part in what is one of the major institutions - but, more fundamentally, what I want to know from you is: what kind of policy do we want to conduct on the international stage?"
"What kind of mandate should a European carry out on the international stage, given the efforts we are making internally, given the influence of the markets outside the European Union and the impact they have on investment, speculation and employment in Europe?"
"We also think that whoever manages the IMF in the future will face a huge task: he or she must not destroy the progress made by Dominique Strauss-Kahn when he shifted ever so slightly the boundaries of what was the Washington Consensus."
"We can already see a hardening of attitudes today within the institution; we think that this is the wrong approach."
"Finally, the issue of the IMF's place within the United Nations system will also have to be raised, and if the Europeans do put forward a candidate, they must ensure that the mandate that they give to that person is structured in such a way as to enable him or her to push for a form of global governance that rises to the post-crisis challenges that we face."
"Madam President, thank you for your response, Mr Rehn."
"By the end of June, we are expecting a new Managing Director to have been appointed for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has, as we all know, been accused of a very serious crime that, unfortunately, has probably also damaged the reputation of the IMF."
"Now, in these turbulent times, a new competent Managing Director must therefore be appointed for an important global institution such as this and the process must be open."
"Like my fellow Members, I welcome the candidacy of France's finance minister, Christine Lagarde."
"I believe we have all found her to be a very competent person."
"She also has the support of several Member States and the European Commission."
"However, why have we not been able to agree on a common nomination procedure?"
"It would have increased Europe's influence."
"That is something that we lack."
"If we had had a common procedure and if the Commission had taken overall responsibility, it would also have strengthened the reputation of the EU, the euro and Europe."
"Article 138 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that the euro's place in the international monetary system must be strengthened."
"Why, therefore, has this opportunity not been taken?"
"The Commissioner spoke of taking one step at a time, but sometimes we may have to make a little leap forward in order to strengthen our position, particularly in turbulent times."
"I also think it is important to point out that the IMF is in need of extensive reform, something that Mrs Berès also makes clear in her report."
"The work on this reform has begun."
"However, the EU's representation in the IMF also needs to be discussed and strengthened."
"We need a stronger IMF that operates as a global lender."
"To summarise: we need a stronger and more representative IMF in our new global world and we need a stronger EU with a clearer voice."
"Finally, Mr Rehn, sometimes we need to make a leap forward."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, in today's uncertain economic climate, it is more important than ever that the global institutions set up to ensure financial and economic stability, which many countries around the world are dependent upon, are not used to make symbolic political statements."
"The IMF is not a symbol but a working institution that needs someone at the head of it who has a strong understanding of the financial markets, the necessary skills gained from managing a large economy and the ability to communicate tough decisions to the general public."
"The strength of Christine Lagarde's candidacy is not that she is a European, but that she is a hugely competent individual who has shown remarkable leadership qualities throughout the financial crisis."
"As the primary role of the IMF is to work on conditional structural reform packages to accompany the distribution of funds to members when they are in dire straits, I believe that Ms Lagarde has shown that she is well able to broker complex agreements on controversial issues, successfully bringing together disparate parties to reach a beneficial solution."
"We must not get caught up in the prism of today's eurozone crisis but look to what problems the IMF may face in the future."
"I believe that Ms Lagarde has the necessary skills and track record to lead the IMF during this period of economic turbulence and to steer a path of reform at the IMF to ensure its continued relevance for generations to come."
"Turning to the matter of eurozone representation on international bodies, as financial markets do not respect national boundaries, it is hugely important that global institutions work effectively to coordinate national policy."
"While I am in favour of more coordination, efficiency and the linking up of policies to avoid regulatory gaps, I believe that the EU must not lose its diverse set of voices in international institutions."
"The crisis has shown the huge differences between the economies of the EU even within the eurozone, let alone the differences between non-eurozone countries as well."
"All of our countries have been affected in different ways in the current crisis and we have different experiences."
"A single voice is not as strong as a multitude of voices singing in harmony."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have four comments that I should like to make."
"Firstly, I should like to come back to Mr Schmidt's speech so as to discuss the process again."
"Given that a role as important as the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund is at stake, I think that, compared to the energy that is at times put into recruiting third-level managers in companies, the way in which this process is being handled shows a lack of professionalism."
"Instead of a relatively open, transparent and criteria-based process, what do we have?"
"A series of caucuses bringing together Heads of State or Government who say to each other, 'I would definitely put forward such and such a person'."
"That does nothing to enhance the European Union's credibility."
"The fact is, after the Dominique Strauss-Kahn episode, Europe cannot afford to cut corners when deciding who its candidate is going to be."
"This is a missed opportunity as far as I am concerned."
"I do not hold you responsible for this - you are not the one calling the shots on this issue - but we would most certainly benefit from taking a much more organised, concerted and professional approach."
"Secondly, I should like to respond to Mrs Swinburne."
"It is time to respond frankly to those who, like you, Mrs Swinburne, and you, Mr Farage, continue to peddle the mistaken idea that we Europeans will be able to influence world affairs - which affect us too - by speaking with a multitude of voices."
"Mrs Swinburne, it is all well and good talking about voices singing in harmony, but you know very well that it does not work like that."
"If, at some point, we have something other than a democratic federation, the voices will not sing in harmony, because everyone will look after the interests of his or her electorate."
"That is how it works."
"Furthermore, if you think, Mr Farage and Mrs Swinburne, that you are going to defend the so-called sovereignty of the United Kingdom - and that applies to all the Member States, be they small States like my own, or large States such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom - if you think that, alone, you will still be able to exert some influence in the world, then I think you are sadly mistaken."
"My third comment concerns the IMF's attitude during the crisis, when compared to that of the European Union."
"On this issue, Commissioner, I do hold you responsible."
"After all, we recall that, in all the discussions held by the Troikas travelling to the various Member States that we are trying to help, ultimately, it is the IMF - and it almost pains me to say this after everything that we Greens said about the IMF in the 1980s and 1990s - that is the most reasonable today, while the Commission and the Central Bank are the ones setting the toughest conditions."
"We cannot permit this state of affairs as Europeans."
"I cannot understand why you are trying to act like a bigger Catholic than the Pope - I am not sure whether I can say that to a Finn but, there, I have said it anyway!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not so much about individual people; it is, first and foremost, about a selection process."
"Surprisingly, anyone who searches for information on the selection process for the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Internet will essentially only discover that the United States and Europe share the two leading positions."
"That means that the economically strongest nations, as a minority, share control of the global economy among themselves, so to speak."
"That is feudalism and has nothing to do with democracy, and that is why we cannot accept this."
"In our view, Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepping down presents a major opportunity to make fundamental changes at this point to the nomination and selection process and to make it an open, transparent and, above all, merit- and qualification-based selection process, as some NGOs have been calling for recently."
"This should also include a combination of majority votes from the members of the IMF and a majority of voting shares in the IMF."
"Up to now, only the voting shares in the IMF have been taken into account, which ensures a structural majority for the economically strong nations."
"This sort of reform and change to the selection process would correspond to the reform of the IMF, which would also correspond to the changes in global economic relations and would give the developing countries a chance to bring their experience with the IMF to bear in the further development of the IMF."
"In closing, I would just like to say that the IMF must be placed under an obligation to work in the interests of reducing global imbalances and poverty."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I would like to say to Commissioner Rehn that I have been looking at the IMF Charter."
"There is nothing here that will surprise you; it is there to promote balance, growth, exchange rate stability, to lessen disequilibrium and to help countries that are in trouble."
"The classic method uses is to shore up the finances and organise a competitive devaluation."
"Nowhere in here does it say that the IMF is there to support political experiments and, in so many ways, that is what Dominique Strauss-Kahn did."
"He used the IMF to help bail out the failing euro project and, as such, he was a very poor choice of candidate."
"Now you want to compound that by approving Christine Lagarde - another member of the European political elite, another euro fanatic, somebody else who believes in propping up this euro project - and I would have thought that, as she has got a vested interest, she is, in fact, a highly unsuitable candidate."
"It is as if the EU has hijacked the IMF, that it is now there as part of the support mechanism for the euro, so that it is not just the taxpayers of the eurozone and the non-eurozone EU members, but the whole world that now has to help prop up the euro as the Greek problem compounds by the day."
"Well, I suppose in some ways, you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust, not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out, but as I have warned before in this Assembly, the validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question."
"I have warned that you cannot go on buying your own bad debt, but we have reached the point where, within weeks, we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent, so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well."
"I would have thought this is a very poor choice."
"The international community at some point will tell you where to get off - perhaps not just quite yet."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise on behalf of Mrs Lulling and Mr Langen, too; they had their own speaking time, but I assure you that I will not use it all up."
"I would just like to point out, as every one of you has done here, that the process of selecting a new Managing Director of the IMF has begun."
"It is important for the European Union to express a unanimous and strong position that is conveyed not only by the various Member States, but also by the Commission, and you have pledged to do that, Commissioner."
"Many of us in this House, with the exception of Mr Farage, are very keen to see the balance - a popular one until now - between the United States and Europe maintained during the process of appointing the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank."
"We fully understand that emerging countries - particularly the largest ones - would like more of a say in the IMF's decision making."
"It is important, therefore, to continue the reforms under way regarding the governance of that international institution, and particularly the ones that you also mentioned, Commissioner."
"However, it is definitely too soon for any radical changes to the balance achieved as a result of the Member States' respective financial contributions to the Fund."
"Only one European candidate has launched a proper campaign by making contact with the various Member States."
"That candidate - who, by the way, is a woman - has the qualities required."
"Her skills, political experience, moral authority and perfect command of English, coupled with her experience of working across the globe, make her the ideal candidate for the post of Managing Director of the IMF."
"As has been said, the Managing Director must be someone who seeks consensus and is effective at a time when the institution has a vital role to play in helping to redress the economic and financial balance with a great sense of purpose."
"Our Union must therefore do whatever it takes to secure Christine Lagarde's appointment."
"(FR) Madam President, I believe there is, nonetheless, a great paradox in this debate."
"Basically, it is vital that nothing changes between the World Bank and the IMF."
"We Europeans are the ones who stand to gain from multilateralism working, but multilateralism will not work if emerging countries are involved only to a limited extent, at the G20 or elsewhere."
"We really must approach this issue dynamically and with a sense of perspective."
"Furthermore, I find it rather paradoxical that, now that we are launching an urgent campaign to see a European appointed as the head of the IMF, we are not setting an example as Europeans by saying, Commissioner, that this is a step in the direction of the external representation of the euro area."
"What explains your great impatience and determination to see a European appointed if not your desire to take this step, which you tell us is not urgent and can keep for another day?"
"If we want to make a go of multilateralism, then we ourselves need to set an example, be consistent and show how well it can work in the future, because the IMF has an absolutely crucial role to play in the field of global governance, a role that transcends the issue of European debt and of the sovereign debt situations of the European countries that are struggling."
"This is a crucial task, but the IMF's role, beyond stabilising the markets, is also to help correct the global imbalances that caused this crisis."
"It is clear today that you are not taking this absolutely crucial governance issue into account in the way in which you promote, or otherwise, a given candidate."
"Yet this is what interests us socialists: seeing the IMF play a part in global governance so as to correct the imbalances that caused this crisis."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, like everyone else in this House, I am not disregarding the method used to select the future Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, but what matters most to the people is knowing what new role that international institution plans to carry out in order to help end today's serious economic, financial, budgetary and monetary crises."
"The International Monetary Fund needs to become much more democratic and focused on human development, education and employment."
"The United States' blocking minority should, in my view, be lifted."
"The voting rights of emerging countries should be significantly increased."
"The IMF should be a tool against speculation, which is suffocating populations today, an effective tool for stabilising agricultural and commodities markets, in order to combat the tax havens that people often talk about."
"Instead of a currency war, the IMF should launch a major new project: that of a common world currency for cooperation instead of a war of economics and competition."
"That is what we should be discussing as a matter of priority, so that people's quality of life improves and bankers stop enriching themselves by plundering nations."
"(PL) Madam President, it is unfortunate that the IMF has recently been discussed only in the context of the affair concerning its former head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn."
"It is not only the prestige of this important position and the whole institution which has suffered, but also the prestige of a European politician occupying such an important position."
"I think that if, as a result of this, we finally stop tolerating behaviour which everyone knew about and which is far too widely accepted, this would be the one positive thing to come out of the whole terrible affair."
"However, now we have to fight to rebuild the reputation of this position and the institution of the IMF."
"For this to happen, we need to propose a competent person for this position who will be able to maintain calm on the markets, in the media and in general public opinion in what is, today, a very difficult situation."
"It is important that the candidate should be credible, and Christine Lagarde has been acknowledged by the Financial Times as being the best Minister for Finance in the euro area in 2009."
"The Commissioner has already mentioned how well she led the presidency at the G20."
"She is a person whose credibility cannot be called into question."
"We cannot underestimate the role of the IMF, particularly now when there is a financial and economic crisis which is affecting many countries in Europe."
"European thinking should therefore be present in this institution."
"We need someone in this position who understands the significance of the present crisis."
"While dealing with global finances at the IMF and using the skills and international experience she gained in the European Union, I know that Christine Lagarde will not lose sight of European interests."
"She said herself that if she were to be chosen for the post, she would bring all her experience as a lawyer, managing director, minister and woman to the Fund."
"Let us pay particular attention to the final element, which is very important in this situation."
"(PT) Madam President, the process of replacing the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is inseparable from the difficulties and contradictions which the capitalist system is facing today in the light of its worsening crisis."
"The ongoing change to one of the institutions at the system's apex is inextricably linked to the disputes between the various factions of big capital, where conflicts are emerging between the major powers."
"It is also inseparable from the unresolved issue of reforming the monetary system and, with it, the currency war over the dollar's hegemony at global level."
"This is a war whose consequences are dumped onto the backs of the workers and peoples of the periphery, as we can see in the European Union."
"Without hiding for one moment the enormous extent to which the centre left and its longstanding ties with neoliberalism are responsible for this process, it is also inseparable from the conflict between those who have been accepting the need to restructure debts within the euro area and those who are pushing to rush blindly on ahead towards new means of institutionalised and openly colonial intervention."
"In any case, both seem committed to taking the exploitation and oppression of the workers and peoples to new levels."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, it would appear that the 21st century will be remembered for the war between political power and the power of the financial institutions."
"There are countries on the planet which are literally governed by anonymous financial institutions and the citizens of those countries are led hither and thither and their fate is determined by what the markets are doing."
"I believe that Mrs Lagarde will be a worthy and able representative of the European Union; she is well qualified for the job thanks to the experience which she acquired during this stormy period of economic crisis and I believe that she will be a worthy representative of the European economy within the framework of global economic governance."
"(DE) Madam President, I think it is important that Mrs Lagarde is appointed to this leading role."
"In France, she has proven that she understands the economy, that she also promotes small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, and that she has regard for those who actually work and make a contribution."
"It is surely also a principle of the International Monetary Fund to work to improve people's standard of living."
"Redistribution is only possible if there is actually something produced to be redistributed."
"Therefore, the reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is an absolutely priority."
"We must ensure that those countries with financial problems receive the necessary instruction and that the appropriate knowledge is passed on with regard to the way that we are trying hard to solve these problems in the European Union."
"(PT) Madam President, the debate we are having here is ducking the most important issues."
"In other words, it is not tackling the serious problem posed by international capitalism: the problem of the financial markets that are controlling our economies; that are trying to impose their rules on countries themselves; that are continuing to exacerbate inequality, discrimination, and attacks on workers' rights and essential public services; and that are contributing to an increase in poverty and social exclusion, not only internationally, in less developed countries, but also here in the European Union and in many of our Member States."
"Therefore, what was needed was for the Commission to adopt a strong position in order to change the situation; to bring an end to tax havens; to control the financial markets; and to prevent the exacerbation of inequality and exploitation."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, let me first thank you for a very substantive debate."
"I believe that there is a broad consensus in this House - not a full but a broad consensus - on the selection process of the next Managing Director of the IMF."
"It has to be open, transparent and merit-based."
"I also sense that there is broad support - maybe not full but broad support - for Mrs Lagarde, who has already been endorsed by the EU Member States and by the Commission as their candidate for Managing Director of the IMF."
"I want to make three points to respond to some of the views expressed in the course of the debate."
"First, the IMF has played a key role, in cooperation with the European Union, in overcoming the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, for which Dominique Strauss-Kahn made a major contribution as the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund."
"While we still face considerable turbulence in some segments of the sovereign debt markets of certain countries, we have been able to contain the sovereign debt crisis and protect the ongoing economic recovery in Europe."
"Of course the work has to go on, and we still have difficult decisions ahead of us, not least in the coming weeks in June."
"But let us recall that there has been no Lehman Brothers catastrophe on European soil, and we have to make sure that there will not be."
"That would be detrimental to economic growth and improving employment in Europe."
"Secondly, we have had very good cooperation between the Commission, the ECB and the IMF, which was not self-evident when we started about a year and a half ago in terms of fire-fighting the financial turmoil."
"Each of these three institutions has its own rules, its own philosophy and its own independence, and it was not self-evident that they could work together in order to overcome these challenges."
"However, I dare to say that a pragmatic sense of crisis-awareness has prevailed and helped us to cooperate in order to contain the sovereign debt crisis and protect economic recovery."
"Thirdly, I do agree that we need to reform our external representation."
"As I said in my opening remarks, we now have a huge task, firstly to conclude the internal economic governance reform."
"We are just about to do this, and I count on you to enable us to do it in the course of June, before the summer break."
"This is extremely important for the credibility of the European Union in these times of crisis."
"So let us all do our best in order to ensure that we will complete this indispensable reform of EU economic governance."
"In the long term, our goal is a single seat, at least for the euro area."
"In the short term, we need better practical and pragmatic policy coordination among the EU Member States that are represented in the G20 or G7 or in the IMF."
"I must say that I have seen plenty of concrete improvement in that regard, so that the EU Member States that are represented in the G20, or in the IMF or in the G7, mostly share common goals and are mostly working together as an orchestra and not with different voices."
"Yes, we have plenty of room for improvement and we have to discuss this thoroughly."
"But, as I said, let us first conclude the internal governance reform and then we can come back to the issue of how to improve our external representation."
"The rights of the emerging economies mean that it is in the fundamental interest of the European Union, its citizens and its Member States for us to be more united and thus more effective in advancing our causes and our interests on the global scene."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - Whoever the next Managing Director of the IMF is, he or she will have a huge task."
"The coming years are likely to be dominated by major international financial and economic governance reforms. There are many excellent candidates, and I hope the selection is based on merit, not politics."
"The reality is that the EU punches below its weight at global level, be it at the G20, IMF or WTO."
"It does not speak with one coherent voice, but with many voices."
"This is a serious shortcoming that particularly affects smaller Member States, who lack the diplomatic muscle of the larger nations."
"Provided policy positions were agreed transparently and democratically, we would benefit from the EU playing a more active role in reshaping the international monetary and financial system."
"The Committee on Economic Affairs is currently working on a report on global economic governance, which I hope will lead to Commission proposals on improvements to the EU's external representation in this field."
"The EU is an economic bloc representing over 450 million people, with a currency that is the world's second international reserve currency."
"But if we do not take it seriously, neither will the rest of the world."
"Seventh EU programme for research, technological development and demonstration (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the report by Mr Audy, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities (Α7-0160/2011)."
"Madam President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here to evaluate the Seventh Framework Programme for research (2007-2013), which has a budget of EUR 51 billion."
"It is the biggest programme in the world, and this amount should be compared to the EUR 17 billion for the 2000-2006 programme, which covered five years, whereas this one covers seven."
"The negotiations on the Seventh Framework Programme took place in 2006 and cover - I repeat - the period 2007-2013."
"Following those negotiations, we now have three new elements, which require us to turn our attention to the evaluation of the programme."
"Firstly, the European Union is getting over the failure of the Lisbon strategy, which was devised by the European Council in 2000 with a view to making the European Union the world's knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"We now have the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The second new element: the failure of the constitutional treaty."
"Today, the Treaty of Lisbon is in force and brings with it new powers."
"The third new element: the financial crisis that reached us from the United States in 2008."
"In view of those three new elements, we must give thought to the years 2011-2013."
"We are living in extremely fragile post-crisis years and, in these times of scarce public resources, the sums at stake are substantial."
"EUR 26 billion has been programmed for the first three years."
"We have EUR 28.5 billion left to programme in 2011, 2012 and 2013."
"We must therefore think carefully about the messages that we want to send to the European Commission so that it adapts its research policy to the major challenges of the day."
"Other speakers will expand on what I have said, but I should like to emphasise two points: the first is simplification and the second is the response to the major challenges we face."
"As regards simplification, my colleague, Mrs Carvalho, is going to discuss in detail her excellent report and, Commissioner, we welcome the Commission decision of 24 January 2011 on the creation of the Unique Registration Facility, but we must go further."
"We need to simplify the future and put the past behind us."
"You are well acquainted with all these issues as a former Member of the European Court of Auditors."
"The three-year reform of the Financial Regulation will enable us to establish the legal basis for this simplification, but I do not think that tinkering with the tolerable risk of error is the right way to go."
"We need to simplify our regulations, and it is through simplification that we will reduce the number of errors."
"In the event of a disagreement between the Commission's auditors and the bodies being audited, I propose that the option of conducting independent counter audits be permitted, and that a mediator be allowed to intervene so that we do not have to ask the Court of Justice to settle any disputes that may arise between the audited bodies and the Commission."
"We really must settle this issue, Commissioner."
"Next, we have the major challenges."
"We must involve the industrial sector more in this Europe 2020 industrial policy, particularly with the European patent, and we must increase the participation of SMEs - small and medium-sized enterprises - and women."
"Infrastructure should be cofinanced by the framework programme, the European Investment Bank, the Structural Funds and national policies."
"We must encourage excellence as well as ensure a harmonious distribution of research infrastructure throughout the European Union."
"We do not know today which countries will be awarded the Nobel prizes in five years' time."
"We must also honour our international commitments, such as ITER."
"Lastly, for the future, we propose in this report to double the amount of research funding in order to create this European research area, with the help of the European Research Council."
"This is the key to the growth we need in order to fund our social ambitions and honour our environmental commitments."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address all of you before the final vote on the FP7 interim evaluation report in plenary tomorrow morning."
"The implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme and, in turn, the progression towards what is proposed as a common strategic framework for research and innovation, is marked by a long series of individual, but nonetheless significant, steps."
"I believe that this debate today marks one of those significant steps."
"Leading up to the discussions today are the months of painstaking work by Mr Audy, the shadow rapporteurs, the other members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as well as the members of the Committee on Budgets."
"Evaluation is nothing if the results are not presented, discussed, questioned, and indeed either accepted or sometimes rejected, by the very stakeholders that it aims to serve, and, of course, Parliament plays a vital role in this process, not only bringing to bear a broad cross-section of experience from political and public life but, just as importantly, from the many fields of deep knowledge held by Members."
"Let me make a few brief introductory remarks on the report itself."
"First, this is a rich and comprehensive report that deals in a constructive way with the key issues raised in the FP7 interim evaluation."
"It is most encouraging to see that the interim evaluation report triggered very substantive responses from the institutions and that these responses, although putting the emphasis sometimes on different issues, basically agree with the main findings and recommendations made by the independent evaluation experts."
"The Commission is pleased to see that the quality of this evaluation work is acknowledged by Parliament."
"The Commission notes that the main points raised in the present report coincide with the key issues addressed in the Commission's response to the evaluation report."
"Even though there might not be full agreement on every detail, it is important to note that there exists a core common understanding on the big ticketed items, notably, the need for a comprehensive strategy to boost research and innovation in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the need to make the programme more accessible to the wide range of possible contributors throughout Europe, and the need to further simplify procedures to allow all participants to focus on creativity rather than bureaucracy."
"The Commission underlines its intention to take concrete measures in the remaining years of the FP7 to implement a maximum number of the concise suggestions made by the evaluators."
"As an example, as Mr Audy reminded us, we have already implemented three concrete simplification measures for FP7: more use of average personnel costs, easier procedures for owner-managers of SMEs, and a clearing committee to ensure a common interpretation of the rules."
"At the same time, the recommendations and views expressed in this interim evaluation are, of course, of paramount importance for the preparation of future activities in the field of research and innovation."
"This will include the necessary quantum leap in simplification, which will be made possible by a common strategic framework, new rules for participation and - with your help - a revised user-friendly Financial Regulation."
"The Commission looks forward to continuing this debate through the forthcoming discussions."
"Against this background, your comments today and the questions that you raise will help to sharpen our understanding still further."
"Madam President, I would like to thank our wonderful Commissioner for her strong commitment to research, and I would also like to thank the rapporteur."
"I have the privilege of acting as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets on matters relating to research and I have a few brief comments from our committee."
"I would like to start with a point of criticism, and that is that it would be good if evaluations of this kind could arrive in good time."
"That would make our work easier, but in all other respects, the evaluation is a good one."
"The Committee on Budgets thinks it is important in future to strengthen the link between research and industry in a better way so as to actually utilise the potential of new innovations and ideas in practice."
"We would also like to emphasise the fact that we need to have the courage to take risks."
"Without risks, we will not achieve the good results that we want."
"Something else that the Commissioner herself mentioned was the question of simplifying the processes and cutting back on existing bureaucracy."
"That is extremely important."
"Last but not least, I would like to remind you that we need to be able to implement the Europe 2020 strategy within the Seventh Framework Programme for research; we cannot wait until the next one."
"Madam President, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report and also for the way in which he conducted the work."
"The current framework programme is strategically important for competitiveness and employability within Europe."
"Of its funding, 50% is yet to be spent."
"As such, the mid-term review of the current framework programme is crucial so that throughout the second half of its existence, it can contribute effectively to the European economy's recovery."
"In terms of the principal recommendations for the review, I would like to highlight the importance of simplifying access to funds, and adapting thematic priorities and the suitability of rules to new challenges."
"Simplifying access to research funds will allow the rules and processes to be made simpler, clearer and more transparent."
"As such, any recommendations in the report which concern simplification but do not require the financial regulations to be revised should still be included in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on the measures which have already been implemented."
"Secondly, I would like to highlight the need for greater emphasis to be placed on thematic areas crucial for the future of Europe, such as energy security, the environment and health care."
"Thirdly, the adaptation of rules for participating in new challenges will enable, for instance, greater participation by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and by young researchers in research projects."
"Finally, I welcome the guidelines for the next framework programme."
"I would particularly stress the recommendation to substantially increase the budget for science and innovation in the EU's next financial framework."
"Only in this way will Europe become more competitive and prosperous."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Audy for his excellent cooperation on the review of the framework programme for research."
"The EU is facing a huge challenge, which is coming from the likes of China, India and Brazil."
"These countries are experiencing massive economic development."
"We therefore need to be even better at creating growth and jobs through research and innovation - otherwise the EU will be left out of the knowledge race."
"The Seventh Framework Programme has been successful, but there is room for improvement."
"I have three priorities when we negotiate the Eighth Framework Programme."
"We must simplify the application and reporting procedures."
"We simply have to deal with the bureaucracy."
"Secondly, we must have the courage to aim for freedom and flexibility."
"Researchers themselves must have the freedom to select the most important areas of research, and, in particular, the programme must be flexible enough to be able to deal with the challenges of tomorrow."
"That will create better results."
"We must also become better at being able to work and think in an interdisciplinary manner."
"Madam President, the Seventh Framework Programme for research is the largest research programme in the world: it has a budget of EUR 54.6 billion for the current period 2007-2013 and has funded over 9 000 projects to date."
"The question is whether its results are worthy of this major investment."
"Judging from the previous speeches, I think that to ask the question is partly to answer it."
"Europe is struggling to do as well as it might, and we know the main reasons for this, as they have been pointed out: there is, broadly speaking, a North-South divide in Europe where research and development are concerned;"
"Europe is also lagging behind in terms of research and development spending by businesses; and researchers and SMEs have difficulty in accessing the various programmes, as our rapporteur mentioned."
"There is room for optimism, and fortunately so, because the Council, Parliament and the Commission are fully in agreement on this issue and are aware of this need to shift the focus of European research and innovation on to the major social and economic challenges that exist."
"I am, of course, thinking of climate change - an issue already discussed - but I am also thinking of energy security, the post-Fukushima period, which will have to be managed, and food safety, rocked by the E. Coli bacterium."
"It is also vital to avoid doing too much at once - in this respect, I obviously share Mr Audy's desire to set clearly defined priorities for the Europe of research."
"That is the idea expressed in paragraph 9 of the report."
"Europe must give itself the means to achieve specific major objectives."
"The rapporteur also mentioned the EUR 28 billion still to be spread over the remaining three years."
"Since we are talking about specific priorities and areas, I shall conclude by specifically mentioning one such area - nanotechnologies - in which I believe more investment is needed, given the many sectors in which they can potentially be used: medicine, agri-food production, electronics, new materials and new energies."
"Yes, it is up to our experts to start this revolution, but the European Union - I am about to finish - must take the lead and conquer this territory of the infinitely small."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, research and innovation are key to delivering growth and to meeting our biggest challenges."
"I have seen much excellent research funded by European grants, both in collaborative projects with industry and across borders, and in individual grants to expert scientists."
"However, Europe's framework programme has a reputation for being the most bureaucratic in the world."
"Commissioner, I still think you can do more for simplification."
"Money is tight and funds must get rapidly to the scientists in the lab, and not just to those who fill in the forms and check the accounts."
"Not every bid can be financed, and in the world of research, added value is, of course, difficult to measure, but I do not believe that a common European system for evaluating performance is the only way forward."
"We need scientists who compete with the best in the world and they should be evaluated on the world stage."
"We also must not compromise that principle of excellence."
"The European Research Council, for example, has done much to support individual scientists."
"If their mandate is changed to support team-based projects, this must not be to the detriment of supporting individuals of excellence."
"I would like to see more money for research but there is no bottomless bank account."
"I, and my group, cannot support doubling the EU budget in one area without a commitment to showing where that money can come from elsewhere."
"We would instead like to see public money work more intelligently, both alongside private investment and through better public procurement."
"Madam President, first and foremost, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Audy for the work he has done and for the excellent way he has collaborated with all of us, in all the groups, and for the openness that he has shown throughout the process."
"I think that the review of this Seventh Framework Programme is absolutely crucial."
"I cannot stress enough the importance of issues like transparency, simplification and redistribution, which are essential, and are clearly outlined in this report and in the positions Parliament has been adopting."
"I think research and innovation are fundamental contributions to a fairer, more redistributive and more sustainable development model, so we cannot let some factors fall by the wayside."
"Since many have already been mentioned here, I will mention factors that are often forgotten."
"Firstly, the review has made clear that the distribution of research funds continues to be too concentrated, and we cannot afford to lose sight of this."
"Some countries, research units and centres, and large industries are able to access research funds far more easily than others."
"We cannot agree with this model."
"We have to achieve an increase in participation by the new Member States and the countries of the south, which, incidentally, happen to have the greatest need for access to funding."
"Secondly, I believe that the participation of actual participants and civil society organisations should also be increased."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) continue to present an important challenge."
"Thirdly, a note on the precariousness of research work: research that is high quality or excellent will not be possible if we continue to allow researchers in certain parts of Europe to be subjected to working conditions which are not worthy of that name."
"That said, I would, above all, like to express my thanks for the work that has been done."
"I think this is an important step for Parliament."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Audy for his excellent report."
"The FP7 is one of the largest research programmes in the world, and it is good for us to do the mid-term evaluation."
"First of all, I am delighted to see that there is a unanimous call for simplification measures for our rules on financing methods."
"Secondly, it is important that we focus on the inadequate participation of SMEs in the programme and that we call for measures to improve this, especially since future growth and job creation in the EU depend on them."
"Thirdly, I strongly support the Marie Curie Actions."
"I would also like to add that it would be vital in the medium term to develop a mechanism to evaluate and assess the progress and the measurable impact of innovation policies and programmes in the EU."
"To conclude, I must say that the level of financing of FP7 must be maintained, as we realise that investing in R&D is key to achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Audy and all my fellow Members who have worked on this."
"A review of this kind is, of course, an important prerequisite for the conclusions that we then need to draw."
"We would surely all agree that the question of investment in research is central to the future of Europe."
"However, whether we then have the courage to draw the right conclusions from this remains to be seen when we go into the next round."
"Do we have the courage to ensure that we do, and will we manage to make adequate financial resources available?"
"Everyone says that we will, but it will be difficult."
"How will we manage to use the existing resources more efficiently?"
"I am very grateful for the fact that, in this debate, we have attached a great deal of importance to the question of simplification, including in connection with Mrs Carvalho's report."
"How are we going to do things more simply, faster and more effectively, and how are we going to achieve better results with the existing resources?"
"Alongside the question of adequate funding, that is another key issue."
"Thirdly, we must ensure - and in this regard I would contradict some of my fellow Members - that we do not distribute the funds according to the principle that 'everyone should get a bit'."
"That is not the principle we should use for research funds."
"Research funds can only be allocated according to the principle of excellence."
"The result - regrettably - is that the funds are not distributed equally to all Member States."
"That means that we face an enormous task, namely that of ensuring that improvements are made in precisely those Member States that do not yet meet the excellence criteria."
"For this, we clearly need other instruments, because this issue has not yet been resolved."
"In future, we will need an array of instruments, not to ensure that the funds are evenly distributed, but so that other funds with other instruments are used in order to place the emphasis on particular aspects."
"Last but not least, we must fund fewer projects."
"We cannot avoid taking a decision as regards which elementary aspects we want to focus on."
"If everyone introduces a new subject, it will not benefit research funding in the long run."
"We need to have the courage to look and see what is particularly good and what, in particular, we want to continue to fund."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, to what extent have the weaknesses detected in our R&D system become strengths with the Seventh Framework Programme?"
"There was a need to stimulate basic research and the European Research Council was fittingly created, which will be required to perform better at combining excellence and cohesion in the future."
"There was a need for more researchers and the Marie Curie Actions were introduced, which still require an even greater effort."
"A greater degree of participation was sought by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and we have successfully attained a figure close to 15%, which could be further improved with increased simplification."
"There was also a need for more funding, particularly private funding, which still remains a weakness, not only due to the crisis, but because certain instruments such as Joint Technological Initiatives (JTIs) frankly leave room for improvement."
"Nonetheless, Mr Audy, I have no doubt that, thanks to the lessons learnt in this mid-term review, the framework programme will reach an even greater degree of excellence."
"Congratulations on your report."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the experts from the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Audy, for their work."
"This mid-term retrospection is crucial."
"The EU has a lack of reactivity, which has prevented it from achieving the Lisbon strategy targets."
"Nevertheless, in terms of research and innovation, there are a few points where the EU still has the leadership and can be proud."
"The EU faces many challenges that are not necessarily faced by its competitors, yet it manages to stay in the competition."
"I am referring to the lack of natural presence of energy sources on European soil, which is definitely an obstacle to development and innovation."
"I am also referring to the ageing of the European population, which is another challenge which characterises the EU."
"But in spite of this, the EU has the most ambitious and the most binding regulations in terms of environmental protection."
"It also has the highest social standards and respects workers at work."
"I think we can be proud of this fact."
"We live on a continent where certain values are still a core concern and are not too greatly affected by globalisation."
"In my opinion, you could not become the most sustainable knowledge-based economy in the world without having respect for the values which characterise European society."
"I believe this will pay dividends in the future."
"(PL) Madam President, an increase in innovation in the European Union is one of the key elements of economic development, especially in times of crisis."
"The rapporteur correctly placed great emphasis on this aspect."
"Unfortunately, it seems to me that some key questions were presented in too general a manner."
"First of all, however, it is worth mentioning the relatively small amount of money earmarked for innovation in the new EU Member States."
"You could almost say that the huge difference and disproportion between the countries of the old Union and the new EU Member States are striking in this instance."
"This was mentioned in merely one sentence in the report."
"Their modest participation is negatively perceived, and has a negative impact on the sustainable development of the Union, as well as on its cohesion."
"It is worth mentioning here that in spite of the EUR 86 billion earmarked for research during the funding period 2007-2013, there is no sign of any change in this state of affairs, so the funds awarded under the Cohesion Fund for innovation in the next financial perspective should take greater account of the factor of balanced management of funds for the old and the new EU Member States."
"After all, this innovation represents an opportunity for these new European countries, and their science and new technologies should also be developed for the general good of Europe, in a cohesive way."
"It should also be stressed that research funding problems primarily affect small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In view of the tightening of monetary policy due to the financial and economic crisis, loans, which are essential for long-term investments linked to innovation, are being restricted."
"This state of affairs must be taken into account in order to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to be awarded loans for such purposes."
"It is also worth mentioning that administrative procedures in this regard need to be simplified."
"(IT) Madam President, I, too, should like to thank Mr Audy and the entire Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for the excellent work they have carried out and for the useful debate that has developed around this incredibly important topic."
"I think that there is just one point that has not yet been made here today and that is the need to acknowledge that Europe is now some way behind in terms of research and innovation."
"We are quick to boast of the results we have achieved but we would do equally well to recognise that, in some areas, we are lagging behind not only our traditional competitor, the United States, but also very strong competitors such as China and other countries."
"I therefore think that if Europe does not want to fall in on itself and die, it must decide to invest more heavily in research and innovation."
"This is not, however, a decision that we need to make this evening during this debate but rather in the context of a broader debate that relates to the financial perspective and the whole question of how to use the resources that we have at our disposal."
"In short, this is definitely the number one issue!"
"That said, I believe that the issues addressed by Mr Audy and Mrs Carvalho - on which I will focus in other speeches - are all worthy of note."
"They cover simplification, the need to coordinate funding, the attempt to develop Europe 2020, excellence and innovation, while reflecting the fact that there are two main strands to all this: the first is small and medium-sized enterprises, the beating heart of Europe, where we must promote innovation and promote it through simplification; and the second is large research centres, which we really ought to have more of."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very fine report by our fellow Member, Mr Audy, summarises all our discussions with the operators in the sector."
"I am not going to go over their assessment of our Seventh Framework Programme: that it is indispensable but too complicated and too bureaucratic."
"I would just like to emphasise two points."
"Firstly, innovation."
"Parliament has pledged to promote it, but it must not do so at the expense of fundamental research."
"As we well know, the main result of research is knowledge, followed by the opportunity to enhance that result in the economic sector, or indeed the industrial sector."
"A clear distinction must be made, then, between the manipulation and the enhancement of fundamental research."
"Secondly, financing."
"We all agree that the budget should match our ambitions."
"I would go so far as to say that, on this issue, we should be innovative by being consistent."
"It is pointless bringing in more instruments; let us make the existing ones more effective."
"In this respect, the risk-sharing finance facility is a real success, but it must take a more inclusive approach to SMEs and research infrastructure."
"I therefore call on the Commission to do everything in its power to solve the disputes as quickly as possible and to take into account the courses of action proposed in this report."
"(SL) Madam President, the Seventh Framework Programme came into force in 2007 after enlargement of the EU by 12 new Member States."
"Obviously, these two major enlargements have increased diversity in the European Union."
"This is where the question arises: does the Seventh Framework Programme adequately take into account that diversity, i.e. has it been designed so as to promote research excellence uniformly throughout the European Union."
"The review has identified certain patterns, of which I note two in particular."
"Firstly, uneven geographical participation and poor participation in projects by researchers from certain parts of the Union, especially those from the less developed regions and from the countries which joined the EU in 2004 or later."
"Secondly, researchers from the smaller Member States are very poorly represented as project coordinators."
"The explanation I have so far been given for this situation is that research excellence is the main criterion for selection to the Seventh Framework Programme."
"This leads to the conclusion that the quality of research in the regions which are very poorly represented in the projects is low."
"You could wonder, though, if that actually is the real reason."
"Such pronouncements should not be made arbitrarily."
"I therefore call on the Commission to look into the causes of this rather uneven geographical distribution of projects and coordinators."
"After all, it is in the interests of the Member States which are lagging behind EU research excellence to take advantage of resources from the European Structural Funds to strengthen their scientific and research sectors."
"This opportunity should also be available in the next financial perspective."
"However, structural funds should be used only within the Member States to which they have been allocated."
"The idea that such funds should flow from the less developed countries to the more developed ones in order for the latter to build their research infrastructure, for example, is unacceptable, because the gap between regions would only increase."
"I hope that the Commission will be able to dispel doubts with regard to equal opportunities for researchers and coordinators from various regions and countries of the Union, provided, obviously, that they meet the scientific excellence requirement."
"(PT) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Audy on his excellent report."
"Although it was overdue, the mid-term review pointed out the most critical aspects of the Seventh Framework Programme: its excessive bureaucracy, industry's lack of interest, the sheer number and complexity of its new instruments, and the slow pace of payments."
"There is also an increased risk of large transfers of funds from the current framework programme to large-scale programmes which offer questionable added value."
"However, the report was also able to point to positive elements, such as stronger international cooperation between scientific groups working on common projects, certain success stories, like the European Research Council, and a better gender balance."
"There are certain elements that need to be prioritised: firstly, the simplification of the programme, and secondly, the promotion of scientific excellence, not only in some countries but throughout Europe, a stronger connection between the framework programme and innovation, and with instruments directed at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurship."
"The Eurostar programme is the most successful example of this and should be developed further."
"(DE) Madam President, what we need to do, quite simply, is to strengthen the research community and thus the economic power of Europe amidst international competition."
"We therefore need to examine what own resources could be available to us in the Eighth Framework Programme for research."
"I would like to call on the Commissioner to make use of the revenue generated through the emissions trading system in order to actually resolve the CO2 problem."
"That would be a significant starting point."
"We would have tens of billions of euro available to us that we could use for the 'intelligent energy' programme, for our wide range of battery platforms, and for the many ways of providing ourselves with a sustainable environment."
"That could be discussed with Commissioner Lewandowski and, of course, with the finance ministers."
"We also need to enhance the Competition and Innovation Programme (CIP)."
"I believe that, in the CIP in particular, information and communications technology should be used to provide the necessary equipment and hardware to allow researchers to communicate faster, better and more efficiently using the latest technology."
"Integrating optical fibre connections in satellite equipment and forming corresponding clusters would be a sensational undertaking, as would the establishment of the European Institute for Technology."
"In this regard, we simply need to introduce the content of the research carried out in the Seventh Framework Programme for research and the CIP and the various other programmes to our educational establishments, namely, to professors, teachers and nursery school teachers."
"We quite simply need pupils and students to have access to the most up-to-date knowledge of our time."
"Last but not least, the European Research Council does an excellent job, and the work that it funds should be made widely available to the public as quickly as possible."
"I would like to expressly thank Mr Audy once again for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and as Mr Correia De Campos also said, the 'Eurostars' programme could become one of the major projects of the future."
"(RO) Madam President, first of all, I, too, need to congratulate Mr Audy for all his efforts on this report."
"Our capacity to unite and coordinate our efforts on research determines our economic competitiveness."
"I support the idea that better coordination, coherence and synergy between the Seventh Framework Programme and the Structural and Cohesion Funds may also improve the participation of currently under-represented Member States."
"Collaborative transnational research must remain a priority."
"Member States must cooperate rather than compete with each other."
"The success rate, which has been modest so far, can be improved by simplifying administrative and financial regulations."
"To conclude in English: earlier this year, Commissioner Quinn stated that 'we need to send red tape to the shredder."
"We need simple and clear rules, consistently and rigorously applied'."
"Today I ask you, Commissioner, to help us to move from words to action. Thank you."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, sometimes it is good to take a look back, especially in the midst of a period like this one, and just before establishing the financial framework and the legislative programme of this House."
"What becomes clear is that scientific research in Europe is top quality."
"The problem is how to turn that research into products and how to organise the whole chain."
"Clearly, there is not all that much sense in us generating very large numbers of patents that are sold all over the world if the resultant added value then ends up in other parts of the world."
"Thus, we need to capture the interest of our people and get them involved in such a way - we need to train them in such a way - that the whole process takes place here."
"I have a second comment to make."
"This is all about excellence, but excellence must stand on its own two feet rather than simply being free floating intelligence."
"Excellence must take root in the regions and the cities."
"It must not be allowed to be the case that this high degree of added value is only found in the metropolitan regions."
"As Parliament, it is our job to bring about the combination of what the research produces and what can be done with that in terms of innovation."
"You have formulated your own Innovation Union, with very good initiatives, and then there are also the various other funds, such as the structural funds, for example, which we can use for this purpose."
"Over the coming years, we need to make use of the conditionality."
"In this sense, we need to also ensure that regions that are lagging a little behind invest in specialisation."
"This can also take place with the Member States' own money, not just through European funding."
"In that way, you create a common agenda, and instruments such as joint programming are also of great importance in this regard."
"I have two more brief points to make."
"First of all, we need to persist with facilities that bear risks."
"This initiative, the European Investment Bank's risk-sharing finance facility, has worked exceedingly well."
"Secondly, Mrs Carvalho, of course, you have done very well."
"There is less red tape."
"Now let go of the reins on these joint technology initiatives (JTIs), where industry plays a 50% role, yet we carry on as if they were public sector organisations!"
"That simply cannot work."
"You have my thanks for this interim report."
"It is very important, and when the new regulations are laid down, we will translate it into new prospects."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"The most important issue which I would like to highlight is the simplification of current rules and procedures for programmes supporting research and innovation activities, and the need to identify the reasons for the under-representation of the new EU Member States."
"A future framework programme must meet current needs in such a way that each country is able to develop a research area, research activities and innovation with the help of common financial instruments, which, if they are well managed, would make it possible for measures to be focused on social and market needs."
"Making it possible for associations, for enterprises, especially micro-enterprises in the form of clusters, and for national or regional networks of technological platforms to participate in a future framework programme is an essential task."
"At the same time, I would like to stress that maintaining the diversity of the European Union's regions in the field of innovation requires particular attention to be paid to the formulation of a common strategic financial framework for scientific research and innovation."
"It is also worth paying attention to the synergy of actions taken at European, national and regional level, with the additional introduction of common administrative and financial regulations, and a compulsory harmonisation of rules and conditions governing participation in various programmes, creating a common and transparent system."
"I hope that the conclusions drawn during the evaluation process for the Seventh Framework Programme will form the basis for further work on the next one, the Eighth."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his eminent report on this mid-term review."
"I think there are three things that should be underlined."
"The first point is simplification - less bureaucracy - and we stated that when we started the Seventh Framework Programme."
"It did become less bureaucratic, and I think researchers and others dealing with these projects are aware of that, but there is much more to do."
"And I think that in some ways, we can put greater trust in the universities that have existed for centuries."
"They will not run away with the money."
"The second point is excellence."
"The whole value of our joint and common effort is that we are trying to add a special European value, providing excellence."
"We have all the Member States financing their research and science and we also have, as has been mentioned, the Structural Funds."
"With regard to this framework programme, if we do not aim for excellence, we will lose the competitive edge that we need to have in the future."
"The third point is mobility."
"I think one of the striking things we have experienced is that the mobility we can achieve via the framework programme is creating the special climate and the special preconditions for excellence."
"And I am happy that the rapporteur has made the proposal for a research voucher, trying to secure that we have a spontaneous process for excellence between researchers in Europe by creating and increasing their mobility."
"So once again, my thanks to the rapporteur."
"(GA) Madam President, we are not often unanimous on a subject in this Chamber and it was clear today that the Commission and the various Members of Parliament were unanimous on this subject and especially on how we should move forward."
"Great praise is due to the rapporteur, Mr Audy."
"As the Commissioner said, 'He brought forward a rich and comprehensive report'."
"He brought forward a rich and comprehensive report and I am delighted that the emphasis has been on a few simple things."
"The first one is simple itself: simplification."
"The need for simplification is absolutely vital."
"I was pleased to hear the Commissioner saying that we are moving to a user-friendly financial regulation."
"We have got to simplify, trust the researchers and ensure that we have the very best researchers."
"If we have that, then we will get results."
"Finally, we have failed with the Lisbon strategy."
"This situation cannot be repeated."
"It is through research, demonstration and delivery that we can achieve the competitiveness that Europe so badly needs."
"(RO) Madam President, in the current climate, and with a view to meeting the EU 2020 objectives, the Seventh Framework Programme needs to respond to the current challenges."
"Making it simpler for SMEs to access funding affords them an opportunity to develop new types of services and products."
"The level of financial contribution, the documentation which needs to be produced, the provision of access to information and specialist advice must be realistic because, otherwise, we will not be able to create the framework facilitating SMEs' access to this programme, regardless of the objectives."
"I also think it is vital that greater importance is attached to the development of research at regional level by encouraging multi-level partnerships and supporting the drafting of methodological guides or guidelines for this purpose."
"We cannot meet objectives without clearly establishing the procedures and encouraging or supporting the development of useful tools."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"As they both said, research and innovation is important for the future of the European economy."
"I certainly know that there are many universities in Wales, for example, which will take advantage of European funding."
"Therefore, I think that it is important that we all support adequate funding for research and innovation in the EU budget; we should not say we support it in this meeting and vote against it in the budget meetings."
"On the key issues raised this afternoon, of course we would all support simplification, such as a common set of rules."
"I am aware, however, of some concerns about always using flat rates and lump sums, so I believe we should be looking for some flexibility and discretion in those areas."
"I would also argue that we should focus on performance."
"But while performance is important, research and innovation does mean we also have to accept some risk- taking as well, and we cannot rule that out."
"Finally, I would also support the proposal to create better links between universities and businesses so that we can take advantage of all the research and development undertaken."
"(RO) Madam President, competitiveness is not an option for the European Union."
"The European Union must be globally competitive, which is why we need to invest in research and innovation."
"Unfortunately, the beneficiaries of the research programmes use a number of national and EU sources of funding."
"However, all these sources of funding very often have different procedures and rules, which makes it difficult to access EU funds and complicates matters for the beneficiaries, given the different rules which need to be learnt."
"We also think that research and innovation in the European Union can only be developed by cutting red tape, simplifying and converging procedures, developing applied research and making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access funding."
"We deplore the fact that, due to the economic and financial crisis, Member States have reduced their education and research budgets and we call on them to invest in education as a priority during this crisis period, as the quality of research and innovation also depends on this."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Audy, for accepting the amendment I tabled asking the Commission to introduce more money in the Seventh Framework Programme for research into, and development of, GNSS applications and services."
"Madam President, I believe that this report will have broad agreement across all groups in Parliament."
"The key element of this report is that the Union must stay at the forefront in the area of research, innovation and science."
"This is important because without research, we cannot become the innovators of tomorrow."
"We need research if we are to create jobs, and we need research, of course, to maintain employment in the EU and to remain competitive against the emerging economies."
"We also need the public sector and, indeed, the private sector, which I believe is the engine of growth in the economy, to work together in a spirit of partnership."
"Efforts to encourage greater participation by SMEs must also be encouraged at the highest level and we must ensure that bureaucracy is kept to the minimum."
"The EU Heads of State or Government endorsed the 'Innovation Union' flagship initiative when they met on 4 February, but endorsement is not sufficient."
"Now we need action, and I know full well that Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn is a Commissioner of action and will follow through."
"Research and innovation are the key tools."
"They are the tools at our disposal to help Europe through the economic crisis that we currently face."
"(DE) Madam President, the review of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) should be based on the advantages and disadvantages that the projects bring for citizens."
"I am thinking, for example, of the INDECT project, which was funded by the FP7."
"The intended benefit of combating terrorism has to be weighed against citizens' freedom and data protection."
"With any project, we must therefore ask the question: who will profit from it and whose rights will be inadmissibly curtailed?"
"That also applies to the funding of research in the field of genetic engineering."
"The ones who profit from this are the large food manufacturers, the lobbyists, but certainly not our citizens."
"Yes, we must invest to a greater extent in research and development, but we also need better evaluation of the projects, which, at the end of day, are funded by taxpayers."
"Madam President, thank you to the rapporteur for this report and my thanks also to the Commissioner who recently paid a visit to my constituency of Northern Ireland, where I know she saw some excellent examples of research and innovation."
"The Northern Ireland economy is a small and medium-sized enterprise economy - 97% of all businesses can be classified in this way - yet it is an economy that lags behind other regions of the United Kingdom and Europe in drawing down money from the framework programme."
"Bureaucracy is cited as the main difficulty and many small businesses are simply more concerned about keeping open the door than they are about the long-term benefits of the research and innovation programme."
"I believe that the example shown by the aerospace industry in Northern Ireland is a significant one - larger companies mentoring and helping smaller companies to actually access the programme - and I would use this opportunity to call upon the Commissioner to provide us with radical and new ways for small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from this very important programme."
"(DE) Madam President, the Seventh Framework Programme for research is not just about research in general; it is also about a specific field of research that ought to be of particular concern to all of us following the Fukushima disaster."
"It is also about funds from the Euratom programme."
"As we all know, it is the nuclear lobby that has succeeded in recent years in promoting nuclear power as a climate-friendly alternative."
"It is particularly strong in some EU Member States."
"We are also well aware that some Member States have gone in for nuclear power in such a way that it would not be easy for them to switch to alternatives."
"What is the use of productive reactors if they buckle under water masses or in the event of earthquakes?"
"What is the use of the most productive nuclear power station if a minor fault is enough to make not only the immediate surroundings, but the whole region uninhabitable for decades?"
"It is therefore important for us to focus more strongly on nuclear safety and to push ahead with the development of alternatives."
"Now that the Euratom research programme is shortly to be extended to 2012 and 2013, Fukushima ought to be taken as an opportunity for a rethink."
"(PL) Madam President, listening to today's debate on the Seventh Framework Programme, I would like to take the opportunity to draw your attention to the preparations for the following programme, the Eighth Framework Programme."
"We already have a Green Paper about it which barely mentions the need for research in other areas, such as fisheries."
"Unfortunately, direct funding of research in this sector is developing in a very worrying direction."
"We started off with resources which gradually decreased in subsequent programmes, and these radical cuts led to the Seventh FP totally excluding marine research as a specific funding target."
"In the next framework programme, this situation must change so that we will be able to fulfil the aims of the reformed common fisheries policy."
"The fisheries sector is facing many problems, so research and scientific support work are powerful tools for the further sustainable development of this sector."
"This is why it is so important to allocate appropriate funding for this aim. Thank you."
"Madam President, I am very grateful for the valuable debate we have had here this evening and I would like to thank all the Members who participated in that valuable debate."
"I will work closely with this House as we move forward and build a future programme for research and innovation with a genuine European added value."
"By the end of the year - on 30 November in fact - we will put on the table our proposals for future funding programmes for research and innovation within the common strategic framework."
"We have already set out some ideas in our Green Paper about how to achieve this by bringing together the different instruments at EU level under a single umbrella."
"We can support the whole innovation chain, all the way from the basic research to market deployment."
"In this way, I believe, we will get the maximum impact from our investments."
"I look forward very much to hearing the outcome of your debates on our Green Paper, which I understand will be adopted in late summer."
"I can assure you that the enriching inputs given by the Carvalho, Merkies, Audy and Matias reports will be duly taken into account when preparing the legislative proposals."
"Finally, let me recall that on 10 June, we will organise the wrap-up event of the Green Paper consultation to which several Members of this Parliament have been invited, some of you as speakers."
"I would like to inform the Members of the House that more than 1 300 responses to the online questionnaire were received."
"There were also an unprecedented number of position papers."
"We received over 700 such papers from national governments, from European-level associations, from businesses, from universities, and from regional and local organisations."
"Replies came from all countries of the European Union and beyond."
"I believe that this has shown the great interest that Europe attaches to research and innovation as policies for our future growth."
"So let me thank you once again for the insight and the impetus that this House has given to the FP7 interim evaluation."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Presidency of Parliament for having allowed this debate to take place, as it was not on the agenda initially."
"It is very helpful for all the political groups to be able to debate this important issue."
"I should also like to say how grateful we are to you, Commissioner."
"I speak on behalf of all those who hold you in high esteem."
"You even have the support of the Irish members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"As you can see, on these issues, anyway, anything can happen."
"Thank you for what you are doing."
"We are really counting on you when it comes to simplification and to the important messages we are sending you, Commissioner."
"I should like to thank the rapporteurs from all the political groups, my fellow Members who tabled numerous amendments, and the contributors to this report - and may I say a special thank you to those from the PPE Group."
"Thank you for discussing the issue of simplification; we have taken note of your comments."
"The words 'industrial competitiveness' raise expectations."
"We must make the link between research and trade - that is, between research and innovation - via the European patent."
"Research must be transformed into growth."
"As Mr Reul said, we must, of course, encourage excellence."
"We must become the best in the world, and it is excellence that will get us there."
"As I said before, however, we do not know who the Nobel prizewinners will be in five or ten years' time."
"Therefore, we need to strike a balance between excellence and distribution across the EU."
"Just as in sport, where we win with the world's best players, we need to have the world's best researchers."
"Excellence is the key word."
"Lastly, we have proposed to double the amount of funding, but not at the expense of agriculture or of the Structural Funds."
"The aim is better coordination with the Member States."
"The Heads of State or Government have told us that they will not be increasing the amount of public sector contributions."
"Instead, we must improve the coordination of European funds, national funds and regional funds - some of which, incidentally, come from European funds - for the sake of consistency and good policy making."
"My final point, Madam President, is this: I had proposed - the proposal was not taken up, but this is a subject that we shall have to address on a political level - that we adopt a European research plan for the defence industry."
"The time has come for the European Union and the Member States, under Article 45 of the Treaty on European Union, to consider a major research programme in the field of defence equipment and, of course, dual use equipment."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) is the world's most significant research support programme, which plays a key role in maintaining the competitiveness of Europe and the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"FP7 demonstrates a significant added value in the field of European research and innovation."
"However, the mid-term review revealed several areas that need to be developed."
"In my opinion, two aspects are crucial for the future success of FP7."
"The first and most urgent task would be the simplification of bureaucratic burdens."
"The overly complex administration is costly and provides a disincentive for SMEs to participate in FP7."
"Elimination of parallel structures, quicker transfer of funds, and harmonisation of FP7 with national priorities can all contribute to making the largest possible number of actors interested in research and innovation activities."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise the importance of an excellence-based approach, since the financial resources of FP7 can most effectively be used if the selection of research projects to be supported is based on excellence."
"However, the mid-term review revealed that certain countries are under-represented in respect of the transfer of funds."
"The main reason behind this is that these Member States do not have a research background infrastructure that would make it possible for them to meet the excellence-based criteria."
"Thus, the synergies between FP7 and the Structural and Cohesion Funds need to be revised, which, in turn, could promote the development of infrastructures which are lagging behind."
"In this way, we can provide a level playing field for all Member States where excellence-based assessment is concerned."
"The Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities is an important instrument for achieving the Europe 2020 strategy targets."
"Europe's leading role in technological innovation and the Union's future competitiveness are also very dependent on scientific research."
"In this regard, what is required is greater focus on support for the programme, a stronger connection with business requirements and better coordination with the EU's other financial instruments and with the Structural Funds."
"Important factors contributing to the programme's success also include providing access to information about the potential opportunities it offers to the widest number of stakeholders possible and simplifying the application procedures, which are excessively complicated at the moment."
"I want to reiterate the need to promote widely the results of successfully completed projects so that more companies can access and, where possible, use them."
"Science does not exist as an end in itself."
"It should provide benefits for the economy and society."
"Links between individual programmes need to be strengthened to ensure consistency when carrying out scientific and demonstration projects, as well as marketing testing and market replication projects."
"This will enable us to achieve greater efficiency and higher European added value from FP7 funding."
"An abiding problem in all reports on innovation is the lack of a clear and specific framework for R&D investment from EU funds."
"This problem is apparent yet again in the Audy report and, what is more, it involves yet another unresolved issue, namely, the imbalance in EU funding."
"The author barely mentions the lack of equality in absorption of funding between Western Europe and the new EU Member States."
"The poor state of funding can be seen, inter alia, in the take-up of the risk-sharing finance facility (RSFF)."
"Projects cofinanced under the facility have been implemented in only 18 out of 27 Member States."
"Additionally, its greatest beneficiaries are applicants from the so-called old EU Member States: Germany (23.1% of all those awarded funding), Spain (19.1%), the United Kingdom (9.9%) and the Netherlands (8.3%)."
"Today, around one third of research is funded under the facility."
"It seems to me that it should be proportionally increased so that the entrepreneur's own contribution should not exceed 10 to 15% of the required amount (currently, the amount required is 15 to 25% of the amount allocated for research)."
"We should remember that one of the EU's main tasks is to eliminate social and geographical imbalances through the distribution of benefits deriving from innovation throughout the EU."
"We will not be able to achieve this goal if we neglect the new EU Member States in financial terms, thus supporting a further one-sided 'brain drain'."
"I welcome the emerging trend for increased funding for scientific research in the European Union."
"At the same time, I believe that it is essential to combine our forces and expenditure in this area."
"Reforms should be implemented at national level as soon as possible to enable the creation of centres that cooperate well and to avoid duplication of work on the same projects."
"This would also contribute to an improved use of funds."
"The European Union must remember the significance of research in terms of providing a competitive edge in today's global world."
"In particular, Member States should reform the way they carry out research on security, one of the key areas mentioned in the report, to ensure that it is optimised during times of financial crisis."
"The attractive nature of the Seventh Framework Programme for research has not been fully demonstrated in the industrial sector."
"In addition to the need for new funding, better coordination is also required between the European Union, Member States and regions on research, development and innovation (RDI)."
"Firstly, the link between the Cohesion Funds and the Framework Programme for research must be improved."
"I must stress the importance of the cohesion policy as it has become a major source of support in Europe for research and innovation."
"Secondly, research and innovation policies must be tailored to the market's specific needs."
"The demand for innovative technologies on the EU market must be identified in order to sell the results of innovation."
"I think that suitable financial instruments should be available to support the successful introduction of innovative technologies on the EU market."
"Last but not least, I should mention that in the EU, there is an extreme imbalance in terms of financial allocation, with the results indicating that the old Member States absorb the majority of the financial resources."
"This situation runs counter to the territorial cohesion objective whereby Member States are developed in a balanced manner from a geographical perspective, which is an objective stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I welcome the proposal to ensure that research supported under the Seventh Framework Programme is aimed at finding solutions to the EU's problems in the areas set out in the Cooperation chapter of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"This primarily involves health care, including clinical and preventive research and medical technologies."
"Cancer is the second most common cause of death in Europe, and due to the fact that the population is ageing, it is expected that one man in three and one woman in four will have direct experience of this disease by the age of 75."
"Cancer research is on the brink of a number of breakthroughs, especially with regard to more accurate and less expensive methods, and also methods that are less distressing for patients, in relation to both preventative check-ups and actual treatments."
"Funding cancer research can save people's lives and cut treatment costs."
"I applaud the political will in support of funding that has already been earmarked for cancer research under the programme."
"This funding must not be reduced in the EU's current economic situation; on the contrary, we must provide more."
"I would like to emphasise that if we can join forces to accomplish ambitious projects such as abolishing state borders or constructing space stations, we should be able to find a way to turn cancer into a disease that no one need fear."
"In order to do so, we need support for, and coordination of, research into treatment methods and prevention."
"The fight against cancer is a European issue which should be a priority for us, from the funding under the Seventh Framework Programme to the umbrella agency at European level."
"EU-Canada trade relations (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the question to the Commission on EU-Canada trade relations, by Vital Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B7-0213/2011)."
"Madam President, as Chair of Parliament's Committee on International Trade, it falls to me to table an oral question to the Commission concerning the negotiation of an economic and trade agreement with Canada."
"Two years after they started, in May 2009, there are indications that these negotiations may be concluded in the course of the current year."
"Given the progress of the negotiations, now is therefore an ideal moment to get information from the Commission concerning some of the most important points in these negotiations."
"The text of the question adopted by my committee is well known and, to save me from reading it, Madam President, please allow me to assume there are copies."
"As we know, since the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has had the right to be informed on all stages of negotiation for international agreements."
"This obviously includes international trade agreements, which constitute an exclusive competence of Parliament, and for which parliamentary scrutiny is more justified."
"It is important to mention that the Commissioner for Trade, Mr de Gucht, and the Directorate-General for Trade have fulfilled this duty of providing information to the parliamentary committee which I chair, in this and other cases."
"It is nonetheless important to share information with Parliament and the public on the most important issues at stake, given the progress of the negotiations in this instance."
"This includes matters which are very sensitive for Parliament and the European public such as, for example, the issue of the famous tar sands and Canadian opposition in the World Trade Organisation to the European ban on products made from seals."
"We therefore believe this oral question and the developments that it may entail to be of particular importance."
"It only remains to inform Parliament that this oral question is accompanied, as usual, by a resolution on the same issue which will be voted on this Wednesday."
"Both initiatives are testament to the great importance that the Committee on International Trade and, in our view, Parliament, should place on this matter."
"Madam President, Commissioner de Gucht is currently absent and has asked me to make the following statement in response to the parliamentary question from Vital Moreira."
"Today's plenary debate on the negotiations for a comprehensive economic and trade agreement with Canada is very welcome."
"So far, these negotiations have run smoothly, and it should be possible to conclude the bulk of an agreement before the end of the year, with a formal conclusion early in 2012."
"However, we are also entering a stage of the negotiations where things are getting more difficult: in particular, because some of the outstanding issues are related to inherent differences in our economic structure or regulatory systems."
"This is a tremendously beneficial agreement for both parties, with positive impacts on business, investors and consumers alike, thanks to the very broad scope envisaged."
"In material terms, we calculate that this could bring an additional EUR 20 billion per year to both economies."
"Where EU offensive interests, such as provincial government procurement, lie in areas of provincial competence, we have been assured that the provinces and territories of Canada will be committed to the negotiations and to the implementation of the agreement."
"In relation to your particular concerns, EU Member States have now reached an understanding on the usage of the so-called 'negative list' approach."
"A key reason why a trading partner like Canada prefers a negative list is that it provides much greater transparency and legal security, because it makes very clear which services are excluded from market opening, including also where monopolies and exclusive rights may exist in the public sector."
"Hence, the negative list approach in no way prejudices the ability of an EU Member State to continue to maintain the right to retain a monopoly in the future for a particular service."
"It remains up to the EU and Canada to decide what commitments it is willing or not to undertake in each sector, including with regard to public services or other services where future policy flexibility is important."
"EU governments will continue to have the option of imposing universal public service obligations on private operators and of subsidising public services as necessary."
"Trade agreements do not impose privatisation or deregulation obligations, and it will be no different for this CETA, which will include provisions on sustainable development covering economic, environmental and social aspects."
"Such provisions will be fully integrated within the trade agreement."
"We note the concerns that have been expressed with regard to the WTO panel on the EU's seals ban and on Canadian oil sands."
"While we understand these concerns, we believe that there are good reasons to keep these processes separated from the CETA negotiations."
"This being said, the negotiation - as in the case of any other trade negotiation - does not in any way impede the ability of the EU or its partner countries to draw up and implement environmental measures."
"More specifically, as regards the Fuels Quality Directive, I want to make it absolutely clear that the negotiation and a future agreement does not and will not represent any negative interference with regard to the implementation of that directive."
"Honourable Members, we are moving closer to an agreement which will help to provide a much-needed boost to the economies of the EU and Canada."
"We are looking forward to hearing Parliament's views during the debate today and the resolution that you will subsequently adopt."
"Madam President, the resumption of negotiations, at Canada's initiative, to upgrade bilateral cooperation under a comprehensive economic and trade agreement is a positive move, as the committee chair, Mr Moreira, pointed out."
"However, there is one issue that concerns us, which has to do with the federal structure of Canada."
"I refer to the need for the unimpeded and uniform application of the agreement by the individual provinces."
"Within the framework of trade relations between the two partners, important offensive and defensive agricultural interests, among other things, are at risk."
"On this point, I should like to voice the opinion of Mr Jeggle, who is absent today."
"Priority is being sought for full protection for geographical indications, given the increasing counterfeiting of quality EU agricultural products."
"Canada, like other states that protect geographical indications under trademarks, is, as we all know, opposed to the demands made by the EU on this point at the Doha Round negotiations."
"The different legislation of the individual provinces is an additional problematic aspect."
"As for the question of genetically modified organisms, I would remind the House that the Union and Canada have signed a mutually acceptable solution to resolve this difference."
"Canada has agreed to resolve the difference in exchange for a bilateral regulatory dialogue on biotechnology issues."
"I call on the Commission to defend the high level of protection provided by the European regulatory framework during the course of the negotiations under way."
"Finally, I would like to mention the Canadian state trading companies in the agricultural sector which, as we all know, have broad competences and can act as monopolies."
"Specific commitments need to be entered into on the Canadian side."
"This, too, is a demand which was highlighted by the Union during WTO negotiations."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, my group can see many benefits in an ambitious, comprehensive, economic trade agreement with Canada."
"However, we have four red lines."
"Firstly, on the extraction of oil sands, which damages local diversity, we insist on the EU's right to use the Fuel Quality Directive to inhibit their use."
"I was pleased to hear what the Commissioner had to say on that matter."
"Secondly, we find it hard to imagine Parliament approving a trade deal with Canada while Canada pursues a challenge, through the WTO, on the EU's trade ban."
"Here I cannot accept the Commissioner's point of view that we should keep the two matters separate."
"I think they are linked in the eyes of the voters, and they are linked in my eyes."
"I would certainly not vote for an agreement unless this dispute is settled before we reach the final stages of this deal."
"Thirdly, we would not be able to accept any limitation on Canada's ability to use the TRIPS flexibilities to export cheap generic medicines to developing countries."
"This is an important source of generics for developing countries, and we should not bow to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry to make it more difficult for Canada to provide generic medicines."
"Fourthly, we cannot accept a deal that does not address the different standards and preferences from local SMEs and state monopolies in Canada."
"This was a point that Mr Papastamkos was making about the difference between provincial and federal regulations."
"They must be dealt with before this agreement comes to conclusion."
"That said, if we find that the final text deals with these issues and is ambitious in reducing tariffs on EU spirits, on EU machinery, on EU automobiles and other areas, we will be happy to back such a free trade agreement."
"But we do insist that the four items I have mentioned are red lines and have to be dealt with properly in these negotiations."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution tabled by the Committee on International Trade clearly expresses support for the ongoing negotiations with Canada on concluding the comprehensive economic and trade agreement."
"Canada is one of our oldest and closest trading partners, currently the 11th biggest, and the potential benefits from deregulating bilateral trade are obvious, including from the study carried out by the Commission and the Canadian Government in October 2008."
"The private sector in the European Union and Canada has also expressed strong support for concluding such a comprehensive agreement, even though a number of challenges still remain, taking into account the lofty ambitions declared during the negotiations."
"I believe that the first thing we need to do is to assess the impact, which will shed some light on the pros and cons of such an agreement."
"Secondly, how realistic are the Commission's expectations that negotiations will be concluded by the end of 2011?"
"Can the Commission also guarantee that the final agreement will include a chapter on sustainable development, in keeping with Parliament's requirements?"
"Will this chapter include labour standards, the obligations associated with multilateral environmental agreements, as well as an effective mechanism for enforcing them?"
"Has a plan already been outlined enabling the Commission to resolve the issues relating to market access?"
"Can the existing differences in terms of economic structures and regulatory systems be overcome in the near future?"
"Does the Commission intend to accept the application of the principle of reciprocity as part of the existing legal protection methods when it comes to resolving trade disputes?"
"Does the Commission think that, in the long run, the implementation of the 'negative list' approach to deregulating services can set a precedent for other, future negotiations too?"
"These are questions that naturally require answers, which I am counting on receiving."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, as others have mentioned, Canada is indeed a solid trading partner for the EU."
"The abolition of the tariffs now being negotiated in the CETA framework is, on the whole, acceptable to our group."
"But sadly, CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying."
"I will mention two of the most troublesome, the first being the negative list in the negotiations on trade liberalisation."
"Normally, in negotiating FTAs, you name the services that you are ready to liberalise."
"But under these proposals, all services are open, except those specifically excluded at the outset."
"As Greens, we think there are some services, particularly those dealing with the general public interest, which are too sensitive and too potentially vulnerable to be negotiated under this 'negative list' approach."
"We have lodged some amendments and we are looking forward to some support from fellow Members."
"The other area of concern is around procurement."
"We are concerned about the impact that CETA will have on procurement."
"To give just one example, the Ontario Green Energy Act would be illegal under CETA."
"That Act promotes the production and feeding of renewable energies and directs investments into local economies."
"That is just one example of how CETA will interfere with domestic policy in Canada."
"Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners, we cannot deny that occasionally, we do have differences of opinion."
"Canada is, for instance, opposed to the EU's GMO policies."
"It is starting WTO action against the EU import ban on seals, in addition to its barbaric annual seal cull, and do not forget that it is fighting the EU Fuel Quality Directive to protect its exports of tar sands to the EU."
"I believe that it is important that we voice all these concerns and urge the Commission to remain firm in the principles and policies of this place."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, the negotiations for the EU-Canada trade agreement have been driven by major European and Canadian multinationals who want market access to vital public services so that they can profit at the expense of workers and consumers."
"This agreement would be a charter for privatisation, particularly in terms of water, telecommunications and electricity."
"The investment chapter would, outrageously, give corporations the right to sue governments when social or environmental policies cut across their profiteering."
"Canada's tar sands have become a playground for big oil companies like BP, Total and Shell."
"These oil deposits produce more than three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil and their exploitation is also extremely damaging to the local environment and a threat to the First Nations communities who live in the region."
"This trade agreement, I understand, could potentially cut across moves to stop this oil being imported into Europe."
"There is an urgent need now for united action by the European and Canadian trade union movement, with environmental and indigenous activists, to fight together and resist this proposed agreement."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, for the Commission and Parliament here to seek to use a proposed trade agreement with Canada to influence that country's internal affairs is simply wrong."
"If the Canadian Government considers that it is environmentally acceptable and economically advantageous to develop their tar sands, that is entirely a matter for them."
"Indeed, we should all welcome this enhancement and diversification of global energy."
"As far as the British national interest is concerned, the coalition government consistently neglects trade relations with the Commonwealth, of which Canada is a founder member."
"To paraphrase the commentator, Ruth Lea: because the Trade Commissioner negotiates trade deals for the whole of the EU, the brutal truth is that EU membership constrains Britain's economic prospects."
"(DE) Madam President, we can be extremely pleased that our long-standing relations with Canada, one of our oldest and closest trading partners worldwide, have been defined by common roots and values."
"As we know, in recent decades, a whole series of framework agreements for trade and economic relations have been concluded, from sectoral agreements right through to the most diverse trade initiatives."
"The EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA), with regard to which there are probably only the last few minor details that need to be worked out, will probably enter into force in the near future."
"Although the predecessor to this agreement was never actually concluded, this time, everyone involved seems to be confident."
"The Canadian chief negotiator even admitted at the start of the year that this agreement was a top priority for Canada."
"As the second largest trading partner, the EU is clearly intended to be established as a counterbalance to the US market and, conversely, as far as Europe is concerned, Canada represents a gateway to the NAFTA economic area."
"If the experts prove to be right, the conclusion of the CETA could increase bilateral trade between the European Union and Canada by 20% by 2014."
"Those are extremely appealing prospects, particularly in economically strained times."
"If we consider that, after Saudi Arabia, Canada has the largest oil reserves, this is probably also of strategic significance in the context of European efforts to achieve more energy security, and that is something that we should definitely bear in mind."
"(SV) Madam President, Canada is one of our most important trading partners."
"Therefore, this is also one of the most important free trade agreements."
"It brings considerable advantages, and all studies show that it could increase trade significantly."
"Many fellow Members are choosing to focus on threats and risks and to make this into a problem, but I think it is important for us to take a step back and focus on why we want these negotiations."
"The reason is that we can see the incredible potential that can be realised in growth, trade and development."
"That is something that we all welcome."
"I have very high hopes of this agreement, as it is so ambitious."
"We often say that all of our free trade agreements should be ambitious, but this one really is."
"This agreement has the potential to create more extensive free trade and more free borders between Europe and Canada than currently exist between Canada and the United States."
"That is worth emphasising."
"It would be an historic achievement if we succeeded in bridging the Atlantic with regard to free trade with Canada."
"I would like to mention the trade in services in particular."
"It is precisely this trade in services that several people have made out to be problematic, but this is clearly one of the most important strategic areas we have, particularly when it comes to financial services."
"I would like to hear the Commission say something about how this part of the negotiations is going, as I know there has been a certain amount of resistance with regard to this area."
"As I said, it is an important strategic area of interest for Europe."
"Finally, I would like to urge the Commission not to let this process drag on."
"We must ensure that we do not allow the negotiations to slow down."
"That is what I see as the biggest threat, in other words, that conflicts concerning various side issues take the focus away from the main issue."
"What is clearly important is to create more free trade."
"When we started these free trade negotiations, there was a very positive attitude from everyone involved."
"I therefore believe it is important for us to ensure that we finish in exactly the same spirit and that we do not allow the negotiations to drag on for far too long."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement negotiated with Canada will strengthen our links with a large and long-standing EU partner country."
"We welcome this, but we must keep track of all its consequences, not just the benefits it will bring for certain economic sectors or certain major international investors."
"In particular, the agreement must respect the social and environmental models of both parties - of the EU Member States and of Canada - and their capacity to continue to legislate in what are sensitive areas for our societies."
"These are not mere details or points to be left for another day."
"As regards public services, the Commission's chosen 'negative list' approach is dangerous."
"It is far too broad and ill-defined, and we would not like to see it set a precedent."
"Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties' right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others."
"We call on the Commission to exclude sectors such as culture, education and public health from the scope of the agreements."
"In this respect, and as other Members have said, the intellectual property part should not call into question issues relating to generic medicine production."
"As for the environment, we are concerned and call for investment."
"As regards the impact of the agreement on oil sands drilling, the agreement must not have the effect of weakening European legislation on the application of the Fuel Quality Directive, nor must it limit the possibility for Canada to regulate drilling of its oil sands in the future under its environmental remit."
"We also call on the Commission - we are asking the question, anyway - to monitor the impact on the fisheries sector in areas such as St Pierre and Miquelon."
"These are areas of Europe that could be severely affected by the complete liberalisation of that sector."
"Lastly, I echo Mr Kazak in saying that the sustainable development chapter must include social and environmental commitments and, in particular, social and environmental responsibility on the part of large multinationals."
"(DE) (The speaker directs a blue-card question to Mr Fjellner under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr Fjellner has represented all this in a very positive light and he said that we should not allow this process to drag on."
"In this context, my question is this: How can he have a positive view of the fact that in Canada, an area one eighth of the size of Austria is destroyed each year in connection with the exploitation of these tar sands and the entire livelihoods of the First Nations communities are being taken away?"
"Does he really view this in such an incredibly positive light and is it not also part of Europe's responsibility to impose appropriate conditions in this regard?"
"(SV) Madam President, I should like to respond to Mr Obermayr's question."
"I do not believe that I made any reference to tar sands in my speech, but I think it would be naive to imagine that the entire free trade agreement with Canada should simply revolve around this issue."
"That would be to lose our sense of perspective."
"It goes without saying that we should lay down clear environmental requirements in these free trade agreements."
"That is something that we do in all of our free trade agreements, but we cannot allow the entire agreement with Canada to be reduced simply to negotiations on the issue of tar sands."
"Madam President, it is the intention of the Commission to set default values for the use of tar sands - not just from Canada, but from any source, including Venezuela, for example - for the purpose of reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, as required by the Fuel Quality Directive."
"There has been extensive lobbying by Canada to try to prevent us doing this."
"I have met the Alberta Energy Minister, who has been doing the rounds, as I am sure others have too."
"Canada has also been lobbying Member States, and there has been the threat that Canada will take us to the World Trade Organisation if such an arrangement is introduced."
"We have to tell Canada to back off."
"Canada is making a great deal of money out of exploiting its tar sands but it also made commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its CO2 emissions, and it has reneged on those commitments because of the financial benefits it is getting from tar sands."
"We do not want a dispute with Canada but we have to insist that we will not shrink from facing inconvenient truths."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, against the backdrop of the ongoing negotiations with Canada, the issue of seal hunting raises its head once again."
"You even made reference to it yourself."
"I was the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety a few years back, but I remain an advocate of the ban on trading seal products."
"I therefore emphatically call on my fellow Members and also the Commission to absolutely not take their eye off this issue."
"Around two years ago, we, Parliament, approved a trading ban with an overwhelming majority, despite the immense pressure from Canada on Parliament and the other institutions to water down the legislation."
"For us, the crucial factor, above all, was the voice of millions of European citizens, who have made known their opposition to this inhumane slaughter."
"The ban has not been ineffective."
"As a result of this piece of legislation, amongst other things, the market pretty much collapsed, as the number of animals killed fell from 217 000 in 2008 to 38 000 this year, while the price of fur also fell from USD 100 in 2006 to USD 15 in 2009."
"Canada is now trying to penetrate new markets, for example in China, but there, too, voices calling for a trading ban are to be heard."
"It is thus also regrettable that Canada is still trying to fight this European legislation through the WTO."
"That is why it is so important that Parliament should again send Canada a strong signal at this point."
"We will not give up on this piece of legislation, which we worked for for so long, both within and outside the Union."
"I hope that my fellow Members will tomorrow lend their support in large numbers to an amendment that I have tabled along with a number of other Members."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations with Canada are being conducted with a country that has a strong economy and a highly developed legal system."
"It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate, if not conceal, an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court."
"Why ever should an ordinary court not decide on compensation in cases of doubt?"
"Which courts do you, as the Commission, not have any trust in whatsoever?"
"Is it the Canadian courts or those in the European Union?"
"Do you not see that, with this part of the agreement, you would be discriminating against the local undertakings?"
"As has already been mentioned by a few Members, my group is also strongly opposed to the Commission's approach of using the agreement to force the liberalisation of services by means of a 'negative list'."
"This turns on its head the approach that has been taken up to now where the contracting partners define the areas that they actively want to open."
"We want to retain public services."
"I would also ask the Commission to provide an explanation for its rejection of Canada's social and employment policy proposals, which ought to be seen in a positive light for the sustainability chapter."
"The European Parliament is also calling for the protection of workers, payment of overtime, minimum wages and rejection of social dumping."
"(PL) Madam President, potential benefits for Canada as well as the European Union are obvious and backed up by research, as well as encouraging support from the private sector."
"This should be commended and further cooperation should be encouraged."
"However, since we are very aware of environmental issues in Europe, we should be tough and demand, as a matter of principle, that Canada fulfils our rigorous standards."
"I am very pleased that the Commissioner mentioned this in her presentation."
"However, we should not only focus on sustainable development but also consider the extraction of resources which pose a risk to life and health such as asbestos, the use and extraction of which is banned in Europe."
"In addition, we should note the difference in regulations on genetically modified organisms."
"This is a particularly sensitive topic in my country, but, of course, the whole chapter on agriculture is important for both sides."
"It should also be noted that we have an obligation to reduce CO2 emissions."
"The final issue, which is no less important, is trade in articles made from seals."
"This is an area where we should be tough in demanding compliance with our bans."
"Taking all of these important matters into account, I believe that our economic relations will achieve their full potential because they are supported by both sides."
"Our Parliament should also encourage this."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I had actually intended to address several points in my speech."
"I am not going to do that now as I would like to say something else."
"I simply do not understand the Commission."
"It is supposed to be the guardian of European law, including the legislation that we have adopted, but when it comes to the trade agreement with Canada, it says that it is important that some people make a lot of money, but it is not important for European law to remain law."
"I do not understand how the Commission can say that we do not need to discuss the import ban on seal products in connection with these matters."
"We are talking about partners here and partners have mutual respect for each other's values, views and interests and do not haul the other partner before a WTO court on account of that partner's values."
"As far as I am concerned, that is not what trading partners are about."
"It is evident that if there is no mutual respect and the parties do not share each other's views, then these parties will not be able to work well together in the area of trade."
"If Canada does not stop its action against the import ban on seal products before the conclusion of this kind of agreement, then, in my opinion, we should not agree to this trade agreement."
"As I said, good partners do not haul each other before WTO courts on account of their convictions."
"Good partners work together."
"(FR) Madam President, during the negotiations on the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) agreements, in particular with Canada, the EU head of delegation promised to retrocede the French cod fishing quota to the fishermen of St Pierre and Miquelon."
"That promise was not kept, and the fishermen, like St Pierre and Miquelon's economy, are today suffering the consequences."
"The negotiations currently taking place on an EU-Canada economic and trade agreement must not sacrifice what remains of St Pierre and Miquelon's economy - again."
"That is why I tabled an amendment on this subject."
"I call on the Commission to ensure that the strategic commercial interests of St Pierre and Miquelon are protected at all times during the negotiations."
"Commissioner, can you assure us of this?"
"(IT) Madam President, I feel bound to note that a sense of fear and a need to defend European interests still prevail among some Members in this Chamber: in other words, they are on the defensive."
"As far as I am concerned, I believe that this agreement with a country with which we have a long-standing bond of friendship is important as long as it is entered into on the right basis, that of true reciprocity, and is a balanced and ambitious agreement."
"It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of extinction and particular economic extractive activities that have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for the poorest countries."
"However, we must be positive in our attitude, not defensive like we were with Japan."
"I would therefore emphasise the need to improve reciprocity in terms of the protection of intellectual property, including trademarks, geographical indications and policies for the reciprocal promotion of bilateral investment, aimed principally at innovation and technology and inspired by the positions already taken in this field by the European Parliament."
"Madam President, I believe that the numerous bilateral agreements between Canada and the Member States are the best foundation on which to build a robust free trade agreement in the commercial arena, thanks to a friendship that we have already experienced in the UN, the G8, NATO and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, a friendship based on the ideals of democracy and freedom that characterise Canada and the European Union."
"(EL) Madam President, I, too, should like to raise the issue of tar sands; this is an important issue, because it is the reason why a similar agreement which we already have with Canada, an international agreement on commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, is not being respected."
"We trust that Canada will take a different stand in the agreement being debated today."
"In any event, Canada is fighting to secure free trade and a liberalised system of investments under this agreement for oil mined from tar sands."
"The environmental impact study for this agreement, which we paid for, does not include an assessment of the impact that liberalisation will have on tar sands."
"In other words, we have a trade agreement which refers to specific measures for trading oil mined from tar sands and we have an impact study for this agreement which does not include an assessment of the impact of this specific activity."
"This makes it very difficult for Parliament to approve any agreement that ultimately transpires."
"That is because we are talking about the Boreal forests, about a quarter of the world's virgin forests, and this mining activity will put those forests and local biodiversity and first nations at risk."
"(RO) Madam President, I think that EU-Canada trade relations are at a crossroads at the moment."
"Signature of the economic agreement is still under negotiation and the priorities of both parties must be included in the final document."
"In this regard, I must highlight the differences in sanitary standards."
"Achieving consensus would avoid an adverse impact on the European agricultural sector."
"In addition, the agreement must also take into account the outcome of common agricultural policy reform."
"Clarifications on the sustainable development chapter are important."
"The EU has established its environmental standards in accordance with Member States' requirements."
"Verifying their compatibility with the standards proposed by Canada is vital to ensuring the effectiveness of the final agreement."
"I think that close attention must also be paid to the impact of the drilling issue and oil surveys on the negotiations."
"This is why the Commission needs to explain where the Fuel Quality Directive comes in this document."
"Madam President, unlike the last discussion, which was virtually unanimous in its approach, this is the exact opposite."
"Many people are very concerned about this proposed free trade agreement."
"Now free trade agreements, bilateral agreements, are the norm at this point in time and I think we have much more in common with Canada than any differences."
"They are a democracy."
"They respect human rights."
"They speak mainly English and French, European languages, and they are open to take in many people, even from my own country, who cannot find jobs in Ireland."
"There are issues, largely concerning seals and tar sands."
"Obviously, they are important but, at the end of the day, I think that some of the points made here would be refuted by the Canadians - because I am a member of the EU-Canadian delegation and these matters have been discussed and they would have a different perspective - and that is why it is important that we continue to negotiate with them on these issues."
"But the bottom line is - and nobody referred to it other than the Commissioner - that there is a EUR 20 billion benefit to both economies here if we can work out a free trade agreement."
"It is worth trying."
"(GA) Thank you, Madam President."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on conducting these negotiations so intensively."
"At the end of the day, this is about trade relations, and I believe that environmental and social issues clearly also need to be regulated in separate agreements."
"Kyoto is a good example of this, where the intention was to improve standards at an international level."
"Therefore, we should be specific in our negotiations here."
"Just as energy policy and the generation of energy is a matter for the Member States in Europe, we must also concede that it should be the Canadians and Canadian democracy that decide how energy is produced there and what environmental impact is ultimately to be taken into account."
"We ought to strive to ensure that a research programme is set up in this regard to help to enable these resources to be used in a way that is as environmentally friendly and sustainable as possible."
"Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, perhaps you could provide some impetus here to get a tar sands research programme put in place alongside this trade agreement."
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, I broadly support the reservations voiced by my colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"The question is whether they can be resolved in this agreement or, as Mr Rübig said, whether other agreements are necessary."
"At this point, however, I would like to draw attention to a major problem, which is the ratification of this agreement."
"For example, the Czech Parliament has already blocked the ratification of a transport agreement, due to the continuing dispute with Canada over the abolition of visa requirements for Czech citizens."
"This is an extremely serious issue, and there is a risk that ratification of the agreement will be blocked until the Commission is able to resolve the issue properly."
"I am asking you to take this issue seriously."
"(RO) Madam President, Canada is currently the European Union's 11th biggest trade partner, with trade relations between the European Union and Canada accounting for 1.6% of the EU's total external trade in 2010."
"In 2010, 26% of the European Union's imports from Canada and 37% of the European Union's exports to Canada related to trade in machinery and transport equipment."
"I would like to know what impact this agreement is having on the European Union's industrial policy strategy and on its strategy on raw materials and rare earths."
"With regard to deregulating services, because it was mentioned here, I would like to ask you, Commissioner, what the link will be between this agreement and the agreement on civil aviation safety and the air transport agreement between the European Union and Canada."
"The aim of both agreements is to make the European and Canadian markets competitive in this area, as they are extremely important for the air transport sector."
"I would therefore like to ask what the trade agreement's impact will be on other agreements already signed between the European Union and Canada."
"(RO) Madam President, I, too, wish to emphasise how important it is to conclude the negotiation of the European Union-Canada economic and trade agreement, thereby strengthening trade and economic links, which are already considerable, and yielding beneficial effects."
"However, during the negotiations, the European executive must strive to encourage an ambitious trade agreement, which will support fair trade and contain legally binding social and environmental protection elements."
"The agreement must not jeopardise the Union's ability to review the Fuel Quality Directive and to refuse to import oil extracted from oil sands, the exploitation of which generates more carbon dioxide than the conventional oil extraction method, thereby entailing a major harmful environmental impact."
"By refusing this kind of oil, the European Union would retain its credibility in terms of its desire to protect the environment and comply with the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol."
"(RO) Madam President, the CETA agreement marks an extremely important step towards a fruitful future for both the European Union and Canada."
"I support this project and am very pleased with the progress made so far."
"I think that we are on the right path to concluding the negotiations this year."
"However, I should point out that there are two points among the several being debated which need to be resolved to avoid creating problems at the time of ratification by some Member States, if they remain unresolved."
"These are the oil extractions from bituminous shale, which may pose a hazard to the environment and the local communities in the area, as well as the lack of reciprocity in the case of compulsory visa requirements for Bulgarian, Romanian and Czech citizens."
"(PT) Madam President, this is yet another piece of the edifice which is European Union trade policy, an edifice which is growing by the day, with consequences that affect the various Member States profoundly but differently."
"The agreements that give concrete expression to this policy are essentially based on free trade, whose goals and effects are clearly demonstrated by the associated rhetoric: that of 'offensive interests', as if we were talking about a war."
"They are agreements that lack democratic legitimacy, and increasingly so as they are almost always negotiated in the greatest secrecy, behind the public's backs, seeking to cover up their economic, social and environmental impact, avoiding informed debate and clearing things up."
"This is the case once again."
"With negotiations at a stage said to be fairly advanced and their conclusion envisaged for 2011, its impact on sectors and countries has yet to be fully debated."
"Its content is nothing new: the opening up of markets, and the liberalisation of services, including increasingly commercialised public services at the mercy of multinationals, making it harder for Member States to exercise their social function in these areas."
"The consequences are also well known: the domination of markets by a few, an impact on weaker production systems, and increasing pretexts for attacks on rights, and on working and living conditions."
"(SK) Madam President, the European Union engages in negotiations on trade and economic agreements with all influential countries, within the bounds of its competence."
"Although Canada has a strong presence in international trade, and is one of the European Union's oldest trading partners, we must proceed very sensitively and constructively as we finalise the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the European Union and Canada."
"Our divergent positions on areas such as drug policy, fisheries policy and the production of oil from tar sands need to be set out in the agreement in such a way as to represent European Union policy while respecting the views of our trading partner."
"Reciprocity stands at the core of balanced trade and economic relations."
"However, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement should by no means diminish Europe's established and accepted certification parameters."
"I would like to believe that, as we approach the finish line, the European Commission will be up to the challenge of finding appropriate solutions to the remaining problems."
"(DE) Madam President, Canada is - I would like to say this at the outset - a wonderful country."
"Wonderful people, wonderful achievements - an important partner for the EU."
"However, we must be able to ask questions of a good partner."
"Many fellow Members are wrong to simply reduce this matter to sand and seals today."
"The tar sands represent just one example of incredible environmental destruction."
"Anyone who has seen Canada knows that environmental destruction is taking place there on a scale to match Brazil."
"This environmental destruction also has an impact on the indigenous people, the First Nations."
"Their environment is being destroyed."
"Anyone who knows a bit about Canada, has visited British Columbia and knows how international corporations have used their influence here to make the indigenous peoples give up their ancestral areas and allow these areas to be bought up, cannot simply ignore this."
"We talk a great deal about clear language and about protection of minorities in countries adjacent to the EU."
"However, it is also important for us to speak out with regard to the protection of the minorities that are the aboriginal peoples of Canada."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I would firstly like to thank all the Members who participated in this debate and Vital Moreira for putting the question to Parliament."
"The Commission has taken careful note of the substance of your questions and I do hope that the answers address your possible underlying concerns."
"As you know, the negotiations are making good progress."
"The Commission wants to ensure a balanced, ambitious, high-quality agreement and it wants to be equally ambitious on sustainable development."
"Canada is a highly developed, like-minded partner with strategic links going far beyond trade and investment."
"The EU and Canada share the ambitious negotiation objectives that can be realised to our mutual benefit, creating the potential for new opportunities."
"Let me emphasise two things in particular."
"As regards the oil sands issues and your concerns in relation to this negotiation, for the Fuels Quality Directive to fall within the scope of CETA's regulatory cooperation provisions, both parties would need to agree."
"CETA's regulatory cooperation provisions would not impose any obligation to hold such discussions."
"Furthermore, the Commission does not propose entering into any commitment that would restrict the regulatory freedom of the EU, be it on environmental issues such as fuel quality, or on any other essential policy objective."
"As I mentioned in the introduction, this agreement is hugely beneficial to our two economies and not just in material terms."
"In both countries, opportunities will be created for business and the manufacturing sector, thanks to the elimination of substantially all imported tariffs and improved market access for services and investors."
"Consumers will gain through more affordable purchases and enhanced access to high-quality services."
"At the same time, increased flows of foreign direct investment would act as a catalyst to creating jobs and boosting wages."
"The CETA will also cover regulatory barriers such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, customs procedures and competition rules."
"European intellectual property rights will gain increased protection."
"Reciprocal access to both sides' procurement markets would not only mean savings for public budgets but also provide huge business opportunities."
"This is why the Commission is convinced that this will be a good and balanced agreement."
"Our very debate tonight allows for important clarifications to be made."
"In this context, the Commission takes careful note, welcomes the resolution to be adopted by Parliament on EU-Canada trade relations and is grateful for its general support."
"My colleague, Commissioner De Gucht, will, of course, continue to keep you informed of further developments in the CETA process."
"I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Union and Canada have had good, solid trade relations for many years."
"Canada is even one of the EU's oldest trading partners."
"In the mid-1970s, the EU signed the first economic and trade agreement with Canada."
"Further agreements followed in the livestock sector and with regard to wines and spirits."
"The EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) could be very advantageous for both trading partners."
"However, there are still a few things that need to be taken into consideration and discussed."
"Clearly, the aim of the agreement must be fair competition."
"This can only be achieved if not only the tariff barriers but also the non-tariff and technical barriers to trade are removed."
"The principle of reciprocity must be respected, because that is the only way to achieve a balanced outcome of the negotiations."
"That also applies to elements that are specific to the country or culture of the individual partners."
"Discussions of tricky subjects like extraction from tar sands and the associated environmental impact, ILO standards, as well as the recognition of technical standards and the traceability of food products, must also continue on equal terms in order to reach a consensus."
"Of particular interest to me are the negotiations in the dairy sector and access to the Canadian market as well as origin labelling of Canadian slaughter cattle."
"Can the Commission provide more information in these areas?"
"What outcome can we expect in this regard?"
"I am glad that Parliament is stating its views on the current EU-Canada trade negotiations and outlining its priorities in this regard."
"Canada is undoubtedly a trade partner of the EU, but it is imperative that we in Parliament relay the concerns of our fellow citizens located both on European territory and in regions forming part of the European family, namely, the protection and defence of their interests."
"By 'European family', I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part."
"In the trade negotiations currently under way, it is the archipelago of St Pierre and Miquelon, next door to Canada, that is particularly affected."
"I therefore call on the Commission, during the negotiations, to defend and protect the interests of that overseas country and territory situated in the North Atlantic Ocean."
"Canada is one of Europe's oldest trade partners."
"It is only natural, therefore, that this relationship should be formalised via a comprehensive trade agreement."
"I do wonder, however, about the content of several negotiating chapters."
"Firstly, the EU and Canada have different rules of origin systems."
"As Canada is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Commission must undertake to find a satisfactory solution regarding both industrial products and agricultural or fisheries products, so that Canada does not become a gateway through which goods from other NAFTA members enter Europe."
"The Commission will also have to negotiate a solution that can be applied to two different geographical indication systems: in Canada, 'geographical indication' is a mere adjective; in Europe, it is a bona fide trademark."
"If European geographical indications are genuinely to be protected, the Canadian authorities will have to recognise the European concept."
"Regarding the chapter on public works contracts, lastly, Canada must grant the EU the same access it granted the United States under their trade agreement; in other words, European businesses must be able to tender for contracts in the provinces, regions and certain municipalities."
"One-minute speeches (Rule 150)"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(EL) Madam President, for the last fortnight, tens, if not thousands of citizens have spontaneously gathered in the streets and squares of Athens and other cities."
"The exasperated Greeks have taken the baton from the Spaniards."
"In the midst of deep crisis, recession and unemployment, they are asking, peacefully but forcefully, for some prospect of a decent life for themselves, their families and their children."
"The size of the crowd and its complaint are unprecedented, even for a country with Greece's strong political way of life and tradition."
"This is a very serious political development with unforeseeable dimensions and implications."
"At a time when there are no watertight compartments between countries, we need to listen very carefully to the uproar of events."
"We need to listen to Mr Reynders, the Belgian Minister for Finance, when he says that we should not go beyond the measures that society can bear in Greece, because that will destroy growth and the country will not recover."
"No policy is viable if it is not backed or, at the very least, tolerated by society, especially a policy which can basically be summarised as a dilemma between exhausting austerity or bankruptcy."
"This policy urgently needs serious change and correction, not only in order to make it fairer, but also if it is to be more effective, for the benefit of everyone."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Capital of Culture is one of the European Union's most recognisable cultural initiatives."
"According to studies carried out by the Commission, it is a reason for national pride and shared responsibility among the inhabitants of the nominated cities."
"In 2016, the nations hosting the contest will be Poland and Spain."
"Two cities will be chosen from both of these countries to be the European Capital of Culture 2016."
"My home city of Gdańsk is in a small group leading the Polish contest, which will be decided this month."
"I am a keen supporter of this candidacy whose motto is 'Cultural freedom - culture of freedom'."
"Gdańsk is, historically, a Hanseatic port and the birthplace of the Solidarity movement, which is synonymous with freedom."
"Now we would like to create a modern programme based on these roots."
"We stand for freedom of access to our cultural heritage and daily intergenerational and neighbourly solidarity."
"I believe that my city has much to offer to European society, and victory in this prestigious contest would contribute to an even greater level of prosperity."
"(RO) Madam President, the drought which we are currently facing throughout the whole of Europe, along with the forecast for the period ahead, is fuelling concerns not only about a new hike in food prices, but also about food safety."
"In these circumstances, I believe that the European Commission must pay EU subsidies in advance to support the farmers who need to use existing irrigation systems, thereby avoiding the total loss of this year's harvests."
"Solutions must also be taken into account, along with this measure, for supporting the implementation of irrigation systems where their use is necessary."
"Thirty per cent of Romania's area is irrigated land, while the lack of water and prevalence of drought are creating problems similar to those of the other Member States, but without being able to provide support to farmers with this life-saving measure, in the event of this situation."
"Madam President, I wanted to speak about the role that sport can play in increasing economic prosperity in our regions."
"In Wales, I see rugby and other major sporting events boosting the economy of Cardiff."
"Another boost will come following the wonderful achievement of Swansea City Football Club - and I say this for the benefit of my colleague Richard Howitt - who have just deservedly reached the Premier Football League after a fantastic season."
"I pay tribute to the manager, players, directors, staff and fans who have made promotion possible."
"They will be a credit to the Premier League, to Wales, and will give a much needed boost to the local economy, as fans, tourists and, hopefully, businesses come to the region."
"Finally, I hope the EU recognises the importance of sport, both economically and socially, and will provide funds to boost sport at all levels, particularly as, since the Lisbon Treaty, the EU now has competence in the field of sport for the first time."
"(EL) Madam President, I have consistently supported the programme to restructure my country."
"I am therefore entitled to point out the weaknesses."
"Firstly, the programme relies too heavily on taxation, instead of public spending cuts."
"It is therefore throttling the Greek private sector, which is the only sector that can repay the massive debts."
"Secondly, there is no rational plan at present to make use of Greek government property."
"Thirdly, the programme is progressing very slowly and this, in conjunction with the specific messages to the Greek public coming out of Europe, is undermining political support for the reforms."
"This is happening every single day."
"We therefore need a bolder programme which calls for faster adjustment and which will provide serious development aid in the form of a European Marshall Plan."
"Such a programme would have a greater chance of success and we all need that success."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to raise for discussion the recent events in the world of football and, in particular, the election of Sepp Blatter as head of FIFA."
"I think that his re-election is deplorable at a time when serious corruption charges have been levelled at FIFA, especially concerning the holding of the World Cup in 2022 in Qatar."
"I think that Member State governments should call for FIFA to be reformed and for its activities to be regulated."
"This might create greater transparency and help avoid such regrettable events, thereby restoring confidence in FIFA."
"Football has become increasingly more like a business."
"Lack of transparency and accusations of corruption are also affecting Romanian football."
"Recently, Politehnica Timişoara, who finished runners-up in the Romanian league championship and were due to play in the Champions League, have been relegated to Romania's third division based on a completely random decision."
"This unjust decision will affect hundreds of thousands of the Timişoara team's fans."
"I also appeal from this Chamber to the football authorities in Romania to reverse this decision and allow Politehnica Timişoara to remain in top-flight Romanian and European football."
"Madam President, 2 June 2011 marked the start of the historic Tallinn-Monte Carlo Electric Car Marathon, and today the cars will be reaching Copenhagen."
"Gesine Meissner and I, as Liberal Members of the European Parliament, are sponsoring an electric car in the race in order to promote sustainable transportation."
"With increasing consumption rates, the depletion of fossil fuels is becoming inevitable and we should therefore increase investment in further research and in the development of sustainable transportation."
"Furthermore, increasing mobility is taking its toll in terms of people's carbon footprint, and that could accelerate global climate change."
"The European Union and its Member States have the opportunity of becoming pioneers in green transportation by introducing incentives to the users of sustainable means of transport, and encouraging the transition to a carbon-free Union."
"(ES) Madam President, the origin of the infection that caused twenty-one deaths in Germany last week is still unknown."
"This further highlights the undue haste with which the German authorities acted."
"The accusations are particularly serious, given that the German market is a key consumer of agricultural products, which is indeed the reason why it has received significant investments for the promotion of those products."
"The European authorities therefore need to take action on two fronts."
"In the short term, implementation of a mechanism to compensate the European farmers most affected must be guaranteed, while in the medium term, it will be necessary to reform the early warning system for unsafe food to prevent any more unfounded alarms in the future."
"These measures will have to take into account the diversity of the European agricultural industry."
"Hence, the Commission's proposal to fund a recall mechanism using the vegetable producers organisations' budget is unacceptable."
"In many regions in Europe, such as Catalonia for example, such organisations do not exist, and therefore the system cannot be used to compensate farmers."
"(PT) Madam President, indifferent to the economic and social devastation caused by the structural changes approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in countries like Greece, the leaders of the European Union are now stepping up their offensive and launching themselves on Portugal with the same approach and unbridled colonial arrogance."
"In exchange for a EUR 78 billion loan, a country where the minimum wage is not even EUR 500 will face cuts in wages and pensions, and the closure of public services, as well as being forced to give up national companies and resources."
"It also faces an increase in the prices of essential goods and services, and EUR 30 billion in interest, which equates to around 40% of the total loan."
"More than two-thirds of this interest will go to the European Union itself."
"This is the meaning of the much-vaunted European solidarity."
"Persisting in this course of action will inevitably lead to an intensification of the social struggle which has been raging throughout Europe, including Portugal."
"We are, and will continue to be, here to support and encourage it, certain that only through such struggle can change be instigated, and an alternative that is needed increasingly urgently put in place in Europe."
"(PT) Madam President, after all the sound bites during the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, the European Commission continues to demonstrate complete indifference when faced with worsening poverty, particularly child poverty, unemployment and massive increases in the numbers of poor workers due to precarious and poorly paid work."
"However, this is now not only limited to neoliberal tendencies, but has dire consequences for countries with weak economies, where it is imperative to strengthen public policies to support public services, create employment with rights, and eradicate poverty."
"Memoranda like the one the troika of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Commission drew up with Portuguese officials demanded anti-social policies, including amendments to redundancy and privatisation laws, and attacks on public and universal social security which can only lead to social regression, condemning workers and the public to unemployment, poverty, underdevelopment and extreme dependency."
"It will transform Portugal into a mere protectorate of the great powers of the EU."
"All of this in exchange for a loan that the Portuguese have to repay, at high interest rates, to increase the profits of international financial capitalism, even though we know full well that such measures resolve nothing, as the case of Greece clearly demonstrates."
"That is why I am protesting against such measures here, and this protest will continue both in Portugal and in the EU."
"(ES) Madam President, first of all, may I express my condolences for all the deaths caused by E. coli, but also my indignation at the extremely unfit way in which the German Administration has treated this issue, causing irreparable damage to all Spanish agricultural products."
"I hope that, in tomorrow's extraordinary meeting of European Union agriculture ministers, this damage caused to Spanish farmers will first of all be redressed with no exclusions, and secondly, that lessons will be learnt: namely, what should not be done in a situation that has indeed resulted in fatalities, but also concerning damage to the products of many countries including my own, Spain."
"Lessons have to be learnt from this crisis."
"Obviously, I hope that the outcome of tomorrow's extraordinary meeting will be redress with no exclusions and a return to normality, so that products that are in perfect condition can circulate throughout the European Union and the world at large."
"(SK) Madam President, Friday's announcement by European Union representatives that the International Monetary Fund would release a further tranche of EUR 12 billion in credit to Greece was given an encouraging reception by the markets."
"Today, however, the Spanish newspaper El País reports that the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha has run out of money."
"Not only does the regional government find itself unable to pay the wages of 76 000 employees, but it still owes roughly EUR 2 billion to its various suppliers."
"We are faced with more bad news, then, this time from Spain, a country that has long struggled to maintain investor confidence."
"Yet the policy of assisting governments by having the European Central Bank buy up their debts cannot go on for much longer, as it is reaching its limits."
"The European Central Bank already has EUR 360 billion in financial instruments on its books that are not freely tradable and holds a further EUR 480 billion in poorly secured securities."
"It is the pacemaker, then, for holders of bad financial assets."
"If this continues, ladies and gentlemen, the euro area will soon have to rescue the European Central Bank, or simply fall apart."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a few comments with regard to the European integration of Serbia, if I may."
"For far too long, the former Yugoslavian states have, in my opinion, received unequal treatment."
"For example, Slovenia was able to join the EU without a problem in 2004, even though criticisms are still made regarding the residual Communist power structures in politics, the media and industry."
"Moreover, Bulgaria and Romania would not be in the Union if we had applied the same stringent criteria to them that we are now applying to Croatia."
"Double standards are also applied with regard to war crimes and restitution."
"Brussels could not care less about Turkey's Armenian genocide."
"In contrast, Croatia and Serbia must first haul their war criminals before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague before the Copenhagen criteria can even come into play."
"While the unlawful regulations of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) and Beneš do not constitute grounds for blocking EU accession, the Serbian restitution policy certainly has to comply with EU stipulations."
"Serbia, which is characterised by a Christian tradition, has proven its good intentions again and again."
"One barrier has been broken down with the extradition of Mladič, but Kosovo must not become the next one."
"As soon as the outstanding reforms are complete, there should, in my view, be nothing more to stand in the way of Serbia's accession to the EU."
"(ES) Madam President, I wish to join my fellow Members in expressing my condolences for the twenty-one victims of E. coli, but also my indignation beyond mere concern at the episodes of uncoordinated response that have caused significant financial damage to the producers and workers of sectors that are crucial to the agriculture of European Union Member States, particularly Spanish cucumber producers."
"These episodes have also damaged the very notion of Europe, cohesion within Europe and cohesion among Europeans, to the extent that, once again, prejudice or insufficiently verified rumours have seriously impaired the cohesion needed to decide on a satisfactory, timely and appropriate response."
"I therefore hope that the lessons that inescapably emerge will, in fact, be learnt."
"I hope that the Council of Agriculture Ministers will be able not just to provide compensation for the injured parties, but also to establish a response protocol that takes on board the lessons extracted from this unfortunate experience."
"Madam President, returning to sport, FIFA has been mentioned and I would like to mention it as well, in particular, the lack of proper governance and the lack of transparency at the higher levels of the organisation."
"It is extraordinary that a 75-year-old man, Sepp Blatter, is going to be returned to power as President of one of the world's leading sports organisations, having been in power now since 1998, especially when you consider that the vast majority of the players - probably 99% of them - are under 30 years of age."
"There must be not just one generation gap, but several generation gaps between him and the players."
"Secondly, it was not surprising last year that England got so little support for the awarding of the World Cup venue, despite its great infrastructure."
"Qatar was awarded it and subsequently we saw people suspended for trying to sell their votes."
"I wonder whether this is the tip of the iceberg."
"There is also the matter of FIFA's failure to introduce goal line technology when other sports have done so."
"It is quite clear that a real reform is needed in the interests of the sport itself and FIFA."
"(LV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that drug taking is prohibited in sport."
"Drug taking is prohibited because it confers unfair advantages on some sportspeople over others."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union, we have a certain type of drug that is not intended for sportspeople but for farmers - in the form of uneven levels of support for them."
"For example, Latvian farmers receive three times less support than German farmers, and as much as six times less than Greek farmers."
"This unfair support makes for unfair competition."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I call upon you, when you are considering and planning the next European financial perspective and period, that you eliminate these drugs, that you cut out this unfair support for farmers, so that all European farmers can become equally competitive. Thank you for your attention."
"(EL) Madam President, hundreds of thousands of Greek citizens of all ages and from all classes have been protesting peacefully - I repeat peacefully - over the past two weeks in town squares throughout the country."
"I would like to make two points: firstly, we need to listen to them and to heed their concerns."
"We need to do this not only at national level, but also at European level."
"Our fellow citizens in towns throughout Greece are shouting to be heard in Brussels, in Strasbourg, everywhere."
"Secondly, over and above any debate about the mistakes and misguided action of the Greek Government, we need to bear this in mind: in their evaluation of the policies being proposed and applied by Europe to deal with the crisis, our fellow citizens are saying to us: 'We have our limits."
"Do not push us beyond our limits'."
"Clear and specific answers need to be given to these messages."
"Only then will Europe's help in dealing with the crisis create a vision and hope among our fellow citizens."
"(HU) Madam President, multiculturalism assumes that nations living side by side mutually know each other's past, culture, and sometimes language, as well."
"However, the fuss stirred up in Romania a few days ago can only be explained by the lack of this reciprocity."
"Two Romanian counties opened a representative office in Brussels, but according to a journalist working in the capital, the problem with this is that the majority of the population of the counties concerned does not belong to the same ethnic group as the majority of the Romanian population."
"Is this a problem in Europe today?"
"The way of thinking that would forbid a neighbour to commemorate the day when he had lost his fortune, land, or perhaps even his relatives, is just as morbid."
"We had an example of that in the past days as well, when we commemorated the Trianon Peace Treaty ending World War I on 4 June."
"There is a remedy for the way of thinking that excludes and shuts up people, denies the past, and wants to impede the development and existence of a region: a strong Europe that is open and inclusive, that appreciates cultural values, and respects the rights of minorities."
"(BG) Madam President, the economic crisis and difficulties which all Member States are experiencing, although to varying degrees, has given impetus to nationalist and populist groups which are not only looking for greater public support, but are also constantly testing European citizens' limits of tolerance by acting openly against the expansion of integration in Europe."
"One recent example of this from Bulgaria are the events which took place on 20 May, when representatives of the nationalist party Attack became involved in clashes with Muslim worshippers outside the only mosque in Sofia."
"These clashes were accompanied by the use of force and arson, and ended up with several people sustaining injuries, including police officers."
"Since video recordings are available of the clashes, the test for the investigative agencies and justice system in Bulgaria will be to what extent the instigators and participants in this incident will be justly punished."
"I would like to state very clearly in this Chamber that the dissemination of ethnic and religion intolerance is an action which blatantly contradicts European values and basic human rights, as well as the traditions of Bulgarian society."
"We must all firmly oppose any attempt of this happening in Europe and clearly distance ourselves from the political forces in Europe which are behind such actions."
"(RO) Madam President, as part of publishing the global Press Freedom Index for 2010, the organisation Reporters Without Borders drew attention to the decline in the freedom of expression in the European Union."
"Romania is in 52nd position in the index, marking a drop of 10 places compared with 2007."
"This is a worrying situation and it raises question marks concerning the actual respect for the right of expression and information guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European Union."
"In Romania, the press has been included by the country's president among the threats to national security."
"In addition, policy makers are constantly making disparaging remarks about the media."
"Such moves away from democratic principles tarnish the European Union's image as a whole."
"Due to internal shortcomings, we are at risk of losing our credibility as upholders of respect for human rights outside the EU."
"This is why I urge genuine protection at EU level for the freedom of expression and press pluralism."
"(RO) Madam President, this is the second occasion that I am presenting before the European Parliament the disastrous situation in Romania's health insurance system."
"Unfortunately, at the moment, the negotiations between the GPs' professional associations, the Ministry of Health and the National Health Insurance Office have reached deadlock."
"As a result, the health system is being blocked and legal rights are being refused to patients who, although they are still paying their health insurance contributions, can no longer enjoy the relevant facilities."
"This situation has resulted from the persistent refusal on the part of the National Health Insurance Office to conduct realistic negotiations with GPs with the aim of drafting an operating framework contract, beneficial to all the stakeholders."
"If this situation carries on much longer, the health service in Romania, which has been weakened so much, is at risk of disintegrating."
"I would like the relevant European bodies to take note of this situation, monitor it and take action to resolve it as soon as possible."
"(RO) Madam President, we talk every day in the European Parliament, from morning till night, about European integration, solidarity, a common culture and about everything which unites us and should continue to motivate us to build a common future for all 27 European Union Member States."
"While we are debating European projects, a vice-president of the same European Parliament similarly discusses matters every day, from morning till night."
"However, this is about segregation based on ethnic criteria, reducing the influence and undermining the authority of a state within its borders in favour of another neighbouring state, about breaking up territories belonging to one European Union Member State and annexing them to another Member State of the same European Union."
"Not only on a personal note, but also on behalf of the Romanian Social Democrat MEPs, I call for László Tőkés to be dismissed from his position as Vice-President."
"Madam President, I wish to express my deep concern regarding the medics who have been arrested in Bahrain."
"Many of these medics have been accused of trying to overthrow the monarchy and face trial with military prosecutors and possible death sentences."
"Yet these doctors and nurses had simply treated injured protestors who were brought to their hospitals."
"Amnesty International and Médecins sans Frontières have also expressed extreme concern over the safety of those involved and indeed the motivation behind their arrests."
"I fully support the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the International Council of Nurses, and indeed a number of Irish doctors, who are adding their voices in condemnation of these awful events."
"In the last few days, I have received information from a number of sources which points to torture and inhumane treatment: some medics have been severely beaten and have been denied access to their families and legal advisers."
"This kind of action is totally unacceptable."
"I am calling publicly on our High Representative, Catherine Ashton."
"I have already written to her to ask her to make every effort to intervene on behalf of those medics who simply did what medical personnel do - try to save lives."
"Madam President, the new austerity package for Greece, which includes EUR 28 billion of cuts and taxes and the privatisation of an incredible EUR 50 billion worth of state assets, confirms again the role of the EU and the IMF as enforcers for anti-worker austerity policies."
"Young people have been on the receiving end of their vicious attacks."
"They are now fighting back with hundreds of thousands occupying squares across Europe, bravely facing down brutal repression."
"They have correctly raised the call for true democracy."
"In my opinion, that can only be truly achieved by breaking the dictatorship of the markets and building a democratic socialist society where people's needs come before profits."
"15 June promises to be an important day of struggle across Europe."
"A general strike will take place in Greece and a major demonstration is planned in Barcelona."
"Big protests should be organised right across Europe against austerity on that day."
"To defeat the onslaught against workers and young people in Europe, the power of the organised working class must be mobilised."
"A one-day general strike across Europe would send a very powerful message of opposition to the European establishment."
"(EL) Madam President, a week ago, Presidents Buzek, Barroso and Van Rompuy met religious representatives to discuss democratic rights and civil liberties."
"I wish to congratulate President Barroso on taking the initiative in 2005 to inaugurate this dialogue with religious leaders;"
"I also wish to congratulate the Presidents of Parliament and of the Council for maintaining this dialogue on an annual basis."
"At the same time, however, I wish to join forces with the religious representatives who called for the European Union to exert its influence in order to put a stop to the persecution of Christians in countries such as Egypt and Iraq and within Europe, in European Cyprus, where the occupying forces are denying Christians entry to their occupied churches and preventing priests and bishops from celebrating Holy Mass."
"Show them, Madam President, that Christian refugees in Cyprus are entitled to celebrate mass in their churches."
"(EL) Madam President, immediately after the meeting in Luxembourg on 6 May, which was reported in an article in Der Spiegel, Greece was on the receiving end of a new wave of recommendations that it should leave the euro area and go back to the drachma."
"Of course, the official position of the European Union was expressed by Commissioner Olli Rehn, who denied the rumours and the recommendations."
"Over and above the views of economists to the contrary and the numerous views of fellow Members in this Chamber, it must be made clear that Greece cannot leave the euro for legal reasons."
"Firstly, because the Treaties make no provision for voluntary or involuntary exit from the common currency."
"Secondly, if we returned to the drachma without abolishing the euro area and the euro, there would be no legal facility for automatically converting deposits in euros in Greek banks, both inside and outside Greece, to drachmas without the depositor's consent."
"When Greece joined the euro area, it was possible to convert deposits in drachmas because the drachma was abolished as a currency and has not existed since."
"Now, however, the euro continues to exist and has not been abolished."
"Therefore, any rumours and any recommendations are legally incorrect."
"(DE) Madam President, whistleblowers are people who no longer wish to keep quiet about illegal acts or deplorable states of affairs, but want to expose them, mostly in the public interest."
"Whistleblowers are also mostly providing added value."
"For example, in 2005, they returned a total of around USD 10 billion to the US Treasury through repayments."
"Clear laws relating to the process of whistleblowing are essential in the fight against corruption."
"In the European Union, Articles 22a and 22b of the Staff Regulations form the legal basis for whistleblowing, but unfortunately in a very fragmented way, leaving many gaps."
"Fundamental elements are missing."
"For example, we need a clear definition of whistleblowing, we need whistleblowers to have a right to be heard, we need independent points of contact that can provide information on rights, obligations and options, and not least we also need precise handling deadlines for the competent EU institutions."
"The positive aspect here is that the EU Staff Regulations are about to be reformed."
"The Commission is to send Parliament a first draft of this in the autumn."
"I think this presents a unique opportunity to make improvements here."
"I would ask my fellow Members to support this and to work to bring about a reform."
"(RO) Madam President, football is truly a religion, but it is a religion in which the devil is more than involved."
"Why is this?"
"This is because a great deal of money is at stake, which is a charge on boredom and loneliness for billions of the planet's inhabitants."
"During the current summer days, Romania is being engulfed in the drama involving a very popular football team, Politehnica Timişoara."
"This team won the right, through its own, honest efforts, to take part in a European cup competition."
"However, now we see that its victory on the pitch has turned into a loss through a random decision."
"In specific terms, the mafia in charge of Romanian football has shaken hands with the mafia in charge of international football and decided to impose a drastic double penalty: to remove the team in question from the European cup competition and relegate it to a lower, amateur division."
"No matter what financial and legal excuses are being given, this is a draconian penalty and hits hard not only a fine team but also a beautiful city with more than 300 000 inhabitants who do not have too many other sources of joy."
"As a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, I am sounding an alarm bell so as to put an end to this awful injustice which may have significant social consequences."
"The debate is closed."
"Credit rating agencies (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on credit rating agencies: future perspectives."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies certainly did not cause the global financial crisis, but, in my opinion, they were responsible to a significant extent for its severity."
"When the so-called structured financial products were developed in America on the basis of the subprime mortgages, the credit rating agencies supported this process by rating dozens, if not hundreds, of products each day in an almost conveyor-belt fashion."
"In so doing, they also accepted conflicts of interests, in that they supported the issuers with advice and help in designing these products."
"They continued to claim that they were only expressing an opinion, although they knew very well that their ratings were, in fact, being used as a seal of approval."
"My report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the Commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn."
"I put forward five proposals."
"The first is that the reliance on ratings must be reduced."
"In practice, we have found that the regulatory environment has led to the use of ratings being absolutely essential, by banks, insurance companies, pension funds etc. which invest their money."
"Basel II made this very clear and, in fact, the credit rating agencies have become regulatory certification bodies."
"We need to make it possible once again for market operators, particularly institutional investors, which possess their own expertise to actually take responsibility themselves and not outsource the responsibility for investment decisions."
"It needs to be made clear that investors should only invest if they actually understand the product and cannot use the excuse that they can, to a certain extent, automatically make a triple A product the goal of their investment strategy."
"Secondly, we must ensure that the information on which credit rating agencies base their decisions is made publicly available, that it is understood, and that the models used are also known."
"That will lead to transparency and will also make it easier for institutional investors seeking to invest to make their own decisions."
"It will also help to enable unsolicited ratings to be given."
"In this connection, we should also consider whether the proposal that the United States is considering is a sensible one, namely, that where only one credit rating agency is chosen by issuers, a second, independent body could be encouraged to give a rating and this second body could be allowed to work on the basis of the information that is publicly available."
"Thirdly, we need more competition."
"We have a de facto oligopoly."
"The three credit rating agencies that exist and operate worldwide control 95% of the global business."
"They have a so-called monopoly income of 40% return on turnover, and therefore I am proposing that we set up a European credit rating agency."
"It should be based on a foundation model and the start-up financing should be provided by the finance sector by means of interest-bearing loans."
"After five years, we will know whether it is working and then this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the funds that it has received."
"However, I am sure that there are also other options."
"It would also make sense to perhaps allow national and regional credit rating agencies to operate in the form of a European network."
"Fourthly, we still have an outstanding matter with regard to the payment model."
"Currently, we have an issuer-pays model."
"That is the model that essentially works throughout the world."
"Thus, the issuer pays, but clearly there is a conflict of interests here that we could reduce if there was no more advising of issuers and if the staff of the supervisory bodies was genuinely independent."
"Other possible models include a subscriber-pays model."
"Here, there is obviously the risk of conflicts of interest as well as of this being an invitation to freeloaders."
"Therefore, this needs consideration."
"The third option would be a performance-based payment, in other words, an up-front payment and then the final payment only once it is clear how good the rating is."
"The last, but important, point is that we must introduce liability."
"Credit rating agencies must accept responsibility for what they actually do, and therefore I believe that we should make them liable, obviously not for the rating as such, but for failures and negligence in their work."
"(RO) Mr President, the credit rating industry has numerous shortcomings, the most important of which are the lack of competition and transparency, as well as the oligopolistic structures."
"Competition would be enhanced by creating a regulatory environment which will promote market entry."
"This would carry out an in-depth analysis of the current obstacles."
"I should emphasis how important it is to monitor the progress of the Basel III system and the process relating to Chapter 4 of the Capital Requirements Directive."
"There is a need to increase accountability and the powers for monitoring the internal models and imposing preventive measures."
"All rating agencies must abide by the highest standards relating to the publication of information, transparency and management of conflicts of interest."
"At the moment, Romania's rating has a stable outlook."
"This could improve if the pace of structural reforms and the stability of the financial sector are maintained."
"(EL) Mr President, the credit rating agencies lost their credibility a long time ago."
"Our rapporteur is absolutely right on that point."
"They upgrade and downgrade almost everything: countries, banks, municipalities, even public corporations, absolutely everything, but their ratings are based, for the most part, on undisclosed, unpublished and, hence, non-transparent information."
"The issue of the lack of transparency and, hence, of the credibility of the data used by credit rating agencies raises an important question: is it fair, is it logical, is it morally correct for ratings that affect the economy and upset the lives of millions of our fellow citizens overnight to be non-transparent and possibly unreliable?"
"Obviously it is not."
"(SK) Mr President, in the wake of the financial meltdown, the credit rating agencies, which assess financial product safety, were criticised for their unprofessional and self-serving ratings of financial products."
"Doubts arose over the fairness and professionalism of their evaluations after the transparency of their operating mechanisms was found to be wanting, and it is therefore time we looked for ways to improve the system for the constant assessment and rating of financial products."
"In this light, I consider the report submitted by the rapporteur to be very important, and I think that the processes he has outlined will enable us to modify the apparatus used to assess financial products so that the conclusions that are offered, either by rating agencies or by other mechanisms, will result in more objective ratings of financial products."
"(PT) Mr President, experience has clearly shown that credit rating agencies are not credible and that their activities continue to be detrimental to certain countries, whether to their economies or to their sovereign debt."
"Today, this is particularly affecting countries that have relatively weak economies."
"That is why the intervention of credit rating agencies, which continue to be extremely harmful despite having lost all of their credibility, must be properly controlled."
"This control should not be limited to transparency rules, but should go further and exert complete control over the international financial system, while also putting an end to tax havens, properly regulating the financial sector with taxes on the movement of speculative capital, and preventing financial capital from continuing to ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur on all five points of his proposals on so-called rating agencies and the exaggerated impact which they have on the global economy and on the European economy."
"These firms cannot, at the same time, engage in commercial activities which are similar or relate to their supervisory or rating role."
"We are calling for controls on reports by these agencies, for certain basic principles to be adopted, and for liability for compensation to be introduced for losses caused to states which were poorly evaluated or misleadingly evaluated."
"I also propose that basic accounting principles be introduced and applied in all the Member States of the European Union, so as to highlight the value, the official valuation of the property of these states, so that we have assets and liabilities and these states cannot be left prey to the whims of rating agencies and the parties they represent."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, Commissioner Barnier is currently in the United States meeting with his counterparts and he has asked me to convey to you the following statement in reply to Wolf Klinz's own-initiative report on rating agencies, which was adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March."
"The Commissioner agrees that shortcomings in the working methods of credit rating agencies are widely recognised today as having contributed to the financial crisis."
"In order to address these concerns, and in accordance with G20 commitments, the EU reacted very quickly by adopting - already in 2009 - a regulation on credit rating agencies."
"This introduces strict requirements with which agencies must comply in order to eliminate potential conflicts of interest and to improve the quality of rating and methodologies as well as the transparency of the ratings."
"As a second step, following the establishment of the three new European financial supervisory agencies, the regulation of credit rating agencies will be strengthened by the introduction of centralised supervision by the European Supervisory Markets Authority."
"The amending regulation became effective on 1 June 2011."
"We will pay very close attention to the correct application of this legislation."
"Nowadays, the European regulatory framework is a model for other jurisdictions."
"However, the developments in the European markets following the sovereign debt crisis in spring 2010 make it clear that further review and strengthening is required."
"For this reason, the Commission undertook in June 2010 to analyse the topics in depth."
"A public consultation was carried out, the Commission services have evaluated the responses and are working on an impact assessment with a view to issuing legislative proposals in the course of this year."
"In this context, the Commission will examine measures to reduce excessive dependence on external ratings, improve transparency, promote competition, introduce the principle of liability and reduce the risk of potential conflicts of interest due to the issuer-pays payment model."
"We know that these are very complex issues and we want to be sure that we address them correctly."
"In this context, we have looked with great interest at Mr Klinz's own-initiative report which covers the topics we are currently reviewing and makes a very big contribution to our legislative initiative."
"Last but not least, at a global level, in October 2010, the Financial Stability Board issued a number of principles aimed at reducing the dependency of financial institutions on credit ratings."
"In accordance with these principles we intend to introduce measures against excessive dependence on ratings in our forthcoming legislative proposal for the banking sector, the so-called CRD4."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 7 June at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Prior to the Lehman Brothers investment bank going bankrupt, it was given the highest rating by the main credit rating agencies."
"They also thought that Iceland's three biggest commercial banks were sound a few days before they collapsed."
"In addition, the downgrading of Greece's rating has not taken into account the launch of its economic recovery programme."
"The economic and financial crisis has highlighted credit rating agencies' oligopolistic structure, as well as their lack of competition, transparency and accountability."
"In a world dominated by three such institutions, greater diversity is needed, along with a new way of working."
"I therefore support the notion of creating a public European credit rating agency as an alternative to the private institutions of this kind. It would become compulsory to obtain a rating from the European agency, which would supplement the ratings offered by the traditional agencies, thereby boosting competition for the fairest rating."
"Guaranteeing independent impact assessments (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Niebler, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on guaranteeing independent impact assessments."
"Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, let me perhaps introduce the topic with a few examples."
"Greece and other states are heavily in debt, although billions from the structural funds have been poured into these countries for many years."
"How can we improve the use of these resources and how can the utilisation of these resources be better controlled?"
"My second example relates to Eurobonds."
"What effect do they have on the European budget?"
"Thirdly, if we were to introduce a financial transaction tax in Europe, what would the consequences be?"
"For all these questions, Parliament demands in its reports that a regulatory impact assessment be carried out."
"After all, we need facts in order to be able to take politically sound decisions."
"That is what my report on improving the guarantee of independent impact assessments is all about."
"This is not a new issue."
"It has occupied us, together with other issues concerning the improvement of legislation, for over ten years."
"However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement."
"My report puts forward proposals for how, with regard to the European Commission and the impact assessments that it carries out, as well as with regard to Parliament's impact assessment studies, we can succeed in bringing about this improvement."
"In terms of its content, the report is divided into four sections."
"Firstly, there are general requirements for impact assessments at European level."
"The second section contains proposals directed at the European Commission and it lists potential areas where improvements can be made."
"In the third section, I discuss how we in the European Parliament can better optimise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument."
"In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create an autonomous impact assessment structure."
"With regard to the general requirements for impact assessments at European level, it is important to note that we need to move away from pure cost analysis towards an examination of the economic, social and health-related impact of legislation at European level."
"Secondly, I think it is important that we carry out an SME test in connection with all regulatory impact assessments and also examine the effect on industrial competitiveness in Europe."
"Thirdly, in this report, we propose the early publication by the Commission of road maps of proposed legislation in order to give Parliament and the stakeholders the opportunity to express their opinions during the consultation period."
"With regard to the European Commission, we call, in particular, for the members of the Impact Assessment Board that was set up a while ago in the Commission to be independent and for the parliamentary committees to be involved in the work at an early stage."
"With regard to Parliament, we believe it is important for us actually to utilise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument."
"Up to now, a few committees have been using it, but I think we need to make much more extensive use of this instrument in our discussions in Parliament."
"If we succeed in developing Parliament's own resources and establishing an autonomous structure under the leadership of Members of this House in order to develop a method that allows us to carry out professional regulatory impact assessments within the European Parliament, then I believe we will have achieved a great deal with this report."
"I hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, impact assessments enable us to perform our role as legislator."
"Their bad reputation is partly explained by the risk of manipulation."
"We may request them in the light of public opinion."
"They may be serious and scientifically correct."
"Take, for example, the impact assessment that the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality commissioned for the purposes of the directive on maternity leave."
"It was so unusable that we regretted having spent taxpayers' money."
"Thank you, Mrs Niebler, for the work you have put into preparing the resolution."
"Your efforts help us to legislate better for the benefit of citizens in the Member States."
"(CS) Mr President, I am tabling a report on the external dimension of the European Union and on corporate social responsibility."
"I took an extremely critical approach when drafting this report because it is very frequently the case that hypocritical positions are adopted during negotiations with countries which are not EU Member States."
"If we want to demand that they respect the same principles that we respect within the European Union, then it is imperative that we do the same."
"We cannot demand compliance with the International Labour Organisation's fundamental conventions and then allow these conventions to be violated by certain Member States."
"I also state in the report that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I warmly thank our rapporteur, Mr Falbr, for his work, and despite his initial concerns, the report remains very strong."
"Speaking on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, I would emphasise once again that the International Labour Organisation's role should be strengthened."
"Voluntary corporate social responsibility is a good thing but the primary role in promoting and protecting human rights belongs to states and international organisations."
"We do not think that legally binding standards should be avoided in the field of corporate responsibility: in Europe, we should create additional standards for company reporting."
"On the other hand, the violation of fundamental principles and rights at work cannot be used as a legitimate comparative advantage."
"Europe should promote its social model and improve, rather than reduce, social standards both internally and externally."
"(DE) Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again, but I believe that some confusion has arisen, because my fellow Members are not currently discussing my report, but the report on social responsibility, which will be debated later."
"Perhaps we could first finish the debate on the subject of the impact assessment - I believe Mr Baldassarre had asked to speak on the subject of my report - and then we can move on to the next report."
"Thank you, Mrs Niebler."
"The problem gradually became clear to me, too."
"We have a minor Internet problem."
"I do not have the correct list of speakers, either."
"The display board is also still showing the Klinz report."
"That is presumably why some Members were a little irritated."
"Thus, we are now debating the report by Mrs Niebler on guaranteeing independent impact assessments."
"Mr President, yes I agree, it is very important that we have independent economic impact assessments of EU regulations."
"These place a very significant cost on business, on the economy and, of course, on the pockets of ordinary citizens."
"Now I recently published the latest addition of my periodic study, 'How Much Does the European Union Cost Britain?', which is available on my website."
"Just one element of these costs is, of course, EU over-regulation."
"Now, using the government's own figures - the UK Government's own figures - the Open Europe think-tank calculates the cost of just the top 99 directives currently in force at over GBP 20 billion per annum."
"In 2006, Commissioner Günter Verheugen put the cost of EU regulation at an average of 3.5% of GDP; 3.5% of the UK's GDP is almost GBP 49 billion per annum."
"This is a staggering burden on business and on consumers."
"Independent impact assessment should, of course, be carried out at the national level but, outside of the European Union, Britain would be free to decide its own level of regulation and it would certainly not be GBP 49 billion per annum."
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"First of all, I think that this is an important proposal."
"This impact assessment is important to us for two reasons."
"One is to ensure that we are passing regulation that is necessary and effective, but also to stop blaming something called Brussels for everything that goes wrong."
"National governments and parliaments take responsibility when everything goes right, but when it is wrong they blame Brussels."
"I think these impact assessments should show just who is responsible and where the blame lies, because it is far too convenient to do that."
"Furthermore, when you look back at what happened before we had the European Union, the cost of that was absolutely devastating."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the report, as it supports our smart regulation agenda and aims to strengthen the shared responsibility of the EU institutions in this area."
"The Commission also welcomes the fact that the report supports some of its suggestions addressed to the European Parliament through the Smart Regulation Communication, but we also know about the few highly problematic proposals."
"The Commission has already made clear in its Smart Regulation Communication that it cannot and will not accept requests that would affect its autonomy in carrying out impact assessments - for instance, the externalisation of the Impact Assessment Board - or that would otherwise affect its right of initiative."
"Let me recall that the European Court of Auditors, in a recent special report on impact assessments in the EU institutions, has confirmed that the Commission's impact assessment system 'has been effective in supporting decision making within the EU institutions' and in raising the quality of our proposals."
"The Court of Auditors also found that the Commission has in place the structures needed for smart regulation and that the Impact Assessment Board clearly helps to raise the quality of our impact assessments."
"The Commission will take a position on the report after the adoption of the resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 7 June at 12:00."
"I would ask all Members for their forbearance with regard to the current discrepancies, as the display is not working."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Impact assessments have a significant effect on legislative activities, which is why new developments are needed, with the establishment of a mechanism independent of those assessments."
"Therefore, they should not justify a legislative proposal, but rather allow for an objective examination of the facts."
"This also applies to the scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the methodology of which has been called into question on several occasions, and to public consultations, where the wording of the questions may lead one to expect answers that the Commission's services want to hear."
"In order to combat these abuses within the legislative process, we call for a clear methodology, an analysis of alternatives and the option not to take any action, as well as maximum transparency and the close involvement of Parliament."
"External dimension of social policy (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Falbr, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility."
"Mr President, as I said in my speech a short while ago, the external dimension of social policy covers EU measures and initiatives aimed at promoting employment standards and social standards in third countries."
"Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 initiative place a far greater emphasis on social policy than was ever the case before, competitiveness and economic factors are still the centre of attention."
"I therefore took a very critical approach to the drafting of this report."
"If we want the third countries with whom we negotiate agreements to respect the principles and the very basis of the European social model, we must respect this model within the European Union."
"If we want the countries with which we negotiate international agreements to respect the International Labour Organisation's fundamental conventions, then we must respect them ourselves."
"It is plain to see, however, that ILO conventions are violated in some Member States."
"As far as corporate social responsibility is concerned, it is undoubtedly a good idea, and has been under discussion since the early 1970s."
"The problem is, however, that it cannot be enforced."
"When we were debating the comments on this report and amendments to it, one of the views expressed was that a directive should be drafted, since some businesses simply do not behave in a socially responsible way."
"More than 150 amendments were tabled to the report, but I think that it nevertheless still takes a critical approach."
"The European Union needs to do more to support the International Labour Organisation, since it is absurd that, while we profess support, fewer and fewer countries are ratifying and respecting the conventions."
"During the last parliamentary term, the Commission even presented proposals, for example, in respect of the Working Time Directive, which ran completely counter to ILO Convention No 1 on Hours of Work, adopted in 1919, which laid down a working week of 48 hours."
"I am very glad that Parliament rejected this directive."
"That brings my explanatory statement to an end."
"There is no need for me to say any more, since this is an issue which everyone understands."
"What I want, above all, is respect for social rights, and respect for something we proclaim as a major achievement of the European Union."
"(RO) Mr President, according to European statistics, well over half of workers in the European Union, particularly immigrants, do not enjoy social protection."
"This is why I think that when it comes to social protection for workers in the European Union, basic common standards need to be promoted, along with imposing penalties if current legislation is breached."
"Ratification of the revised European Social Charter would encourage internal social reforms at EU Member State level, while also facilitating the process of harmonising national legislation with EU regulations."
"It is important as a political commitment to promoting and guaranteeing social standards and to adapting the legal and institutional mechanisms to the specific standards and values of European democracies."
"The social rights stipulated by this agreement comply with Community social law and the relevant standards in European Union Member States."
"Mr President, as a shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, I would like our position on this report to be quite clear."
"First of all, while we appreciate that the final text may be improved by the votes tomorrow, it is strong enough, and we would simply underline that the role of the International Labour Organisation should be strengthened."
"On this we agree with the rapporteur."
"Voluntary corporate social responsibility is a good thing but the primary role in promoting and protecting human rights belongs to states and international organisations."
"We do not think that legally binding standards should be avoided in the field of corporate responsibility."
"Violation of fundamental principles and rights at work cannot be used as a legitimate comparative advantage and we must insist, in bilateral and multilateral relations with our partners, that decent work standards are properly complied with."
"(PT) Mr President, bearing in mind that the World Social Security Report 2010 of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) states that over 50% of all workers have no social protection, it is easy to conclude that, in most cases, there is no corporate social responsibility."
"Nonetheless, the Commission continues to negotiate free trade agreements that generally only serve the interests of big companies and financial institutions, do not give proper attention to labour rights, and fail to promote freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining."
"They do not take the measures necessary for the effective elimination of discrimination in the workplace or profession, or for the elimination of forced labour or insecure or poorly paid work, including child labour."
"This report should therefore denounce all of these issues, but it falls short of what is required, and we hope that the Commission will go further tomorrow in consolidating its approach to these issues ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Mr President, it is true that social protection for workers is often a lot weaker than it should be, even within the European Union."
"This is particularly true for migrant groups in the population, who travel abroad to work in places where they are often unfamiliar with the language and the local regulations, and are subsequently, of course, unable to keep up professionally with local workers."
"Despite this, I do think it is important for the European Union to seek the application of the International Labour Organisation's rules and agreements in international treaties with third countries, because it seems to me, as we learn more about the labour market and working conditions in Asia, Africa and other corners of the world, that we must strive to ensure that significant improvements are made in the status of workers in these regions and areas too."
"Therefore, I personally support Mr Falbr and his report."
"I am certain that it will also lead to improvements in these rules in Europe as well."
"(RO) Mr President, I, too, want to congratulate the rapporteur, while also calling on the European Commission to adopt the necessary measures so that European companies adhere to European principles and values even when they are operating in other countries."
"The European Union must promote the European social model."
"This is why it is of paramount importance to adhere to the European Union's principles and values."
"We regret that the European Union does not have a homogenous formula for a social clause to be inserted in all bilateral trade agreements."
"I want to point out, Commissioner, that a horizontal civil aviation agreement between the European Union and Canada was voted on recently."
"It is the most ambitious agreement of its kind signed by the European Union, even though it does not provide any social clauses."
"Both sides have committed to work and develop things in this area."
"Unfortunately, however, I should emphasise that we regret that the European Union does not have a homogenous formula for a social clause to be inserted into international agreements."
"Mr President, I congratulate Richard Falbr on the comprehensive approach to international labour standards in his report."
"I have been pleased to contribute to his work on the specific question of corporate social responsibility."
"Tonight, this gives us a chance to influence the Commission in advance of its CSR communication by asking it firstly to maintain the open definition of CSR latterly adopted by it in the Multi-Stakeholder Forum; to return to the principle of convergence in private and voluntary CSR initiatives, which was its former policy; to make concrete proposals for implementing global CSR standards, specifically the updated OECD guidelines on Multinational Enterprises and the new Ruggie framework on business and human rights; to commit to the principle of integrated financial, environmental, social and human rights reporting by business - indeed paving the way towards the possibility of future legislation in this area; and to advance the responsibility of European businesses in their global supply chain, responding to the governance gaps identified in the Commission's own recent Edinburgh study."
"Parliament always likes to help the Commission, Ms Reding."
"I hope these suggestions help tonight."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of my colleague, László Andor, I would like to welcome the fact that the motion for a resolution for discussion today addresses so many crucial aspects of social policy's external dimension."
"The Commission firmly supports closer cooperation at global level, with employment and social objectives going hand in hand with economic objectives."
"In particular, we support the continuation of discussion and the coordination of efforts within the G20."
"In this connection, the preparations for a G20 Labour and Employment Ministers meeting provide a good example of the increased cohesion emerging at world level."
"The Commission also supports close cooperation with and among international organisations, which - and I am quoting the OECD and the International Labour Organisation - is vital for achieving a level playing field internationally and, in particular, for setting international labour standards."
"The 100th session of the ILO began last week: it will focus on a new ILO convention on domestic workers, an issue which this House discussed recently."
"Social protection, including the development of the Social Protection Floor initiative, is another area of interest for this year's ILO conference."
"We will closely follow the discussions on implementation of the labour standards enshrined in the ILO Convention, and I would point out that the Commission welcomes the emphasis in today's motion for a resolution on the need for the EU to promote the ILO core labour standards and the decent work agenda worldwide, including gender equality and non-discrimination policy as a cross-cutting issue."
"The Commission will also continue to promote sustainable development, decent work, labour standards and corporate social responsibility in other policy areas, such as trade and development policy."
"In 2011, the Commission intends to present a communication on corporate social responsibility outlining proposals for further action at international level, including promoting cooperate social responsibility in relations with partner countries."
"In our view, the involvement of enterprises is also essential in order to address issues such as youth employment, training, workforce skills, health and diversity, responsible restructuring and local development, especially given the current economic and social difficulties facing Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 7 June at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I attach a lot of importance to the activities and initiatives associated with the external dimension of the European Union's social policy, the aim of which is to promote social standards in third countries in order to prevent, among other things, the present-day slavery in which people are treated purely as 'production machines', rather than valuable individuals."
"As a result of the prevalent and increasing economic competition in the world, conditions for workers are deteriorating further, with workers' pay being the main victim of cuts and the working age being extended, in an attempt to make profits."
"Therefore, in order to change the current trend, we must move from words to deeds and implement the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Decent Work Agenda and the relevant conventions."
"If necessary, we must also apply extreme measures - various economic sanctions and restrictions - against countries and companies which consistently ignore them."
"Of course, the relevant sanctions should not be implemented lightly or based on the desire to eliminate economic competition."
"Violations of labour norms by third countries also contribute to excessively high duties in developed countries and in the European Union's Single Market, so we must not fail to follow the ILO's conditions if we want to be competitive."
"The European Union should not point the finger here; instead, it should put forward its own solutions and compromises in order to improve the situation."
"I welcome the increase in companies' social responsibility and respectful attitudes towards their own workers."
"Yet we cannot accept a situation where the obligations of countries and local governments are shifted onto companies."
"This is more the kind of policy associated with the former Soviet Union and present-day CIS countries, where the authorities essentially channel the money of the businesses."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Falbr for his excellent work on the report on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility."
"A politically and economically integrated EU also needs a social dimension more urgently than ever."
"It is important to guarantee the existence of basic services, basic security and decent working conditions for all EU citizens, especially now during this economic crisis."
"As the rapporteur says, the approach to social policy that Europe chooses should also be adopted in our relations with third countries."
"The Union must insist more strongly that a condition of future trade and investment agreements should be that international agreements are ratified, implemented and monitored."
"Furthermore, European companies, too, should be required to be more open with respect to their accounts and subcontracting chains, so that the European Union's strong socio-political values do not remain merely illusory."
"Financing instrument for development cooperation (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation: lessons learned and perspectives for the future."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the DCI, the European Union's Development Cooperation Instrument, is a powerful tool."
"Covering the period between 2007 and 2013, the EU has at its disposal a budget of almost EUR 17 billion to combat poverty, to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to promote democratic governance in developing countries."
"Parliament has closely followed the functioning and impact of the instrument to ensure that the money is spent in accordance with these objectives."
"At the end of this year, the Commission is going to present its proposals for the next generation of financing instruments for external action, to cover the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework."
"Therefore, the Committee on Development has taken the initiative to analyse the lessons learnt with the DCI and to define our expectations for the future instrument."
"The Committee on Development was unanimous in supporting the following key principles."
"We need a financing instrument which is exclusively targeted at the objectives of poverty eradication as defined in the Lisbon Treaty and which only covers developing countries."
"The new instrument must primarily fund measures which fulfil the criteria for ODA (Official Development Assistance) as defined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee."
"The ODA quota must be even stricter than in the current DCI."
"Let me be clear that we do not question the importance of non-ODA cooperation with developing countries, in particular, the emerging markets and strategic middle-income countries, but this form of cooperation should be channelled through separate instruments to enhance transparency and protect the specific nature of development cooperation."
"Funding to improve people's access to basic health and education must be ring-fenced by including a clear benchmark."
"At least 20% of funding under the geographical programmes should go into these life-saving sectors of basic health and basic education."
"The future instrument must ensure better integration of environmental and climate change issues in developing cooperation."
"Assisting developing countries in setting up fair and effective tax systems is another issue to be strengthened."
"In particular for the middle-income countries, the mobilisation of domestic revenue is crucial for reducing poverty and aid dependency."
"The new instrument must be sufficiently funded."
"The EU development budget in the next financial framework should increase in real terms and thus contribute to reaching the collective target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA."
"The scarce development resources must be used in the most effective and efficient manner."
"Closer coordination between the Commission and Member States is needed and Parliament therefore supports the development of joint strategy papers."
"The Commission itself has said that this could bring about savings of greater impact, of approximately EUR 6 billion per annum."
"Think of what that could do in the developing world."
"Finally, a word on procedure."
"When the Commission adopts strategic programme decisions on the new instrument, Parliament must have a say on an equal footing with the Council."
"This is the requirement of Article 290 of the Lisbon Treaty, which must be fully respected."
"The resolution we are going to vote on this week will provide the guiding line for upcoming negotiations on the next-generation development instrument."
"I hope that this House will give broad support to the proposals from the Committee on Development which have been carried out in quiet disquisition but based on our experience of the negotiations we went into - and I remind the House that we merged 14 regulations into one in the DCI."
"We want to make sure that the DCI works and that its successor will work in achieving these objectives."
"(RO) Mr President, the eradication of poverty is a key international objective of the EU."
"Implementation of this instrument helps define the European Union's presence in the UN and achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"In addition, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force, the EU has the necessary external powers for meeting this target."
"In future, the new fund's geographic and thematic priorities will need to be clarified to make it operate more efficiently."
"This means that vulnerable social groups, developing and emerging countries have to be included on the list of financed development objectives."
"The strengthening of the SME sector and domestic private sector will be encouraged with the aim of raising the living standard in the countries included in this programme."
"This will help reduce dependence on external aid and boost domestic economic growth."
"(RO) Mr President, the European Union can help developing countries in their efforts to tackle poverty."
"In order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, I think that it is vitally important also to take actions which help developing countries combat climate change."
"The European Union has taken actions in this respect, targeted at agriculture, adapting to climate change, forestation, the management of marine resources and coastal areas, as well as water management."
"The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund was set up in 2006 with the aim of mobilising private investment for projects supporting energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy sources in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition."
"The 'Energy and Climate Change' package also envisages the introduction of the Clean Development Mechanism, which allows Member States to make energy-efficient investments and use the carbon credits in developing countries."
"(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, our colleague, Mr Mitchell, is a recognised expert in the Committee on Development."
"That is why his report is so well drafted, and I thank him."
"I would just like to emphasise one small point: respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"The greatest gift that we can give is not money."
"It is widely known that the Union uses its budget to impose its Western values and standards on developing countries."
"We have a duty to demand respect for human rights, but the future depends on respect for the right of nations to self-determination."
"We in the West need to respect their values and cultures while providing financial assistance."
"(RO) Mr President, just as the rapporteur has also emphasised, the eradication of poverty is one of the main objectives of the financing instrument for development cooperation, launched by the European Union to provide support to developing countries."
"At the moment, another challenge needs to be included on the agenda for the debate on the Development Cooperation Instrument, namely, the food price crisis, triggered by the drought and speculation on the global food market."
"This requires the European Union to respond flexibly and quickly not only in order to address the sudden changes in terms of requirements and priorities, but also to ensure consistency with the new international objectives due to be defined."
"The European Parliament must continue, as part of this process, to support the Commission's efforts in programming development cooperation policies and to enhance its role in the democratic and budgetary control procedure."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's remarks and suggestions."
"I am pleased to see that we agree on the majority of issues."
"Most of all, the Commission appreciates that the continuing dialogue in the context of democratic scrutiny has produced very good results."
"We only regret that Parliament does not feel that some of its resolutions on programming were respected in every detail, although the Commission has taken full account of Parliament's view wherever possible."
"Regarding cooperation on global public goods, the Commission would point out that, in general, this may meet the criteria of official development assistance (ODA) and the EU should therefore continue financing ODA-related cooperation on global public goods under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)."
"Nevertheless, a separate partnership instrument will concentrate on cooperation of EU interest and will be complemented by a thematic programme addressing civil society organisations and local authorities."
"Likewise, projects financed under the thematic programme for migration and asylum generally count as ODA."
"Thematic cooperation programmes such as 'Investing in People' will continue to address all the millennium development goals, as we must not neglect the interrelationship between them."
"While budgetisation of the European Development Fund does not currently seem feasible, the Commission nevertheless intends to pursue the issue with Member States, taking into account, primarily, the objectives and principles of the Cotonou Agreement."
"With regard to the use of delegated acts, the Commission refers to President Barroso's letter of 7 March 2011, indicating that a new architecture will reflect the new institutional context."
"One important element will be flexibility in the programming process, so that funding and priorities can adapt to today's rapidly changing world."
"This could be done by the introduction of significant elements of the delegated acts procedure, fully respecting the criteria established in Article 290."
"In conclusion, the Commission welcomes Parliament's report."
"It constitutes useful input in the preparation of the follow-up instrument to the DCI under the next Multiannual Financial Framework."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 7 June at 12:00."
"Progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, we have been talking about European contract law for over a decade; now is the time for action, and if ever there was a time when the Internal Market needed a boost in terms of additional transactions, it is now."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs favours an optional instrument, a second EU contract law for all citizens and enterprises."
"We believe it could help."
"But we have said that there will be tough criteria for the next step."
"There must be a high level of consumer protection, higher than in many of our Member States."
"It must be easy and user-friendly for SMEs; it must give them a badge of honour to conduct their business under this optional contract and there must be no detriment to national law."
"The process must be evidence-based, impact-assessed and with full parliamentary involvement, and on that basis, as I have said, the time for talking is over and we need to move forward."
"There are those who are nervous and say, well, let us just use the idea of a toolbox."
"Can I say to those who have that idea, be very careful, because I have a suspicion that a toolbox without an optional instrument is potentially actually more invasive of national law than a toolbox with an optional instrument that is voluntary, that respects the autonomy of the parties and is not detrimental to national law."
"Let us see something, as we move forward, that offers preventative justice for EU citizens and small businesses; that really gives us an instrument which means justice for growth."
"Enough talking, now let us move on."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her work and the contents of her report, with which I am in complete agreement."
"I believe that only an optional instrument to be adopted by means of a regulation can adequately fulfil the objectives of the whole reform of European contract law."
"Moreover, an optional instrument should neither harmonise nor replace national contract laws but rather work alongside them as an alternative instrument that offers freedom of choice to contracting parties."
"Therefore, I do not agree with the proposals put forward by those who would prefer to limit the scope of this instrument so that it applies only to e-commerce contracts, as this would create an artificial and, above all, unnecessary distinction between online and face to face transactions."
"Our task as legislators is not to limit the legal nature of the regulation on the basis of speculation or market projections but rather to ensure legal certainty and to lay the foundations for a common legal language in the field of commerce."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Reding, the vision of European contract law is clearly a wonderful one."
"However, at the end of the day, it has to provide something positive for European citizens, otherwise the idea of European contract law is simply art for art's sake."
"Why does the report start with the most vulnerable parties here, the consumers?"
"The key element of Mrs Wallis's report, the recommendation of the optional instrument, is an unreasonable demand for consumers, to put it mildly."
"It is confusing for them, and in practical terms, it will never be the consumers themselves that are able to decide which state's contract law they ultimately utilise, but rather their counterparts in the matter, in particular, big businesses."
"In any case, now is not the time to say that the optional instrument is the last word on the matter, but instead we should look more closely at the other options, too - the toolbox that was mentioned and the contract models."
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for her bold move."
"While I have no idea how it will progress, we obviously need to try to ensure that European citizens, European retailers and European consumers benefit from what I would call equal rules, so that they can buy, sell and hence engage in business on the basis of these same rules."
"In view of the complexity of the machinery of European law and national legislation, a single optional system that could be rolled out across the European Union is an appealing prospect, but is probably a Sisyphean task, as we will clearly be hampered by diverse legal systems, protests from the legal profession, and jurisdiction issues."
"I fear that it would be very difficult to establish, but let us give it a shot and see what happens."
"(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, although voluntary contract legislation may give rise to legal problems regarding its implementation, it represents one way of getting rid of the different systems of contract law, which are one reason for the high failure rate of cross-border purchases by consumers, which is estimated at 60%."
"Unfortunately, entrepreneurs face a series of other pitfalls."
"It is not only contract law which is not fully harmonised, but also consumer law."
"There are significant differences in tax regimes and accounting standards."
"Payments often attract extra bank charges, and the cross-border use of digital content is frequently blocked for licensing reasons."
"Moreover, consumers in 10 Member States were unable to find domestic offers for at least half of 100 products tested, while consumers in 13 Member States found cross-border price offers that were at least 10% lower than in their own country."
"I therefore support the proposal to issue legally binding standardised voluntary contracts translated into all the languages."
"At the same time, I would like to call on the Commission to play a more active role in resolving the outstanding urgent issues, in order to put an end to the fragmentation of the Internal Market."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Diana Wallis, together with Hans-Peter Mayer and Sirpa Pietikäinen, for the excellent work on this dossier."
"It is very clear that, in the wake of the global economic crisis, the Internal Market needs to be boosted."
"We need the Internal Market if we want to have growth, job creation and innovation."
"What is the current situation?"
"Only one in four businesses trade across borders and those who trade limit their operations to only a few Member States."
"That means they miss out on the possibility of utilising the Internal Market."
"What are the consequences for consumers?"
"Well, they do not reap the benefits of the Internal Market either."
"Many cross-border orders - as many as 61% of the orders on the online market - fail to be completed for this reason."
"That means that we have here a non-functioning of the Internal Market both for businesses and for consumers."
"That is the reason why the Commission has launched a consultation on policy options in the field of contract law, in response to which Parliament is giving its opinion today."
"We have seen that Internal Market failures are due, in part, to the differences in national contract law."
"We agree that there are other reasons for failure, but our recent Eurobarometer surveys show that contract-law related obstacles rank first out of eleven obstacles to business-to-consumer transactions."
"That is why we need to get rid of those obstacles, one by one, starting now with contract law."
"By the way, this Parliament has been discussing this for ten years, but the experts outside have been discussing it for 30 years."
"So all the work done to analyse and make proposals is there on the table."
"We have never taken advantage of this."
"That is why I agree with the rapporteur that it is time to act now and to see what positive action we can take."
"I have taken note of the assessment of the report on the policy options presented in the Green Paper and the support for the innovative solution of an optional instrument, which means no harmonisation but giving consumers and businesses a choice of having a Europe-wide system."
"I have also seen the support for an instrument applicable in both B2C and B2B transactions, which favours a material scope covering sales contracts, contracts for the supply of digital content and some service contracts."
"I have taken very good note of what has been said by Parliament, namely, that any future instrument, whatever it looks like, should give consumers a high level of protection in order not to deprive them of the protection they would otherwise enjoy under national law."
"That is a conditio sine qua non."
"If we do not have that, we will fail in all of our activities."
"Where do we stand at the moment?"
"On 3 May 2011, the Commission published the results of a feasibility study by the Expert Group on European contract law and we invited all stakeholders to comment."
"The Commission is analysing the results of the public consultation and then it will prepare a detailed impact assessment to see what should be the next step that, in times of crisis, will be good for giving a boost to the Internal Market and creating growth and jobs in the Internal Market by expanding the markets, mostly for SMEs, and giving consumers the possibility of better choice and better deals."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 8 June at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Even though we have an Internal Market, businesses and consumers do not take sufficient advantage of the opportunities it offers, as the proportion of cross-border transactions remains fairly low."
"The Internal Market can be revitalised by encouraging cross-border transactions and I believe that this report will help achieve this objective."
"We must obviously respect differences between Member States' legal systems and the principle of subsidiarity, which is why I do not regard total harmonisation as the most suitable option."
"On the other hand, I feel that the optional application of common rules for cross-border contracts is a viable alternative."
"In addition, I believe that if a Member State would like to extend the scope of application of European law to domestic transactions as well, it should be free to do so."
"It is very true to say that this is not the solution to every problem."
"There are also other obstacles preventing cross-border transactions, in addition to these contract law differences, relating to areas such as tax matters, intellectual property or the availability of electronic payment methods."
"However, I think that this optional instrument deserves a try as it may get rid of some of the administrative burden which is currently preventing SMEs from expanding their businesses in Member States other than their own."
"Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hirsch, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow, we will vote on the role of vocational education and training in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In this connection, it is worth taking a brief look at the position we are starting from."
"We currently have a level of youth unemployment of 21%, in other words, almost double the normal average."
"We have an EU-wide school drop-out rate of over 14%."
"The participation of women in gainful employment is still very low."
"Many people with disabilities, as well as migrants, are without jobs."
"The goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is precisely to tap this potential in terms of workers and to bring them into the workplace so that the EU, too, can deal with globalisation."
"Thus, it is also our job to ensure that initial vocational education in particular is of high quality."
"The discussion began in connection with the Copenhagen process, followed by the Bruges Communiqué, and now it is up to us to see to what extent this area can also be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy."
"An absolutely key element is the fact that young people must have the opportunity, not only in their studies, but also in their vocational training, to undertake part of their training in another EU Member State."
"It is a key element because someone who has already worked in another Member State will also take the opportunity later on to regard the European labour market as his or her labour market, with all the opportunities that that offers."
"It is therefore an absolutely key aspect that we must pursue."
"The second major area is, of course, that of further training."
"On account of demographic change, people are having to work for longer and longer - or they can work for longer, but everyone has to take that decision for themselves."
"People are living until they are much older and will continue with their careers for much longer, and in order to be able to carry on in skilled work until they are older, they will also need to undertake further training."
"There is currently a very low level of participation in further training initiatives."
"Here, too, it must be ensured that the willingness of both employers and workers exists and increases when it comes to taking advantage of further training and continuing to gain education by means of lifelong learning."
"For this, of course, the options on offer also need to be flexible."
"We must take everyone into consideration."
"Further training must fit in with other elements of people's lives and it must be possible to do it alongside work and family life."
"For that reason, we clearly need to create flexible opportunities in future."
"The area of universities has received a great deal of attention - in connection with the Bologna Process, for example - and a similar situation faces us in the area of vocational training, including with regard to mobility."
"We could almost say that no one has noticed this."
"Nevertheless, alongside the universities, the area of vocational education and training is particularly important and we therefore must not ignore it."
"For that reason, I would like at this point to thank my fellow Members from the other groups once again for their very committed cooperation."
"(EL) Mr President, as shadow rapporteur, I welcome the Hirsch report, because it highlights how important it is to always have the capacity to learn and work, alongside mobility and flexibility, in the modern and demanding international labour environment."
"It is true that the economic crisis has brought unemployment and insecurity to everyone, especially young people, women and the disabled."
"In order to achieve the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, we need constant and proper vocational education and training both in the European Union and in the Member States."
"We need targeted policies and strategies to reduce the percentage of early school leavers, proper programming of people's needs for training, and closer ties between the education provided and the needs of the labour market."
"I am certain that the European Qualifications Framework, the European system of academic units for vocational education and training, transparency and cooperation and comparability of the various education systems will support the needs ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Mr President, investment in education is vital to ensure a better future for Europeans."
"At the moment, the EU youth unemployment rate has reached 20%, while the average EU school dropout rate is 16%, and in some countries, like Portugal, it has reached 40%."
"Lifelong learning is vital if unemployment is to be prevented."
"We must give due consideration to the different career paths."
"Workers must be made more greatly aware of the need for ongoing further training."
"We feel that vocational education and training should be accessible, available and affordable at every stage of life, regardless of people's status on the labour market and their income."
"Vocational education and training should create the conditions conducive to labour mobility, both during initial studies and as part of the lifelong learning process."
"We call on Member States to simplify the procedures for recognising qualifications."
"(RO) Mr President, one of the biggest challenges Europe is faced with is the youth unemployment rate."
"At European level, the focus is placed on reducing the school dropout rate below 10% and on actions such as 'New skills for new jobs', whose aim is to bring the world of education and training closer to the labour market."
"The distinction between education and training, apart from their context in the workplace, will become even less clear in the future."
"In order to achieve a greater level of integration, a vital change will need to be made in the way education and training provision is conceived, not only from an individual perspective, but also at institutional level and every level of administration."
"Therefore, I think that system-related obstacles and those in terms of attitude preventing integration need to be removed if Europeans are to learn to make progress in the areas of their skills and values and make an effective contribution to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives."
"(DA) Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who has tabled an extremely good report."
"Like everyone else, I believe that we should remember the context in which this report is set, and that, of course, is the youth crisis that we are experiencing in Europe."
"We are agreed about the general crisis - soaring youth unemployment and young people who are, in fact, moving out of Europe to find work, and this, in my opinion, will be a very serious threat to our economy and our cohesion in Europe in the coming years."
"The second context for this report is the common 2020 objectives that we have set for training, employment and the reduction of the drop-out rate."
"This is about Europe's competitiveness."
"It is about having a trained workforce, which is something that we know we need."
"It is also important to ensure that the new generation has the opportunity for jobs and training."
"This is absolutely crucial."
"It may be the case that the EU does not have a great deal of competence in this area, but something can be done nevertheless."
"In any case, it is a shared concern, and therefore we must ensure that we provide high-quality training and that there is guidance available."
"We must reduce the drop-out rate and ensure that there is a strong link between training and work, for example, by means of exchange systems like we have in Germany and Denmark."
"We must also ensure that all young people have the right to undergo training."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Hirsch, for her very constructive approach."
"I have listened to her with great interest because that was actually my dossier 12 years ago."
"I started to bring about the mobility in training which was not on the agenda at that moment, and I am very glad to hear how strongly Parliament is in favour of developing this essential element in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I would also like to say how much we welcome the report, which reinforces and complements the Commission's communication of June 2010."
"This communication was an input to the latest review of the Copenhagen Process, and the Bruges Communiqué has now, of course, become the European agenda par excellence for vocational training for the years 2011-2020."
"Many of Parliament's suggestions correspond with the actions proposed in the Bruges Communiqué."
"The Commission shares Parliament's view because we need to modernise vocational education and training in Europe to make it attractive, to have qualified teachers and trainers, innovative learning methods and high-quality infrastructure and facilities, and, of course, we have to have the mobility."
"We have to give the will to young people - and to less young people - to go outside their Member State in order to get the experience which is important if we want to have a real European education and training area."
"The Commission also aims to attain gender balance and to help disadvantaged groups through the lifelong learning programme, notably through the Leonardo da Vinci programme, which is included."
"So all the help which the Commission can get from Parliament is most welcome."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 7 June 2011, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"During the current economic and financial crisis where the unemployment rate, especially among young people, has exceeded the 20% mark at EU level and even 30% in some Member States, improving vocational education and training must become a priority for the European Union."
"In this context, youth mobility within the EU, combined with greater flexibility in terms of the labour market and the education and training on offer, are essential elements which ought to be developed at EU and national level."
"Ongoing, well-structured dialogue between universities, research centres and businesses can enable a real link to be established between employers' requirements and the skills acquired during education and training cycles."
"Furthermore, increasing mobility at European Union level through expanding programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci or Youth on the Move can also help improve the EU's ability to respond better to the demand of the European labour market and to have greater potential for development in this area."
"Particular attention must also be focused on socially disadvantaged groups, who need to have fair access to vocational education and training."
"The transition from education to work is a structural challenge for employees all over the European Union."
"Unfortunately, early unemployment has lasting negative effects."
"For this reason, Member States should ensure that vocational education and training is better adjusted to the needs of the labour market, and that vocational education provides employees with the skills needed to take up new, sustainable jobs that will be created in the future sustainable economy."
"I consider the role of local governments, entrepreneurial partnerships and educational institutions important in the development of the labour market demands of vocational education and training."
"The opportunity for mobility is an important part of vocational education and training, but more emphasis should be placed on a better harmonisation of Member States' different education systems - including mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas - in order to enhance collaboration and support mobility."
"High-quality vocational education and training fundamentally contribute to sustainable development."
"Better training opportunities must be created for trainers, particularly at regional and local level, with a view to securing the effectiveness of vocational education and training systems, as well as efficient and successful transfer of knowledge."
"The possibility to learn in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life that will promote the acquisition of foreign-language skills and increased competitiveness."
"Cooperation at European level in the field of vocational education is also absolutely crucial for the functioning of the single European Internal Market."
"High-quality vocational education and training must both respond to the demands of the labour market and create the conditions for workforce mobility."
"Highly qualified and well-educated people represent a competitive advantage for the EU, and support for vocational education should take this into account."
"We need to focus on establishing close links with the world of work, and also on facilitating high-quality work experience as part of vocational training, both at home and abroad, within the framework of European mobility programmes."
"We need greater coordination at European level between the education systems in the individual Member States, and, following on from this, cooperation on the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications."
"The report covers these issues, and, as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am happy with its final form."
"I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training."
"It points to an incredibly important issue which has not often been discussed to date, namely, the need for national authorities to take action, in cooperation with the European Commission, to prevent unemployment by tailoring vocational training to the needs of the job market."
"Unfortunately, vocational education has been neglected in recent years and has reduced in significance."
"This is why it is so important to promote it as an effective tool in the fight against unemployment, and particularly against unemployment among the young inhabitants of the European Union, which has reached 21%."
"Apprenticeships, the establishment of advisory services making it easier for workers to plan their training according to the needs of the jobs market and the promotion of lifelong vocational education should be priorities."
"That is why I call on the Commission to carry out constant monitoring of the outlook for possible changes in the EU jobs market, so that Member States can continuously adapt their vocational training programmes to the needs of the market."
"I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training and would like to emphasise how important it is to promote lifelong learning through initiatives and Europe-wide programmes in order to make it possible for workers to have a better future."
"These days, workers are at the mercy of frequent and risky employment transitions."
"There are many types of transition: from training, redundancy, internships or precarious employment into full-time employment."
"The report contains some important points, including increasing the quota of women in work, recognition of informal learning and promotion of languages with the goal of providing mobility programmes."
"I am particularly pleased that the focus has been placed on education and training for young people, which is something that I will actively support in the flagship initiatives that follow."
"The transition from educational institution to working life must be as smooth as possible and, in particular, tailored to individual needs, because it must also be possible for young people with inadequate training to gain the skills necessary to be able to work in skilled jobs and to earn a good living."
"Social background must not determine a person's educational opportunities."
"Young people must be given help and support in securing entry to the world of work."
"However, the cost of a modern labour market policy must not be borne by our workers."
"New skills and competences acquired by graduates of various types of educational institutions have strategic significance for economic growth and open up new possibilities for people, creating a basis for sustainable development."
"That is why we cannot underestimate the problem of unemployment, especially among young people."
"They are the ones who most often do not obtain permanent work and are forced to accept temporary work which has an inferior level of social insurance and lacks prospects for development."
"One of the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce the rate of early school leavers to a maximum of 10%, and to enable 40% of young Europeans to complete tertiary education."
"The legislative process should focus on facilitating the implementation of vocational traineeships and work experience for young workers, especially in micro-enterprises and small enterprises which find it difficult to fund this type of initiative."
"Strong emphasis should also be placed on eliminating differences in men and women's pay by 2020, since this currently stands at about 18%."
"I believe that the two most important initiatives in the supranational jobs market are the qualifications framework drawn up within the context of the Copenhagen process and the unified European credit transfer system for vocational education and training."
"It is also worth mentioning informal training, which represents an underestimated additional source of skills, and which shapes the character and sense of responsibility of the individual, which is why it should be funded by the EU."
"In order to accomplish these many important goals, cooperation between Member States is vital, as is the involvement of all entities, including those at local and regional level."

"EHEC outbreak in the EU Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the EHEC outbreak in the EU Member States."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank all of you for this opportunity to inform you about developments in relation to the outbreak of E coli."
"I am very concerned about the heavy burden of death and disease that this food-borne epidemic has caused the European population and want to take the opportunity once again to express my condolences to those who are suffering as a result."
"In this context, I have to note that the situation is still evolving."
"There are now over 1 672 Shiga-toxin-producing E coli cases, and serious complications have developed in at least 661 people."
"According to the latest information, this outbreak is responsible for 21 deaths in Germany and 1 in Sweden."
"Sporadic cases are reported in 11 other Member States."
"Switzerland has also reported 15 cases and the United States 4."
"The epicentre of the disease is still the area around Hamburg in northern Germany."
"Most of the cases reported outside Germany concern either German nationals travelling or persons who visited this part of Germany."
"So what is the European Commission doing to tackle the outbreak?"
"First, we have immediately activated all our networks responsible for managing crises."
"The networks are in daily contact and allow for the timely exchange of information, laying the ground for rapid action."
"The Commission holds almost daily meetings with your public health authorities and food safety authorities to discuss the evolution of the outbreak, the health measures taken to prevent infection and the treatment of affected people."
"The Early Warning and Response System and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed have provided a solid basis for exchanging information."
"Second, we have asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to do a scientific risk assessment, which is being updated regularly as the situation evolves."
"We now have an EU case definition which will allow Member States to share the same approach on the investigation of the outbreak."
"Patient questionnaires for outbreak investigations are being collected and compared by the ECDC."
"The ECDC has also developed, together with the European Food Safety Authority, advice on preventive measures addressed to the public."
"This advice is now available in all official languages on the Commission website."
"We have asked the ECDC to urgently set up a platform to exchange best practice on treatment, involving both Member States and professional societies."
"Our food safety EU reference laboratory in Rome developed in record time a method which reduces the time needed to detect the E coli bacterium in food from about six days to 48 hours."
"Finally, let me stress that public perception is extremely important."
"In this regard, the Commission draws up daily updates, shared with the Health Security Committee communicators' network and food safety authorities."
"In addition, the Commission keeps its website dedicated to this outbreak up to date."
"I would strongly urge Members of the European Parliament to support this science-based communication to the public, in order to reduce unnecessary fears and to reinforce our common efforts."
"I can assure you that the Commission, together with these agencies, is working very hard with national health and food safety ministries to support them in containing this outbreak."
"To do that, we need to pursue intensively the investigation into the source of contamination; the work is taking place as I speak."
"During the Health Council yesterday, I asked Germany to reinforce surveillance, outbreak controls and measures in order to identify the source of the outbreak and halt the spread of the infection."
"I also asked that the causes of the contamination should be swiftly dealt with."
"The German authorities accepted the Commission proposal to dispatch to Germany experts in epidemiology of food-borne diseases from the Commission, the ECDC and the EFSA."
"On Sunday, 5 June, the experts started their mission to assist German authorities with the ongoing epidemiology, verify the results and contribute to the ongoing investigations to identify the source."
"As we all know, the initial suspicion raised by the German authorities that cucumbers from Spain were the cause has not been confirmed by any test results available."
"On Sunday, 5 June, the German authorities notified the European Commission that, based on the epidemiological investigations, they believe bean sprouts are the possible source of the E coli outbreak affecting mainly the northern part of Germany."
"The information was transferred immediately to all Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed."
"The Commission follows any new development closely, and will decide on the appropriate course of action the moment laboratory tests confirm any epidemiological finding."
"We do not have any results to date."
"Here, I should stress that it is crucial that national authorities do not rush to give information on any source of infection which is not proven by bacteriological analysis, as this spreads unjustified fears in the population all over Europe and creates problems for our food producers selling products in the EU and outside the EU."
"While such intensive investigations are going on, we must be careful not to jump to premature conclusions."
"In this respect, I want to refer to the latest information coming from Germany regarding the suspicion that sprouts may be the source of contamination; it noted that laboratory tests have not been concluded and that consequently, premature conclusions have to be avoided."
"This illustrates that it is important for the Member States to introduce well sustained and scientifically based alerts into the RASFF and to trigger the RASFF when Member States are confident regarding the scientific evidence supporting the alert notification."
"You have to act quickly and decisively in order to preserve the Internal Market."
"If we manage to do this, then we can learn from the lessons of this crisis and continually improve our systems."
"I have been repeating: our system works."
"We need to learn lessons as we go along."
"I believe that this is our responsibility: to be flexible and to be fast in adjusting our processes and procedures to respond to these types of incidents."
"Coordination and clear lines of information and communication remain the core of our ability to be effective in such situations."
"We have to learn lessons on this front."
"Before closing, I would like to raise briefly two more points."
"The first concerns references to bans on certain products."
"I would like to stress again that the outbreak is limited geographically to an area surrounding the city of Hamburg, so there is no reason, as of today, to take such measures at European level."
"In the light of this and of the steps towards the identification of the source, we consider any ban on any product as disproportionate."
"Finally, I am also very sensitive to the financial impact that this crisis is having on farmers, particularly vegetable producers."
"This is why I am working closely with my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, to address the hardship faced by this group of our citizens that has also been hit by the outbreak."
"In fact, Agriculture Ministers are holding an extraordinary Council meeting today to address E coli."
"As I finish talking to you, I will head back to Brussels to be with my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, during this extraordinary Agriculture Ministers' Council."
"In addition, we are in constant contact with third countries, in particular Russia, to ask them to lift their ban, which is considered disproportionate."
"The Commission is working hand in hand with the Member States with one common goal: to bring this outbreak to an end as soon as possible."
"I am insisting to all concerned that, in situations like this, it is not a local problem, it is a European problem."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli for focusing on the patients first."
"I would like to do the same."
"Hundreds of people are severely ill."
"Medical personnel in northern Germany are really at their limit."
"Twenty-two people have already died."
"Yesterday in the Council, a representative of another Member State, Luxembourg, said that financial losses could be recompensed, but human life cannot."
"Therefore, I would firstly like to ask for understanding with regard to issuing a warning even if we are not 100% certain where the source is but only have a suspicion - that we also make this information public."
"Of course, we still have to find the source."
"I see that many people working for the authorities, with the support of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), too - my sincere thanks to the European institutions and to Commissioner Dalli for the fact that the European Union is also helping to investigate this matter - are really working very intensively on this."
"Nevertheless, as a German Member of this House, I cannot stand here and say that everything is going well."
"There have been a few problems in connection with the crisis management."
"For example, the Hamburg Health Senator informed the public, which was the right thing to do, even if there was not absolute certainty with regard to the Spanish cucumbers."
"The EHEC pathogen was on the Spanish cucumbers and it should not have been there."
"Even the Spanish Members must understand that."
"However, she informed the public first and only very much later, hours or half a day later, she informed the European Commission and the Spanish authorities."
"That was unacceptable."
"In this regard, we in Germany must also consider internally how we could manage this better."
"However, together we should concentrate on the fact that the enemy is not in Spain or in Germany, but rather the real problem is the pathogen that we need to get under control and to combat."
"My final point is that we adopted a resolution during the last plenary sitting on the subject of resistance to antibiotics."
"Even though this pathogen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics, we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics."
"This is a long-standing subject that we now need to tackle more quickly because next time, it could be the case that the pathogen has to be treated with antibiotics but, because it is resistant, it is not possible to treat it."
"We need to work on this."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, you are right that this is a public health issue, a very serious one, and our focus should now be on caring for the sick and identifying the source, but then we have to look to the long term and find out how we stop it happening again."
"A few weeks ago, I met a representative of the US Food and Drug Administration."
"She was telling me about the problems of E coli in fruit and vegetables in the United States and we discussed how this was not common in the European Union."
"Now we have had this outbreak, so we have to ask ourselves some questions."
"Is it about our farming practices, as Peter Liese just mentioned?"
"Is it about intensive farming, hot-housing fruit and vegetables?"
"Is it about overuse of antibiotics in livestock?"
"Is it about manure spreading?"
"Would more accurate food labelling have helped us to identify more quickly the source of the contamination?"
"I note that the Council is not here today, but the Council is resisting proper country of origin labelling on our foods."
"I hope they will listen to this debate in the future."
"So, Commissioner, we need to investigate thoroughly for the longer term and we need to learn lessons and integrate them into our policies."
"Too often, we hear from this Commission and from many in this House about over-regulation, but, as with the banks, I am starting to wonder whether we tend to put the needs of market and supply chains ahead of those of public protection and the consumer."
"'Business as usual' is not going to be good enough."
"It is not normal that people in Europe go out for a salad and die as a consequence, and we need policy change to address this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for having first spoken about the victims and the people taken ill."
"Clearly, it is to them that our first thoughts must go, as well as to the farmers who are in a very difficult position, one that we can perfectly understand."
"I wish to make three points."
"Firstly, we uphold the precautionary principle."
"It was applied in this case, so we cannot complain, and the consequences will obviously have to be dealt with."
"As Mr Liese pointed out just now, human beings clearly come before economic issues, which can be dealt with at any time."
"Death, unfortunately, is permanent."
"Secondly, I fully agree with what Mrs McAvan just said about the importance of traceability."
"We are discussing labelling today."
"It is absolutely vital that we have comprehensive labelling and that we can trace products in order to know where they have originated from."
"Thirdly, regarding the absolutely crucial issue at the heart of the problem, we must admit that we do not know everything, that there are gaps in our scientific knowledge and, in fact, that we are sometimes completely in the dark."
"We cannot know everything."
"We cannot challenge those who have taken decisions and, at the same time, believe that we should wait."
"In this case, the precautionary principle must prevail."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all, I would also like to express my sympathy to those who have been affected."
"Concerning those who have lost their lives: you cannot bring back a life."
"We can probably put the underlying situation right in the longer term, but it shows how wrong it is to jump to conclusions at a very early point."
"I can understand the anger - if there is anger and I am sure there is - from the Spanish side and from those who have lost their business."
"We can probably do something to recompense that, but you cannot give back a life."
"We have got to learn from this and to ensure that in future, we have a solid base for response, as the Commissioner has said."
"We have to find a resolution as quickly as possible to the present situation and, in the long term, we have got to improve our response mechanisms to this type of situation."
"I suppose it is very easy with hindsight to talk about what could or should have been done or what we did not do, but now, with the benefit of that hindsight, we could put mechanisms in place to ensure that this never happens again."
"The Commissioner is right."
"We must learn from the lessons of this."
"You must always learn from the lessons of your mistakes."
"If mistakes have been made, let us put them right and ensure that it never happens again."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you rightly said that there have been too many deaths and too many people made sick as a result of this EHEC pathogen, and I think that the situation we find ourselves in also shows that neither Germany nor the European Union are prepared for the sort of spread of EHEC that we are currently seeing."
"A simple comparison with a few other countries makes it clear that we could be better. I would just like to refer once again to the example of the United States."
"Since the 1980s, huge efforts have been made there with regard to research, there is a reporting obligation and there is a centralised disease control authority in Atlanta that has extensive powers for direct intervention when such an epidemic occurs."
"In Germany, on the other hand, we have two Federal Ministries that are responsible and these ministries clearly could not agree on who was to take responsibility."
"We also have regional ministries that want to, and must, assume responsibility, but that are clearly overstretched."
"We have communication problems between laboratories and politicians."
"Thus, it is wholly unclear when science is to intervene, when disease control measures are to be announced, and when political action is to be taken."
"I can understand why a Minister, on receiving the information that the cucumbers are responsible, would issue a warning accordingly, but where is the detailed coordination?"
"Where is the genuine decision-making authority?"
"It seems to me - and I say this very cautiously - that action was taken just as prematurely with the bean sprouts as with the cucumbers."
"There is something of a discrepancy between scientific findings and political action."
"Getting back to what we need to do: we need to establish a reporting obligation throughout Europe, define central laboratories and set up a central body within the European Union with the decision-making power in the event of an outbreak of such a disease."
"I think that would be the appropriate thing to do."
"I am extremely grateful to Mr Liese for mentioning the antibiotics problem."
"Here, too, we are faced with problems that we are actually already aware of."
"However, because we shy away from entering into a debate with the medical sector, the pharmaceuticals industry and the intensive livestock farming sector - there is a great deal to be addressed here - we are also not being as consistent as we need to be in the way we deal with the matter of antibiotics resistance."
"EHEC and antibiotics resistance are both major problems."
"Mr President, the EHEC epidemic is making apparent the flaws in the system of industrial food production in the liberalised Internal Market of the EU."
"When profits take priority over the protection of health, then food quality and food safety suffers."
"So far, at least 22 people have died in Germany as a result of the EHEC pathogen and there have been more than 1 500 cases of infection."
"In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders."
"After more than two weeks, the source of this life-threatening epidemic is still unclear."
"If we had regional production of foodstuffs, it would be easier to determine the source of infection and the effects of the epidemic would be more limited."
"As a result of the long transport routes and the anonymous production conditions, it is very difficult to trace the origin of the food."
"However, traceability with regard to the origin of the food is essential when it comes to food safety."
"Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from."
"The Federal Government in Germany completely failed in connection with the EHEC epidemic."
"In the confusion between regional and federal competences, management of the crisis fell by the wayside."
"The monitoring authorities were not prepared for this situation."
"We need a radical rethink in agricultural policy."
"Our food must be safe."
"However, agricultural producers should also be protected against incalculable financial risks."
"The policy for promoting agriculture and rural areas must consistently aim at a clear decentralisation of the food production and marketing structures."
"(ES) Mr President, I should like to briefly raise three points on the current situation concerning cucumbers."
"I am the grandson of a German and feel deep affection for that country, but the German authorities have clearly acted hastily and rashly in this particular case."
"As for the EU institutions, an analysis of their actions reveals that the European Food Safety Authority and the Commission reacted feebly and clumsily."
"They have failed to coordinate or to manage the situation."
"Thirdly, the injured parties are entitled to rapid financial compensation."
"In the meantime, however, I propose to Parliament that we hold a great show of European gastronomy either in Brussels or here in Strasbourg, allowing cucumber to take centre stage."
"We must vindicate the lost honour - an expression much to the taste of the German author Heinrich Böll - of cucumber producers."
"Europe is the right stage for this purpose."
"(ES) Mr President, one can only express a deep sense of sorrow for the 23 fatalities: 22 in Germany and one in Sweden."
"This crisis is clear evidence that the European Union has a long way to go in improving its food safety alert system and its internal coordination."
"The Member States involved have been slow, inefficient and inoperative in their reaction, and, at this point in time, with 23 people dead, we still do not know where the problem is coming from."
"The European Commission must think hard about the problems it causes with its irresponsible actions or its failure to act at times of crisis such as we are seeing now."
"These lead to cases of financial ruin, the destruction of previously stable jobs, unemployment, helplessness and, needless to say, an extremely hazardous public health crisis."
"While you in the Commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in Germany - statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible - mentioning Spanish farms by their names and addresses, the population remained exposed, without knowing it, to the bacterium."
"Thus, in the belief that they were avoiding contact with it, the public were more exposed than ever to eating potentially harmful food."
"In the Council of Agriculture Ministers that will be held in Luxembourg at two o'clock this afternoon, the European Commission should propose that a portion of the EUR 2 500 million left over from the common agricultural policy be put to use."
"Those EUR 2 500 million should be used to redress, in so far as is possible, the damage that has been caused."
"To enable this, a suitable legal solution will need to be found, as was the case in previous instances, for example, the 'mad cow' and dioxin affairs."
"One such solution should also be found now."
"Commissioners, Ministers, your actions in Luxembourg today must befit the stature of your office."
"Furthermore, the German authorities, in view of their reckless accusations, should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning, and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products, which is now in shatters."
"(PT) Mr President, the outbreak of infection in Germany has meant that we are facing one of the most difficult public health, crisis management situations in living memory."
"The Commission and Germany, in particular, have not been managing this crisis in the best possible way."
"We are facing a massive human tragedy involving the loss of many lives, and a threat to the lives of thousands of others."
"This is also a crisis of consumer confidence in staple foods, with economic and social consequences that are hard to foresee."
"Society expects a rapid response from the national and Union authorities that sheds light on the causes of this crisis, along with effective action."
"However, it is also necessary to minimise the disastrous consequences this is having on another group of innocent victims, namely, fruit and vegetable producers, as has been mentioned here today."
"These workers have been hastily and unfairly blamed, and have lost income and seen their futures seriously threatened."
"Preventative action also needs to be taken as a matter of urgency so that similar situations do not happen again."
"One aspect of this is to increase the effectiveness of supervision and control mechanisms for antibiotics in animals, as I mentioned in the debate held here less than a month ago."
"Another area where action needs to be taken is the form of the new common agricultural policy (CAP), which we are in the process of reforming."
"It is vital that, in future, incentives be aimed at ensuring quality based on sustainable production methods, as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been insisting."
"(FR) Mr President, the situation has worsened still further: 23 people have died and more than 2 200 people have been taken ill in Europe."
"Clearly, our thoughts are very much with them this morning."
"The German authorities have still not succeeded in formally identifying the cause of this epidemic."
"In the meantime, no one is touching European vegetables, and this health crisis has turned into a social crisis and an economic crisis too, of course."
"The market garden sector is rightly demanding compensation and, as the Commissioner said, the Ministers and Commissioners concerned are due to meet on this subject this afternoon in Luxembourg."
"Aside from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and essential traceability - the first point - it is also a question of knowing how this general alert singling out Spanish cucumbers for blame could have been issued without any, or hardly any, proof."
"What urgent lessons does the Commission intend to learn from this serious crisis, Commissioner, so that our food alert system is more than ever based on 'sound and well-sustained scientific evidence', as you yourself described it, Commissioner?"
"(PL) Mr President, I, too, would like to express my sorrow at the loss of life and to wish those who are ill a quick return to health."
"We have a great deal which needs to be explained."
"We have to establish the source and cause of the outbreak, but we must also identify the source and cause of the false information about the outbreak which was spread in Europe and around the world - false and damaging information, which has done so much harm."
"We need to look very closely at the causes of the outbreak and, in particular, at industrial animal husbandry, where antibiotics are used on a massive scale."
"I agree with those who have just spoken about this."
"If antibiotics are used on such a large scale, it is no surprise that strains of bacteria arise which do not then respond to antibiotics."
"In my opinion, this intensive farming with the use of antibiotics should be greatly restricted in the European Union, and perhaps even stopped, and the damage which has been done should be repaired by those who caused it."
"(DE) Mr President, EHEC is not a new problem, but it is clear that Europe is still inadequately prepared for a crisis like this."
"It takes too long for clear guidelines to be issued."
"Three weeks is definitely too long."
"Consumer protection, we are all agreed, always takes absolute priority over financial interests."
"However, it needs to be made clear who is to issue a warning and when, who is subsequently to take over responsibility for the warnings, and when the European Commission is to get involved."
"In Germany, the responsibility lies with 16 federal states and two ministries, which is too finely distributed for a European crisis."
"Europe must be involved here at an earlier stage."
"I do not believe that we have learnt the right lessons from the crises of the 1990s."
"That is something that we now need to rectify as a matter of urgency."
"When it comes to food, we need transparency and clear traceability with regard to manufacture."
"We need clear country of origin labelling."
"However, we also need a European reaction force to coordinate the scientific and medical work and to establish control plans."
"(Applause)"
"(PT) Mr President, in view of the flurry of conflicting reports about the origin of this outbreak, it is important to bear some points in mind."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that more than 15 days after the first cases had been reported and more than a month after the first instances of contamination had occurred, the European early warning and response units have still been unable to identify the real cause of the contamination."
"This has caused a great deal of harm, as has already been mentioned here."
"Secondly, it is important to remember that this is a serious, but not isolated, case of a lack of food security in the EU."
"I would remind you of the recent debate that we had here on the problem of dioxins."
"These cases are inseparable from a common agricultural policy (CAP) that promotes intensive, export-oriented production models, instead of encouraging, as is necessary, local production and consumption, which could ensure much more effective traceability and, consequently, greater food security."
"Finally, it is important to compensate European producers for the damage that they are suffering, and not just those in the geographical area of the outbreak of infection."
"The CAP is a common policy, so this should be done through EU measures rather than just national ones, given the obvious inequalities that this would create."
"Mr President, first it was cucumbers, yesterday it was bean sprouts."
"Today, it is not bean sprouts."
"The truth is that the experts just do not know, but each time such allegations are made, they destroy livelihoods in countries' economies."
"What we do know is that there is something very strange about this outbreak."
"There is an unnatural combination of strains and DNA in the virus."
"It is affecting unusual groups of people in a way not normally associated with E coli outbreaks."
"It has already struck far more people and in far more places than a normal outbreak and, unlike in normal outbreaks, it has not been rapidly traced to one or two food suppliers."
"Given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries - including Britain, the USA, Iraq and Israel - have, in the past, been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated E coli as a biological weapon, should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is, in fact, an instance of, and perhaps a test run for, biological terrorism?"
"(FR) Mr President, the situation is serious, very serious even, as this EHEC outbreak is a complete mystery."
"I can imagine the anxiety of those taken ill, and we can only lament the deaths that have occurred."
"This whole affair must force us to take a very rigorous approach to European public health problems and make us see that it is vital to work with researchers and the pharmaceutical industry in order to respond effectively to such a situation and also to give ourselves the means to do so."
"The bacterium costs lives, too many lives."
"It also costs our farmers a lot of money and dangerously undermines consumer confidence in our agricultural products and agri-food industry, which are still undoubtedly the safest and most strictly controlled in the world."
"After cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and bean sprouts, what will be the next victim of this health hysteria?"
"There are serious economic consequences for farmers."
"The fact is, the alert system worked very well."
"The problem is that the Commission has neither the resources nor the opportunity to check whether information given by a Member State is true or not."
"Bacteria circulate more quickly today than they did in the past."
"Lessons will have to be learnt, in communication terms, from the way in which this health crisis has been managed."
"Feedback will have to be given."
"Additional checks will no doubt have to be envisaged before the conclusions of a national or regional health agency can be taken as read."
"Lastly, this crisis totally justifies a vital improvement in the traceability of foodstuffs."
"The obligation to indicate the country of origin or the place of provenance unfortunately only applies in a limited number of cases."
"It should be extended to a larger number of foodstuffs."
"In the event of a health crisis, this would make it possible to identify the sources of contamination and to warn the consumers concerned more quickly."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers can be compensated, but human life cannot be recovered."
"Indeed, our sympathy goes out to all those who have died or are lying in a hospital bed."
"This situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable that three weeks after the outbreak of this crisis, we still do not know exactly where the pathogen that caused the crisis originated."
"That really should not happen in Europe."
"There are several lessons we need to learn from this."
"Firstly, we need to look for the source and examine whether improper practices are still present in the food production sector or in the food supply chain."
"We have legislation that has been in place for 20 years, and the standards and codes of practices in the European Union are quite stringent, but it is clear that we are still vulnerable when it comes to foodstuffs."
"There still seem to be gaps and shortcomings and we need to learn from this once again."
"I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic."
"Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way."
"We clearly need more Europe. That has already been said by other Members here."
"When any regional or national authority issues a warning for the whole of Europe, it can only be a disaster."
"In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public."
"Mr President, the German and European authorities are still trying to identify the source of the E coli outbreak."
"Today, we still have no concrete evidence about the reason for this spread and all scenarios should be considered, including potential negligence or unintentional entry of the bacteria into the food chain."
"How the bacteria were actually created is a different case; research and findings are needed urgently."
"However, I would also like to make a special point about the way current events have been communicated to the general public by German and European authorities, with the serious consequences we know for the fruit and vegetable sector, not only in Spain, but in all our Union."
"This is not the first time that we have had a problem relating to food safety in Germany."
"I propose that the Commission should help the German authorities to enhance the traceability and control of the German procedures, and similar measures should be taken concerning the procedures in other Member States."
"Transparency is needed to maintain consumer confidence."
"All information should be available but this information should not be communicated in a way that means raising multiple alarms and triggering consumers' fears when evidence has not yet been found."
"Let me also point out the responsibility of the media."
"Mr President, hearsay can be dangerous."
"Did this outbreak start in Germany or some other Member State?"
"Rumours can be destructive and can even help spread an outbreak."
"There are still many unanswered questions surrounding this outbreak."
"The only sure thing is that most Member States have reported cases of the bacteria."
"To date, we have 22 deaths in the EU."
"This outbreak demonstrates the importance of cross-border cooperation in the field of preventive health."
"It also brings into play the importance of having a European agency such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to monitor, collaborate and inform the Member States."
"We are relatively lucky in the UK to have had only three reported cases, but that is today: tomorrow, things could change, and we must be vigilant."
"In addition to finding the cause of the outbreak, we need to keep the public informed and therefore protected."
"ECDC is publishing daily updates."
"Through cooperation, we can control this outbreak."
"If our citizens are informed, they stand a better chance of avoiding infection."
"Above all, we need to be calm and measured in our response."
"(EL) Mr President, for the second time in six months, Europe is facing a food crisis which has caused serious health problems for many people and has even resulted in loss of life among our fellow men."
"Something is not right, Commissioner."
"In January, we had the problems of toxins in Germany; now we have bacteria problems, again in Germany."
"The first case was covered up, even though it was known about for months; in the second case, the blame has been conveniently shifted to Spanish cucumbers."
"This is a problem of recognisability, of traceability and of inadequate controls at EU level."
"In the first case, in January, Mr Dalli told us, when speaking about dioxins, that you would take all the necessary measures to ensure that legislation on the food control system was tightened up."
"The other day, you said that this was not a problem of recognisability and that there was some other problem."
"The Commission's stand is marked by confusion, cover-up and panic and, as a result, we are mourning lives, we are mourning cases of illness and we are mourning the consequences to agricultural production."
"(IT) Mr President, the situation we are discussing is very serious, but I think in some cases, we are still confusing things at very different levels."
"Lost lives clearly cannot be put at the same level as economic problems; that is not what we are doing."
"I would like to stress, however, that it is not by pointing the finger at the causes - which then turn out not to be the causes - that we will solve the problem."
"If someone is murdered and an innocent person is put in prison for it, that provides no comfort or justice for the murder that has been committed."
"Yet we are doing just that: in an extremely serious situation, with a public health crisis and food safety at stake, we are pointing the finger at people who then turn out not to be guilty, thus causing further victims."
"The Spanish growers have already taken to the streets and today, in about 40 minutes' time, direct growers in Italy, too, will be demonstrating in the streets in Milan and the province of Latina, offering consumers fresh cucumbers and other fruit and vegetables to show that they are healthy foods and important for a healthy, balanced diet."
"We would not wish to strike German consumers the extra blow of depriving them of foods that are absolutely essential for their diet and their health."
"I would also like to point out some data that should give the relevant authorities, in particular, cause for serious thought when they put out certain information that causes alarm, fear and panic."
"Data supplied by Eurobarometer and gathered by Coldiretti in Italy show that in a food emergency, 43% of Italians, for example, avoid the foods they have heard about for a certain length of time, whereas 13% cut them out of their diet for good."
"We must therefore try to think about what we say and how we influence people's eating habits."
"I should like to ask the Commission, therefore, if it does not think there is a case for triggering the European emergency clause and bringing forward the discussion on financial compensation."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Dalli, your colleagues in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers and yourself have done everything right."
"The same cannot be said of the German authorities."
"The least that we can say is that there is chaos when it comes to communications, and that, perhaps, is putting it mildly."
"The fact that Germany's health minister yesterday thought it unnecessary to travel to a Health Council in Luxembourg where the main topic on the agenda was this serious infection crisis shows that he has absolutely no idea what Europe is really about and that he is ignorant, does not recognise the problems, or is still busy with internal party political crises."
"(Applause)"
"What is more, I must observe - and Mr Dalli said it himself - that the German authorities clearly took the view that they would do without European Union experts, patronisingly and arrogantly believing that they had no need for them."
"Furthermore, the fact that it took three days for these experts to get into Germany is a scandal, and one that we must be critical of in this House."
"At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market."
"I say to you quite clearly - if there are dangerous bacteria on a cucumber or a lettuce that do not lead to death, that may be a good thing, but for me it is not enough to justify a compensation case."
"Cucumbers from Spain and other countries did have EHEC bacteria on them."
"They were not the bacteria behind this outbreak, but it takes a while to find that out."
"For me, that is not the point, either."
"Those of you who understand the European Union and know the early warning system also know how the early warning system works."
"You know that, in the early warning system, the product and also the name of the producer must be named."
"You can also look that up easily in the legislation."
"For me, the important question is what will happen in future?"
"In the future, we need to consider whether slurry use can continue."
"Could there still be production methods that are unacceptable?"
"Who, in the European Union, actually monitors what, when and with what result this is documented, and who has what obligations in that regard?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, this is a real crisis."
"23 people are dead, over 2 000 have been affected, the vegetable markets are in turmoil with prices on the floor, and it is estimated that producers are losing EUR 300 million a day."
"Relations between Germany and Spain are strained to say the least, and yet, three weeks into this crisis, we still have no idea of where the source of this contamination has come from."
"Commissioner Dalli, I want assurance from you here today that absolutely every effort is being made to trace where the source of this E coli outbreak has come from, because until we trace the source, we cannot start the process of rebuilding consumer confidence."
"Secondly, I want you to spell out what actions you intend to take once we get over this crisis to stabilise the market and rebuild consumer confidence."
"Thirdly, we do have to hear from you what the Commission intends to do to try and compensate farmers who, through no fault of their own, have seen their markets destroyed and are unable to sell their produce."
"Fourthly, I want an assurance from the Commission that a transparent, independent investigation will be set up to establish the facts of what went wrong."
"It is only once we have the facts that we can take action to plug any gaps in food safety law."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the health dimension of the crisis resulting from this outbreak of EHEC bacteria is absolutely tragic."
"The situation is serious."
"There is an urgent need to get help to those affected and to take all possible steps to prevent the further spread of this infection."
"All necessary resources must be made available to our research institutes and hospitals."
"Rapid action has been the order of the day since this pathogen emerged."
"However, the uniform, Europe-wide crisis management right down to a common language regime has not been characterised by professionalism."
"The pathological hunt to locate the contamination site led to premature accusations of guilt all round, and these arguments led to days of negative headlines and total uncertainty on the part of consumers."
"For the producers affected, this gave rise to dramatic losses of income that threatened their very survival."
"Blameless, regionally-produced products, too, are no longer selling."
"In Austria alone, sales of fresh vegetables have fallen by 75%."
"Growers of vegetables are being faced with these losses of income right in the middle of their peak harvesting season."
"The uncoordinated way in which consumers have received information in the course of this event once again raises the demand for universal and cross-sector origin marking and efficient monitoring on the principle of 'marked and checked at source'."
"Consumers have the right to know where products come from."
"This applies equally to shop shelves and to restaurants and catering."
"All the authorities now need to quickly eliminate the prejudices against fresh vegetables, re-invigorate sales of fresh vegetables and breathe new life into trade with third countries."
"The EHEC situation has thrust local vegetable growers into an existential crisis completely out of the blue and through no fault of their own."
"The Commission must make it possible for there to be compensation for losses, be it through a European agricultural fund, the European crisis fund or measures to promote sales."
"Mr Liese is absolutely right to say that human life is irreplaceable and that every death is one death too many."
"However, it is also absolutely our duty not to leave our producers high and dry when it is through no fault of their own that they have found themselves in this situation that threatens their very survival."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we all want the German food crisis to end as quickly as possible."
"We have to remember the victims, and I hope that once the initial errors have been remedied, it will be possible to identify the source of the infection, for everyone's peace of mind."
"However, apart from the health aspect of this crisis, I have to mention the economic repercussions."
"The Spanish horticultural sector has estimated the economic losses caused by the fatal errors in communication, which we now know about, at EUR 200 million a week."
"I wish to emphasise the responsible attitude demonstrated by this sector and its total cooperation with my country's authorities."
"Commissioner, traceability to the origin worked, but how much time was lost in directing attention to the origin, focusing on agricultural production, whereas other forms of contamination, such as handling or distribution at the point of destination, were dismissed?"
"Why did the Commission echo the hurried information from Germany?"
"There has been a lack of coordination, Commissioner, and the unilateral closure of borders to Spanish products is proof of the failure to monitor the crisis within the European Union."
"I would ask the Commission to activate immediately all the necessary mechanisms to compensate the damage to the Spanish and European sector, both financially and in terms of consumer image."
"In the long term, however, it remains to be seen which other measures are adopted in this respect."
"Unfounded accusations, improvisation, lack of coordination, millions in losses, attacks on the honour and credibility of a sector: is it not sufficient reason to demand who takes responsibility?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Dalli for his measured comments at the start of the debate."
"There have been some less measured comments in the Chamber because of the impact on human lives, and indeed the add-on impact on producers and consumer confidence."
"This is a most serious food crisis, and Mr Dalli has acknowledged that."
"We know it is regionalised in a certain part of the European Union, but it is not a German-only problem; it is an EU problem."
"The system exists to find the cause and deal with the consequences, but I am afraid that not all parts of the system have been adequately put in place, and I have some questions in relation to timing."
"I understand that the rapid alert was given on 22 May 2011: I am concerned that the European experts went into Germany only on Sunday, 5 June."
"Why such an incredible time lapse?"
"I think that this needs to be looked at."
"We have, under Article 55 of Regulation 178/2002, the possibility of creating a crisis unit."
"Everyone who spoke said this is a crisis, and Mr Dalli acknowledges it is a crisis."
"It is one which is growing rather than declining, and I would suggest it is now time for the EU to invoke that regulation and put such a crisis unit in place."
"The thing that has been most distressing has been the virtual 'naming and shaming' of vegetables and then declaring them not guilty."
"This has shattered consumer confidence not just in fresh fruit and vegetables, but in our system of food safety and control."
"Commissioner Dalli, I know that you are nodding in agreement, and I welcome that, but I do believe that now is the time to set up the crisis unit, and I would like you to comment on that in your closing remarks."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I come from the region of Europe where the outbreak of the EHEC pathogen is at its raging worst."
"This aggressive bacteria seems unstoppable."
"Between mid-May and noon yesterday, 1 733 people were infected, while 23 patients died a torturous death."
"The situation in the clinics is extremely fraught. Intensive care beds are running out, and blood plasma is needed urgently."
"No end is in sight."
"The people of my home area fear new cases every day."
"For me, it is a question of courage and a sense of responsibility to warn about every even potential carrier of this bacterium."
"Various foodstuffs have been analysed, but it has not been found."
"My understanding of high grade foodstuffs is that they are healthy and that they are placed on the market subject to monitoring."
"I am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard, and once again, we are finding out that there are loopholes."
"However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme."
"In all the understandable panic, there must not, under any circumstances, be a witch-hunt, as that would drive many hard-working farmers throughout Europe to the wall."
"It therefore needs to be clear to everyone that we in the European Union need to show solidarity with one another and stand ready to provide mutual assistance in the event of emergencies."
"In other words, all the medical experts must sit down together, and economic assistance needs to be provided to those who innocently find themselves facing financial disaster."
"(ES) Mr President, first of all, I wish to express my condolences to the relatives of those who have died as the result of this crisis."
"Commissioner, informing the public of health risks is a difficult and delicate task and has to be perfectly documented and verified."
"It is not a question of finding who is to blame, but on this occasion, major errors have occurred, starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager, recently recruited to the job, who unleashed social alarm and a very serious, irreparable economic crisis."
"Nor would it appear that the Commission has coordinated this crisis very well."
"I wonder when the first case occurred, and whether Article 3 of the regulation relating to the rapid alert system - which requires Member States to notify the risk immediately and within 48 hours - was met, and also whether Article 8 of said regulation - which obliges the Commission to check whether the information is complete, true and legible and has sufficient legal basis - was met."
"What is certain is that the serious shortcomings of this regulation have been exposed and that it is necessary to review the current legal framework in order to define precisely, among other things, the crisis management procedures used by the competent authorities, to attribute errors or omissions to the perpetrator in the food chain (and traceability is used to this end), to prevent health protection from concealing commercial barriers and to arbitrate compensation procedures for damage to trade and loss of profit."
"Commissioner, neither cucumbers or soya are the cause."
"As Mr Liese has said, the cause is the pathogen."
"The cause is serotype O104:H4 of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which is already described throughout scientific literature and is associated with meat products."
"However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work: they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, nothing that we do here or in the European Union is going to bring the dead back to life, but I hope that what is being done will prevent more deaths and halt the chain of people who are ill and who are suffering without having done anything to cause the problem."
"Certainly, we do not know the causes, but we do know some things that we have to spell out: there has been negligence in political action and negligence by the German Federal Government; it cannot act as if Hamburg were a city state on another continent."
"If Mrs Merkel and her Ministry of Health had translated the arrogance with which they frequently address other States into diligence and efficiency, some of the things that happened would not have done so."
"That negligence has had criminal consequences for one State, namely Spain, and for its most important sector, agriculture."
"It has ruined thousands of people and small businesses, and has discredited the economy for a long time."
"I ask you to go to the Council today and ask for full compensation for those affected, because we cannot ask for life for those who have died."
"And I ask for the control systems to be reviewed."
"And for Mrs Merkel to accept responsibility."
"And I ask her for less arrogance and more diligence."
"And that she be held responsible for the damage she has caused."
"She cannot ignore the fact that Hamburg is in her country."
"She cannot ignore her responsibilities."
"She cannot attribute blame to a Federal State when she herself should be held responsible for the damage caused."
"A bit more humility, a bit more good management and a little less conservatism would have gone a long way to ensuring that this crisis did not slip through her hands, and that Spain and other farmers in the south did not have to suffer its painful consequences."
"Review the controls, review the warning systems and ask for responsibility, because, Commissioner, in Spain we are asking you, the Council and Germany for precisely this."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being here, but I would rather he was somewhere else, such as on a plane to Russia, for example, in order to make the case at the highest possible level that the ban that Russia has now introduced should be withdrawn because it is completely over-the-top."
"I thank the Commissioner for his willingness to communicate with us at this point, but the communication that has taken place thus far, including by the Commission, has been a disgraceful failure."
"It was days after the outbreak of the crisis when the Commission held a press conference."
"The genie was already long out of the bottle by that stage, however, and the wildest imaginable stories were already circulating in the media."
"The Commissioner spoke about a possible source on Dutch cucumbers, even though more than 200 tests had already shown days earlier that that was not the case."
"I agree with you that the technical side of the story has worked. Rapid alert, tracking and tracing have all worked."
"There is also the communications side of the whole issue, though, and that side has been abysmal, first of all in Germany, of course, with so many different institutes, authorities and even a number of ministers all giving out different signals."
"There was a minister for agriculture who made a senseless comment that people should 'stop eating uncooked produce altogether', even though she had no authority for the matter."
"I assume that you are talking to Germany in this regard, as there needs to be a fundamental investigation into how everything could have been handled so shoddily."
"I also hope that you will soon argue the case with the agriculture ministers for an emergency fund, to be paid for from the surplus still available in the agriculture budget."
"Just as we did with dairy products when a deep crisis broke out in that sector, we need now, too, to call that surplus into use."
"In my home country alone, this sector is suffering to the tune of EUR 80 million a week even though the source of the outbreak is elsewhere, and the result is that healthy businesses are now on the verge of collapse."
"That cannot be the European Union's intention."
"I take it that you will take this strong signal from Parliament with you to the Agriculture Ministers' Council."
"(SK) Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome this debate."
"We are looking at this problem from various angles, and we are looking for the source of the infection, the identity of the pathogen and the possibility of a cure."
"I am now just waiting to see which pharmaceutical firm will come forward and say it has a cure for this disease, thus starting another panic."
"In my opinion, the area where there is greatest room for improvement is in public awareness."
"I think it is inadequate and irresponsible to inform citizens on a given day about which food they should not buy or which food looks suspicious."
"It is necessary to inform citizens about what they should do in their everyday lives, and there should be one campaign here at both European Union and Member State level."
"If people maintain basic rules of hygiene, and if they maintain their personal hygiene as well as washing or heat-treating their food, that will be enough to protect them from this infection."
"This is not a demanding campaign, but I think that there have been and that there will be epidemics and various diseases here, and what has protected people most has been their personal behaviour."
"I firmly believe that such a campaign would help prevent disease, as well as helping vegetable growers."
"(PL) Mr President, it is important that we are discussing, today, the subject of the threat to patients, food producers and consumers caused by the emergence of a dangerous strain of bacteria, the source of which we are, as yet, unable to identify."
"We say we have a good system for monitoring food quality and maintaining high standards."
"In spite of this, difficult situations such as the present one continue to arise."
"Therefore, it is essential to review and improve our system of surveillance and monitoring."
"We need to be ready for situations which are even more dangerous."
"We must not release information about sources of origin if the information is not reliable."
"This slows down the process of continuing to search for the source, and causes serious moral injury and huge economic damage."
"We extend expressions of sympathy to the families of the victims and to those who are ill, but let us remember to provide compensation to the farmers from a number of countries who have suffered losses."
"We are talking about the future of the common agricultural policy and about issues of security in the area of access to food and quality of food."
"Perhaps this difficult situation will make us aware of how important this area of issues and problems is, because it is one which concerns not just what our citizens eat, but the state of their health."
"(ES) Mr President, we are faced with a public health problem - an epidemic according to the Commissioner - and they have been looking for those culpable and not the cause."
"The system has not worked: We have 22 dead, 1 600 affected and, three weeks later, we still do not know the cause and, using the precautionary principle without scientific basis - I repeat, without scientific basis - Spain is being blamed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Spanish cucumbers were not contaminated."
"They were not contaminated!"
"I am repeating it because some versions to the contrary have been heard here."
"Moreover, so that you can see the impact that these words have had: 300 000 jobs may be affected; a loss of confidence."
"An epidemic knows no frontiers."
"I am telling you, Commissioner: knows no frontiers!"
"We ask for responsibility for what has not been done, for what we have to do immediately, because there is a risk of further infection in Germany at the moment - it has the largest number of people affected - but Spain is not to blame."
"We ask for compensation."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as you said, the problem is not local, even if it is localised."
"I would like you to say so more loudly and clearly, because we seriously need more tools and European coordination on these issues."
"The message has been extremely muddled and fraught with consequences, including for Spanish producers, but not just for them, since others have been affected too."
"This point was made several times just now."
"Striking a balance between early warning, on the one hand, and transparency, on the other, is certainly difficult."
"However, precaution or the precautionary principle does not mean that we should communicate information randomly and far too quickly."
"Things should therefore be set straight, and those responsible for an early warning should also be the ones who pay compensation."
"This is what you will be discussing this afternoon."
"This is what is important, even though, like everyone else, my thoughts are clearly, first and foremost, with the victims."
"Still, farmers are waiting for the compensation they deserve."
"For the rest, resistance to antibiotics and traceability continue to be key issues which we will have to look into further."
"Mr President, with 22 people dead in the EU and over 2 000 taken in for treatment as a result of the ongoing E coli outbreak across Europe, it is appropriate that this Parliament extends its sympathies to those who have lost loved ones and our good wishes for a recovery to others."
"Consumers demand food that is of good quality, safe and traceable."
"The fact that the source of this outbreak is still unclear and that the search for answers has, at times, seemed haphazard, means that consumer confidence is eroding fast."
"Economically, it is farmers who will suffer while this goes on - farmers whose food is perfectly safe."
"We must also urge calm in such a situation."
"National governments have been quick to apportion blame."
"In the past, we in the UK have suffered as a result of such scaremongering around our produce, and this speculative blame game must stop."
"Can I also say that this House constantly rushes to introduce regulation."
"Before it does so, we must have a full and thorough investigation of the facts."
"(ES) Mr President, the most important thing, and that which is uniting us here today, are the victims, because nobody should feel as unprotected as we, the European consumers, feel at the moment."
"Furthermore, we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims."
"It is my responsibility to denounce the German authorities, who, wrongly and hastily, accused Spanish cucumbers and, more specifically, the cooperatives of Malaga and Almeria, which were model operations and which will not recover from these accusations."
"Thousands of jobless families are wondering why - and they need an answer - and, in particular, they want to know what the future holds for them, not just in Andalusia, but throughout European agriculture."
"Therefore, and in the hope that the experts will soon find the solution, I demand that today, when the Commission speaks to the Council, it asks for immediate and moral economic measures for all the producers from Andalusia and from the whole of Europe, who are looking towards us with indignation, but also with hope."
"(ES) Mr President, instead of giving priority to the European investigation and cooperation, the German authorities have slandered and prejudiced cucumber producers and others."
"Yet nobody in Germany has resigned or offered reparations for the damage caused."
"It is Germany that has a serious credibility problem."
"The treatment by Mrs Merkel of the southern countries, both with regard to agriculture and finance, is intolerable."
"Someone said that Mrs Merkel was a disciple of Adenauer and Kohl."
"She is nothing of the sort: she lacks moral fibre."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, clearly, we need to learn from the mistakes that have been made."
"There is the coordination problem in Germany - various German MEPs have also said this, both from the governing bloc and from the opposition - with the two federal ministries, the sixteen Länder and the lack of coordination."
"There needs to be a strict national monitoring system, and it needs to be looked at how that operates both in Germany and also, above all, in the other 26 Member States."
"At the moment, we are pointing our fingers at Germany, but perhaps it will soon be our own Member States we are pointing at."
"We therefore need to ask whether the internal monitoring systems in all the Member States are strong enough."
"The European systems that are in place - Mrs Roth-Behrendt was quite right - do work."
"There is perhaps a lack of coordination."
"At any rate, there was certainly a lack of communication."
"That should therefore be the focus of our attention."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner, first of all, whether he will respond to the question asked by Mr Leinen and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, amongst others, as to whether you will be bringing forward a truly European solution."
"Secondly, can you tell us what you will be doing at the agriculture Council and how you can compensate those farmers who have suffered damages?"
"(ES) Mr President, it is precisely in situations of crisis that the efficiency of and confidence in institutions is seen."
"In this case, they have left much to be desired."
"The Commission has said precisely that suspicions about Spanish cucumbers have not been confirmed."
"No, Commissioner: what has been confirmed is that the suspicions were unfounded, irresponsible and without objective data; what has been confirmed is that there are 23 dead and that the Spanish horticultural sector has suffered enormous damage."
"What has also been confirmed is that the Commission must do what it has not done up to now, which is to act with conviction on various fronts: stop the outbreak; prevent unfounded suspicions from being given a glimmer of credibility, seriously affecting a Member State - in this case, Spain - by taking the necessary measures to achieve this; compensate the damage suffered without delay and restore to the Spanish brand its image of safe, very high quality agricultural products."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, we are in the middle of a crisis and, if truth be told, we have more important things to be doing at this point in time than pointing fingers and assigning blame."
"When you are in the middle of a crisis, all you should be doing is making your decisions and solving the crisis before doing anything else."
"Everything else can be discussed later."
"The first priority is to find a treatment for patients for these antibiotic-resistant bacteria and to trace the source of the outbreak."
"In addition, we need, above all, to communicate well in order to walk the tightrope between keeping the patients, consumers and producers informed and doing right by all of them."
"We can then turn our attention to the question of how our crisis management is actually going."
"This will certainly not be the last crisis."
"Who is in charge?"
"Too many authorities are involved, and somebody needs to take the lead."
"That is what the conversation today with you and the Council must be about."
"What will be the situation with leadership in future, and who will take on the role?"
"The use of antibiotics is indeed a thorn in our sides, for both animals and people."
"There are major differences between the Member States."
"Last but not least, there needs to be compensation for the damage done."
"To sum up, there needs to be clarity and drive."
"(DE) Mr President, EHEC is the term of the last week."
"First of all, our sympathy, clearly, goes to the victims."
"In the interests of public health, the authorities have the obligation to provide them with information."
"The well-being of the people must come first."
"In the United States, they have an early-warning system to that end."
"The fact is that there have been over 2 000 infections and more than 20 people have died."
"People have to be told where this bacterium is."
"It was on Spanish cucumbers, where it certainly should not have been, as a faecal bacterium has absolutely no place on a foodstuff."
"When it comes to economic compensation, those responsible must pay, certainly not everyone else."
"Finally, I would like to observe that the Council was absent for the whole of the debate on this issue."
"(PL) Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak in such an important debate."
"The citizens of the European Union need the European institutions to be effective in many areas, including in prevention of the spread of every kind of disease in every part of the European Union, and this is understandable."
"However, above all else, preventative agencies working in the area of health and food safety should be ready with ways of preventing panic."
"These institutions should be completely independent of the administrations of Member States, and should even be empowered to act with executive authority in the event of a crisis."
"We did not manage to prevent panic this time."
"This has resulted in losses running into millions, and Polish farmers have also been affected."
"The price of vegetables on the Polish market fell by two thirds in the course of a week."
"Every day, vegetable producers incur losses of PLN 2 million."
"Several months ago, we raised the alarm concerning swine flu."
"The European institutions did not pass muster then and were not able to prevent panic from spreading across the European Union."
"Now, something similar has happened."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity must prevail: that is one of the European Union's founding principles, but solidarity must not be an excuse for the various stakeholders to shirk their responsibilities."
"It is not right that the German authorities failed to defer, from the start, to the European Union in a tragedy that has transcended their borders ever since the end of their first press conference, when they wrongly blamed Spanish cucumbers."
"It is not right to make unsubstantiated accusations, to communicate uncertain information and to cause such confusion."
"It is not right that all the principles of crisis communication have been flouted in this way."
"Because of this, the crisis has turned into hysteria."
"These rumours and witch-hunts fuelled by those same authorities have caused enormous harm; they indicate a lack of responsibility."
"The bond of trust between consumers and producers has once again been broken."
"Let us ensure that this tragedy is not a terrible waste, too, by learning important lessons from it: we need to decide on the best ways of implementing a robust cross-border traceability system and establish a European communication unit and a crisis management unit."
"If we do not learn the lessons of this failure quickly, 23 people will have died for nothing."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank you and also all the Members who contributed to this debate."
"I will not have time to react to every single interesting comment that was made, but I can assure you we have taken note of the feeling expressed in this House."
"Today, as I said, I will be attending the Council of Agriculture Ministers."
"Tomorrow, I will be in Berlin to participate in a coordination meeting between the food safety sector and the health sector, together with the experts we have in place there."
"My main preoccupation is to stop hospitalisations: that is my first and foremost objective."
"I am concentrating on mobilisation and on speeding up the identification of the cause of the outbreak."
"We set up the crisis unit on 30 May 2011 and, at Commission level, we were fully mobilised at that point."
"My public health department mobilised the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the ECDC has activated its crisis mode in order to make scientific assessments as rapidly as possible."
"The Commission immediately asked the ECDC to carry out a scientific assessment."
"In daily meetings with Member State experts, the Commission has coordinated assessment measures: the establishment of common case definitions, case reporting, patient questionnaires, sharing perspectives on treatment, and hygiene advice to the public are some of the outputs we have achieved in a very short time span."
"We have to be very careful and we have to keep everything in perspective."
"It is easy for all of us to sit in judgment with hindsight and to make statements, rather than being in the eye of the storm when a crisis is happening."
"We have to be careful in our statements and criticism because, while insisting - as I do - that decisions be made on the basis of well-sustained evidence, we should not terrify those who are called upon to take risky decisions, sometimes in very difficult situations, fearing that afterwards they will be put in the dock and everyone will pass judgment on their decisions."
"I think this aspect of situation management is very important."
"The same goes for checking and controlling the information that is circulating."
"We have a system in Europe that allows for fast communication and, in order to have fast communication, we apply the subsidiarity principle - looking to the lowest possible level as the base from which communication should start."
"We have to be careful because, if we begin to add layer upon layer of controls and checks to verify the information circulating, then we will defeat the purpose of speed, and in circumstances where health is concerned, and where life and death is sometimes at stake, speed is of the utmost importance."
"As regards information, we are supplying continuous information as we receive it."
"In this respect, we at the Commission agree that coordinated and rapid communication is an essential element of risk management."
"If you remember, in 2009-2010, as a result of our H1N1 experience, we set up a system to coordinate public health communication, and our EU Health Security Committee has a network of communicators."
"We will need to involve regional actors more effectively in this process, as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO)."
"As recently as yesterday, I was on the phone with Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the WHO, about this aspect of coordinating information and ensuring full coordination before any communication takes place."
"We will study what happened, and undertake closer investigations and analyses."
"Once we are confident that the contamination has been stopped, we will concentrate on what happened in the information sector, with regard to investigation protocols and in terms of coordination across the board when the crisis occurred, and we will then reflect on whether we need more tools and closer European coordination."
"That may be part of the answer but, as you say, it is going to involve a lot of discussion both here in Parliament and also at Member State level."
"On the issue of compensation, this will be discussed this afternoon in the AGRI Council, and I am sure that my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, is doing his utmost to identify and develop ways and means of compensating our farmers who have been suffering as a result of this problem."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) The latest German food safety scandal has directed our attention to the deficiencies of adequate regulatory supervision once again."
"Consumers' faith in the diligence of food producers and, not least, in the professional operation of supervisory authorities, was shaken once more."
"In a well-functioning rule of law state, consumers have good reason to believe that the food that ends up on their tables and that they give to their children is safe to consume."
"Unfortunately, this is not the first time that this faith has been shaken."
"It is enough to think of the poisoned tomato scandal in Hungary, but we might mention January's dioxin-contaminated pork scandal in Germany as well."
"All these sad events call our attention time and again to the fact that the state must strengthen regulatory inspections, and act against all deficiencies or abuses in the strictest possible manner."
"It is, after all, absolutely impossible to expect citizens to carry out this work instead of the state."
"We cannot get trained to become food scientists or install laboratories capable of inspecting food in our homes."
"Instead, the right solution is to impose the strictest sanctions against those who violate regulations, and not be afraid to even shut down businesses."
"First and foremost, I would like to express my solidarity with the families of the victims."
"For the immediate future, the EU and the Member States should focus their resources on finding the source of the contamination in order to end the outbreak and the deaths that it has caused, and to restore consumer confidence in the food chain, as without this, it is impossible to put an end to our farmers' desperation."
"In order to do this, the European Food Safety Authority and the Member States' health ministers need to work together."
"This has been slow to happen due to Germany's disastrous management of the crisis."
"The EU cannot neglect its farmers in this situation."
"It needs to create a mechanism to compensate them rapidly for the massive negative impact of this crisis, which is already jeopardising the survival of many farms."
"The absolute priority is consumer protection, but we need to correct our procedures."
"It is vital to establish who is to issue a warning, and when and how they should issue it, in order to prevent the information chaos we have been witnessing."
"This has had disastrous consequences, while the source of the problem has not even been identified."
"We also need to see clear action from bodies of a pan-European nature."
"Our concern is, first and foremost, for the victims of this epidemic and their surviving dependants."
"This abominable situation must not be repeated; we need to learn the lessons from it quickly in order, in future, to be able to more quickly detect where the cause is and to communicate in a more efficient and more coordinated manner."
"This area, communications and the poor consultation between the Member States in that regard, has been a pitiful failure."
"A very great deal of economic damage has been wrought that would have been perfectly preventable if more care had been taken with communications in the crisis."
"The operators affected are entitled to damages. We are therefore arguing the case for the establishment of a European emergency fund."
"Additional national support measures are like a sticking plaster for a broken arm, and, moreover, hardly provide evidence of serious European solidarity."
"As Commissioner Dalli said here this morning, this is not a national problem for Germany; it is a European problem."
"Let us therefore also tackle it in a European context."
"This crisis is also an opportunity to make clear to European citizens that Europe will not leave the victims of a public health disaster of this kind in the lurch."
"Research into the source of the E coli outbreak is proving complicated."
"Bean sprouts are presumed to be the source of the infection and to have caused the deaths of 20 people in Europe and a further 300 or so serious cases diagnosed in Germany alone, but the latest test results on bean sprout samples have been negative."
"The immediate consequence of the outbreak has been a noticeable drop in fruit and vegetable consumption throughout Europe."
"Although, at the moment, no precise figures are yet available on the extent of the losses in the European market-gardening sector following the E coli crisis, the economic damage caused to this sector will clearly not be negligible."
"Given that I have already tabled a parliamentary question on this issue, I take the opportunity in this Chamber to stress the need for the Union to commit itself to supporting European producers in this sector with instruments appropriate to the seriousness of the crisis."
"I also draw the Commission's attention to the fact that it should consider introducing measures to improve the preservation of fruit and vegetables and increase controls on their packaging."
"With food safety in the EU in the news for the second time in six months, and with such a high death toll, this is not a food scandal; it is a food crisis."
"Two weeks later and we have rushed to point the finger and created a credibility problem before we have even established the cause."
"We have undermined producers who, even though they did their job properly, have found themselves in the position of scapegoat and are still paying the price today."
"We have undermined the confidence of European and other consumers."
"We have created a rupture in our trade relations and in internal cohesion."
"This crisis calls the European agricultural model itself into question and tests the functioning of the Internal Market."
"It is no longer enough to say who and what is to blame."
"The Commission should take permanent corrective measures, one of which is traceability and should be a priority objective."
"Several important points should be raised in connection with the issue we are discussing, and I am relaying here the concerns of my fellow citizens."
"Firstly, European consumers must be able to know what they are eating."
"Hence, it is vital to ensure that agricultural products can be traced from farm to fork at European level."
"Secondly, we must call on Germany to do everything it can to locate the origin of the bacterium."
"In this respect, I welcome the Commission's decision to send experts to Germany."
"However, the Commission must carry out its work on a wider scale and check whether all the control, analysis and research systems have been adhered to properly, because we must improve and strengthen our food alert mechanisms."
"Thirdly, audits should be carried out across Europe so as to ensure that the monitoring systems are effective."
"Fourthly and finally, let us not forget the farmers who have been treated badly: they have been wrongly suspected without having done anything!"
"And there will be many more of them yet who suffer from the lack of trust among consumers."
"Europe must therefore unite in support of proper compensation measures."
"In relation to the debate on the EHEC outbreak in the EU Member States, I would like to call attention to the fact that as a result of decisions made by EU and non-EU countries, borders have been closed in order to protect the market from an influx of vegetables from countries which harbour the supposed source of the infection."
"The information being received from vegetable producers is disturbing."
"Dealers are recording zero interest from customers in buying cucumbers, tomatoes and other vegetables."
"They are incurring huge financial losses because they are being forced to throw away entire deliveries or let them go for significantly less than the price they paid for them."
"Producers are turning away from growing vegetables, which involves changing production to something else, and this, in turn, means worker layoffs."
"If the forecasts are going to continue to be disturbing and we do not find the source of the infection, businesses will be forced to stop trading because of a lack of liquidity."
"I think the European Union does have administrative instruments which allow it to react quickly to such cases, so we should consider how to improve the system to make it more effective."
"Since we do have these tools, we should find the source of the infection as soon as possible, so as not to expose vegetable producers to further losses."
"Society must now slowly get used to the fact that there will be some kind of epidemic every year - first it was avian influenza, then swine influenza, and now it is bacteria in fresh vegetables."
"This epidemic will also result in victims and enormous financial losses."
"The main difference from previous epidemics, in my opinion, is that we have still not definitively identified the source of the infection - first it was (Spanish) cucumbers, and now it is (German) bean sprouts."
"Questions are also being raised about the mistakes made by Member States."
"By this I mean the mistakes made by Germany, which refused help from the Commission and tried to solve this crisis by itself."
"The false accusations caused enormous financial losses to Spanish farmers, and not only them but probably the entire agricultural sector as well."
"The European Commission yesterday proposed compensation of EUR 150 million for vegetable growers who suffered damages as a result of the intestinal infection in Germany."
"In my opinion, it is very important to negotiate compensation in relation to mistakes, such as in the case of Spain."
"The latest developments indicate that the only damage to occur was the financial loss for European farmers."
"We must not forget, however, that the highest price that we paid for this epidemic was in the dozens of victims across many Member States of the European Union."
"It is our duty to take action so that similar errors and outbreaks do not occur."
"The first clarification which needs to be made, because a remark was made about this in the Chamber, is that, faced with such a crisis, agricultural policy is not the problem but rather the solution."
"European consumers have become used to having confidence in the food which they find on supermarket shelves precisely because European producers are obliged to comply with the highest quality standards in the world."
"However, this crisis has highlighted that the European system is not infallible and that we are extremely vulnerable."
"Indeed, we must now turn our thoughts primarily to the victims."
"What has happened is a tragedy."
"At the same time, we must also think about the support measures which are required to prevent the loss of thousands of farming jobs and, above all, the destruction of an entire sector."
"The new food scandal, with the emergence of a new, hyper-toxic bacterium which has already caused dozens of deaths and serious damage to the health of thousands of workers, adds to the long, seemingly endless list of food scandals in the EU."
"This is, in fact, a crime by international companies, which are poisoning the food chain and sacrificing human life and the health of the workers in order to increase their profits."
"The new food epidemic illustrates that the EU neither can nor will protect human life and public health because, as a transnational union of monopolies, it has promised to serve and protect the profits of capital, not the lives of the workers."
"The sole objective of the unsubstantiated accusations - for which there is no scientific basis - made by the German authorities against small and medium-sized holdings in the Member States in the south of the EU, which the EU hastily adopted, thereby causing very serious damage to farmers in those countries, was to cover up and conceal the anti-grassroots and dangerous nature of the CAP and the responsibilities of the EU, the bourgeois governments and the monopoly groups, which have no hesitation in feeding the workers highly toxic foods which are dangerous to their health, provided that they maximise the profits of capital."
"The manner of the response to the EHEC outbreak in northern Germany raises important questions."
"First of all, we need to reflect on the causes of this outbreak and the factors that have stood in the way of fighting it."
"Are there too many antibiotics in cattle fodder?"
"Is it the case that the over-intensive nature of agriculture does not do us any favours?"
"To what extent do we need better labelling and tracing?"
"These are important questions, especially now, when the review of the common agricultural policy is on the horizon."
"In addition, it has also become clear that there are substantial weak points in the European crisis management system for crises in foodstuffs."
"Particularly given the nature of this situation where, as well as the federal government, there are also two competent ministries per region, there is too much fragmentation and too great a lack of clarity in the approach towards, and communications regarding, the crisis."
"In crises of this kind, it is of crucial importance, both for consumers and for foodstuff producers, that a European coordination cell be set up as quickly as possible to look after both communications and the coordination of the scientific investigation."
"This will enable quicker and more efficient investigation into the causes of an outbreak by also exploiting the expertise of other European researchers and laboratories to the full."
"Charging of heavy goods vehicles (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (15145/1/2010 - C7-0045/2011 - (rapporteur: Mr El Khadraoui)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when, hopefully, the plenary session shortly approves the agreement that we negotiated between the institutions with a large majority, we will be playing our part in a significant moment for the transport sector in Europe, a milestone that could signpost the direction for policy for decades to come."
"The immediate tangible impact on the ground will, of course, depend on the political willingness of the Member States to exploit the new opportunities or otherwise."
"We are not imposing anything."
"We are only making things possible, specifically, the application of a principle that we, Parliament, have been arguing for for a number of years, namely, the 'polluter pays' principle, the internalisation of external costs."
"A number of old stagers amongst us know that we have already been fighting hard for this since 2006, when Mrs Wortmann-Kool led the previous review."
"This was followed, in 2008, by a Commission proposal which we have since been working on for three years."
"Those who have followed this dossier from close quarters know how laborious a job it was to get to this result."
"It is a compromise, a compromise between the institutions, but also a compromise between the institutions that, for instance, was backed by the minimum possible majority in the Council, and that also has its opponents here in Parliament."
"Some people think it is not ambitious enough, while others believe that it goes much too far."
"It is to the credit of the negotiating team and, specifically, of the shadow rapporteurs who, together with myself, Council staff and the Commission, reached this fragile equilibrium."
"I ask all of you to support this package that we have achieved as a step in the right direction."
"It provides the Member States, for the first time, with the ability to also charge for noise and air pollution over and above the existing infrastructure charges which, in addition, are not consistently levied everywhere at the moment, and in a way that could stimulate the likes of fleet renewal."
"At the same time, it gives the Member States the ability to greater vary their charging depending on the time of day at which a lorry uses a road."
"This gives the governments control options in order to improve mobility."
"At the same time, there is also a strong commitment - the strongest possible commitment - on the part of the Member States to reinvest the income generated into the transport system in order to make it more sustainable and to reinvest at least 15% of the income into the trans-European transport network."
"At the same time - and this was also an important issue for the European Parliament - there is clarity about the transparency requirement."
"Member States have to specify what level of income they obtain from the charges and what they are going to do with that money in order to bring about a better transport system."
"The package is also due to be applied to a larger part of the fleet, specifically, all vehicles of 3.5 tonnes or above. That is the principle."
"That is the standard. This is what has been agreed."
"It is also to be applied to the entire motorway network."
"We put a strong emphasis on the importance of the interoperability of the system. This will mean one little box per goods vehicle to cross the whole of Europe, rather than 25 or 26."
"That is cast in stone in the legislation."
"Finally, I have one more point to make, and it concerns the correlation tables. There has been quite some discussion about this."
"The solution that we came up with, taking the form of a number of declarations from the three institutions, would seem adequate to avoid setting a precedent."
"To conclude, the Eurovignette is no miracle solution. We will not solve the mobility problem completely on the back of it, of course not."
"It is, however, an important part of a solution to bring about a more sustainable transport system."
"Cost incentives will make up an important element of this, but we will also have to do much more."
"What it is, though, is a step in the right direction and it is for that reason that I and those who worked with me are asking for your support."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr El Khadraoui, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of the Hungarian Presidency, we made a promise to work for a strong Europe, one in which people are in the centre."
"I am very glad that we are now ahead of adopting a directive which will clearly improve the quality of life of European citizens."
"As such, I wholeheartedly welcome the fact that we have succeeded in reaching an agreement with the European Parliament on the Eurovignette Directive."
"The objective of the proposal concerning tolls imposed on heavy goods vehicles for using certain infrastructures is to set the charges used in transportation correctly, so that they reflect more accurately the actual costs of air and noise pollution, traffic congestion and climate change effects caused by heavy goods vehicles."
"It is a fact that commercial road transport is one of the determining economic sectors of modern societies."
"It is also a fact that the extent of problems that can be associated with road transport, such as air and noise pollution, as well as traffic congestion, are becoming ever more severe."
"This is why innovative and professional policy measures, such as promoting the use of environmentally friendly vehicles or developing route planners, are playing an increasingly large role."
"As a result of measures that aim to internalise external costs, economic efficiency is likely to increase and negative environmental effects will decrease."
"The fair road charge system proposed in the Eurovignette Directive will allow us to use our scarce resources in a more sustainable manner."
"This measure is also very important in connection with the Commission's recently published White Paper, the 'Road map to a Single European Transport Area - Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system'."
"The measure is the first step on the road leading towards the internalisation of external costs of all transport methods."
"According to the view of the Council, this proposal is one of the most important measures in the area of transport."
"We know that Parliament agrees with us on this matter."
"We have worked very hard together to reach the compromise."
"This is why the Hungarian Presidency would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, in particular, for being prepared to cooperate constructively with the Council and for making a committed effort to achieve success."
"The last open question of the negotiations was related to the correlation tables."
"The Presidency was pleased with the solution found for this issue, and I would like to read the respective statement of the Hungarian Presidency, which is supported by the next Polish, Danish and Cypriot Presidencies."
"In order to avoid any misinterpretation or misunderstanding, let me read it out in English: 'It is hereby declared that the agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament in the trialogue of 23 May 2011 concerning the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, Eurovignette, does not prejudge the outcome of interinstitutional negotiations on correlation tables'."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an extremely important issue, one that will clearly influence the everyday lives of our citizens."
"Therefore, we welcome the agreement reached between these two institutions."
"I believe that in the area of transport policy, this is one of our most important results during the Hungarian Presidency, and we are awaiting tomorrow's vote with optimism, hoping that the majority of representatives will support this directive."
"Thank you once more to all those who helped create this compromise, not only the rapporteur, but also the shadow rapporteurs, as well as our legal professionals, for helping to find a solution for the difficult matter of correlation tables."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, after three years' negotiations, we are now close to the adoption of the amended directive on charging heavy goods vehicles, the so-called Eurovignette Directive."
"This is part of a wider strategy to internalise the external costs of transport in all modes to get transport prices right."
"I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for unblocking this file in the Council."
"The Hungarian Presidency skilfully negotiated with a very narrow majority in the Council."
"Let me thank, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui."
"Together with the shadow rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, he managed to significantly improve the text at second reading."
"I look forward to Parliament adopting this directive for two main reasons."
"Firstly, to achieve our goals of a more sustainable green transport system and thus implement the 'polluter pays' principle."
"The directive will authorise Member States to charge tolls on lorries not only for infrastructure costs, as is the case now, but also for noise and air pollution."
"It will also allow more efficient varying of tolls to ease congestion during peak hours."
"Secondly, at a time of scarce public funding, the charging for external costs provided by the new directive will generate revenues and make new financial resources available for transport infrastructure."
"The Commission supports this agreement."
"I have noted your declaration on the correlation table. I fully sympathise with you on this issue."
"On behalf of the Commission, I will also make a formal statement:"
"'The Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt to the EU directive and that they communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation in the interests of citizens, better law making and increasing legal transparency, and to assist in the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions."
"The Commission regrets the lack of support for the provision included in the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, which aimed at rendering the establishment of correlation tables obligatory."
"The Commission, in a spirit of compromise, and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of that proposal, can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with the relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice."
"It will inform Parliament within 12 months of the adoption of this agreement in plenary and produce a report at the end of the transposition period on practice in the Member States, in order to draw up for themselves - and in the interests of the Union - their own tables illustrating as far as possible the correlation between this directive and the transposition measures and to make them public."
"However, the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent."
"The Commission will continue its efforts with a view to finding, together with Parliament and the Council, an appropriate solution to this horizontal institutional issue'."
"Mr President, the Eurovignette Directive is important because it lays down the European ground rules for a per-kilometre charge and thus ensures a level playing field for road transport within the European Union."
"For all that, I have no intention of hiding the fact that my group had major problems with the original Commission proposal and also with the rapporteur's position at first reading."
"Fortunately, the rapporteur took some major steps in our direction and we should certainly also thank the Council and the Hungarian Presidency, who succeeded, ultimately, not only in achieving a solid majority in the Council, but also in getting Parliament to support this position, too."
"The majority of my group will also be endorsing this agreement, as it represents the first steps towards actually introducing the 'polluter pays' principle, and it does so in an intelligent way."
"First and foremost is the idea that there should be incentives to stimulate sustainability, not just higher duties."
"The arrangement of higher duties during peak hours, compensated for during off-peak hours, is now much better elaborated than in the Council position."
"That will mean that total toll levels remain the same."
"The exemptions for EURO V and EURO VI are also positive, as well as the fact that the Member States have again committed to regulating the interoperability of toll systems, as it is a thorn in our sides that that is still not the case."
"Parliament also finds the earmarking important."
"We would have wanted more of it, but it is definitely an important step, and in that I mean not only the percentage that will now be earmarked, but also the reporting obligation on the part of the Member States."
"Hopefully, that is a first step towards further earmarking of this money."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following a negotiations marathon, Mr El Khadraoui and the representatives of the Council and the Commission managed to tie up an improved package of measures for road charging for heavy goods vehicles in Europe."
"I am very grateful to those involved and, in particular, to our rapporteur, for what they have achieved."
"Through the recognition of the principle of internalising external costs, the partial earmarking of funding for the transport infrastructure and the incentives provided for fleet renewal, we have succeeded in realising important objectives from the Transport White Paper."
"I also believe that we must not overlook the obligations for transparency, which ultimately must also apply to the Council."
"I find it highly regrettable that several Member States attempted, even after the conclusion of the trialogue negotiations, to throw a spanner in the works - they really did try - in connection with the correlation tables in order to block this directive."
"Nonetheless, I would like to conclude by calling on all my fellow Members to accept the compromise achieved and not to jeopardise the results of these long and laboured negotiations, as all that would achieve would be to help the wrong people."
"You have my thanks for backing this compromise."
"Mr President, we will not be winning any beauty prizes with what is on the table, despite the persevering and unbending efforts of the rapporteur, who, by the way, I congratulate in that regard."
"The most important and trickiest point, for me, was earmarking."
"What will the Member States use the income from these charges for?"
"Will they use them to make their transport economy more efficient? Are we going to oblige them to do so?"
"We did not succeed in doing this."
"We thus did not achieve what we were hoping for in this regard."
"It is somewhat perverse that Member States are seeking to keep the way open for retaining this income, just as the external costs are also retained."
"With this charge, we really should be limiting external costs as far as possible and preferably reining them back to zero."
"Thus, the things that this money should actually be used for are the likes of improved infrastructure and research into cleaner goods vehicles."
"There is one issue that continues to bother me, which is, if you have variable charging for peak hours, how do you tackle traffic jams if you do not treat all those responsible for causing them in the same way?"
"This is an issue that we had in black and white at first reading, but the Council did not want to know."
"The efficiency of some of the things that we do is thus not 100%."
"What we do have here - and Mr Ertug has already pointed this out - is more transparency."
"The Member States have to produce a report stating how much income these charges generate and what they have done to improve the system."
"I thus hope that a discussion arises between the payers, the road freight sector and the government on the use of this money and efficiency."
"That is one of the positive elements."
"I am no enthusiast, but I did defend this in my group because we now have an important principle - the internalisation of external costs - incorporated into European legislation for the first time."
"That means that we can make a start on the process of charging for all external costs for all modes of transport in order to improve your economy along with your sustainability."
"The Commissioner included a number of measures in the White Paper for which this step is necessary."
"If we do not approve it, then we will also be stuck on a number of issues in the White Paper."
"It is quite rare, after all, that it is persistently so difficult to reach agreement in the Council - and, Madam President, I am not blaming the Hungarian Presidency of the Council here, it did its best."
"This is an important - and essential - first step in a long process."
"Mr President, I should also first like to thank the Council and Commission for coming to this compromise but, in particular, Mr Saïd El Khadraoui for the proper way in which these talks were concluded while not losing sight of their goal."
"The Group of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) will support the compromise agreement because many of the solutions that were worked out are, in reality, fine achievements."
"On the Council's side, this compromise was very fragile, and it is understandable that some issues such as the scope of the directive or collection and distribution of the allocated funds to Member States were sensitive issues even up to the end of the talks."
"I believe that further compromise talks would lead to a worse result or would end in no result at all."
"The most important thing now is to continue forward, to implement the 'polluter pays' principle regarding the collection of road tax."
"The damage done to the environment must be compensated, and the infrastructure must be improved, and, as Mr Sterckx has stated, this is the first piece of legislation at European level where this principle has been incorporated."
"This principle and the taxes should be implemented in all Member States."
"Unfortunately, many states have not yet implemented the Eurovignette 1 infrastructure payments and, most likely, these same states will be very tardy in implementing Eurovignette 2."
"This distorts the market in haulage flows and, in fact, whereas the roads are maintained by payments by taxpayers in these Member States and the European Union taxpayers, the benefit is gained by third-country carriers, the infrastructure stays undeveloped, and external costs are not recovered."
"Let us hope for some willingness on the part of the Member States."
"Thank you"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurovignette and the results of the negotiations represent an example of how the Council is currently attempting to place limitations on and water down all Parliament's proposals, particularly in the field of transport policy."
"The transport policy of the Member States' transport ministers consists of demanding a sustainable and forward-looking transport policy for the European Union every Sunday while doing everything under the sun during the week to actively prevent such a policy from being realised."
"One thing is clear, and that is that noise and exhaust gases are to the detriment of both people and nature."
"They give rise to costs, and those costs are currently borne by the taxpayers, rather than those responsible for the costs."
"Parliament's proposal, which was already a very tame one and a difficult compromise between the countries at the centre of Europe and those on the peripheries, was still watered down even further."
"Thus, for example, the allocation of external costs became voluntary, rather than compulsory."
"Costs are not apportioned for all the deleterious consequences caused, only for a small number of factors."
"In the end, what remains of the allocation of costs amounts to little more than a couple of hot dogs and a beer for a whole leg of the journey. I find that very little."
"The arrangements apply only in a qualified way to goods vehicles weighing over 3.5 tonnes. Germany got its way with the 12-tonne proposal and in mountain areas, the only goods vehicles now subject to taxation are those that you do not even find there because they cannot get up the large inclines."
"In the end, Italy wanted to derail the whole thing on the basis of a bureaucratic detail."
"When it comes down to it, that is a prime example of how transport policy, sadly, is still not taken seriously enough."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will still vote in favour, as we want to take our place in a majority that at least rescues the principle of the charging of external costs for a future where more reasonable people occupy the role of transport minister in the Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for completing a very demanding piece of work."
"'Eurovignette' is one of the directives that should enable road and rail transport gradually to be put on an equal footing."
"Rail transport has been disadvantaged for years in the EU's Member States due to the fact that users have to pay to use transport routes."
"In the case of the road network, payments for using the infrastructure have so far been rather symbolic."
"If we look at the matter in purely technical terms, disregarding any other factors, we discover that the highest category roads, in other words, motorways, expressways and category one roads, are best adapted to the operation of heavy goods vehicles."
"The directive does not go so far as to follow the logic outlined above and set the highest fees for the lowest category roads, in other words, local roads."
"On the contrary, it focuses only on charging for some external costs, based on the 'polluter pays' principle, and only in the case of the highest category roads, in other words, motorways, expressways, category one roads and dual-carriageways."
"The payments should include as few exemptions as possible, and should apply to the so-called external costs of road transport, including noise and, above all, emissions."
"I am frankly curious as to how the individual states will justify their unwillingness to introduce payments, at least under Table 1, which is a very watered-down version of what genuine environmentalists want."
"Despite these conflicts between logic and the version of the recommendation discussed here, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left supports the position of the rapporteur."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question from Mr Leichtfried under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Kohlíček, it could be that I have misunderstood you."
"There is something that I would like to clear up."
"It is relatively clear, after all, that this is a tame compromise, that heavy goods vehicles will continue to hold the advantage on the roads, and that the charging level overall is far too low."
"However, you did start by saying that this directive could now potentially lead to a level playing field between road and rail transport."
"I do not believe that such a level playing field will result."
"It could be that I have misunderstood you in this regard. I would ask you to clarify this."
"(CS) Mr President, in my opinion, this is only the first step towards putting things on an equal footing, because if I pay a lot for infrastructure on the railway ... (the speaker continued in German)"
"(DE) ... it is the first step towards equalising the conditions for the railways with those of the roads as, at the moment, you have to pay for distance travelled on the railways, but only a very small amount for the roads."
"This is thus a small step towards harmonising the conditions for the railways and the roads."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for doing such an immense and very important job."
"As you know, the transport sector plays a key role in guaranteeing mobility and socio-economic development in Europe and, in order to address the challenges of economic growth and sustainability, it is necessary to improve transport sector infrastructure."
"We are all concerned about the effects of climate change, environmental conservation and various issues relating to health and social well-being, which are inseparable from the rational use of transport."
"I agree that applying the 'polluter pays' principle, as well as trying to safeguard the public interest, results, and must result, in measures primarily aimed at reducing environmental pollution, noise pollution, damage to the countryside, and social costs that arise due to poor health, because these generate substantial economic costs that are borne by the public at large, and thus by Europe's citizens."
"It is good that in the area of transport, we are finally striving to apply the 'polluter pays' principle."
"Undoubtedly, this will give Member States additional possibilities to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means that a better transport-demand-management instrument can be developed."
"However, I still believe that the instruments we are discussing today, which will be adopted in the near future, are not exactly adequate and are only economically beneficial for central transit European Union Member States, and are not entirely favourable, or significantly less favourable, for a large number of European Union Member States situated on the EU's external borders."
"While basically welcoming the project, I believe that it would be worth fully re-evaluating this aspect, weighing it up again and only then adopting it."
"Mr President: So the EU seeks to raise EU revenue by taxation on trucks?"
"Well, I ask UK voters what they think of the EU and the usual answer is 'I do not think we should join'."
"The UK has been politically taken over."
"UK law is made in Strasbourg, a monster red-tape factory is closing industry, and now we have tax but, because it is not football, the people are not informed."
"The UK media avoid EU reality, brains are fed with TV soaps and reporters say the EU does not affect local issues."
"The EU is not news."
"This report seeks to raise tax from tolls on trucks, partly funding the trans-European TEN-T project, which includes linking high-speed EU trains."
"So, when the EU raises taxes in the UK, will the people respond by kicking the EU in the ballot box?"
"No, because they are not informed."
"The final EU superstate takeover by stealth will be a taxpayers' sleepwalk into Europe."
"The defences are down, the press do not care and the UK is asleep, so get those unfortunate truckers taxed."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members who were involved for their work."
"It was not easy to reach a compromise on this issue."
"That is also due to the fact that many people, including in this House, naturally do not agree with the result 100%."
"Some people were for it, others against."
"However, I would like to caution, from the outset, against the absurd situation whereby those who expect more link up with those who expect nothing and between them, they collapse the whole deal."
"I therefore hope that those who want costs to be internalised, and who even view this deal as very small progress, will support this compromise here."
"That is, to a large extent, the view of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), if not all the delegations, as we support the internalisation of the costs in all types of transport and we also support the use of resources to promote mobility."
"For us, that was one of the most important points."
"For us, it is not about making transport more expensive, as has just been claimed."
"Making transport more expensive does not make it more efficient."
"For us, this is about having a proper balance, so that those resources that are partly earned in relation to mobility are also invested in that area."
"Another important factor for us is interoperability."
"We do not want technically different charging systems across Europe - the idea of 27 different systems in future is unacceptable."
"I hail from a border area, and driving around the area for half an hour, you can face road tolls six times!"
"That is not sustainable."
"The Council needs to be somewhat more flexible in this regard than it was in the past."
"We are also putting an emphasis on environmentally friendly goods vehicles."
"That means that we are also indicating a course of direction in this connection and, as has just been said, what we have introduced in this regard is not mandatory, with the result that those who favour the internalisation of costs are certainly not satisfied in that respect."
"I personally would also have liked this to have been mandatory in all Member States."
"We have had this debate so many times in this House."
"What do we want tomorrow?"
"Do we want 27 different charging systems, or do we want all the Member States to work to the same rules?"
"Or do we have to wait for further crises before we hear the call for action at European level again?"
"For me, the Eurovignette, too, makes one thing clear, namely, that only Europe brings the answer. Different charges in individual Member States do not."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there has been one major success story in this discussion, and that is the rapporteur."
"I really think that, with this dossier, the rapporteur had so much resistance to overcome and that he thus managed to extract the absolute maximum possible from this entire issue."
"The fact is that, in this House, there is not really a majority for a real greening of transport."
"The first thing you have to do, then, is cope with that."
"It is absolutely clear that there is currently a majority of transport ministers in the Council to whom environmental interests are of no concern."
"It is equally clear that there is a majority in the Council who do not care about those who live and work along roadways and that there is a majority in the Council who support consumers purchasing any old junk, that has been transported far and wide, rather than high quality regional products."
"Given that situation, I would say that the very best result has been achieved."
"First of all, we have the principle of external costs."
"That was a major step, a difficult step, facing all that resistance."
"We now have the ability, for the first time, to charge for exhaust gases. We have the ability to charge for noise."
"Of course, these are too limited and at far too low a level."
"If you look at the tables, this really is a drop in the ocean."
"It also proved possible to expand the corridors, so to speak, but we did not manage to put a tax on CO2."
"That is inexplicable."
"Transport is one of the largest producers of CO2 emissions in Europe and it is not charged for this."
"These points leave me really dissatisfied."
"That said, I endorse what has been said by other Members, who believe that we need to vote in favour of this, as otherwise, everything will go down the drain."
"I am voting in favour, with a heavy heart, and the thought that it is a good thing that we have come this far, but there must be much more progress in the future."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper, Commissioner Kallas sets out various possibilities for the future of transport."
"For instance, he describes how there is a need for incentive systems in order to give transport a more environmentally friendly form, and he also states that new sources of funding are needed, including, for example, in order to be able to work according to the 'polluter pays' principle."
"The Eurovignette Directive that we are debating today is one way that both of these points really can be achieved."
"This was a major Belgian effort, I believe we can say, begun under the Belgian Presidency of the Council with three important Belgians involved and, above all, because of the rapporteur, who succeeded in opening a door to the new routes."
"As it happens, I would have wished Belgium's major effort greater success than what we now have."
"What we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise."
"Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent - 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks - it is really far too little."
"All national transport policy representatives say that we need considerable resources in order to be able to sustain our infrastructure networks."
"It is self-evident that the resources collected in this area should also be able to be invested there."
"That is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied."
"The fact is that, in this connection, we have nonetheless taken a step in a direction in which we will be able to move further at a later date."
"That is also the reason why we intend to vote in favour of this compromise."
"It was a tough struggle, though. It very definitely could have been the case that we ended up with nothing at all on the table, since a few Member States would have preferred to have nothing at all."
"This is therefore a success, and it will have our backing in the vote today."
"(Applause)"
"(CS) Mr President, in the directive under discussion, the Commission has put forward the possibility of charging for external costs such as air pollution, noise and traffic congestion, based on an attempt to internalise external costs in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle."
"I support this principle because I consider it important from the perspective of the impact on the environment and human health, as well as the use of more methods of transport at national, regional and local levels."
"This is also in the interest of municipalities, which are often harmed by the negative impacts of transit traffic in particular."
"With regard to the continuing economic crisis and the increasing financial burden on transport operators, I also firmly believe that Member States should be given the option to spread out the introduction of charges for external costs over time, and according to individual types."
"The new system should also make it possible to replace obsolete fleets through the use of reduced rates for external costs when investing in environmentally friendly vehicles."
"(FR) Mr President, there is nothing to be pleased about today: a green transport system is still a long way off, as has been said."
"What is in this text?"
"What does it say?"
"Quite simply, it permits the Member States, on a voluntary basis, to use a 'polluter pays' system."
"Furthermore, the system is so restricted and so limited that, at the end of the day, the cost will only increase by around three to four cents."
"How can people think that a three or four cent mark-up will actually have an impact on modal shift?"
"In other words, it is not a great success from an environmental point of view."
"This is what this famous principle of internalisation of external costs has become, after being put through the Council mill - sorry, Mrs Győri - after so much resistance, and despite the considerable efforts of the rapporteur."
"Nevertheless, we shall vote for this principle because it is an important one."
"It is a principle like others - we spoke earlier about the precautionary principle, which has made its mark in the European directives."
"We shall vote for this principle."
"It is just one principle; a whole battle remains to be fought, and we will continue to fight it in order to effect a genuine modal shift and to establish a greener transport system that protects people's health and combats climate change more effectively."
"(NL) Mr President, the current proposal for the Eurovignette is based on the idea of Europe's efficient road transport system subsidising its inefficient railways."
"The most disconcerting fact, however, is probably that this Parliament sees this proposal as just a first step."
"It would be a first step, it should be noted, in the wrong direction that would mean that the Member States' current right to implement this legislation would become an obligation, that the charge per kilometre would only rise and, above all, that car drivers would soon be next."
"This Parliament talks of a single system among the Member States."
"However, adopting this proposal will mean that hauliers should get ready for a new box in the cabs of their lorries, with associated new taxes, of course."
"It is clear that, with this proposal, the European Parliament is strangling the life out of road transport as a result of the hysteria about the climate."
"The transport sector has it hard enough as it is, and is not expecting more taxes imposed by Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Kallas, first of all, I acknowledge and applaud the work accomplished by the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, who has done his utmost in searching for a possible compromise."
"Precisely because of that, I think we should go through the ritual procedure."
"This dossier should really have gone to conciliation, though, because the correlation tables were not included in the final agreement."
"That could have been an ideal opportunity to reach a comprehensive agreement."
"Unfortunately, as has already been pointed out, that is not a mere detail."
"The 'polluter pays' principle is right, valid and agreed upon and, to avoid any doubt, I am in favour of the greening of transport."
"However, this instrument - Eurovignette - is too partial and ineffective, as well as unfair."
"At a time of great economic difficulty such as we are experiencing now, the only purpose of this decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market is to make money, even if hardly any of this money is then used for transport infrastructure."
"In my view, a very complicated mechanism is being introduced, not least for calculating the amount to be charged."
"I am therefore critical of this dossier because I believe the way it penalises the geographically more peripheral Member States is unacceptable in this Europe of economic and territorial cohesion."
"The effectiveness of this instrument has not been demonstrated, and the modulation of transport flows creates problems for current and future financial planning because the charges are shifting and changing all the time."
"In this respect, I am told that the Member States are free to apply this extra charge or not."
"In the case of cross-border transport, however, we also depend on the decisions of others and so we need to reach an agreement."
"Therefore, I am convinced that an agreement reached at any price, at the expense of the haulage industry, cannot be considered a success."
"I really think there is still a very long way to go, especially as regards fair charging."
"(ES) Mr President, first of all, I would like to acknowledge the tenacity of the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, though I also have to say that from the beginning, I did point out the particular sophistry of the peripheral countries, with the scandalous lack of alternatives to the road - look at the continuous obstacles in the Pyrenees, between Spain and France, to establishing regular cross-border rail traffic."
"Now, moreover, - and I take advantage of the fact that Mr Kallas is here - the Commission is placing in doubt the future central crossing of the Pyrenees in the future core network."
"In other words, with these problems of a railway alternative, the truth is that the agreement on the Eurovignette is now imposing even greater burdens on the transportation of products by road, which, in the peripheral countries, particularly in the south and in the east, are products of little or limited added value."
"In creating at this precise time - as a rumour, shall we say - the problem of adding even a few centimes - four cents do not appear anything at all to Mrs Durant - right now, when we have just passed through the crisis, or are still in mid-crisis in the case of the cucumber, and due precisely to these irresponsible and false accusations which are without proof, they have dealt a brutal blow to thousands of Spanish families, not just farmers, but also hauliers, because just these few centimes, on thousands of kilometres and products like the Spanish cucumber, will generate a major problem in terms of transporting them to the central market, which is precisely where these accusations originate."
"No, Mr El Khadraoui, at the beginning, some initial accounts appeared, from which it was clear that, through the problems of the tax burden, there was an increase, and then they simply disappeared."
"I have always asked why those studies disappeared, but the truth is that it was worrying, so they have told us time and time again."
"Even so, I - and they also - would be prepared to make the sacrifice if the problems were to be resolved, important problems like congestion."
"However, in the current agreement, we have to say that the car does not seem to be included in the congestion."
"I am referring to major problems, such as the state of the infrastructure and the fact that things are improving, including in terms of reducing noise or other pollution."
"Even now, we know that it is not going to be possible because we do not have any alternatives at all to this."
"Therefore, the Spanish socialist delegation sees itself obliged to vote against this agreement."
"(FR) Mr President, two words sum up the general tone of our work and the mood in Parliament: 'finally' and, on the flip side, 'a bit of a shame'."
"'Finally' because, after very lengthy negotiations, we have reached a compromise and the 'polluter pays' principle is now genuinely beginning to take shape in this dossier."
"'A bit of a shame' because, even though the public finance situation in the Member States is complicated, we should have done everything in our power to reinvest the revenue collected for the benefit of, for example, trans-European transport network (TEN-T) priority projects."
"Mr Kallas, it will be up to the Commission to exercise close scrutiny."
"'A shame', also, because I personally regret this minimum agreement where the desire to ease congestion is concerned: although the proposed agreement retains the off-peak concept, the methods by which the Member States must implement it are 'weak'."
"The Commission must provide impetus on this issue as well."
"Thirdly, although the current directive stipulates that 3.5 tonne heavy goods vehicles must be included from 2012, we provide for the possibility of exempting them in the agreement."
"This is a harmful concession."
"Here too, Mr Kallas, it will be up to the Commission to play a key role."
"In short, although it is a modest compromise and a small step, it is a step nonetheless. We shall therefore vote for it."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Lichtenberger said that there are some reasonable ministers in the European Union's Member States."
"I would be grateful to her if she could give me their names, although I do realise it would be a very, very short list."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work, although it is good that we can debate it, because it does contain a number of things that are extremely controversial."
"Lorries are to pay more, which means that the owners of transport firms are to pay more."
"This is a problem for firms during a crisis, and we cannot pretend otherwise."
"The question is: how will the money be spent?"
"There is a real dilemma here, because if the money goes on yet more foolish projects of marginal groups, that will be a bad thing."
"It should be spent on the transport sector, on the development of transport, in which case the increases would be understandable."
"Otherwise, it is a kind of extortion, and this with the sanction of the European Union and the European Parliament's stamp of approval."
"I think this is something which really is controversial."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, transport in Europe is too cheap."
"Only environmentally friendly transport is too expensive."
"All of this is brought about by policy choices, and this directive will not change that."
"We have unfair competition."
"The tax privileges that heavy goods vehicles enjoy are not being curtailed."
"Every lorry causes 60 000 times as much damage as a car but, of course, it is not charged 60 000 times as much."
"We have had a mandatory rail toll within the European Union for decades."
"Every locomotive - whether it transports passengers or goods - must pay a rail toll for every kilometre it travels."
"On the roads, the toll is voluntary. It is capped."
"It mostly applies only on motorways and only to vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more."
"On the railways, there is no limit."
"That is unfair, and it hinders the environmentally friendly railways while relieving the environmentally unfriendly roads."
"We know that we need a change in mobility in order to protect the climate."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to protect the climate and secure mobility for the future, and that is why we need fair competition."
"This Eurovignette is only a tiny step forward towards that goal."
"Mr President, HGV haulage is integral to the supply process essential to a good economy."
"If added charges are levied across Europe, the extra cost is ultimately filtered to the consumer."
"The UK Government is looking into HGV charges to bring us in line with Europe by 2015."
"We do not have a network of toll roads, nor do we lay additional charges on heavy goods vehicles after road tax."
"We face unfair competition from an increasing number of foreign trucks taking up more than their fair share of cross-border haulage."
"Foreign operators pay nothing to use our roads but UK diesel duty is as much as 23 pence a litre higher, giving competitors a 15% advantage."
"However, under EU law, the UK cannot introduce a charge applicable only to foreign vehicles."
"If this directive expands its capabilities, any move by the UK Government to introduce HGV charges will be overshadowed by an unwanted indirect tax which the Commission also reserves the right to make obligatory in 2013."
"As the proposals relate to taxation, it should require unanimity at Council level, yet the legislation is being ushered in via the transport provision of Lisbon."
"It is an underhand way of introducing indirect taxation and should not be voted through by anybody with a democratic bone in their body."
"(FR) Mr President, in its Europe 2020 strategy, the European Union set itself the objective of making our economy greener and our transport more modern."
"All the European institutions, including the majority of our Parliament, have broadly supported this objective, as have almost all the Member States."
"It is a pity, then, that several Member States should have gone to great lengths, since 2008, to strip the proposal for a new Eurovignette directive of its content and to block this dossier."
"Today, however, thanks to the tenacity of our rapporteur - and I should like to pay tribute here to Mr El Khadraoui - and of the shadow rapporteurs in their negotiations with the Council, we have a compromise before us at long last."
"Admittedly, this text is far less ambitious than the initial proposal, but it will enable us for the first time to implement the 'polluter pays' principle and to internalise external transport costs such as noise and CO2 emissions."
"In order to ensure that this Eurovignette is not just a tax but actually helps improve transport in Europe, the Member States are also encouraged to reinvest the revenues they collect in the modernisation of transport modes."
"Parliament has also successfully ensured that real progress is made on the interoperability of toll systems and that stronger incentives are given to use less polluting heavy goods vehicles."
"In order to remain consistent with the policy objectives that our institution has set itself, I sincerely hope that we will be able to endorse this compromise that is being proposed to us at second reading and thus pave the way for a more sustainable transport policy."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at last we have something to be satisfied about: the toll charge for road transport, which is capped by this new Eurovignette Directive, may, in the future, include the costs of noise and air pollution."
"Another cause for satisfaction is that, with this report by Mr El Khadraoui - and I congratulate him on his tenacity - we are clearly expressing our desire to see the 'polluter pays' principle factored into the costs of road transport."
"We must remain vigilant, however: after three years of interinstitutional negotiations, we need to convince certain Member States that a policy for genuinely protecting the environment and an economic policy for successfully developing Europe's rail network are both achievable thanks to the balance struck in this trialogue."
"We must also ensure that part of the revenue collected is actually allocated to infrastructure and trans-European transport network projects as indicated."
"May I also say how sorry I am that the binding nature of the 'polluter pays' principle has been left out of this compromise."
"Leaving aside our rapporteur Mr El Khadraoui's tenacity, on which I congratulated him, Commissioner, the European Commission has once again lost the fight to certain nationalist positions and sentiments."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to say a big thank you to the rapporteur for his excellent work on a very difficult subject."
"As many people have pointed out, the new rules merely contain calls for the Member States to use the revenue they receive to improve the environment and it is therefore important, just as Mr Sterckx said, that we here in the European Parliament continually remind our governments of the importance of following these recommendations."
"The intention is clearly not that our drivers and hauliers should pay for the noise and environmental impact if we do not, at the same time, introduce measures aimed at solving the problems, such as road treatment and other noise-attenuation measures."
"It is very important to prevent these charges simply becoming a new tax on heavy goods vehicles, as some Members here have pointed out."
"We must continue to work to improve the environment and reduce carbon dioxide levels in Europe, and it is therefore of central importance that we ensure that environmental charges are genuinely used to reduce and eliminate the environmental problems that arise."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, with the decision on the Eurovignette, Europe is taking a step in the right direction in order to be able to apply the 'polluter pays' principle to road transport."
"Ultimately, we now have the agreement to pass on the costs for the use of infrastructure, for noise and for air pollution to the carrier."
"I hope that many EU Member States will adopt this system, including the Netherlands."
"The Rutte government in the Netherlands is sensibly planning to pull 'paying for mobility in a different way' out of the hat."
"Those plans fit in well with today's agreement."
"I hope that the Commission will bring forward proposals to also charge these costs to other means of transport in a phased manner."
"Of course, in so doing, account must be taken of the specific properties of each sector."
"Thus, inland shipping is not the only user of river water, something that is abundantly clear during these days of extreme drought."
"Agriculture, after all, currently has its sprinklers wide open."
"However, we have now taken an important step forwards and we need to push on even further."
"(ES) Mr President, it is no coincidence that Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and other countries are all reluctant to accept the so-called Eurovignette."
"This common critical stance stems from our position as peripheral countries since, at the end of the day, it will be us who will pay this quite singular levy and the Member States enjoying a geographical location in the centre of the European Union who will collect it."
"The reasoning that underlies the Eurovignette is beset by major contradictions and the discourse that supports it becomes weaker every day."
"Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion, just as the old 'polluter pays' principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way."
"In addition to this, ladies and gentlemen, only 15% of the funds collected through the Eurovignette - which was conceived as a funding source for infrastructures - will finally be used to fund trans-European networks, and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation."
"Thus, finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries, within the wide sphere of infrastructures."
"The ultimate result will be yet another setback for road freight transport, which, the way things stand today, is the only means enabling the operation of the Internal Market."
"This is reality, ladies and gentlemen, a reality that is a lot starker in the context of an economic crisis."
"If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs."
"Lastly, the food crisis, which has recklessly been blamed on Spanish products, has led to unfair penalties and huge losses for those penalised by the Eurovignette: freight carriers and prime crop farmers."
"It is for all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, that the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party shall vote against this draft directive."
"(EL) Mr President, the general principle introduced in the directive on goods transport, by which I mean the internalisation of external costs, is very basic and of symbolic importance."
"This is a modern and, at the same time, flexible framework for the application of the 'polluter pays' principle and a tool to moderate the congestion problems on major national motorways."
"That is precisely why the concerns expressed by many speakers about the imbalance in terms of the repercussions of its application in the regions of the Union and in the road transport sector - some of which are justified - need to be overcome."
"The aim of the compromise text, which is due in large part to Mr El Khadraoui, is to achieve gradual application of the charges in question, so that it is accompanied by gradual renewal of the European fleet."
"However, the way to overcome the objections and to pave the way for the acceptance and efficacy of the framework of the Eurovignette is to ensure, firstly, that the directive is applied strictly, transparently and quickly to all the Member States and, secondly, that all the revenue is channelled, as contributory resources, to transport infrastructures and is not used to plug well-publicised gaps."
"(DE) Mr President, as we all know, this directive is a compromise."
"However, it is, without doubt, also a good compromise, as it accommodates both sides, at least to a certain extent - both the carriers and the citizens, who have to suffer the noise and the exhaust gases."
"What are the advantages of this directive? For me, there are three."
"Firstly, there is the earmarking of the revenue from road charges for investment in improved transport infrastructure, which is in the public economic interest and provides increased safety and better transport routes."
"Secondly, there is the standardisation of collection, which lowers costs and prevents traffic congestion."
"Thirdly - and very importantly - there is the fact that it gives the Member States the ability and the freedom to factor costs such as noise and pollutant emissions into their road charges at a future point."
"These, then, are control mechanisms."
"Those who steer clear of rush hours and traffic jams will pay less and those who drive clean and quiet goods vehicles will enjoy lower costs."
"I hope that these incentives will mean that, in future, traffic jams will be avoided and goods vehicle fleets will be renewed."
"All in all, we are aware that not all wishes could be satisfied in the negotiations, but these positive aspects that we were able to achieve in the negotiations thanks to Parliament's strength should lead to the desired positive effects."
"I also hope that there is not too much bureaucracy in the implementation, as that would harm the whole."
"(RO) Mr President, the inclusion of a charge based on external costs in the toll charge allows Member States to introduce it for using the trans-European road network, or certain sections of it, as well as any other additional sections of their own motorways which are not part of the trans-European road network."
"We do not support the deliberate introduction of tariff barriers which will increase the costs of transport operators from peripheral Member States and, by extension, the prices of the products transported."
"Although the directive should not allow discrimination based on the haulier's nationality, Article 7k permits Member States which introduce a system for charging tolls and/or users of the infrastructure to offer suitable compensation for these charges, which may distort competition."
"I think that the income generated from the charge on users of the infrastructure and from the charge based on external costs must be used to support the trans-European road network, improve road safety and provide safe parking areas, which are an absolute necessity for compliance with the applicable social legislation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on the need to make goods transport more sustainable, but this result is achieved mainly by investing in infrastructure and gradually renewing the existing fleet."
"In reality, behind the environmentalist spirit of Eurovignette and the 'polluter pays' principle lies a major competitive disadvantage for some countries compared with others, with serious repercussions not only on their section of the haulage industry, which is, to a great extent, made up of small and medium-sized enterprises, but also on their national systems."
"All that will happen without the mandatory reallocation of sufficient resources to improve transport infrastructure and the efficiency and environmental performance of the haulage industry, something that should be an essential outcome of this directive."
"The negotiations have led to a few minor positive results - I am thinking of interoperability and mini-hire marketing in mountain areas - but the overall outcome is unsatisfactory."
"I think a possible conciliation procedure would be the best way to smooth off the sharp edges that still remain unresolved."
"Mr President, the proposed directive might be the last straw to break the back of the British road haulage industry."
"The industry has been declining steadily over the last decade. Drivers with operating licences have fallen by 8% in the last three years."
"Foreign lorries now control 80% of cross-Channel business."
"In the last decade, 20% of domestic business has been lost to foreign hauliers."
"There is a large and growing resident population of foreign hauliers using foreign vehicles and paying only their own countries' modest vehicle charges who are taking more and more domestic business."
"It might appear that British hauliers are simply losing business as the result of competition, a favourite word in the EU lexicon."
"However, the competition is not fair competition."
"The British road fund licence is much greater and fuel tax exceeds that of other countries."
"Foreign hauliers work in the UK on fuel brought with them in 1 000-litre tanks. Whilst the proposed charges will apply to all vehicles, the burden on the British industry could be fatal."
"This directive must be resisted."
"(DE) Mr President, it is beyond doubt that the Internal Market is one of the major achievements of our Union and that efficient transport structures are part of that."
"However, I personally live on a stretch across which over 50 million tonnes of goods a year are transported, and I believe that, alongside people's right to efficient transport, there is also a right for those living alongside to be protected from the impact and effects of this transport."
"This proposal is therefore certainly a small step in the right direction if it is used in such a way that investments are made to improve noise protection, provide modern heavy goods vehicles and, above all, to bring about modern rail networks and modern rolling stock."
"It is also a positive thing that a supplemental rate can be charged in mountainous areas."
"I do find it particularly questionable, however, that we are planning to proceed in this area according to the principle of voluntary action, in other words, such that, as before, States that do not wish to be involved in this Eurovignette simply do not have to implement it."
"That will not only lead to discrimination within Europe but it is also extremely questionable with regard to the impact on the people."
"Mr President, the general trend of this proposal is positive because we are in an era where we have to tackle climate change, etc. in every possible area; all methods which lead to pollution have to be dealt with."
"Certainly, the focus on the heavy goods vehicles makes sense regarding the use of tolls, etc."
"The one point which we need to expand on in particular is that we should be able to develop technology that produces engines that require less and less fuel, in other words, that travel more and more miles for fewer miles to the gallon."
"Certainly that is one area where much research needs to be done; many efficiencies could be made, not just for heavy goods vehicles, but also for all other vehicles."
"That is something which is not being mentioned and promoted and researched enough."
"(FR) Mr President, the fact that the taxation of road freight transport and the Eurovignette have finally been addressed is, in itself, good news for all Europeans."
"That said, we still have a long way to go before road freight transport bears a reasonable proportion of the costs it represents for our societies: wear and tear of infrastructure, pollution, public health and accidents."
"As someone who lives in a city through which millions of heavy goods vehicles pass each year, I can confirm that the suffering of the populations concerned is rarely taken into account."
"Then there are the issues that no one wants to address in this House: the very low wages paid to drivers, the terrible working conditions and the unacceptable driving times that compromise everyone's safety."
"It is no exaggeration to talk about slaves of the road."
"So yes, it is necessary to impose a maximum rate of taxation in order to encourage short journeys, piggyback transport, maritime transport and inland navigation, and it is necessary to make the entire Union and its neighbourhood strive for the best possible social conditions."
"However, it is important to have intelligent taxation, so that the ones paying are not transport SMEs, drivers and still less consumers, but large shippers and major customers such as the large-scale distribution sector."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank honourable Members very much for their comments and I would like to make some remarks."
"Firstly, Eurovignette is not a European tax."
"This must be made very clear."
"In that sense, it is a bad name."
"On the contrary, it is a directive which limits and regulates national charges."
"We have 22 countries with different tolls and charges for different types of vehicles - heavy vehicles and private cars."
"All users from different countries pay these tolls if they appear on this network."
"Secondly, please accept the compromise."
"This is much bigger and more complicated than it looks."
"There are two fundamental continuing fights behind this."
"The first is a fight about principle - who should pay for the use of infrastructures and what specifically they should pay for."
"So it is going in the right direction."
"The 'user pays' and 'polluter pays' principle will inevitably continue."
"This is the direction that things are going."
"The second fight is much more continuous and sharper."
"It is a conflict between the countries which have heavy transit traffic, which, of course, want more flexibility to address problems with their infrastructure, and clearly want to share the burden for the use of infrastructure between taxpayers and all users - I stress all users: there cannot be any discrimination."
"Of course, there is a group of countries who are fiercely against it."
"This was also very visible here during the debate."
"I must just remind you that on 15 October, the Council agreed on the political compromise."
"It was just short of a blocking minority and the fight continues here now."
"Mr El Khadraoui has done tremendous work to reach a good compromise and to have a good proposal for this compromise."
"I sincerely ask you to please support this compromise."
"It appears to have a lot of details that are not satisfactory in different parts and to different people but it is a really big step."
"This issue has been up in the air for years and years. Now we are taking a step forward."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you for this valuable debate, which included a great number of arguments and counterarguments."
"This also shows, as the Commissioner has also mentioned, that a compromise has been reached."
"After great difficulties, problems and struggles of course, I am nevertheless convinced that this is a European success, as has already been mentioned by Mr Leichtfried."
"Thank you also for the appreciation expressed to the Hungarian Presidency."
"As with every other compromise, a serious balancing act was carried out."
"We had to balance environmental and economic sustainability."
"I reject the notion that the Council did not attach any importance to environmental protection."
"Had it not been important, this directive would not exist."
"We also had to create a balance - and I would like to say this to Mr De Grandes Pascual as well - between the centre and the periphery."
"It is true that heated debates took place in the Council on the best ways to ensure that peripheral Member States do not feel locked out, and eventually a qualified majority was formed in the Council, and I hope - and I believe that the discussion has shown this as well - in Parliament, too."
"We could say that this is just a drop in the ocean, but I believe - and I am happy that this has been acknowledged by many during the debate - that we have made an extremely important first step towards internalising costs and re-circulating revenues into the sector, even if, as with every compromise, it is not the most perfect one, and I am certain that we will be able to take further steps in the following years."
"I would like to mention three specific issues which attracted several questions."
"The first one is the utilisation of revenues, and I would like to return to the comment made by Mr Sterckx. The agreement contains a detailed recommendation for Member States, precisely with respect to the utilisation of revenues, and states, inter alia, that 15% of generated revenues - and I emphasise this for Mrs Meissner in particular - should be used to finance trans-European transport projects."
"I would also like to add that this is the result of an adequate compromise and, as Mr Dirk Sterckx has also mentioned, a good and adequate one, although perhaps only a first step in the right direction."
"The second specific question was also asked by Mr Sterckx, with respect to showing the costs of traffic jams and congestion."
"Well, the agreement reached with the European Parliament extends to this problem as well, since it makes it possible for Member States to determine road usage charges in a differentiated manner on the basis of location and time."
"As you all know, Member States have the opportunity to levy higher infrastructure charges during peak periods."
"This increased differentiation of infrastructure charges gives us an alternative for fighting traffic congestion, and even if we only include air and noise pollution in the calculation of external costs, the differentiation mechanism introduced in the directive can still make an efficient contribution to the reduction of traffic jams typical of European roads."
"Finally, I would like to address your third question, specifically the question posed by Ms Lichtenberger concerning the external charges."
"The Council has already adopted its first-reading position on 14 February of this year, and we subsequently inserted a provision in the directive at the request of Parliament, to the effect that we will give a political signal to citizens concerning the environmental characteristics of heavy goods vehicles."
"To this end, we have included the possibility that in addition to the surcharge applied in mountainous regions, an external charge can be added in the case of Euro 0, 1, 2 and 3 vehicles."
"Since Euro 3 vehicles are less polluting than the other most polluting vehicles in the Euro emission categories, the double charge system will apply to them only from a later date, while it will already be applicable to the other categories from the effective date of the directive."
"Furthermore, the agreement reached with the European Parliament also provides incentives in respect of the least polluting vehicles in the Euro 5 and 6 categories, in order to promote the renewal of the vehicle fleet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become very clear from our debate today that we have made an extremely important step forward for the transport sector with the Eurovignette Directive."
"The specific recommendation regarding heavy goods vehicles is important not only in itself, but it also carries a symbolic significance."
"It is the first to apply - and I am glad that you have confirmed this in your comments - the 'polluter pays' principle, and launches a lengthy debate and implementation process, which leads to the internalisation of the external costs of all transportation methods."
"Mr President, the Hungarian Presidency is very pleased that this agreement was reached with the European Parliament, and I am sure that the measure debated now and awaiting adoption by Parliament can lead to an increase in economic efficiency and a decrease in the negative environmental impacts in the transport sector, and that as a result, European Union citizens will be the winners of this directive being adopted."
"Mr President, I thank each and every one of you for your expressions of support and your comments, and that includes those who opposed the report, by the way."
"The transport sector is important for our economy."
"It does, however, also give rise to costs - infrastructure costs, but also other costs such as fine particulates in the air, noise, traffic jams and so on."
"With this revised directive, we will finally be creating a European framework that gives the Member States the opportunity to get the costs partly paid back by those who actually gave rise to them."
"At the same time, this method also enables the Member States to generate resources to reinvest in the transport system in order to make it more sustainable so as to actually reduce these external costs."
"In this way, we can make our society more liveable, increase the efficiency of the sector and also contribute to a more level playing field between the different modes of transport, so as, in so doing, to also provide greater opportunities for the railways and inland waterways."
"I stressed earlier on, in my introduction, how difficult it was to reach this compromise."
"The aim in the Commission's White Paper, by the way, is to achieve the mandatory internalisation of external costs by 2020."
"That promises heated discussions over the next few years."
"In the meanwhile, I hope, first of all, that this plenary grants sufficient support to enable us to get going and to demonstrate that Europe can also take decisions that are good for our citizens."
"Secondly, I hope that a number of Member States will now really get on with making use of the new opportunities and will also be able to tempt other Member States to join in on the strength of their good results."
"That will enable us to build a wider support base to also go further."
"In the meantime, this directive provides the Commission with an awful lot of homework to be getting on with. Over the forthcoming years, the ideas of also internalising other external costs, making internalisation mandatory and including other types of vehicles, also need to be looked into."
"These are things for the forthcoming years, however."
"We must first take this step forwards."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I think completion of the work today at second reading on the directive on charging heavy goods vehicles - the Eurovignette Directive - is extremely important."
"The basic and most important issue is the provision which establishes the 'polluter pays' principle, according to which heavy goods vehicles which cause more pollution and are noisier than those fitted with engines which comply with the Euro V or Euro VI standards will be subject to tolls for using road infrastructure."
"In addition, allowance has been made for the possibility of a certain dependence of tolls on vehicle movement (road congestion) at peak hours - for a maximum, however, of five hours a day."
"I think that this solution will successfully encourage avoidance of the use of some sections of road during peak hours."
"Furthermore, the Member States will be able to specify the use to be made of revenue generated from tolls collected, but at least 15% will have to be used for financial support for TEN-T projects, in order to increase transport sustainability."
"I am delighted to say that the Eurovignette Directive has reached the end of its second reading."
"This report introduces the key phrase 'the polluter pays', which means that the change to the rules on road transport tolls will allow us to add the real costs of air and noise pollution by lorries to the taxes and fees collected when heavy goods vehicles use motorways."
"In addition, the directive stipulates that money collected in this way should be used to finance effective and environmentally friendly transport systems."
"At the same time, 15% of the fees collected must be invested in pan-European transport networks: not just road transport, but also rail and inland waterway transport."
"Although the directive will apply to all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, I think that this provision goes too far, because such vehicles mainly operate regionally, and this should not be regulated at European level."
"At the same time, a Member State has the right to exempt vehicles under 12 tonnes, an option which I hope Estonia will use."
"Speaking of Estonia, I think that this directive will bring to an end the situation in which our lorries pay in other countries, while vehicles from other countries do not pay to drive on our roads."
"I hope that the government will put an end to this type of unequal treatment and set equal conditions for all."
"The directive also provides an incentive for fleet renewal: the newer and lower-polluting the vehicle, the less tax it must pay."
"This requires large investments from transport companies, which will actually pay off relatively quickly, both in terms of lower road tax and in terms of lower fuel consumption."
"The revision of the Eurovignette Directive is crucial in order to integrate more effectively the cost of pollution caused by road transport, something which will now be possible thanks to the opportunity for the Member States to take into account air and noise pollution, as well as congestion of certain routes, when setting toll charges for heavy goods vehicles."
"In regions such as mine, where international freight vehicles clog the Alpine roads, this is a long-awaited measure."
"This revision is also a first step towards the reintroduction of fair competition between European road hauliers, since some Member States, such as France and Germany, already apply the 'polluter pays' principle and want the EU to extend it to all the others."
"What matters now is that the revenue from the Eurovignette actually goes towards projects to improve infrastructure, cut pollution and protect the environment."
"I therefore welcome the Member States' undertaking to reassign part of this revenue to the TEN-T, a major project designed to guarantee Europe's territorial cohesion and to improve access in regions such as those of the Alps, where the infrastructure is not sufficient to ensure a modal shift from road transport to other forms of transport."
"I am convinced that the European Union needs harmonised guidelines which enable Member States to make charges for external costs created by the road transport sector."
"However, we must remember that transport firms, particularly during a crisis, will not be able to afford to change their fleets quickly and buy vehicles which comply with the Euro V and VI standards."
"We cannot, therefore, punish hauliers for external factors over which they have no influence."
"In my opinion, we need to try to achieve a maximum extension of the period during which incentives apply to the ecologically cleanest vehicles."
"Transport firms which invest in low-emission technologies must have the right to an appropriate period during which their investments are guaranteed, when they would pay the lowest charges or be exempt."
"Finally, we very often emphasise in Parliament that people are the most important."
"Let us remember, therefore, that the transport sector around the Union not only represents excessive noise or CO2 emissions but also represents, above all, hundreds of thousands of jobs and an important component of GDP in many Member States."

"Above all, the proposed candidate has political experience, and also auditing and financial experience, although the latter is perhaps not as strong as might be hoped."
"I am voting in favour of this candidate, but I believe that more thought needs to be given to the type of qualifications that Members of the Court of Auditors ought to have."
"I supported the nomination of Hans Gustaf Wessberg as a Member of the Court of Auditors because he has over 30 years of professional experience of high level management in public institutions as well as private enterprises in Sweden."
"A large part of his career has been devoted to improving conditions for private enterprises in Sweden, as manager in organisations representing industry interests in public life."
"He also has extensive experience of public service, as both a politician and civil servant."
"He has served as director general of the Swedish Companies Registration Office, an independent government agency, and as state secretary on several occasions."
"That is why I am convinced that he has the qualities required for this post."
"The curriculum vitae submitted by H.G. Wessberg for his nomination as a member of the Court of Auditors shows skills and experience that are certainly in line with the technical and scientific standards required by the position."
"In particular, Mr Wessberg's commitment to the private-sector business fabric makes the candidate particularly suited to ensuring the balance between EU law and the specific demands of both the market and the people of Europe."
"I therefore voted in favour of this proposal for a European Parliament decision."
"in writing. - I voted for Sweden's nomination of H.G. Wessberg to join the European Court of Auditors and replace Lars Heikensten."
"When the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed Mr Wessberg on 24 May 2011, MEPs praised his past performance in both the private and public sectors."
"Once appointed, H.G. Wessberg will serve until the end of Sweden's mandate, that is until March 2012, and could then be re-elected for another mandate of six years."
"I wish him all the best in his new role."
"I wish Mr Wessberg every success in the important office for which he has been chosen, and I am convinced that he will carry out the functions for which he has now been appointed with complete dedication and competence."
"As expected, the hearing of the Swedish candidate for membership of the Court of Auditors was unproblematic."
"As was evident later in the vote, the final result was marginally in favour of the candidate."
"He has ministerial experience, as well as experience of working in the private sector."
"He has also worked in the area of defence, has handled finances and budgets at a high level and was also a supporter of Swedish membership of the EU."
"in writing. - I voted to support Sweden's nomination of H.G. Wessberg to join the European Court."
"Mr Wessberg will replace Lars Heikensten, who left to become executive director of the Nobel Foundation."
"Mr Wessberg will take up his duties following his formal appointment by the Council of Ministers, scheduled for Friday, 10 June 2011."
"The Court of Auditors is an institution that inspects the European Union's income and outgoings in order to verify their legality, as well as verifying good financial management."
"It operates in complete independence."
"In this spirit, the nomination of the individuals of which it is composed must be governed by capability and independence criteria."
"Mr Wessberg, from Sweden, has submitted his curriculum vitae, completed a written questionnaire and has been interviewed by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"He has argued his case well enough to justify his appointment to the Court of Auditors, and to perform his duties capably and independently."
"in writing. - The European Parliament,"
"having regard to Article 286(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, pursuant to which the Council consulted Parliament (C7-0103/2011), having regard to the fact that at its meeting of 24 May 2011 the Committee on Budgetary Control heard the Council's nominee for membership of the Court of Auditors, having regard to Rule 108 of its Rules of Procedure, having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control,"
"whereas H.G. Wessberg fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 286(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU,"
"delivers a favourable opinion on the nomination of H.G. Wessberg as a Member of the Court of Auditors; instructs its President to forward this decision to the Council and, for information, the Court of Auditors, the other institutions of the European Union and the audit institutions of the Member States."
"I voted against because I think that it is possible to find a more suitable person for the position offered, from a professional point of view."
"I voted in favour of the report on the nomination of Mr Wessberg as member of the Court of Auditors."
"My decision is based on all of the information presented for this choice, including his responses to the questionnaire for candidates for membership of the Court of Auditors, annexed to this report, as they indicate compliance with the criteria laid down in Article 286(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the need for members of the Court of Auditors to be fully independent."
"I therefore welcome the nomination of Mr Wessberg."
"I voted for this report because I believe the Court of Auditors may benefit from Mr Wessberg's experience in the financial management of institutions."
"The candidate fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 286(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and his curriculum vitae shows a series of high-level positions in financial management and budgetary control in public institutions and private enterprises."
"The candidate's answers to the questionnaire show that he is serious and highly motivated."
"in writing. - I was pleased to support the Swedish candidate for the Court of Auditors."
"Bearing in mind that the accusations date back to 2004, which means that they were made before Mrs Hankiss became a Member of this House, I am voting in favour of waiving her parliamentary immunity."
"I support the rapporteur's recommendation to waive Mrs Hankiss's immunity in the case in question."
"The case pending against her has its origins in an incident dating back to early 2004, when she was not yet a Member of the European Parliament."
"Evidently, therefore, the rules of procedure concerning parliamentary immunity and privilege cannot apply, and so waiving her immunity complies with the rules governing this House's institutional and legal affairs."
"The Central District Court in Buda, Budapest is asking the European Parliament to lift the immunity of MEP Ágnes Hankiss in connection with renewed criminal proceedings."
"Ágnes Hankiss was accused by a private plaintiff of allegedly committing the crime of public defamation and, in particular, the crime of defaming the memory of a dead person, the plaintiff's father."
"On the basis of the facts as stated, and in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I think it would be appropriate to recommend lifting immunity in this case."
"Mrs Wallis claims that the same principles are always applied by the European Parliament with regard to the waiver of the immunity of its Members."
"That is a cynical lie."
"In a case concerning me personally, the Court of Justice ruled in 2010 that Parliament had violated my rights as an MEP - and it violated them again last month, on exactly the same grounds!"
"For her to say that an MEP's immunity should be waived because the comments for which he or she is being criticised did not come within the scope of his or her parliamentary activities is absolute nonsense from a legal point of view."
"If that had been the case, legal action would not have been possible!"
"This is the basis of the current Article 8."
"By definition, Article 9 applies to activities beyond the scope of this Parliament!"
"Parliament now preserves or waives immunity according to how it feels: it waives it for political opinions in one case, but preserves it for suspected tax evasion in another, considering it an example of fumus persecutionis."
"As I am more strongly attached to freedom of expression than the pseudo democrats in this House, I shall systematically refuse to waive the immunity of one of my fellow Members, from whichever political group, for the expression of his or her opinions, no matter how much they differ from my own."
"The responsible committee recommends (unanimously) waiving parliamentary immunity because the Central District Court of Buda, Budapest, is asking the European Parliament to waive the immunity of its Member, Ágnes Hankiss, in connection with renewed criminal proceedings ordered by the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hungary given on 12 November 2009."
"Ágnes Hankiss is accused by a private plaintiff of an alleged offence of defamation of honour committed in public (Section 179 of the Hungarian Criminal Code) and, in particular the defamation of the memory of a dead person, the plaintiff's father, under Section 181 of the Hungarian Criminal Code, as a result of a statement made during the programme 'Péntek 8 mondatvadász' on 23 January 2004."
"On 12 November 2009, the Supreme Court considered that there was indeed a violation of the substantive provisions of criminal law and ordered a renewed procedure to be conducted by the Central District Court of Buda."
"The court is to conduct this renewed procedure in light of considerations stated in the decision of the Supreme Court."
"The Central District Court of Buda opened renewed proceedings on 31 March 2010."
"On the same day, the proceedings were suspended on the grounds that Ágnes Hankiss enjoys parliamentary immunity as a Member of the European Parliament."
"The relevant request for the waiver of that immunity was made by the Court on 6 July 2010."
"in writing. - I voted to waive the parliamentary immunity of Ágnes Hankiss, accused of defamation."
"Ms Hankiss's immunity was lifted because the events in question took place in 2004, before she was elected to the European Parliament (in July 2009), and because the case does not concern her political activities as an MEP."
"Parliamentary immunity does not cover ordinary criminal cases."
"Ágnes Hankiss can be tried without her parliamentary activities being called into question."
"I voted to waive her immunity."
"in writing. - Since Ágnes Hankiss is accused of alleged defamation under Section 181 of the Hungarian Criminal Code, as a result of a statement made during a programme on 23 January 2004, I voted in favour."
"At the sitting of 6 September 2010, the President announced that he had received a letter sent by the Central District Court of Budapest on 6 July 2010 requesting the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Hankiss, pursuant to Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The President referred the request to the Committee on Legal Affairs pursuant to the same Rule."
"The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which was voted for unanimously, concluded that the present case does not come within the scope of the political activities of Mrs Hankiss as a Member of this House."
"It concerns instead a statement made in 2004, long before she was elected a Member of this House."
"The rapporteur has also found no evidence of fumus persecutionis: that is, a sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the case has been brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member."
"I therefore support the proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and voted in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Hankiss."
"On 6 July 2010, the Central District Court of Buda sent a request to waive the immunity of Ágnes Hankiss in connection with renewed criminal proceedings ordered by a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hungary in 2009."
"On 23 January 2004, following a statement made during a programme, Mrs Hankiss was accused of an alleged offence of defamation of honour committed in public and, in particular, of defamation of the memory of a dead person."
"In an appeal hearing on 25 March 2009, the Budapest Municipal Court acquitted Mrs Hankiss of the charges, but, on 12 November 2009, the Hungarian Supreme Court ordered a renewed procedure to be conducted by the Central District Court of Buda."
"The renewed proceedings were opened on 31 March 2010 and suspended the same day because of Mrs Hankiss's parliamentary immunity."
"For these reasons, and because the case does not come within the scope of Mrs Hankiss's political activities as a Member of the European Parliament, since it concerns a statement made long before she was elected a Member, I am voting in favour of waiving her parliamentary immunity."
"in writing. - In favour."
"The case relates to an alleged offence of defamation which does not come within the scope of Ms Hankiss' political activities as an MEP, but relates instead to a statement made in 2004, before she was elected an MEP."
"The rapporteur has also found no evidence of fumus persecutionis."
"I am voting in favour of this report as it covers the Commission's objectives of simplifying the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of textile products."
"Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 and Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, which were initially adopted in order to implement trade policy measures in the textile sector, have now become obsolete instruments that constrain the free market and are poorly adapted to changes in the new regulatory environment."
"Until recently, quantitative restrictions on imports originating in World Trade Organisation (WTO) member countries were in force, together with special safeguard provisions for textile products from the People's Republic of China."
"Those restrictions were eliminated with the expiry of the WTO agreement in 2005, as were the provisions for China in 2008."
"Therefore, the only effective method of preventing distortions in the market and continuing to control textile imports is still to subject such imports to verification procedures that require indication of the country of origin."
"That indication is, in fact, contained in the proposal for a regulation on 'Made in' origin marking, which was adopted in this Chamber on 21 October 2010, which introduces a control mechanism and aims to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better, clearer legislative framework for companies and for consumer protection."
"I voted in favour of this document, repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature and released for free circulation in the Community, and on the conditions for the acceptance of such proof and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries."
"In 2005, the World Trade Organisation repealed the restrictions on imports originating in Member States, and the European Union should also simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Community."
"I believe that the amendments mentioned will ensure the uniformity of the rules for import and will align the rules relating to imports of textiles with those for other industrial goods, which should improve the overall consistency of the legislative environment in this area."
"I supported the Zahradil report because I think that Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products has served its purpose."
"The 1998 Council Regulation introduced instruments for controlling the import of textile products, which enabled the WTO Agreement to be implemented."
"With the expiry of the WTO Agreement in 2005 and of the special safeguard measures in 2008, the Council Regulation served its purpose, while the import restriction measures it imposed can be managed using other instruments."
"Although repealing these regulations might appear to be a positive and welcome step from the standpoint of legislative simplification, it would, on the other hand, mean depriving our textile industry of still valid forms of defence against unfair competition from countries like China."
"The rapporteur's arguments that future legislation on 'Made in' origin marking and new World Trade Organisation agreements will soon be a good solution to the problem of defending our industry do not appear to stand up: we are still waiting for the Council to respond regarding origin marking, but it does not seem to have any intention of endorsing a regulation that this House adopted last autumn by an overwhelming majority."
"It would certainly appear to be wiser to wait until there is a clear legislative framework governing future imports of certain textile products from the Far East before we start repealing the old laws."
"I have therefore voted against the report."
"I voted in favour of this report because its primary aim is to repeal the EU regulation currently in force, laying down additional requirements proving the origin of textile products imported into the EU, thus simplifying the legislation in force and creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses."
"Until the World Trade Organisation (WTO) repealed restrictions on imports of textile products from China in 2008, the EU really needed a legislative instrument for regulating trade with third countries and protecting the EU Internal Market and its manufacturers."
"However, such complicated administrative procedures are now no longer proportionate, particularly as another EU regulation imposes an obligation to indicate a product's country of origin in customs documents before it is released for free circulation in the EU market, and consumer protection is also currently being enhanced in the EU by increasing the amount of information provided to consumers."
"I am in favour of repealing the Council regulation on proof of origin for certain textile products as I believe that efforts need to be made to simplify the existing legislation in order to create a clearer legislative environment for businesses."
"I should, however, add that I consider it important to maintain alternative controlling mechanisms for imports of such products into the EU, in order to avoid market disruption caused by increases in such imports."
"My nature is to be in favour of less red tape and of administrative simplification."
"When it comes to resolving anachronisms, I am all for it."
"That is the case here."
"In fact, the existence of unnecessary administrative burdens, as was the case with proof of origin for certain textile products in cases where there are no quantitative restrictions on the importing of these products to Europe, or in cases where there is a need to present an import authorisation, only impedes the easy flow of international trade that is our intention."
"That said, and although it is not directly related to this measure, I would also like to highlight the importance of maintaining the status quo in terms of the current World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, particularly as regards the world market for textiles and clothing, very specifically, the changes to the rules on importing textiles and clothing products into the EU at a time of severe economic downturn in various Member States."
"I voted for this report because I believe the Commission proposal contributes to reducing excessive administrative burdens and additional costs for companies by making rules on importing certain textile products more uniform."
"The repeal of Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 is intended to remove the burden on importers of presenting proofs of origin for certain products."
"Since these products can be freely imported, proving their origin is apparently unnecessary, but there are still some doubts about this facilitating measure."
"I cannot fail to stress the need to ensure the quality of products sold within Europe and to guarantee the safety of those who use them."
"Beyond simply knowing the origin of textile products from outside the Union, it is essential to ensure that European standards are met, and to not allow raw materials and processed products to enter and be sold in the Union without meeting the minimum conditions."
"I also believe that more important than ascertaining the type of products used in the manufacture of textile products is to assess whether these are in compliance with competition rules and respect for workers' dignity and rights, as cases where these are violated are on the increase."
"This has unacceptable consequences for the workers themselves and for the viability of the European textile sector, particularly in Portugal, which has been forced to compete with producers that systematically fail to observe such rules and rights."
"This report concerns a proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products, and on the conditions for the acceptance of such proof, and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries."
"The changes that have now been introduced into the regulatory environment allow trade policy measures to be improved, especially following the surge in imports from the People's Republic of China, by introducing control instruments for imports of textile products from third countries."
"I voted in favour of this report because, by significantly improving the information given to consumers, it will allow informed and responsible choices to be made by all citizens of the Member States, and will allow them to opt for products that are made in the EU."
"The Commission proposal, which is adopted by this report, is aimed at simplifying the customs formalities followed by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Union."
"To this end, it proposes repealing the conditions of acceptance of proofs of origin for certain textiles and textile articles originating in third countries."
"The list of products covered is extensive, comprising: silk; wool; cotton; other vegetable textile fibres; man-made or artificial filaments; felt and non-woven materials; carpets and other textile floor coverings; special woven fabrics, lace, upholstery and embroidery; knitted or crocheted fabrics; articles of apparel and clothing accessories; and many others."
"The consequences of liberalising the international textiles trade are known all too well in countries like Portugal, with the elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports and special safeguard provisions."
"This proposal, which is in line with previous measures, aims to make the lives of major European importers, which are its main beneficiaries, even easier, as they will be able to access raw materials and low-cost finished products, while sacrificing national industry and thousands of jobs."
"Despite already being the object of resolutions of this Parliament, the last of which was in 2010, the old request that the country of origin be marked and that information be made available about the origin of various goods has been postponed."
"This report adopts the proposal by the Commission to simplify the customs formalities followed by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the European Union."
"It thus proposes to repeal the conditions of acceptance of proofs of origin for certain textiles and textile articles originating in third countries."
"The list of products covered is extensive, comprising: silk; wool; cotton; other vegetable textile fibres; man-made or artificial filaments; felt and non-woven materials; carpets and other textile floor coverings; special woven fabrics, lace, upholstery and embroidery; knitted or crocheted fabrics; and articles of apparel and clothing accessories."
"The consequences of liberalising the international textiles trade are known all too well in countries like Portugal, with the elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports and special safeguard provisions."
"This proposal, which is in line with previous measures, aims to make the lives of major European importers, which are its main beneficiaries, even easier, as they will be able to access raw materials and low-cost finished products, while sacrificing national industry and thousands of jobs."
"Despite already being the object of resolutions of this Parliament, the last of which was in 2010, the old request that the country of origin be marked and that information be made available about the origin of various goods has been postponed, which we regret."
"The Commission is aiming, among other things, to support the unification of import rules by harmonising the rules on textile imports with the rules on imports of other industrial products."
"This should improve the overall cohesion of the legislative environment in this area."
"The legal instrument that is to be abolished relates to the conditions for accepting the evidence of origin of certain textiles and textile products originating in third countries."
"In my view, the aim should be to implement trade policy measures that would help to prevent market distortion caused by the sharp growth in imports from third countries, such as China, for example."
"I endorsed this document because the Commission's proposal to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 and to amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 is driven by the European Union's policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Community, which fall within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature."
"Moreover, the Commission's objective is also to enhance the uniformity of the rules for import by aligning the rules relating to imports of textiles with those for other industrial goods, which should improve the overall consistency of the legislative environment in this area."
"It is the Commission's view that the very limited trade policy measures in the textiles sector applied by the Union can be managed without imposing the excessive burden of having to present proof of origin for all imports."
"This also helps to prevent the problem of market distortions that would be caused by a surge in imports of such textile products to the EU market, if the allowable quotas were not respected."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which is driven by the European Union's policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the EU."
"We strongly supported this report in view of the EU's policy commitment to simplifying the legislation in force."
"We aim to create a better, clearer legislative environment for businesses."
"European trade policy measures in the textiles sector can be managed without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports."
"In order to continue controlling imports of textile products still subject to remaining quantitative restrictions and originating from countries that are not yet members of the World Trade Organisation, the EU will now rely on import authorisations."
"Meanwhile, concerning the categories of products falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature that are not subject to quantitative import restrictions and are released for free circulation in the EU, a system of ex post statistical surveillance is being applied to monitor their impact on the EU market."
"We would point out that, in addition to the abovementioned import control mechanisms, it has been mandatory since 2010 to indicate the country of origin of certain third-country products in order to better inform consumers about their origin."
"We should now seek to enhance the uniformity of the rules for import by aligning the rules relating to textile imports with those for other industrial goods, which should improve the overall consistency of the legislative environment in this area."
"The outcome of the vote expresses the sense that the indication 'made in' is essential for market transparency and clarifying for consumers the origin of the products that they use."
"It is necessary to strengthen the EU economy by improving the competitiveness of EU industry in the global economy."
"We can only have fair competition if the world economy operates according to clear rules for producers, exporters and importers, while also taking into account common social and environmental norms."
"The aim of this proposal is the codification of existing legislative texts on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs."
"It is regrettable, however, that it is not yet possible to monitor the path of the product from its source."
"in writing. - Since the report is on a Commission proposal that aims to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of textile products, I voted in favour."
"I voted against this report because it is based on unfounded premises and vague future assumptions."
"On the one hand, it maintains that proof of origin is useless, since it states that the European Union can protect itself on the basis of a system of ex post statistical customs surveillance."
"However, it does not say, for instance, that the 'updated Community Customs Code' is far from being fully operational and still has some obvious gaps in it, especially in terms of the complete computerisation of the system, a much-needed measure."
"At the same time, the report expressly states that implementation of the Muscardini report on 'Made in' origin marking - which, by the way, we strongly supported - will serve to protect origin marking."
"Well, I am glad that the rapporteur is so sure, but at the moment, the origin marking regulation does not yet exist and we do not really know if, when or how it will be adopted."
"In essence, therefore, I think this report is a dangerous leap into the void, with serious consequences as usual for the textile industry, which the European Union continues to mistreat in the face of general indifference."
"The adoption of Mr Zahradil's proposal has reopened the debate on the importance of origin marking for products from third countries, as a measure designed to implement a trade policy that can prevent market disturbances due to a rise in foreign imports, and to sort out the complicated legislative environment that today makes it difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to develop."
"I am therefore in favour of a regulation that enhances the uniformity of the rules for European textile imports by aligning them with those for other industrial goods."
"However, we should bear in mind the fact that, even if we use ex ante and ex post control mechanisms to assess the impact of third-country imports on the European market, the European Union has not yet been able to adopt a control mechanism based on fair and important information for consumers such as that provided by origin marking."
"I hope that the Council, too, will quickly come to a positive conclusion on the decisive steps taken by this House towards ensuring traceability and adequate information on products."
"These measures will both ensure that people have appropriate, reliable knowledge about the goods on the market and make them appreciate the uniqueness of European manufacturing."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature and released for free circulation in the Community, and on the conditions for the acceptance of such proof and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries."
"I voted in favour with reservations, but did so because, overall, it is positive and is in line with EU policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force, with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities observed by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Union, and with the objective of making the rules for importing more uniform, by aligning the rules relating to textile imports with those for other industrial goods, which should improve the overall consistency of the legislative environment in this area."
"The aim of the Commission's proposal to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products and to amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries is to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Community."
"The requirements for the presentation of proof of origin for textile products were introduced in order to ensure the proper implementation of import restriction measures so as to avoid market disruption caused by imports from the People's Republic of China."
"The impact and the number of measures applied by the European Union to imports of these products have gradually diminished in recent years."
"In fact, special safeguard provisions have been created for textile and clothing imports from the People's Republic of China and quantitative restrictions on imports from World Trade Organisation member countries have been lifted."
"For the reasons given above, I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - I have spoken on this issue before and I am voting for this report because I believe EU citizens have the right to know the make-up of the clothes they buy."
"This regulation will allow consumers to avoid buying products containing non-textile parts of animal origin, whether for health, ethical or other considerations."
"Under this regulation, for example, the trimmings on collars will be labelled clearly and separately from the rest of the garment, allowing consumers to make an informed choice about the clothes they buy."
"Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal, as fur is potentially hazardous to their health and without proper labelling, they may buy a product containing these textiles without realising it."
"Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 was aimed at introducing requirements for the presentation of proof of origin for certain textiles originating in third countries to which the quantitative restrictions on imports applied."
"Due to the changes that have taken place in the meantime, particularly as a result of the 2005 World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the removal of the first proof of origin for products seems to be justified, and I therefore voted for the repeal of this regulation."
"In general, it aims to relieve the burden on products when they enter the EU, without sacrificing the interests of purchasers, so it is therefore important to maintain alternative monitoring mechanisms for imports of such products into the EU."
"I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Zahradil."
"The very limited trade policy measures applied by the EU in the textiles sector can be managed without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports."
"However, import control measures on textile products must be maintained."
"In fact, in order to continue controlling imports of textile products still subject to remaining quantitative restrictions and originating from Belarus and North Korea, which are not yet members of the World Trade Organisation, the EU now relies on import authorisations."
"That helps to prevent the problem of market distortions that would be caused by a surge in imports of certain textile products onto the EU market, if the allowable quotas were not respected."
"Moreover, concerning the categories of products not subject to quantitative import restrictions and released for free circulation in the EU, a system of ex post statistical surveillance is being applied to monitor their impact on the EU market."
"I would also like to point out that in 2010, the European Parliament adopted at first reading the report by Mrs Muscardini on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries ('Made in'), which also concerns textiles and clothing."
"in writing. - In favour."
"In the ambit of the better law making approach, the Commission proposes to repeal a 1998 Council Regulation under which importers have to provide proof of origin of textiles and articles of apparel for EU customs procedures."
"The regulation had value as long as quantitative restrictions on textiles and articles of apparel existed through the WTO's Multifibre Agreement."
"This agreement was terminated in 2005."
"By 2008, the Agreement on textiles and clothing between the EU and China and all other surveillance systems for imports of textiles and clothing from China had also ended."
"Textile and clothing imports from Belarus and North Korea, neither of which are members of the WTO, are still subject to quantitative restrictions."
"The system of import authorisations still remains in place for controls on these imports, which, however, do not pose problems with regard to the functioning of the EU market."
"This system is deemed sufficient."
"All in all, Parliament is advocating a new 'made in' labelling regime, which is currently a Sleeping Beauty after the conclusion of the first reading in 2010."
"Such a regime would provide much better control possibilities - and also consumer information - than the old Proof of Origin Regulations."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree with its underlying spirit: to simplify and harmonise EU legislation on imports of textile products in order to facilitate trade with third countries."
"I believe, in fact, that the limited trade policy measures applied by the EU in the textiles sector can be managed entirely without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports."
"Besides, import authorisations, ex post statistical surveillance systems and the requirements of single administrative documents already ensure that imports are effectively controlled in the Union."
"To complete the picture, however, I look forward to the time when the Muscardini report fully enters into force, as it will enable European consumers to be better informed about the origin of products, including textiles, from third countries."
"The legislation being repealed in this case concerns the conditions of acceptance of proof of origin for certain textile products originating in third countries, which established specific requirements by applying quantitative restrictions."
"The rapporteur shares the Commission's view that the trade policy measures applied by the EU in the textiles sector can be managed without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports."
"As far as we are concerned, it is in the interests of both consumers and businesses to ensure that any burden imposed on importers of goods from third countries serves to control and limit such goods."
"Above all, we are concerned that we are going to repeal regulations that are useful for customs control without there being any progress at the moment on the 'Made in' origin marking regulation, which is currently at a standstill in the Commission because of the Council's obstructionism."
"I would also like to point out that the Council has vetoed origin markings in relation to the ad hoc textile measure and is trying to do the same as regards the mandatory indication of place of origin on food labels."
"We voted against the report."
"in writing. - This Commission proposal simplifies the legislation in force on proving the origin of certain textile products."
"In 1998, the EU set out the requirement for importers to present proof of origin for products falling under Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature, listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3090/93, and which have been made in third countries."
"It should be noted that in 2005, quantitative restrictions on textile and clothing imports originating in World Trade Organisation (WTO) member countries were rules, while the rules for the same type of products originating in the People's Republic of China expired at the end of 2008."
"In view of this, I am voting in favour of this report, as I believe that it marks a positive step in defining a clearer and simpler legislative environment for European businesses which import textile and footwear products originating in third countries for which there continue to be quantitative restrictions because they are not WTO members."
"I also believe that the customs authorities make an effective contribution to efficiently monitoring imports of this type of product, effectively supervising their impact on the EU's economic climate and, thus, the economy of each Member State."
"I voted in favour of the report on proof of origin for certain textile products."
"The recasting of the legislation in this area aims to simplify and standardise the legislative framework, including the administrative formalities, whilst, at the same time, also including appropriate instruments to manage the market disruptions brought about by the serious rise in imports from third countries."
"Finally, the new arrangements make allowance for the calls the European Parliament has hitherto made for more information for consumers."
"I am voting in favour of the participation of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), as the EMCDDA is open to the participation of any third country, and particularly bearing in mind that Croatia is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on the way from the production countries to consumer countries."
"I therefore believe that its immediate involvement is essential."
"By asking to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), the Republic of Croatia has shown that it shares the interest of the EU and its Member States in the objectives and work of the Centre, the task of which is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"That is why I endorsed the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Serracchiani, on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the EMCDDA."
"I voted in favour of this document."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction plays a vital role in collecting data on drugs and drug addiction and preparing objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"The information is intended to provide a basis for analysing the demand for drugs, ways of reducing it, and the drug market in general."
"In 2005, the Republic of Croatia asked to participate in the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"The Republic of Croatia is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on the way from the production countries to consumer countries."
"There have been large-scale cocaine seizures in Croatia, which are mostly linked to sea transport."
"I supported this agreement and the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which will allow factual and objective information to be collected from Croatia at European level concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences, and will enable the Republic of Croatia to gain information on best practices to understand the nature of its drug problems and improve its response to them."
"Drugs are one of the major scourges of our society today."
"This is a socially and culturally complex and dynamic problem, which is constantly changing and taking on new forms, with the use of new substances and new groups of consumers."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) was set up in 1993, and its main tasks are to collect data on drugs and drug addiction, and to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"This information is vital as it provides a basis for the analysis of demand for drugs and of ways of reducing it, as well as of phenomena associated with the drug market in general."
"Croatia is a transit route through which illegal drugs are smuggled on the way from production countries to consumer countries."
"It is therefore crucial for Europe that Croatia provide information concerning drugs and drug addiction, and their consequences."
"It is also crucial that it be able to obtain information on best practices."
"That is why I am voting for this recommendation."
"I support the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction because the number of deaths, compared with last year, is falling for all drugs except heroin, and progress is being achieved as a whole in the fight against drug use."
"The Republic of Croatia will be able to receive information on best practices to understand the nature of its drug problems and respond to them better."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Serracchiani's report on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction because I believe it would represent a highly beneficial exchange for both parties."
"On the one hand, Croatia's participation in the monitoring centre would provide decisive factual information to support our commitment to fight the illegal drug trade, given that Croatia is one of the main transit routes for smuggling drugs into the European Union; on the other hand, Croatia could make use of European best practice in order to respond to and combat the problem."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree that Croatia's participation in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is vital for combating illicit drug use and trafficking, both within Croatia itself, and throughout the EU."
"As a coastal state on the EU's external borders, Croatia is used as a transit country in international drugs trafficking, and it is therefore especially important for the EU to provide this country's national institutions with all the assistance necessary for combating a phenomenon that poses a particular threat to health and social stability."
"According to the agreement, Croatia will take part in the Centre's work programme, will satisfy the obligations laid down in EU legislation, and will share data with the EMCDDA, subject to the data protection requirements of the Union."
"The Republic of Croatia is an important transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled from the production countries to consumer countries."
"Evidence of this is provided by the significant cocaine seizures in Croatia, which are mostly connected with sea transport."
"According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), no general population survey on illicit drug use has been carried out in Croatia."
"However, the latest data on drug-related deaths from 2008 indicate that 87 cases were registered."
"There has been a steady increase in the quantities of drugs seized."
"Training of police officers and provision of the necessary equipment have continued."
"However, the results from investigations and the prosecution of drug-related crime need to be considerably improved."
"Croatia remains one of the main trafficking routes for drugs to the EU."
"The participation of the Republic of Croatia in the activities of the EMCDDA becomes, in these circumstances, a positive development for the whole Union."
"This means that Croatia's involvement in the EMCDDA's work programme requires a link to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction and an exchange of data with the EMCDDA."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) on the important work that it has been carrying out to reduce the quantity of drugs and of related phenomena in Europe."
"I agree with the participation of Croatia in the EMCDDA's activities, given the fact that the country has become part of a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled, due to its strategic location, and I believe that the adoption of the European programme will lead to the improvement of health care and social peace, at both European and international level."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) plays a vital role in collecting data about drugs and drug addiction, adding to the store of objective, reliable and comparable data at European level, which provides a basis for analysing demand for drugs and ways of reducing it, as well as phenomena associated with the drug market in general."
"Any third countries sharing the interests of the Union and its Member States regarding the EMCDDA's objectives and work can participate in that work."
"Croatia applied in 2005, and the negotiations were successfully concluded in 2009."
"It is important that this agreement be adopted, as Croatia is one of the main transit routes through which illicit drugs are smuggled into the EU, so it is vital that this country be involved in the EMCDDA's work as soon as possible, particularly bearing in mind that Croatia's accession to the EU is envisaged for the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013."
"Croatia will be linked to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX) and will share data with the EMCDDA, subject to the data protection requirements of the Union and national law."
"The phenomenon of drug addiction, particularly of the drug market, is a global threat and a terrible obstacle which is difficult to fight due to its constant relocations and changes."
"The nature of the work by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is very important in this area, as it allows the various Member States to create an international knowledge and information base."
"Information is crucial for analysing and creating strategies to reduce and combat the existence of drug markets and drug addiction."
"Croatia has been expressing its wish to work with the EU on this crucial issue since 2005, and it is now time for this to happen, through its inclusion in the work of the EMCDDA, which is based in Lisbon."
"The proposal set out in the report regarding Croatia's compliance with its obligations to the EMCDDA and the EU is very positive."
"I am voting in favour of this report as I believe that this link between Croatia and the EU will contribute not only to a more effective fight against the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction, but also to the creation of greater solidarity between the EU and Croatia, which is an accession candidate, and will - at least, I hope so - shortly become a fully fledged Member State."
"The main task of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"The EMCDDA is, in practice, open to the participation of any third country that shares the interests of the EU."
"Croatia has asked to participate in it since 2005. It will now also be part of the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"As I see it, this report also illustrates the need for better information exchange between Member States and European agencies and, above all, for Croatia's potential accession to be prepared in a calmer manner than the 'major' enlargement of 2004 and 2007, when the countries of Central and Eastern Europe joined the EU."
"I voted in favour of the report on the participation of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) as I believe that this is a positive step, given that Croatia is expected to accede to the EU shortly, bur mainly because the consumption and trafficking of illicit drugs are global phenomena with severe socio-economic and health repercussions."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) aims to collect data on drugs and drug addiction, so as to analyse changes in drug consumption among the population and to study the promotion of policies and actions aimed at reducing consumption."
"In view of the fact that the EMCDDA is open to participation by third countries and that Croatia has been seeking to participate since 2005, and considering that the country is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on the way from the production countries to consumer countries, and that significant seizures, particularly of cocaine, are made in this country, I believe that Croatia's participation in the EMCDDA is an important step."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the EU, of an agreement between the EU and the Republic of Croatia for this purpose."
"This recommendation, drafted by Mrs Serracchiani and based on the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of an agreement between the EU and the Republic of Croatia, concerns the interest that Croatia has shown in forging a link with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)."
"Given that Croatia is one of the main routes for trafficking drugs to the EU, where significant seizures of illicit hallucinogenic products - including cannabis, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines - have been made; that the Croatian Government has adopted a National Programme for Prevention of Drugs amongst Youth; that the country has sought accession to the EU; and that its integration is expected to take place in 2013, I support the conclusion of the agreement between the EU and the Republic of Croatia, so that the latter can forge links with the Lisbon-based EMCDDA."
"The changes to the global situation regarding the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs is worrying."
"The 2009 report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) confirmed that the situation has deteriorated in relation to drugs such as cocaine, heroin and new synthetic drugs, and it has seen persistently high levels of consumption and a spiralling upward trend in this regard."
"Countless factors have a bearing on this growth, which is not unconnected to the deepening of the crisis of capitalism and its social effects in many countries."
"This report proposes support for the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the latter's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)."
"Regardless of the process of this country's accession to the EU, its development and ultimate outcome, it is proposed that it will participate in the EMCDDA, given that it is making an effort in terms of investigating and prosecuting drug-related crime."
"It is suggested, however, that these efforts should be significantly improved, given that Croatia continues to be one of the main routes for drug trafficking into the EU."
"It is important that Croatia's accession to the EMCDDA, which we support, could contribute to stepping up the fight against drug trafficking."
"By adopting this report, Parliament has given its support to the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the latter's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)."
"Although, as the rapporteur mentions, Croatia's entry into the EU is envisaged for the second half of 2012 or early 2013, its participation in the EMCDDA could be accepted given that this country is making an effort to investigate and prosecute drug-related crime."
"However, these efforts must be significantly improved, given that Croatia continues to be one of the main routes for drug trafficking into the EU."
"We are aware that the development of the global situation regarding the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs is worrying."
"According to data given in the 2009 report by the EMCDDA, it was shown that the situation has deteriorated, especially in relation to drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and to new synthetic drugs, and it has seen persistently high levels of consumption and a spiralling upward trend in this regard."
"We hope that this decision will contribute to stepping up the fight against drug trafficking."
"Croatia straddles the transit route through which drugs are illegally smuggled from producer countries to consumer countries."
"Significant and large-scale cocaine seizures in Croatia are mostly connected with sea transport."
"The use and smuggling of illegal drugs are global phenomena which post a threat to health and social stability."
"I therefore welcome the participation of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, mainly for the purposes of education in this area and preventing the use of drugs and other narcotic substances."
"Since Croatia will be an important partner for the European Union's future relations with the countries of former Yugoslavia, and since it is a key transit area for drug smuggling, we welcome this candidate country's participation in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"It is essential for us to be able to meet and work with Croatian experts in the field in order to fight this sad problem, which is why I am in favour of the proposal."
"As shadow rapporteur on this dossier, I voted resolutely in favour of this resolution and this agreement to allow Croatia to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, as well as in the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX)."
"I therefore fully support Croatia's participation so that it can play an active part in combating this problem, the scale and devastating effects of which are dangerously on the increase in Europe."
"According to statistics compiled by the Centre, 75 million Europeans have already tried cannabis and 14 million Europeans have already tried cocaine at least once."
"It should also be pointed out that Croatia remains one of the main trafficking routes for drugs to the EU."
"This agreement will therefore not only make it possible to obtain factual and objective information from Croatia concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences, but will also enable Croatia, through these exchanges of information and best practices, to understand the nature of this phenomenon and better respond to it."
"I endorsed this report because, as we know, the main task of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"The information is intended to provide a basis for analysing the demand for drugs and ways of reducing it, as well as phenomena associated with the drug market in general."
"It is stipulated that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) shall be open to the participation of any third country that shares the interests of the Union and its Member States in its objectives and work."
"In 2005, the Republic of Croatia asked to participate in the activities of the EMCDDA."
"The Republic of Croatia will take part in the Centre's work programme, will satisfy the obligations of the regulation, will be linked to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX) and will share data with the EMCDDA, subject to the data protection requirements of the Union and national laws."
"The Republic of Croatia will also contribute financially to the Union to cover the cost of its participation and will also participate in the Management Board of the Centre without the right to vote until such time as it becomes a member of the European Union."
"For its part, the EMCDDA will treat the Republic of Croatia as an existing Member State, through equal treatment in terms of linkage to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX) and staffing provisions."
"Drug addiction is a social problem, both for developed countries and for those which are poorly developed."
"Croatia, just like other countries, is having to contend with drug addiction, and it has very tough legislation in this area."
"Preventative work is being done chiefly in schools, because that social group is the most vulnerable to drug dependence."
"Croatia, as a candidate country for EU membership, has a duty to adapt its legal system to the system which is in force in the countries of the Union."
"I think that Croatia's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is extremely important, particularly because Croatia is a transit route."
"Illicit substances are smuggled through Croatia from the production countries to consumer countries."
"Participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction will help introduce the European Union's extremely important anti-drugs policy to Croatia."
"With my vote today, I supported the recommendation for the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"The Republic of Croatia will, in fact, take part in the Centre's European work programme on drugs and drug addiction."
"The Centre's main task is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"The subject is clearly very important, both for its marked impact on health protection and for the fight against the criminal activities associated with the drug market."
"Croatia is, in fact, on one of the sea transit routes commonly used by organised crime to bring illegal drugs from producing countries to consuming countries."
"To us, that fact is even more worrying when we realise that Croatia will be the next candidate country to become a Member State of the European Union."
"I therefore hope that Croatia's participation in the work programme proves to be of the greatest benefit."
"This draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is important as Croatia is one of the main entry points for drugs in Europe."
"With a view to tackling drug trafficking effectively, which not only poses a threat to Croatia but to the European Union as well, it is important that Croatia is also linked to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX) and actively and directly involved in exchanging data with the EMCDDA."
"This exchange of data helps create a database for analysing the demand for drugs and secondary drug-trafficking activities, which is vital for publishing proper, objective information that can be compared at a European level."
"in writing. - I welcome this agreement and the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"Illicit drug use and trafficking are worldwide phenomena that threaten health and social stability."
"Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has tried an illicit drug and at least one of our citizens dies every hour from a drug overdose."
"At a European level, it is also important to have factual and objective information from Croatia concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences, and, at the same time, the Republic of Croatia can get information on best practices to understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them."
"The problem of drugs, which we are discussing now, is, to a large extent, also a historical problem."
"The illegal drugs trade goes beyond, and always has gone beyond, the borders of any one country."
"In my opinion, the establishment of high quality international cooperation in the fight against the illegal drugs trade, not only at the European level but especially at the global level, would be one way to improve the effectiveness of the fight against this kind of trade."
"As a doctor, I would also like to say that drug abuse can have extremely grave and irreversible consequences for human health."
"I therefore support effective international cooperation in the fight against the illegal trade in drugs or their precursors and, at the same time, I would like to mention the need for prevention."
"Illicit drug use and trafficking are worldwide problems that threaten health and social stability."
"The Republic of Croatia is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on the way from the production countries to consumer countries."
"Moreover, in the last 10 years, the number of drug-related deaths has been gradually increasing."
"Despite the continuing training of police officers and the provision of the necessary equipment, the results of investigations and prosecutions of drug-related crime need to be considerably enhanced."
"Croatia continues to be located on one of the main trafficking routes for drugs into the EU."
"We are certainly in favour of the government's adoption of a national programme for preventing drug use among young people, with the aim of updating the existing programmes."
"We therefore approve of the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"Since this is a candidate country that will soon be joining the European Union, it is particularly important for it to provide the Member States with exhaustive, objective information about drug trafficking and drug addiction and their economic and social consequences."
"The scourge of drugs continues to cause concern throughout the EU."
"The more countries help to combat it, the greater the chance of success."
"Croatia's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is therefore welcome."
"Croatia does, however, need to step up the fight against drug trafficking on its territory as this continues to be one of the main routes for drug trafficking into the EU."
"The main task of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"The Republic of Croatia will accordingly take part in the Centre's work programme, be linked to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX) and share data with the EMCDDA."
"The Republic of Croatia is a transit route for drugs arriving from production countries and remains one of the main trafficking routes for drugs to the EU."
"Nevertheless, in 2010, it adopted a programme for implementation of the Action Plan on Combating Drugs Abuse, as well as a National Programme for Prevention of Drugs amongst Youth."
"Furthermore, training of police officers and provision of the necessary equipment have continued."
"By participating in the EMCDDA and exchanging information, Croatia will be able to understand the problem and better respond to it."
"Its participation is also an encouraging sign with regard to its forthcoming accession to the European Union."
"in writing. - As is known, the Centre is working basically with policy makers at the level of the Community and the Member States, which thus help to develop a strategy for combating drugs and providing information to the general public."
"At the present time, attention is mainly paid to implementation of the EU Action Plan for 2009-2012, which is aimed at strengthening European cooperation in the struggle against the unacceptable consequences of drug addiction."
"I would like to see the Centre working not only on the consequences but also on the causes of drug addiction, thus solving the problem at an early stage."
"I voted in favour."
"I believe that we must take steps, not just within the European Union, but beyond its borders, to reduce the use of and demand for drugs, using strict preventative measures to combat phenomena associated with the drug market."
"Consequently, it is very important to obtain accurate data and information on drugs and drug addiction, because these are global phenomena, posing a threat to the health, security and social well-being of us all."
"I support Croatia's participation in the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"Croatia aims to become a full member of the European Union."
"It should be noted that Croatia is a transit route through which large quantities of drugs are smuggled to other countries."
"I am pleased that Croatia is making significant efforts to combat the trafficking, use of and trade in illegal drugs."
"However, Croatia remains one of the main routes for trafficking drugs to the EU."
"It is therefore crucial to quickly obtain factual and objective information on drugs, drug addiction and the consequences of these."
"Furthermore, this will create an ideal framework for Croatia to obtain information on other EU Member States' best practices in addressing problems related to drugs and drug addiction."
"I welcome Croatia's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)."
"The main task of the EMCDDA is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction, and to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"This information provides a basis for analysing demand for drugs and ways of reducing it, as well as phenomena associated with the drug market in general."
"Indeed, Croatia, like certain other European countries, is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on the way from production countries to consumer countries."
"The significant and large-scale cocaine seizures in Croatia are mostly connected with sea transport."
"With the adoption of this report, Croatia will start participating in the EMCDDA's work programme and sharing data with the EMCDDA, subject to the data protection requirements of the Union and national law."
"The agreement sets out financial contributions to the Union to cover the cost of its participation."
"The EMCDDA is the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which was established in 1993 with the main task of collecting data on drugs and drug addiction, in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level."
"The information supplied by the Centre provides a basis for analysing the demand for drugs entering the EU and all the phenomena associated with the drug market, so as to be able to work out how best to combat these problems."
"The Centre is open to the participation of any third country that shares the interests of the Union and its Member States in its objectives and work."
"Croatia asked to participate in the Centre's activities in 2005 and, in 2006, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of Croatia."
"These were positively concluded in July 2009 with the initialling of the agreement."
"The agreement was subsequently revised in December 2009 in light of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It should be pointed out that Croatia is already part of Reitox, the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"For the reasons given above, and in order to further improve cooperation with non-EU countries, I have voted in favour."
"Croatia asked to join the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2005."
"Since this country is on one of the main drug smuggling routes into the European Union, I consider it important to have factual, objective information from Croatia on these problems."
"I therefore find the rapporteur's position entirely acceptable and I support this recommendation."
"The Republic of Croatia has requested that it be allowed to participate in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), created in 1993 and based in Lisbon."
"Indeed, the country is particularly interested in the fight against drug trafficking: as well as the problems it is experiencing with its domestic policy, it is a route of entry for smuggling these products into the EU."
"In its fight against drug addiction and trafficking, Croatia has already implemented measures to address this at a national level, both in terms of preventing consumption and in terms of supporting the investigation of drug-related crime."
"There is, therefore, mutual interest in Croatia's accession to the EMCDDA."
"However, insofar as it is not yet a Member State, it is necessary to define its status - its rights of participation and what responsibilities it should have - in the context of the EMCDDA."
"in writing. - We supported the mandate of EMCDDA in 2006."
"As regards the specific situation in Croatia, it is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on their way from the producer countries to consumer countries."
"Significant and large-scale cocaine seizures in Croatia are mostly connected with sea transport."
"In the last 10 years, the number of deaths has gradually increased in Croatia."
"A majority (77.1%) of the cases of deaths were associated with opiates."
"In 2008, the total number of reported drug-related offences was 7 168."
"In 2009, a total of 7 934 persons were treated by the national drug addiction institutes."
"The number of seizures decreased for all drugs except heroin when compared to the previous year and, in general, progress has been made in combating drug abuse."
"Generally Croatia's anti-drug legislation is similar to that of the EU Member States."
"However, the rapporteur's position points out that, from 2010 on, every therapeutic community has to provide the Office for Drugs with data on treated patients."
"It would be good to obtain more information on the scope of this obligation."
"Nevertheless, this is an issue for domestic legislation, not the Agreement."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation because I consider the protection of European citizens' health and social stability to be a priority that should be borne in mind in the fight against illicit drug use and trafficking."
"Croatia is situated on one of the main trafficking routes for drugs into the EU."
"Its participation in the work programme of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction will provide the European Union with factual information on drug trafficking and use in Croatia, and will enable Croatia to understand the scale of its drug-related problems and adopt best practice to deal with them."
"Moreover, a sound legal basis for its participation can be found in Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1920/2006 establishing the Centre, which opens the Centre's doors to third countries that share its aims and interests."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which integrates Croatia into the fight against drugs in the EU."
"The aim of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is to collect data on the drug problem (sale, market, use) and to disseminate it in the Member States so that they can analyse and better respond to the problem."
"I therefore fully support Croatia's participation in the work of the Centre so that it can play an active part in combating this problem, the scale and devastating effects of which are dangerously on the increase in Europe."
"The Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia represents an efficient means for the EU and Croatia to reduce and impede the trade in, and consumption of, drugs on the basis of the sharing of data and experience in relation to drugs and their abuse, and in light of the fact that one EU citizen dies of an overdose every hour."
"Account needs to be taken of the fact that Croatia will accede to the European Union in 2012 or 2013 and that, as a result of its geographical location, it represents a good trans-shipment point for drug dealers."
"I voted for Mrs Auconie's report."
"I welcome this proposal to extend the scope of application to the cross-border transport of euro cash by road."
"The territory of Member States which are about to introduce the single currency must be included in the cash transport system."
"It ought to be possible, within the euro area, to sign a contract with the cash-in-transit company offering the best price, even if it is located in another Member State."
"This will facilitate access to the most efficient channels for collecting and delivering cash and providing cash services."
"In future, an ever increasing number of cash-in-transit operators will be required for the euro in the run-up to the changeover to this currency."
"Furthermore, a large number of Member States in the euro area have signed or may wish to sign agreements for the production of banknotes and coins abroad."
"I support the report on the draft Council Regulation concerning the extension of the scope of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States."
"This is because it is a good idea to also include in the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States the territory of Member States which are about to introduce the euro, since there is normally an increased need for euro cash transportation in the run-up to the changeover."
"I agree with extending the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro."
"The purpose of the present proposal is to extend the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro area Member States (the main proposal) to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro, since there is normally an increased need for euro cash transportation in the run-up to the changeover."
"I welcome this extension of the scope (although it should be noted that the legal basis here is Article 352 TFEU, which means that Parliament merely has the power of consent)."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation as I believe that the scope of this regulation should be able to be extended to the territory of any Member State about to join the euro."
"This decision will contribute to a more harmonious transition to the euro, whilst adequately responding to the increased need for cross-border transportation of euro cash in the run-up to the changeover."
"I agree with the rapporteur in the follow-up to her initial report on extending the regulation on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro."
"The aim of this provision is to simplify regulatory restrictions in order to make it possible for euro notes and coins to circulate more easily between Member States and to ensure a high level of professionalism and security within the euro area."
"It is right to expand the scope of this regulation, since there is a greater need to transport euro currency in the period preceding the introduction of the euro in the Member States of the euro area."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, the purpose of which is to extend the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro area Member States (the main proposal) to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro, since there is normally an increased need for euro cash transportation in the run-up to the changeover."
"I believe that it is appropriate to widen the scope of application of the regulation on the cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro area Member States, and to apply its provisions on the territory of Member States that are preparing to introduce the euro."
"It should be noted that in countries that are preparing to change currency, a significant need for euro cash transportation services is emerging."
"Consequently, we need to improve the quality of transportation services, creating favourable conditions for cash-in-transit companies to provide services quickly and efficiently."
"Furthermore, given the nature of the goods transported and their value, it is very important for the cash to reach the end recipient safely."
"Euro bank notes and coins are genuinely a pan-European means of payment, as the euro area currently consists of 16 Member States."
"Since national laws may be incompatible between countries, it is usually very difficult for professional cash transport companies to move euro cash between euro area Member States, which means that such transport is currently very limited."
"As a result, the demand for cross-border transport of euro cash by road has risen markedly."
"This new proposal for a regulation seeks to extend the scope of the regulation on cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro."
"The principal proposal is to extend the scope of the regulation on cross-border transport between euro area Member States, not forgetting that there is an increased need for euro cash transport in the run-up to the changeover to the euro as the national currency of new Member States."
"For these reasons, and to ensure that this issue is clearly regulated, I have voted in favour of the regulation in question."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation because I believe the scope of the regulation on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between Member States should be extended to the territory of countries that are about to introduce the single currency."
"In fact, such states normally have an increased need for euro cash in the run-up to the introduction of the single currency in their territories, to enable them to quickly and completely engage in EU trade and thereby participate in it to the full."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which has provisions to allow a greater volume of euro cash to travel to countries which are due to adopt the euro to cope with demand."
"I supported this report because it improves the safety and training of professionals who transport euro cash."
"I voted in favour of the draft Council Regulation concerning the extension of the scope of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash between euro area Member States."
"I voted in favour of it because I consider that extending the scope of the regulation is necessary and will resolve problems relating to the safety of the personnel responsible for transportation."
"I am voting in favour of the report in question, bearing in mind that satellite navigation systems should ensure interoperability between the various systems."
"For its part, the Commission should ensure adequate levels of funding."
"I should also note that, of the 15 actions included in the Commission's action plan, nine should have an immediate application."
"I voted in favour of the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Ţicău, on transport applications of global navigation satellite systems."
"Indeed, I am in favour of the application of GNSS functions to different modes of transport and of the proper implementation of research and funding in this area."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"On 14 June 2010, the Commission published its Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which included 24 specific recommendations for action."
"The action plan was prepared by taking into account the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development and use of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service)."
"The EU launched the EGNOS project (and Galileo) to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this growing strategic market."
"Europe's current market share of 25% is below expectations."
"EGNOS will offer more possibilities (EGNOS is ten times more accurate than GPS) when Galileo becomes operational in 2013."
"The Commission is best placed to coordinate the implementation of the action plan to avoid duplication at Member State level and to ensure overall progress in various EU policy fields covered by GNSS applications."
"In view of the major economic benefits, which EGNOS will have on the broader European economy if fully developed and deployed, the Commission should set out clear priorities in this area, including the operation of EGNOS throughout the whole of the EU and ensuring adequate investment in related research and technological development."
"The dynamic development of satellite navigation systems in recent years is the result of both technological progress and market needs."
"These systems are used everywhere, today, in every form of transport."
"The continued expansion of this sector means that the value of European systems is projected to reach a level of EUR 230 billion by 2025."
"The EU's EGNOS and Galileo projects can contribute to competitiveness in every area of this sector of services, because they are markedly better and more accurate than the GPS system while also being compatible with it."
"Unfortunately, the countries in the east and south of the Union are still not covered by the EGNOS system."
"Extending its range would, therefore, appear to be essential in the context of its further development."
"Something else which has not been made clear is how the costs of maintaining the Galileo system will be financed."
"They are estimated at around EUR 800 million per year."
"In view of the above, I have abstained from voting on the report."
"in writing. - (BG) I support the report on transport applications of global navigation satellite systems - short- and medium-term EU policy, because the navigation systems market is huge."
"The proposal will help avoid duplication at Member State level and ensure overall progress in the multiplicity of EU policy fields in this sector."
"On the whole, the European navigation system (10 times more accurate than GPS) will make an important contribution to safety and environmental objectives in road transport and to freer traffic flow through providing the opportunity for road tolling."
"I have taken a prudent approach and decided to abstain on Mrs Ţicău's report."
"Although an action plan on global navigation satellite systems might be considered strategic, to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in its growing market share, there are many key points that have not been addressed."
"Among these are the possible data protection risks and especially the uncertainty about how the annual maintenance cost of Galileo, which is estimated at around EUR 800 million, will be financed."
"The lack of clarity over the financial sustainability of a project that is so important for Europe's economy, and yet also so ambitious, demands a cautious, objective approach."
"The aim of the European Parliament resolution of 7 June 2011 is to encourage the European Commission to take targeted action to promote the development of global navigation satellite systems."
"Europe's GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and Galileo projects are in direct competition with the United States' GPS."
"These projects will make everyday life easier from now on."
"They represent added value not only for industry but also for transport in Europe, which is why I fully support them."
"They will have many knock-on effects: for civil aviation, air traffic control systems will be made safer; and for road traffic, this system will facilitate fee collection and improve safety via satellite tracking of emergency calls and monitoring of road transport."
"All these areas will be improved by the creation of this European service."
"I voted for this resolution in order to put pressure on the European and national authorities and to prevent a delay that deprives Europe every day of infinite possibilities."
"The Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications outlines the steps that are essential to the GNSS passing a turning point and guaranteeing project success."
"It is important that the plan does not founder in an excessive number of initiatives, and get bogged down in mere consultations, and that it really is implemented by 2013."
"The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) system must cover the entire European Union, and should be extended to northern, eastern and south-eastern Europe."
"In order for it to be fully effective for transport purposes, it must include not only the entire Union, but also our closest neighbours."
"In the area of civil aviation, the development of the system and the use of the EGNOS application for landing manoeuvres should be supported."
"It is a strategic precondition for the genuine establishment of a Single European Sky."
"There is also considerable potential for the exploitation of EGNOS and GNSS in the areas of safety, the environment, and the smooth operation of road transport, as they can be used for collecting tolls."
"I am voting for the policy on the transport applications of global navigation satellite systems, which I believe will contribute to better management of transport and logistics, as well as surveillance systems."
"Given the high value of the global market in this sector, which will continue to grow over the coming years, I would also like to highlight the importance of creating the conditions for European industry to be competitive."
"According to current estimates, global navigation satellite systems are expected to earn the European economy between EUR 55 and 63 billion over the next 20 years."
"These applications, which are largely based on the US GPS system at present, account for around 6% of the EU's total GDP."
"In the light of this, I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău's own-initiative report, which calls on the Commission to provide adequate funding for the development of applications based on the European global navigation satellite system, EGNOS and Galileo."
"SME access to this funding should be particularly encouraged in order to stimulate innovation on the basis of these European systems."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the application of the proposed Action Plan on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) will contribute to the establishment of a transport network that is more efficient through safer, more environmentally friendly and more economical modes of transport."
"Global navigation systems are part of everyday life in the transport sector, and they will have growing importance in a world that increasingly functions as part of a network, and where trade and rapid communication are essential."
"The commercial advantages and value of such systems are obvious, and there is understandable European interest in having as many of these solutions as possible, and in these operating without depending on third parties."
"The action plan tabled by the Commission makes valid proposals for the future of the EU approach to these issues, and enables the topic to be raised in a more solid and consistent way."
"The way these systems are funded requires particularly strict handling in order to avoid waste, and an imaginative approach is also needed in order to garner support and partners."
"I hope that the Union will still be able to equip itself with independent global navigation systems, and will exploit its full potential, in order to promote the strengthening of the economy, increased employment and transport safety."
"This report, drafted by Mrs Ţicău, concerns transport applications of navigation satellite systems for the EU, following the publication of the Commission's Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications on 14 June 2010."
"This sector has experienced exponential growth since 2000, which saw the first provision of Global Positioning System (GPS) services, going from EUR 124 billion in 2008 to an estimated global market value in the region of EUR 230 billion in 2025."
"The EU could not afford to fall behind in this satellite navigation technology, so it developed its European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the forerunner of the Galileo system, which it is hoped should be operational in 2013 and will be ten times more accurate than GPS."
"It is expected that accuracy to 45 centimetres will be possible in the near future."
"I would congratulate the rapporteur, and I welcome the adoption of this report, which I voted for, as it will allow the EU to increase its market share and enhance Europe's competitiveness in a strategic and growing market."
"Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) can have important and extremely useful applications for all modes of transport."
"Among other aspects, they can make them safer, more environmentally friendly and more economical."
"GNSS can also play a vital role in supporting and promoting the use of so-called intelligent transport systems."
"The rapporteur addresses some of these aspects."
"However, like other technologies, the practical results of GNSS applications are inseparable from the economic and social context in which they occur, and from the ends and objectives they serve."
"This is the case in general, and in this sector in particular."
"As such, it is not surprising that it is proposed that this system should also help establish the Single European Sky, for instance; we would like to distance ourselves from this aspect of the report."
"We agree with a GNSS that can support the development, modernisation and diversification of public services, especially in the area of transport."
"The GNSS cannot fail to be analysed across all of the many dimensions in which it may be applied."
"In view of this, we would question the limits of the potential use of these programmes in the context of assumed competition between the EU and the United States with regard to the functionality and efficiency of these systems."

"In June 2010, the Commission published the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications, which includes 24 specific recommendations."
"The action plan was drawn up in a period when the global navigation satellite systems were being implemented, specifically, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) system."
"The satellite navigation systems should ensure cooperation between the various systems, and should also be usable in passenger and freight transport."
"In my opinion, the Commission should take the steps necessary for coordinating implementation of the action plan and securing progress in EU policy areas related to GNSS applications."
"Although we agree with some aspects of Mrs Ţicău's proposal, we are unsure about many others."
"These include identifying how the annual maintenance cost of Galileo, which is estimated at EUR 800 million, will be financed once it has become operational; the possible data protection risks associated with using global navigation satellite system applications and services; and the pressing need to find additional funding to ensure that operations involving the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Galileo are soon successful."
"For these reasons, the proposal should not be thrown out but I cannot give it my full support."
"The adoption of this report is an important step forward as it lays the foundations for the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development of EGNOS, which should smooth the way for implementation of the Galileo system."
"I also gave it my vote because it will provide an opportunity to take concrete measures that will facilitate the development of transport in Europe, have a major impact on safety and environmental matters and improve traffic flow conditions for road transport."
"I endorsed this document because, on 14 June 2010, the Commission published its Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications, which included 24 specific recommendations for action."
"The action plan was prepared by taking into account the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development and use of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service)."
"EGNOS is the forerunner of the Galileo system."
"GNSS are important for developing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), because ITSs can provide more efficient, cleaner and safer transport solutions, and proper implementation of a number of ITS services requires fully operational GNSS systems."
"EGNOS and Galileo can make an important contribution to road traffic management and an awareness-raising campaign in that sector is required in order to increase the use of the opportunities it provides in relation to fee collection, eCall, online booking of safe parking sites for trucks, and real-time tracking to contribute to safer and more environmentally friendly road transport."
"This motion for a European Parliament resolution is important as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) can be applied to all modes of transport (land, sea and air), making traffic operate more efficiently, supporting economic growth and reducing pollution."
"At the same time, GNSS is part of the EU 2020 strategy's key innovation objectives."
"A larger amount of annual funding than is allocated at the moment needs to be provided so that this global navigation system is implemented in a suitable, uniform manner in all EU Member States."
"This motion for a resolution proposes, amongst its suggestions, allocating funding for the research and development of new GNSS applications which can be applied in areas such as climate change, agriculture, civil defence, natural disaster warning systems and so on. Last but not least, developing an EU-level GNSS system guarantees the EU's independence from similar navigation systems outside the EU."
"in writing. - I welcome the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications (COM(2010)308), which aims to promote the development of downstream applications through certification, standardisation and coordination with the industry and other countries, as well as by disseminating information, raising awareness, implementing regulatory measures and increasing funding."
"With the publication of the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications and the development and deployment of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service), the European Union has sought to point out civilian uses and ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this fast-growing strategic market."
"We agree with the targeted action plan drawn up by the Commission, which includes 15 sectoral actions, nine of which have an immediate and important transport application, particularly as regards promoting EGNOS in third countries."
"In fact, for this system to be fully effective from a transport perspective, its range has to go beyond the borders of Europe to include our near neighbours."
"As a matter of priority, therefore, it should be extended to northern, eastern and south-eastern Europe."
"In the area of civil aviation, we call on the Member States to prioritise EGNOS-based procedures and services with a view to creating a real Single European Sky."
"It is also clear that EGNOS and GNSS generally can make an important contribution to safety and environmental protection."
"To achieve these objectives, we will need adequate investment in the European research and development sector."
"This is the time for the Commission to coordinate the implementation of the action plan so as to avoid duplication between Member States and to ensure overall progress in the many different EU application areas for applications of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)."
"The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) should cover the entire European Union, and should be extended to the southern, eastern and south-eastern regions of Europe as a priority."
"For the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) to be fully effective from a transport perspective, its range has to be the whole of the Union, and indeed beyond, to cover our closest neighbours."
"In the area of civil aviation, the Member States must promote the development and use of EGNOS-based landing procedures, and both these and EGNOS-based services must be certified as a matter of priority for civil aviation."
"This is a strategic requirement for a real Single European Sky."
"It is also clear that the EGNOS and GNSS systems can, in general, make an important contribution to road safety and environmental objectives, and to freer road traffic flow, due to their availability for use in road tolling."
"We must find ways of funding this system."
"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) applications are a central and crucial business component in all transport-related sectors, and their effective functioning makes transport safer, more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective."
"The European Union cannot continue to depend on systems initially designed for other uses by other countries."
"Considering the high added value that the GNSS and Galileo projects generate for EU industrial policy, it is essential to ensure their success."
"A targeted action plan is the best way of giving fresh impetus and contributing significantly to targets on safety and the environment as well as to those on traffic flow improvement for road transport."
"Furthermore, satellite navigation systems must provide interoperability with different systems, including traditional systems."
"Extending the coverage of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) should be a priority."
"This system must then be extended to the entire European continent as well as to Euro-Mediterranean Partnership countries and also to the Middle East and Africa."
"Finally, the Commission should propose measures to ensure an adequate level of financing without diminishing the other funds allocated to transport policy."
"in writing. - Satellite navigation systems should ensure interoperability between different systems and should also allow intermodal use in passenger and freight transport services."
"Therefore, I voted in favour."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on EU policy in the short and medium term on transport applications of Global Navigation Satellite Systems, above all because, across the entire EU, significant attention should be paid to the GNSS and Galileo projects in the transport sector."
"The Commission has a special role to play here, establishing a regulatory mechanism that would eliminate various bureaucratic and other obstacles and would facilitate the smooth and effective implementation of these projects."
"Furthermore, it is very important to ensure appropriate and sufficient funding for these projects, according to criteria of transparency and proportionality, with particular attention being paid to SMEs."
"We must promote the use of EGNOS and Galileo in civil aviation and thus contribute to establishing the Single European Sky ATM Research programme and facilitating its implementation."
"It is crucial for European satellite radio navigation programmes to be adapted to multi-modal services and applied throughout Europe, not only in certain countries, because the effective implementation of the programmes mentioned would improve freight transport efficiency and help to address many transport safety and environmental issues."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Ţicău because I think that new technologies such as satellite navigation systems, which are becoming increasingly widespread and benefit all of society, should be applied to the transport sector."
"In the global system in which we live, the EU must adapt its policies to the needs of the various sectors and develop a global satellite navigation system that integrates perfectly with the well-known GPS system so as to provide immediate information with no margin for error."
"With a booming market and an estimated turnover of more than EUR 200 billion over the next 10 years, satellite navigation needs adequate funding to support its development in practice."
"On 14 June 2010, the Commission published its Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications, which included 24 specific recommendations for action."
"This sector as a whole has experienced enormous expansion since the first provision of Global Positioning System (GPS) services from US satellite facilities in 2000."
"Indeed, the estimated global market value in 2008 was EUR 124 billion, projected to reach EUR 230 billion by 2025."
"Of this, 20% is represented by intelligent transport systems (ITS) and 5% by safety applications, including transport safety applications."
"This project aims to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this growing strategic market."
"Europe's current market share of 25% is below expectations."
"EGNOS is GPS-compatible but will offer more possibilities when Galileo becomes operational in 2013."
"EGNOS is ten times more accurate than GPS at present."
"These aspects have immediate and important implications for the transport sector, including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, and I am therefore voting in favour."
"The global satellite navigation systems sector has experienced strong growth since 2000, when the systems were first used in the United States."
"The estimated global market value in 2025 is EUR 230 billion, 20% of which will come from intelligent transport systems and 5% from safety applications."
"In June 2010, the Commission published the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications and, specifically, the European EGNOS system: this action plan also includes 24 specific recommendations for action."
"If the EGNOS system is to be developed further, priority must be given to the measures proposed in the action plan and adequate investment and funding in research and development activities must be provided without fail."
"Indeed, a lack of European funding for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in this research project under the seventh and eighth framework programmes would make it less attractive to commercial operators."
"In order to support the further development of the EGNOS system and to ensure that the system does not suffer from a lack of European funding, I voted in favour of this proposal."
"in writing. - The Commission's Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite Systems shows there is huge demand in a market projected to be worth EUR 230 billion by 2025."
"However, Europe is failing to compete globally in this field and our current market share of 25% is below what is expected."
"We must ensure we take the necessary steps to ensure this industry achieves its full potential."
"The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is ten times more accurate than GPS and it is predicted that accuracy to 45 centimetres can be achieved in the near future."
"This system has obvious uses in the fields of air and sea transport and can also be used in road transport."
"However, we must be mindful of encroaching too much on European citizens as there are obvious personal privacy issues with such technology."
"Overall, I welcome ENGOS and GNSS as they can make an important contribution to safety and environmental objectives and I believe adequate investment in the related research and development will be essential."
"But the funding gap must be closed in order to reap the benefits of these projects."
"Following the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications, published by the Commission on 14 June 2010 with a view to increasing the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), efforts should be made to extend the navigation system to cover the entire EU."
"Indeed, the expansion of this system can offer huge advantages for the economy and security."
"To this end, however, major investment is needed in innovation and development."
"This is the only way, firstly, that the system will achieve its full scope and, secondly, that it will reach the level of maturity that will ultimately enable a financial return."
"This is an area, moreover, that has seen massive development."
"For instance, it is estimated that in the near future, it will be possible to achieve geographic locations accurate to 45 centimetres."
"For these reasons, I voted for this report."
"Today, we voted during the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on the report on transport applications of Global Navigation Satellite Systems."
"In 2010, the Commission published the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications."
"The action plan outlines the solutions necessary to ensure the success of satellite navigation."
"The general background to the action plan is the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development and deployment of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service)."
"EGNOS is the forerunner of the Galileo system."
"The EU has launched the EGNOS project (and Galileo) to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this growing strategic market."
"I believe it is necessary, as Mrs Ţicău points out, to set aside additional funding for the Galileo programme and, hence, to create perhaps a Galileo reserve fund within the EU budget to cover any additional costs, taking care not to harm the other programmes."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report."
"On 14 June 2010, the Commission published its Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which included 24 specific recommendations for action."
"The background to the action plan is the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development and deployment of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service), the forerunner of the Galileo system."
"The sector as a whole has experienced enormous expansion since the first provision of GPS services from American satellite facilities in 2000."
"The estimated global market value in 2008 was EUR 124 billion, and it is projected to reach EUR 230 billion by 2025."
"Of this, 20% is represented by Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and 5% by safety applications, including transport safety applications."
"The EU launched the EGNOS project (and Galileo) to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this growing strategic market."
"Europe's current market share of 25% is below expectations."
"EGNOS is GPS compatible but it will offer more possibilities when Galileo becomes operational in 2013."
"EGNOS is 10 times more accurate than GPS."
"Like the rapporteur, I support the Commission's Action Plan for the development of EGNOS and Galileo, which is based on nine horizontal measures with an immediate transport application."
"The deployment of EGNOS to its maximum extent throughout Europe and beyond to our near neighbours will have a major beneficial impact on the broader European economy, as well as on safety and environmental objectives, and will encourage a freer traffic flow in road transport."
"If we are to achieve these objectives, however, we need adequate funding for research and development, which has been scarce until now."
"The EU is, in fact, the only trading block that does not provide direct funding to its GNSS programme."
"The report on transport applications of global navigation satellite systems supports and highlights the role and importance of the Commission's 2010-2013 action plan in this area and its impact on transport."
"The nine measures in the action plan are immediately and essentially related to transport."
"It envisages the use and development of global navigation satellite systems in all forms of transport."
"Of course, this will play a very big role in road and air transport."
"Two of the measures that are definitely worth highlighting are the facilitation of the creation of a Single European Sky and the creation of applications for intelligent transport systems."
"In addition, the use of satellites will provide an opportunity to develop and use a great many different applications."
"I sincerely hope that the development and putting into practice of the systems, applications and solutions specified in the report goes as planned, and that, already in the next few years, the various solutions will find an application, which will make companies' and citizens' lives easier and enhance safety at sea, in the air and on the roads."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which deals with developing and deploying European systems to exploit Galileo and other satellite systems and their applications in the transport domain."
"Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) currently have implications for all EU policies, and their development and application will have a catalytic effect on implementing the Europe 2020 strategy and on creating a strategic and competitive European sector."
"Transport applications account for 20% of all GNSS applications by volume, and 44% by value."
"This industry represents a growing global market in which Europe should take the lead and achieve its independence."
"GNSS applications and services in the area of transport have various implications for security, for effectiveness, and for the economic and environmental costs of all modes of transport."
"I also believe that it is important to note that in order for there to be fair development, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programme should cover all of the Member States and enable interoperability and compatibility with third countries, so as to make this market competitive and dynamic."
"Finally, I would stress the rapporteur's idea that the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should ensure adequate levels of funding for GNSS research and development, as well as for its implementation."
"Mechanisms should be created to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) gain access to this funding more easily, and to facilitate the development and marketing of GNSS applications."
"I have voted in favour of this report."
"Following the failure of Europe's market share in the growing satellite navigation systems market to live up to expectations, in June last year, the Commission brought forward an action plan on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) applications."
"The Commission sensibly chose a targeted action plan, the recommendations of which not only include the realisation of the Single European Sky - already a priority that the Union has confirmed many times - but in the sphere of road transport, too, GNSS is to make an important contribution to attaining our safety and environmental protection targets."
"Taken as a whole, the action plan is designed to ensure that the European market, too, can compete in this sector, the worldwide market value of which is forecast to further grow to EUR 230 billion by 2025."
"I am convinced that actions to promote the use of EGNOS and Galileo in civil aviation are crucial for implementation of the Single European Sky ATM Research programme."
"Unfortunately, as the rapporteur has emphasised in her document, introduction of the Galileo system continues to be beset by new problems."
"I agree with the call to the Commission to ensure swift certification of EGNOS for civil aviation."
"I have often stressed already that I am an enthusiast of the concept of the Single European Sky and the Single European Sky ATM Research programme."
"Rapid and full realisation of the European air space is a very important strategic step towards real integration of the Union and strengthening the common market."
"Without Galileo, we will not have SESAR, and without SESAR, we will not achieve Single European Sky 2."
"Let us remember that in this area in particular, we are dealing with a system of interconnected vessels - a weakness in one part will have a disastrous effect on the rest."
"I am voting for the report in question as there needs to be a framework for assessing individual air agreements, although Parliament needs to monitor the negotiations closely, instead of being left behind and only deciding whether to accept or reject the final text."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category."
"That is why I am in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Brian Simpson, on the implementation of a set of criteria for evaluating the content of these agreements."
"I also think that there is a need to promote balanced market access and investment opportunities, as well as fair competition, particularly with regard to public subsidies and social and environmental standards."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, agreements covering a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies require Parliament's consent."
"I voted in favour of this report aimed at setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated, both in terms of substance and the procedures the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism might adopt to ensure that it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent."
"Comprehensive air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines, by means of both market access and regulatory convergence to promote fair competition, including issues with regard to state subsidies and social and environmental standards."
"I agree with the rapporteur that Parliament needs to follow the process from the very beginning and be closely involved in the topics under discussion to discover the current state of the negotiations on air agreements."
"The Commission should also be aware of the criteria that Parliament will use to evaluate an agreement and its elements."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category."
"The new Parliamentary powers established by the Treaty bring with them new responsibilities to ensure that Parliament and its responsible committee are well informed about the preparation of the agreements to which it will subsequently be asked to give its consent."
"In view of this change, I welcome the corresponding new Parliamentary responsibility to monitor the conduct of negotiations more closely."
"I would take the opportunity to point out here that, in order to be well placed to consider whether or not to grant consent once the negotiations have been completed, Parliament needs to follow the process from the outset, rather than after the negotiations have been concluded."
"Lastly, I repeat the call for the Commission to supply Parliament with a constant flow of information and to submit reports analysing the strengths and weaknesses of existing agreements on a regular basis."
"I believe, in fact, that this would enable Parliament to assess future agreements more effectively."
"This motion for a European Parliament resolution on the conclusion of international air agreements incorporates many of the key principles upheld by the Lega Nord."
"They include the need to ensure equal market access rights for airlines from all Member States, preventing concealed dumping practices financed directly by national policies, in breach of Community rules on State aid."
"The motion also voices concern about citizens' safety, acknowledging the fundamental importance of establishing a reference framework on safety."
"Another principle defended by the Lega Nord and upheld in the motion concerns transparency between the activities of the European institutions and EU citizens, whose interests are directly represented in Parliament."
"To this end, the motion highlights, in fact, the need for the Commission to fulfil its responsibility of keeping Parliament constantly informed of the progress of its negotiations with non-EU operators."
"For the reasons listed above, I decided to vote in favour of this motion."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree that comprehensive EU air agreements with neighbouring countries can only benefit passengers, freight operators and airlines in many respects: maintaining security and environmental standards and promoting a favourable business environment."
"The aim of this report is to simplify and clarify the conclusion of air transport agreements and the adoption of decisions on such agreements, with the European Parliament informing the Commission in advance about the criteria upon which it will base its decision whether or not to consent to the conclusion of a particular agreement on behalf of the EU."
"In the report, Parliament also draws the attention of the Commission and the Council to agreements which, if concluded, may benefit the EU and its citizens, but which the EU has, for one reason or another, yet to conclude with countries such as Russia, China, Japan and India."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent is required for the conclusion of international agreements."
"This means that it is a natural step for the Committee on Transport and Tourism to draw up an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air transport agreements should be evaluated."
"Comprehensive agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can provide substantial benefits by offering passengers and freight operators improved services - in terms of both variety and cost - while allowing airlines new opportunities and a competitive edge."
"Indeed, regulatory convergence can do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies, social and environmental standards."
"It is unfortunate that the Council has yet to grant the Commission a mandate to open negotiations on a global air transport agreement with important trading partners, such as the People's Republic of China and India, despite the proposal dating from 2005."
"The economic growth of this region enhances the value of such agreements."
"I voted in favour of this own-initiative report because the increasingly important contribution of the aviation sector brings with it many advantages for the European economy, but also quite a few disadvantages."
"I believe that the institution to which I belong, namely Parliament, should be given greater supervisory powers so that it has a full understanding of the types of agreement that do or do not deserve its consent."
"The vote that we would cast would be the result of close monitoring of the outcome of negotiations, which must promote compliance with international legislation on social rights, full recognition of certification practices and procedures, exchange of safety data and joint inspections."
"Only by giving our consent to ambitious agreements that respect the principles upheld by the EU could we make a valid contribution to the latter's activities and improvement."
"I believe that the possibility of regulatory convergence raised by certain international air agreements will be realised by creating conditions of fair competition."
"This is not only beneficial to industry in the countries involved, but also constitutes an opportunity to standardise and strengthen social and environmental standards."
"The services offered to passengers and freight operators will also see substantial improvements which would not be as visible through other means, such as bilateral agreements."
"The conclusion of comprehensive agreements on air transport with neighbouring countries or significant global partners is of particular importance in terms of market access and of regulatory convergence, as it promotes fair competition, an equal level of social and environmental standards, and so on. This benefits all parties: passengers, freight operators and airlines."
"In terms of horizontal agreements, it is also important to align existing bilateral agreements with EU law, so as to ensure greater legal certainty, increase transparency and provide additional benefits in terms of simplification, while ensuring that all Union airlines will enjoy the same rights."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has come to play a more prominent role in this area, making its approval necessary for the conclusion of these international agreements."
"I am therefore voting for this report, which seeks to set out some general principles and a consistent set of standards."
"It also stresses the importance of keeping Parliament informed, so that it can monitor the process from the beginning, as this will give it the opportunity to express its concerns and priorities."
"I voted in favour of this report for two main reasons."
"Firstly, the report recommends increasing the role of the European Parliament, under new powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the conclusion of international agreements with third countries."
"In this respect, the report highlights the need to strengthen dialogue with the European Commission at the different negotiation stages and in the monitoring of agreements in force."
"Secondly, the report stresses the need to conclude aviation safety agreements with third countries that have a significant aircraft manufacturing industry; this is a crucial requirement considering the legitimate need to ensure ever-greater aviation safety."
"Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has had more powers to intervene in the conclusion of international agreements between the European Union and third countries."
"Brian Simpson's report adopted today will thus enable Parliament's role in international aviation negotiations to be defined better."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament is particularly pressing for agreements concluded by the European Union to include mutual recognition of aviation security and safety standards, as well as better safeguards for the protection of passenger rights."
"I voted in favour of the report on international air agreements under the Treaty of Lisbon, as it highlights the importance of Parliament being 'immediately and fully informed at all stages' of the process of negotiating agreements between the EU and third countries or international organisations."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given Parliament new powers on the approval of international agreements."
"Of these, the international air transport agreements are of particular importance, given the various security and coordination needs involved."
"Assessing an agreement requires criteria based on strict scrutiny and monitoring of the terms of negotiation."
"I hope that the Commission and Parliament can cooperate actively so as to continually improve the quality and rigour of this type of agreement."
"This report by Mr Simpson deals with international air agreements under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
"Since 1 December 2009, with the entry into force of the TFEU, Parliament has seen its powers strengthened and has taken on codecision responsibilities in many areas, including air services."
"In view of this, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has tabled this report, which appears to be extremely positive and timely, setting out some general principles with which I fully agree."
"Parliament is thus able to monitor the whole process from the beginning, through the information given to it by the Commission, especially through the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, and to carefully appraise the agreements it is asked to vote on, whether they are horizontal, comprehensive or safety agreements."
"The international air agreements provided for under the Treaty of Lisbon are supranational agreements intended to overlap with the existing bilateral agreements implemented by the Member States."
"We have reiterated our position against this principle in successive agreements upon which Parliament has delivered opinions, along with criticism of the comprehensive nature of these agreements, which are, without exception, aimed at the liberalisation and privatisation of the sector."
"The rapporteur - who, significantly, is from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - states that 'air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines'."
"However, the reality in this and in other sectors which have seen increased liberalisation, such as rail transport, belies these promises of benefits."
"If there really is a winner from processes of monopolistic concentration in the air transport sector - which is what inevitably follows liberalisation and 'free competition' - it is not the passengers, nor the workers, nor many of the so-called 'flag carrier' airlines, but rather the major European companies in the sector."
"Those are the reasons why we voted against."
"This report relates to international air agreements under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"These are international agreements intended to harmonise and overlap with the existing bilateral agreements implemented by the Member States."
"The rapporteur states that 'air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines, by means [...] of market access'."
"However, the fact is that putting these agreements into practice at EU level has already shown us that such promises of benefits ring hollow for both workers and passengers."
"Most of these agreements have the implicit aim of opening the market and liberalising the sector, motivated by free competition, or of disregarding its distortions, the benefits which the most powerful companies can derive from it and the false environmental solution for the reduction of carbon emissions, and the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading system."
"After the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, there was an extension of the conditions under which the consent of Parliament was required for signing international agreements."
"Air agreements currently belong to this category."
"In the past, Parliament was merely consulted on such agreements."
"The new powers given to Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, however, also bring new responsibilities."
"In my opinion, Parliament must be capable of following the development of negotiations before being faced with the possibility of accepting or rejecting the final wording of individual international agreements."
"Moreover, the relevant criteria for air agreements with third countries should include the possibility of a balanced approach to markets and investment opportunities, as well as fair economic competition in the area of state subsidies and environmental and social standards."
"The new powers established by the Treaty of Lisbon mean that we, too, can have our say on aviation area matters in air agreements."
"The report emphasises fair competition and, hence, the need to monitor, among other things, state funding, while having regard to environmental issues and ensuring a high level of passenger rights."
"We are in favour of all these measures, and so the report has my vote."
"I agreed with this document because the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draw up an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated, both in terms of substance and the procedures the Committee might adopt to ensure that it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations, and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent."
"During today's sitting, I voted in favour of Mr Simpson's report on international air agreements under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In fact, following the Treaty's entry into force, on 1 December 2009, Parliament gained the right to give its consent to agreements covering sectors to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"This is a significant step forward, especially in light of the EU's supposed democratic deficit, if we consider that, previously, Parliament, a body democratically elected by the people of Europe, was consulted on such agreements only after they had been concluded."
"We therefore expect the Commission to respond to our call for it to maintain the flow of information and to provide the responsible committee with comprehensive information about the intention to propose negotiations with a view to concluding and amending international air agreements, so that Parliament as a whole can express its opinion in full knowledge of the facts."
"The Treaty of Lisbon introduces new parliamentary competences, thereby granting the European Parliament greater decision-making powers, along with responsibility for ensuring the smooth flow of business, providing information and guaranteeing citizens' safety."
"Regulatory convergence among the European Parliament's relevant committees, reciprocal recognition of safety and security standards and ensuring the highest possible standard for international air transport agreements provide benefits to passengers and freight operators, in logistical and economic terms, as well as to airlines."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which considers that comprehensive air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines, by means both of market access and of regulatory convergence to promote fair competition, including with regard to state subsidies and social and environmental standards, providing certain standards and conditions are met."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, air agreements require the European Parliament's consent, as they concern a sector to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"We agree with the Committee on Transport and Tourism's idea to set out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated in terms of substance."
"Moreover, the Committee should be well informed throughout the course of negotiations, so that it has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent."
"Parliament therefore needs to follow the process from the outset."
"Comprehensive agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can provide substantial benefits by offering European passengers and freight operators improved services - in terms of both variety and cost - while giving airlines new profit-making opportunities."
"Regulatory convergence can do much to promote fair competition."
"Lastly, we maintain that it is important to open negotiations with important trading partners in Asia, including the People's Republic of China and India, since the economic growth of that entire region makes such agreements ever more significant from the point of view of developing world trade."
"The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon has increased the number of cases in which Parliament's approval is needed to conclude an international agreement."
"Air services agreements now fall into this category, as they cover an area to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism has therefore decided to table this own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated in terms of substance, and of the procedures the committee might adopt in order to remain well informed throughout the course of negotiations and so that it has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the final decision and merely being able to adopt or reject it."
"Parliament's new powers, provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon, bring with them a new responsibility to ensure that Parliament and its competent committee are well informed about the preparation of the agreements to which it will subsequently be asked to give its consent."
"This implies a corresponding responsibility to monitor how negotiations are conducted more closely."
"These assumptions therefore need to be borne in mind when international agreements are being negotiated in future."
"in writing. - The report covers the framework to evaluate individual air agreements, taking into account the changes under the Lisbon Treaty, to be used for all future negotiations, conclusions and parliamentary approval thereof (via consent)."
"Relevant criteria for air agreements with third countries include balanced access to markets and investment opportunities, as well as fair competition in terms of state subsidies, environmental and social standards."
"I voted in favour."
"Comprehensive air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver benefits not only to freight operators and airlines, but also to passengers."
"Above all, such agreements guarantee the same rights to all Union airlines."
"Furthermore, high standards in terms of air safety and security will be applied and these are vitally important to passengers, crew and the whole aviation sector in general."
"Given the benefits of the agreements mentioned, I believe that it is appropriate to lay down general principles to be used when evaluating air transport agreements."
"It is important for every agreement to relax or eliminate restrictions on market access and investment opportunities, to maintain and enhance social and environmental standards, to provide adequate safeguards for data protection and privacy, to include mutual recognition of security standards and ensure a high level of passenger rights."
"Attention should be drawn to the fact that the Commission must take immediate action to address the issue of Siberian overflights and begin negotiations on international air transport agreements with Japan and Russia."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which has been in force since 1 December 2009, has increased the number of cases in which Parliament's approval is needed to conclude international agreements."
"Air services agreements now fall into this category, as they cover an area to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"Previously, it was only necessary to consult Parliament about these agreements."
"In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided to draft an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated by Parliament in terms of substance, rather than being confronted with the final decision and merely being able to adopt or reject it."
"Parliament's new powers, provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon, bring with them new responsibilities to ensure that Parliament and its competent committee are well informed about the preparation of the agreements to which it will subsequently be asked to give its consent."
"This implies a corresponding responsibility to monitor how negotiations are conducted more closely."
"The possibilities identified in this report, which I voted for, can be seen as forming a list of elements which can be adopted according to the particular circumstances of each agreement."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has strengthened its role in the conclusion of international air agreements."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draft an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated, both in terms of substance and in terms of the procedures the Committee might adopt to ensure that it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations, and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent."
"These agreements can be split into three categories: horizontal agreements, which align existing bilateral agreements; comprehensive agreements, which seek to ensure fair competition; and lastly, safety agreements, which are intended to ensure a high level of civil aviation safety."
"Furthermore, the report recommends a set of criteria for assessing the content of the agreements, including balanced access to markets and investment opportunities, and fair competition with regard to state, environmental and social subsidies."
"I voted in favour so that a constant flow of information is maintained and the strengths and weaknesses of these agreements are analysed better."
"As the Treaty of Lisbon has increased the range of Parliament's powers with respect to the conclusion of international agreements, it is necessary, in the process of redefining its status, to offer new forms of legal framework for its action."
"This report appears in this context."
"As Parliament has also come to have powers in relation to air agreements, it is important to ensure that it has access to information throughout the negotiation process."
"Indeed, it cannot simply be involved at the end of the process, whereby its activity is reduced to merely agreeing or disagreeing with the final solution, without having a range of relevant indicators at its disposal in order to make a considered decision."
"Underpinned by the need to involve Parliament throughout the process, it is also necessary to draw attention, even if only in general terms, to aspects such as the terms under which information is provided or the stages at which it should be made available."
"in writing. - I voted in favour."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"Previously, Parliament had only been consulted on such agreements."
"In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draw up an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles on how air agreements should be evaluated, covering both their substance and the procedures the Committee might adopt to ensure it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations, and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent."
"The report sets out some general principles regarding good communication between Parliament and the Commission when international air agreements are adopted and regarding the development of common methods for evaluating those agreements."
"Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has gained additional powers and corresponding responsibilities, and must now monitor the conduct of negotiations and the conclusion of air agreements more closely."
"Given the importance of such agreements, especially in terms of guaranteeing better services for passengers and new opportunities for operators, it is a good idea for Parliament to inform the Commission of its concerns and its assessment criteria at the outset, without waiting until the negotiations have been concluded."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gave Parliament greater rights, one of which is that Parliament's consent is required for concluding international agreements."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism quite often has to assess and deal with various aviation agreements."
"I think that this report will significantly aid and simplify the work of the Committee on Transport and Tourism because it highlights the general principles of how we should assess aviation agreements, both in terms of content and in terms of measures."
"Moreover, this report will help clarify the various aviation agreements and process them in the simplest way, and it states which criteria we should pay attention to and which aspects we should keep track of. In addition, this report will help in applying the process of how to move forward with these aviation agreements and what stages will be needed as the various institutions deal with them."
"I think that this report is necessary, and I therefore supported its adoption."
"in writing. - This report provides for a framework to be established in order that Parliament can undertake its obligations under the Lisbon Treaty in regard to international air agreements."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism were keen to ensure that in dealing with individual agreements with individual sovereign countries, Parliament used the same procedures and guidelines for rapporteurs to work with in order to give us a consistent approach and to give us the opportunity to consider important aspects, including relevant safety and social conditions."
"I shall be voting in favour and would hope that Parliament can support my report so that the proposed framework can be put into operation"
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has institutionalised new areas in which Parliament's approval is necessary for the conclusion of international agreements."
"Agreements on air transport fall into this category, as they are part of the ordinary legislative procedure."
"This requires Parliament to be kept regularly informed, in order to ensure a concerted evaluation of the whole negotiation process, and so that it can express its opinions and priorities at the same time."
"This report contains guidelines on how air agreements should be analysed in terms of content and procedures to be adopted."
"Three categories of agreement are presented which cover different objectives, namely, horizontal agreements, comprehensive agreements and safety agreements."
"I am voting in favour of this agreement as I consider it essential that the position adopted by the European Commission, and stressed in this report, expresses the fact that Parliament should regularly monitor the entire process through the sharing of information, and that the Commission should submit a report analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the existing agreements at least every three years."
"The agreements should be adopted through a fruitful interinstitutional agreement that enables the European institutions to participate actively in them."
"I voted in favour of Mr Simpson's report on international air agreements under the Treaty of Lisbon, bearing in mind that Parliament now has a greater share of responsibility when it comes to negotiating international agreements."
"Furthermore, agreements on air transport with third countries help to develop international air transport and safeguard security of law."
"in writing. - (DE) The result of the new competences given to Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon is that this House will, in future, be presented with international air agreements to evaluate and approve on a more frequent basis."
"The rapporteur therefore proposes that some general principles should be drawn up in order to make such evaluations easier, and also better."
"Although he does recognise the benefits of such agreements in principle, the rapporteur does not forego a differentiated approach and, on several occasions, calls for a constructive dialogue between the Commission and Parliament."
"I welcome the results of today's vote, particularly in view of the fact that I was rapporteur for the document on the air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States, which was a document of particular importance."
"Taken together, aviation markets in the European Union and the United States account for around 60% of the world's air traffic."
"The future opening of the market to EU and US aviation enterprises on a non-discriminatory basis will offer better services to passengers and air transport carriers, will bring significant economic benefits and will create jobs."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament was not involved in the negotiations on the EU-US agreement and so was not able to influence the content of the document."
"This is an unacceptable situation."
"I agree, therefore, with the main thesis of the Simpson report on international air agreements, which has been adopted today."
"The European Parliament should have been involved in the negotiations from the very beginning, or should at least have been kept informed as to their progress."
"I support this report in view of the new elements that have been introduced by the Council, especially with regard to earmarking, greater transparency and incentives for fleet renewal, vehicle capacity and the possibility of more effective variation of infrastructure."
"Eurovignette III will allow the Member States to charge road users, if they choose, for external costs, namely pollution, air and noise, so that the 'polluter pays' principle is introduced to road transport."
"In anticipation of the White Paper, the legislation now envisaged requires the Member States and the Commission to take the next steps towards a more sustainable and interoperational transport system, with a harmonised charging system internalising more external costs."
"With the draft directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructure (the Eurovignette Directive), Member States will now be able to implement charges on air and noise pollution from road transport."
"This measure, which applies the 'polluter pays' principle, aims to encourage the progressive renewal of the lorries which travel on our roads."
"It could also represent a new source of funding for cleaner forms of transport such as rail and waterways."
"I therefore voted in favour of Saïd El Khadraoui's report."
"However, I call for Member States to exercise restraint when implementing the Eurovignette: this must not jeopardise the commercial and financial soundness of haulage companies or companies which use haulage."
"Most Irish goods sold on the EU market are transported on the road network and therefore, I voted against the measures recommended in this report because they would impose excessive costs on Irish hauliers, exporters and producers."
"The Eurovignette Directive already involves charges, but Member States are not obliged to impose these charges."
"The Eurovignette is currently in operation on 15 000 km of European motorways, including half of the EU's tolled motorways."
"While I am in favour of addressing air and noise pollution and of encouraging people to use cleaner vehicles, if this directive were to be extended and tolls for noise and air pollution were to be included, Irish hauliers taking Irish exports to Europe would suffer greatly as a consequence."
"Many Irish goods are exported internationally and the additional costs proposed in the report could inflict huge damage on Irish export and transport companies, and it could be a fatal blow to those small businesses that currently are achieving only a small profit margin."
"I voted in favour of this joint position on the Eurovignette Directive presented at second reading by the Council and Parliament."
"The directive's main objectives are to allow Member States to charge road users for some external costs, in other words, to apply the 'polluter pays' principle, and also to give Member States additional possibilities to make their national road charging systems more efficient."
"I welcome the goals of reducing pollution and implementing the 'polluter pays' principle in the area of road transport."
"I also supported the proposal for revenue obtained from the Eurovignette charge to be earmarked for investment in road infrastructure and to be used to make transport greener."
"The promotion of sustainable transport is a key element of the common transport policy."
"To this end, we should reduce the contribution the transport sector makes to climate change and the negative impact of transport, in particular, congestion, which impedes mobility, and air and noise pollution, which damage health and the environment."
"Although I welcome the agreement that has been reached on the Eurovignette Directive, I am nonetheless far from being fully satisfied."
"By endorsing the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council, we are putting an end to long years of negotiation."
"This is certainly a step in the right direction but it is a minimalistic agreement that lacks teeth!"
"Indeed, Member States will only have the possibility, but in no way will they be obliged, of making heavy goods vehicles pay for the external costs they cause."
"The fact remains that the idea is now out there and that is the real positive point which enables me to vote for the compromise."
"By introducing the 'polluter pays' principle for heavy goods vehicles, the directive paves the way for the recognition in our public policies of the internalisation of external costs caused by transport."
"The principle of transparency of revenue and investment is also on the record which, we hope, will be a precedent in assessing public policies: indeed, Member States will have to report to the Commission on a regular basis."
"However, the low allocation threshold of revenue to the trans-European transport networks (TENs) (15%) is regrettable."
"In addition, we will have to ensure that the commitment made by the Member States to invest revenue in sustainable projects has been kept."
"The report we are discussing today is particularly important because it provides for the amendment of Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles."
"I believe that the submission of this proposal for a new directive, the fruit of the compromise reached between the Hungarian Presidency, the Commission and Parliament, is very damaging to the Italian economy, since Italy transports around a third - or approximately EUR 200 billion a year - of all the traded goods hauled on Europe's roads."
"Once the directive has been implemented in Europe's countries of transit, goods imported to and exported from Italy will be more exposed to the burden of additional charges."
"I share the Italian Government's highly critical view: it believes that, at a time of great economic difficulty such as we are experiencing now, the political decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market is far from wise."
"To my mind, the small breakthroughs that were achieved with the compromise have no real impact on a text that is highly detrimental to both the Italian system and the haulage industry."
"What is more, the effectiveness of the measure has not been proven: road transport and its associated pollution costs will continue to increase until an intermodal infrastructure network has been developed."
"in writing. - I voted against this amendment as it is imperative that the Commission is not permitted to establish revenue-raising capabilities, even via an indirect charge, particularly without the unanimous assent of the Council."
"In the UK, we do not currently subscribe to the Eurovignette scheme."
"However, the Westminster Government is looking into rolling out HGV charges in accordance with European law by 2015."
"The Commission, however, has reserved the right to make the carbon charge obligatory by 2013."
"I do not wish to see UK citizens in any way contributing to any form of EU tax."
"The levying of a charge on heavy goods vehicles is a measure which penalises the outlying countries of the EU, such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal."
"In general, these are the countries hardest hit by the financial crisis, which has led to a fiscal and economic crisis."
"In view of this, I am voting against the tabled report, as I believe the uneven application of such charges is unjust, given that outlying countries would generate most of the revenue, to the benefit of the countries of central Europe."
"I voted against the El Khadraoui report on charging heavy goods vehicles as the proposal allows tariff barriers to be introduced, which will increase the costs for freight operators in the peripheral Member States."
"The directive will also allow Member States to offer compensation in exchange for these charges, which could result in the distortion of competition between operators from different EU Member States."
"Parliament has just given its go-ahead for new rules on road transport charges, thereby making it possible to ensure the development and funding of a more suitable transport policy with regard to environmental requirements pertaining to pollution and noise."
"While road haulage companies will now have to pay the cost of air and noise pollution generated by lorries, Member States will, in return, be obliged to reinvest the revenues obtained from these charges in pan-European transport networks and, especially, in more effective and less polluting transport systems."
"These charges are a step forward, but they are not enough."
"It is time that Member States committed to implementing a genuine freight development policy and thus to making consistent use of all rail and road transport infrastructure."
"The European Parliament has today approved the revision of the Eurovignette Directive by a large majority."
"The text stipulates that heavy goods vehicles shall pay the cost of air and noise pollution."
"The agreement approved today in effect authorises Member States to charge road haulage companies for the cost of air and noise pollution, in addition to charges on the use of motorway infrastructure."
"While this is a significant revision, it only represents a small step in the right direction, because the regulations are non-binding."
"I therefore still look forward to seeing new proposals which would make these new measures compulsory, which would include in them the cost of all the environmental damage caused and which would extend the 'polluter pays' principle to all forms of transport."
"The text also presses for use to be actually made of the revenues from toll collection."
"In this regard, Parliament has obliged Member States to invest part of the returns from toll collection in the improvement of traffic flow and mobility infrastructure."
"It should also be possible to allocate the proceeds of these charges to projects such as those which reduce air or even noise pollution."
"I voted against the report on the charging of heavy goods vehicles as I believe that levying charges for the use of infrastructure could have negative repercussions for the European economy, particularly in outlying countries."
"Bearing in mind that several taxes and charges are already levied on the road transport sector, especially excise duties on fuel, and in view of the current economic climate, I think that the internalisation of the sector's costs should be considered so that these measures might merit greater consensus between the various players affected."
"The revision of the Eurovignette Directive requires that heavy good vehicles circulating on European motorways be subject to the 'polluter pays' principle, allowing the Member States to include the cost of noise and air pollution in national tolls."
"This additional cost is likely to be between three or four cents per vehicle per kilometre."
"At a time when the European economy is weak and competitiveness is more vital than ever, this principle may serve to make freight transport even more expensive, especially for outlying countries, for which the price of transportation is added to the cost of the goods."
"These countries are not only forced to absorb the cost of fuel, but will now have to do the same with the additional costs of tolls, thereby losing competitiveness."
"Without trying to underestimate the environmental issue, this does not seem to me to be the time to burden European companies with another charge."
"The levying of a charge on heavy goods vehicles is a measure which penalises the outlying countries of the EU while, at the same time, providing additional revenue for the countries of central Europe."
"The text that came out of the trialogue is less negative for Portugal than the proposal of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as it reduces the variation to 175% and the peak period for charges to five hours, extending the exemption of less polluting vehicles for another year, hence, to four years."
"However, the levying of this charge will remain a reality and will bring an increase in the existing costs for the outlying countries of the EU."
"These new provisions of the Eurovignette Directive will allow Member States to charge heavy goods vehicles an amount equal to the cost of noise and air pollution caused by traffic, in addition to the infrastructure charge, at the tolls."
"This additional cost is likely to average three or four cents per vehicle per kilometre."
"Less polluting vehicles will remain exempt."
"I voted against this report's proposal as I believe it will harm the outlying Member States."
"The very high dependence on road transport is a real problem; in Portugal, dependence on this mode of transport is even greater than the EU average."
"This is the case for environmental and public health reasons, due to the high levels of pollution associated with it, and for energy reasons related to dwindling oil reserves and growing difficulty of access to this commodity."
"It is therefore essential to promote the diversification of modes of freight transport, particularly with a strong commitment to rail."
"Unfortunately, not only has this investment not been made, but in some countries, including Portugal, we have also seen divestment in this type of transport."
"This divestment tends to increase following processes of liberalisation and privatisation."
"This report addresses some of these issues, but it goes no further than seeking to levy a new charge on heavy goods vehicles, to be added to the existing charges, some of which have been recently increased in Portugal."
"The effectiveness of these is doubtful in terms of pursuing the stated objectives, while they represent an additional burden and may result in many companies going out of business given the current economic and social crisis."
"We are aware that the very high dependence on road transport is a real problem; in Portugal, dependence on this mode of transport is even greater than the EU average."
"This situation needs to change, whether for environmental or public health reasons, due to the high levels of pollution associated with it, or for energy reasons related to the dwindling oil reserves and growing difficulty of access to this commodity."
"It is therefore essential to promote the diversification of modes of freight transport, particularly with a strong commitment to rail."
"However, not only have some countries being failing to make this commitment, but in some countries, including Portugal, we have also seen divestment in this type of transport, which tends to increase following the process of liberalisation and privatisation."
"This report address some of these issues, but it then limits itself to seeking to levy a new tax on heavy goods vehicles, to be added to the existing ones, some of which have been increased recently in Portugal, such as the 'shadow tolls'."
"The effectiveness of these is doubtful in terms of the effective pursuit of the stated objectives, while they represent an additional burden and may result in many companies going out of business given the current economic and social crisis."
"Some time has passed since the adoption of the European Parliament's opinion on the Eurovignette III Directive at first reading."
"The directive should enable Member States - if they so desire - to collect fees from road users for certain (limited) external costs, so that the 'polluter pays' principle can finally be introduced in the area of road transport."
"It also provides Member States with additional possibilities for increasing the effectiveness of national systems for collecting road tolls, which is a better instrument for managing demand in the transport sector."
"The opinion of the Council confirmed these objectives, and it is now also desirable for the Commission to take steps which will lead to the lasting sustainable development of transport, cooperation, a harmonised system of tolls and the further internalisation of external costs."
"in writing. - The reality is that this proposal will have a disproportionate impact upon the peripheral Member States in the European Union, such as Ireland, as centrally located Member States have the option of switching to rail."
"It is estimated by the Irish Exporters Association that a truck travelling from Ireland to mainland Europe via Holyhead and Dover will incur a road use charge of EUR 120 and an external cost of EUR 30."
"Therefore, a roundtrip will incur a fee of EUR 300 as a result of this legislation."
"The main export sectors that will be affected include pharmaceuticals, ICT, medical devices, dairy and other food products."
"Moreover, the road haulage sector employs over 30 000 people in Ireland."
"The bottom line is that these new charges will increase the cost of transporting Irish exports into European markets."
"I voted against this report as the EU should be seeking ways to improve our competitiveness in line with the Europe 2020 strategy instead of introducing legislation which threatens our competitiveness."
"Parliament's approval of the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles is a step forward in the protection of European citizens' health, and a commitment to lessen the harmful effects of pollution caused by such vehicles."
"The 'polluter pays' principle has been introduced for the first time in this sector in order to encourage safer and more sustainable transport, and hence to promote alternatives such as rail transport."
"Under the compromise reached, however, due consideration must also be given to the protection of the haulage industry, which must not be penalised excessively."
"Member States must therefore strive to make more effective use of the revenues collected under the Eurovignette, for example, by investing in infrastructure improvements and encouraging the use of less polluting haulage vehicles, so as to ensure that the benefits of the directive are enjoyed by all the sectors involved."
"I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Saïd El Khadraoui, on the revision of the EU Eurovignette legislation, which will allow heavy good vehicles to be charged."
"For the first time, the 'polluter pays' principle will be applied to road transport, and it will be possible to charge heavy goods vehicles for noise and air pollution when they use the EU's motorways."
"This is an innovative initiative which I welcome, as it allows environmental and social costs to be taken into account and is not limited merely to infrastructure costs."
"It is, nevertheless, regrettable that the European Parliament's ambitious plans for stringent environmental requirements have been hindered by the Council of Ministers, under the pretext of overly high additional costs."
"Despite all of this, this report is a genuine step forward in environmental terms."
"I endorsed this document because its objective is to charge heavy goods vehicles depending on the time of day they are travelling, during or outwith rush hour, and depending on the sound emitted and cylinder capacity."
"At least 15% of the money collected in charges is invested in other projects related to CO2 reduction."
"It is good that today, we are ready to reduce climate change and, in the area of road transport, we are finally striving to apply the 'polluter pays' principle."
"Undoubtedly, this will give Member States additional possibilities to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means that a better transport-demand-management instrument can be developed."
"However, I still believe that these instruments are only economically beneficial and favourable for a few central transit European Union Member States, and therefore completely unfavourable or much less favourable for a large number of European Union Member States, situated near the European Union's borders, both in the east, the south, the west and the north."
"I therefore believe that it would be worth us fully evaluating this aspect, weighing it up again, and only then adopting it."
"I would like to give my full endorsement to the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles."
"I would, in particular, like to support a provision which is very important for Europe's environment."
"I hope that the lower charges for vehicles which are less polluting will motivate owners of transport firms who have not done so to renew their fleets."
"Furthermore, crops which grow in the vicinity of heavily used roads would be much less exposed to pollution from exhaust fumes."
"I think the increased charges for driving at peak hours are another positive feature."
"Thanks to these restrictions, we will achieve greater safety on the roads and better driving conditions for all road users."
"These restrictions will also allow improvements to the state of the infrastructure, which suffers the greatest damage at those very hours of peak traffic."
"I voted against the proposed compromise text, a position in keeping with that of the Italian Government, which has already voiced its opposition to the proposal in the EU Council."
"Imposing a further system of taxation on hauliers will deal a very heavy blow to a sector which underpins Italy's trading system."
"Increasing the costs borne by this sector means increasing the burden on society as a whole and penalising our goods, for which there will be a corresponding fall in demand."
"I do not believe that this compromise is the right answer, particularly for a country such as Italy, for example, which is a departure point for transport flows that create wealth for our national system and that need to be safeguarded through the identification of appropriate tools that will combat air and noise pollution, but which have due regard for its specific structural and logistical characteristics."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the charging of heavy goods vehicles as it ratifies an agreement which was difficult to reach, on the revision of the Eurovignette Directive."
"This 1999 directive, revised in 2006, aims to harmonise the charging of heavy good vehicles."
"The adopted revision is a first step in internalising external costs in road transport and, hence, a step towards putting the 'polluter pays' principle into practice."
"Air and noise pollution from traffic will thus be charged electronically, at a rate of three to four cents per kilometre depending on the vehicle's Euro class, the type of road and the level of congestion."
"This revision will henceforth allow traffic to be managed better through increased charges in peak periods (not exceeding 175% over five hours), but also provides for a proportionate decrease in low peak charges to avoid penalising road haulage companies financially."
"Finally, the resolution encourages Member States to use the amounts raised to finance certain types of sustainable transport projects."
"I voted in favour of Eurovignettes because I think that solutions of this kind can ensure full harmonisation of the European system for charging heavy goods vehicles, thus facilitating efficient travel through Member States without unnecessary delays."
"In my opinion, incorporation of the 'polluter pays' principle will ensure a reduction of the pollution and noise caused by heavy goods vehicles not fitted with engines which comply with the Euro V and VI standards, as these engines are not subject to road charges."
"In addition, the principle has been established that Member States will be able to specify the use to be made of revenue generated from tolls collected and that at least 15% will have to be used for financial support for TEN-T projects."
"This will ensure greater transport sustainability."
"in writing. - I voted for this report revising 'Eurovignette' road haulage tax rules, which will make it possible for Member States to charge hauliers for air and noise pollution costs, in addition to motorway tolls."
"This directive will ensure that revenue from these charges is used to improve the performance of transport systems and cut pollution."
"Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures allows Member States, if they so wish, to also charge road users for some external costs."
"This offers them additional opportunities to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means a better transport-demand-management instrument."
"We believe that, at a time of great economic difficulty, the political decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market purely in order to make money is not very wise."
"Furthermore, the way in which this approach penalises the geographically more peripheral Member States, countries of origin, departure or destination of goods, for the benefit of 'central' and transit countries, is unacceptable."
"Lastly, when establishing the principle, no thought has been given to the impact of this measure on traffic flows and, hence, on existing concessions, meaning that there is a risk of the traffic going elsewhere."
"The effectiveness of the measure has not been proven: road transport and its associated pollution costs will continue to increase, which is why we, the Italian delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), are against this measure."
"This directive makes provision for Member States levying a toll on heavy goods vehicles which includes an amount equal to the cost of noise and air pollution as a result of traffic, in addition to the infrastructure charge."
"I believe that the 'polluter pays' principle is not a solution, as it limits itself to leaving the decision up to the market."
"Authorising and legitimising pollution if it is economically viable for the company is not a path to sustainability."
"I believe that the EU's priority should be to impose more stringent measures on pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles and to commit decisively to rail freight."
"Rather than solving the problem of pollution, this directive exacerbates the inequality between Member States by placing a greater burden on outlying countries such as Portugal, which are exporters but are not crossed by major transport routes."
"I voted against for these reasons."
"This report deserves credit for demanding accountability from Member States."
"Firstly, for demanding accountability on the relief which Member States grant to small truck manufacturers."
"This is a good thing since these irresponsible practices must cease."
"Secondly, for demanding accountability on the revenues generated by the Eurovignette."
"Opacity cannot be the rule there either."
"These revenues must be exclusively destined for environmental policies."
"It is, however, regrettable that the text does not go even further."
"It includes almost nothing on the relief granted to the manufacturers of Euro VI vehicles."
"What is worse, it promotes bringing the Eurovignette under the carbon emission trading scheme."
"I am voting in favour of this text to encourage further work to be done and to lend my approval to the Eurovignette concept, whilst regretting these two serious shortcomings."
"Environmental concerns can never be jeopardised, but at the same time, they cannot be detached from economic issues; still less in this time of crisis that we are still experiencing, and which continues to buffet the countries of southern Europe, especially my country, Portugal."
"In view of this, I cannot agree with the adoption of the 'polluter pays' principle, as this situation will greatly affect those working in the freight transport sector in outlying countries, in particular, Portugal, but not in the richer countries of central and northern Europe."
"in writing. - Eurovignette III will allow Member States - if they so wish - to charge road users for external costs (air, noise, pollution), so that finally, the 'polluter pays' principle is introduced in road transport."
"Taking into account that the tax system is opaque and irrational, I voted against."
"In times of increasing globalisation in which the volume of traffic is also rising massively, it is exactly those Member States with sensitive regions such as in the area crossing the Alps that have an interest in charging road users for certain external costs according to the 'polluter pays' principle."
"At the same time, this should also give rise to an instrument to better manage traffic demand."
"This report takes a pragmatic approach in order to reconcile the numerous and varying wishes."
"In this context, however, we must not overlook the various initiatives to pave the way for so-called giga- or megaliners, which are associated with high infrastructure costs."
"It is also the case that, hitherto, lip service alone has been paid to moving freight traffic from road to rail."
"We should also not forget these factors, including when it comes to the idea in the proposal of earmarking the revenue from infrastructure charges."
"As far as the incentives for fleet renewal are concerned, we must also consider that we must not unilaterally burden our local carriers and fleet-owners with strict environmental and safety regulations, only for the low-cost competitors to come riding over the border in foul scrap vehicles."
"However, since this report makes very reasonable arguments in this regard, I voted in favour."
"I decided to vote against this proposal because it would have a very negative impact on the smallest haulage companies in particular."
"Yes, it is right to combat pollution and try to ease traffic congestion, but introducing another tax increase is definitely not the best solution in my view."
"By applying this 'Eurovignette', the chances are that only the largest haulage companies - that is, those with more resources at their disposal - will manage to survive."
"Many small businesses, especially in Italy, risk having to leave the market because of the excessive charges they would face, and this would certainly have a serious impact on employment too."
"My hope, therefore, is that other European countries will adopt the same position as the Italian Government, which has already confirmed that it will not be applying this measure."
"The crisis has caused great damage to the haulage industry, and this new tax will certainly not contribute much to its recovery as far as I can see."
"I do not agree with the proposal to charge heavy goods vehicles according to air and noise pollution."
"I feel that it would be inappropriate to create yet another additional tax burden for hauliers, who have been badly affected by the financial crisis."
"The charge will reflect not just road infrastructure costs, the vehicle's pollution category and length of journey, but also the level of pollution, noise and congestion."
"Moreover, the charge will not only be applied to motorways in the trans-European road network, but also to other motorways and important roads."
"Attention should be drawn to the fact that such regulation will have a negative impact on European road hauliers' revenue and increase delivery times."
"Due to the reasons mentioned, there will be an increase in transportation costs and the price of freight transportation."
"Furthermore, a toll may significantly reduce the demand for road transport."
"The new Eurovignette Directive, which is intended to encourage the implementation of harmonised charging systems in the Member States in order to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of heavy goods vehicles, will end up penalising certain peripheral Member States, such as Italy, which are countries of departure or destination of goods."
"This is why I voted against the report, which amends the 1999 directive."
"Instead of increasing competition and laying down common rules for the Internal Market, the new directive distorts competition for the benefit of a few Member States located at the heart of freight traffic in Europe."
"Under the pretext of reducing CO2 emissions, a tax is being introduced with the aim of discouraging road transport in favour of rail and intermodal transport."
"The directive, as it is conceived, is very harmful to the entire haulage system, at a time of economic stagnation when we need to implement measures to revive the sector."
"This report presents a pragmatic approach to not wasting any more time on the adoption of the so-called Eurovignette III Directive on the levying of charges on heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures."
"It is intended to achieve the best possible compromise between Parliament and the Council."
"The proposed amendments are the result of consultations with the political groups."
"In view of this, I voted in favour of this report, as it will allow the Member States, if they so wish, to also charge road users for some limited external costs, with the aim of introducing the 'polluter pays' principle to road transport."
"It will also give Member States more opportunities to make their respective national road pricing systems more efficient, which means a better instrument for transport demand management."
"These objectives were confirmed by the Council's position."
"It is worth highlighting the proposal to earmark the revenue from charges on external cost and infrastructure to be used for sustainable transport and trans-European networks, in particular."
"Effective earmarking of this revenue, which increases accountability and transparency, will not only increase public acceptance but will also ensure the reduction of external costs on road transport."
"Under the amended Directive 1999/62/EC, Member States will also be able to charge road users for some (limited) external costs, so that finally, the 'polluter pays' principle is introduced in road transport."
"This offers Member States additional opportunities to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means a better transport-demand-management instrument."
"Road toll charges for the transport sector will therefore reflect the cost of noise and air pollution, as well as infrastructure costs."
"These costs will still admit of some exceptions, provided that the Member State requesting them has a good reason for doing so."
"There will be incentives to promote the renewal of the fleet of heavy goods vehicles, derogations for heavy goods vehicles fitted with less polluting engines and, finally, the toll charge may vary according to the time of travel."
"This is to ensure that heavy goods vehicles can avoid certain road sections during peak hours."
"The revenues generated from this toll charge increase will have to be reinvested in transport infrastructure, with at least 15% to be earmarked initially for trans-European transport projects."
"For these reasons, and for the sake of a better road system in Europe, I voted in favour."
"This directive makes provision for Member States levying a toll on heavy goods vehicles which includes an amount equal to the cost of noise and air pollution as a result of traffic, in addition to the infrastructure charge."
"I believe that the 'polluter pays' principle is not a solution, as it limits itself to leaving the decision up to the market."
"Authorising and legitimising pollution if it is economically viable for the company is not a path to sustainability."
"I believe that the EU's priority should be to impose more stringent measures on pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles and to commit decisively to rail freight."
"Rather than solving the problem of pollution, this directive exacerbates the inequality between Member States by placing a greater burden on outlying countries such as Portugal, which are exporters but are not crossed by major transport routes."
"I voted against for these reasons."
"The proposal for revision of the Eurovignette Directive, which is at issue here, is aimed at introducing the 'polluter pays' principle to road transport, allowing the Member States to include the cost of noise and air pollution in national tolls, which means the levying of yet another charge on heavy goods vehicles."
"This measure penalises the outlying countries of the European Union, which is particularly onerous in the context of the financial crisis that we are currently experiencing."
"For these reasons, I voted against this report."
"I voted in favour of this compromise on the revision of the Eurovignette Directive, which aims to set 'polluter pays' road tolls for heavy goods vehicles."
"Member States will then be able to integrate in taxes or tolls levied the actual costs incurred by traffic-based air and noise pollution, whereas up to now, only infrastructure-related costs could be charged."
"The compromise deal falls short of the European Parliament's ambitions and this alone will not revolutionise road transport, for which the industry and Member States are clearly not yet ready to shoulder the actual costs of their ecological footprint."
"The average additional cost to hauliers should not exceed 4 euro cents per vehicle per kilometre, and the least polluting vehicles, driving during off-peak times, would be exempt."
"And yet this reform had been consigned to oblivion before the Belgian Presidency put it back on the Council's table."
"I welcome the progress made as a positive first step towards a more sustainable road transport system."
"The reason we have voted in favour is because we refuse to accept the fallacious arguments put forward by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the People's Party (PP) on the industry's competitiveness."
"Any gain in competitiveness also requires generating incentives for investment in more efficient means of transport, fair rules of competition, and internalising the social and environmental costs of general economic activity."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has always strived for cost internalisation and for all goods to have a cost that is fair in social and environmental terms."
"We are aware that the minimal proposal falls short of our aspirations by a long stretch, but our vote is also an expression of our confidence that the process will not end here and that an important step has been taken by acknowledging the need to internalise transport costs."
"We also remind the Member States that they must go even further, bringing in legislation to introduce fairer and more efficient tax systems that include all the external costs mentioned, and we urge the Commission to continue to work so that its future proposal on this matter may prove more ambitious."
"The recommendation is the last stage in the procedural process of amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (Eurovignette)."
"It is the fruit of lengthy consultations and compromises with the various political groups."
"Charging users for some associated external costs enables Member States to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means they are better able to manage transport demand."
"Furthermore, the 'polluter pays' principle helps to make users in the sector more aware of their responsibilities."
"To conclude, the public will be more supportive if the additional revenue generated from infrastructure and external costs is allocated transparently and effectively, and this would also serve to reduce the external costs of road transport more quickly."
"The taxation of heavy goods vehicles, which was debated today immediately prior to the vote, is another example of how what was originally a very good principle has, in the end, remained relatively weak and has lost much of its impact."
"I think that the taxes collected should have been directed much more towards developing transport infrastructure, but unfortunately, as often happens, the Council really does not have any good ideas in this regard."
"Many countries see in all this an opportunity to gain extra tax revenues which can be put to many other uses."
"It is a very positive development that the adoption of this directive will end the situation in Estonia in which vehicles from other countries do not pay the tax in Estonia, but our vehicles pay in other countries."
"Even though this report has become weaker in many respects during the proceedings, and that Parliament has had to give in on several provisions, this is still a big step forward, and I feel that I must give it my full support."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"It is a compromise based on the 'polluter pays' principle, in other words, the principle of making it possible to charge for certain external costs of transport, in the form of pollution, noise and traffic congestion, for example."
"Implementing the external costs of transport is a step in the right direction."
"in writing. - El Khadraoui has done a great job on this report."
"The only way that we can make progress in fighting climate change is responsible reports such as this one which hold those accountable who cause the most pollution and which is why I was able to support it."
"The charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, under the terms of the European Parliament document voted on in plenary today, represents an increase in costs related to the movement of this type of transport."
"The Eurovignette is a measure which penalises the outlying countries of the EU at a time when those countries are undergoing a period of economic and financial difficulty, whilst, at the same time, providing additional revenue for the countries of central Europe."
"The review of the directive in line with Parliament's position will have considerable negative effects on competitiveness and economic development for several Member States, such as Portugal."
"While acknowledging that the final text adopted today in Strasbourg is less negative than the text that was previously agreed in parliamentary committee, the imposition of this charge will still become a reality and will mean an increase in existing costs for the outlying countries of the EU."
"For these reasons, as a matter of national interest and as a member of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, I voted against the document tabled in plenary."
"in writing. - I abstained on the Eurovignette vote today."
"I abstained because, in the case of Catalonia, what is proposed would penalise a lot of small and medium enterprises that do not have the option of putting goods and products on trains - in particular, because of the difference of gauge, which constitutes a physical barrier to completion of the Internal Market - and would damage their business greatly."
"Any new EU rules on charging heavy goods vehicles must maintain a balance between the environmental needs and economic interests of the new Member States."
"Lithuania is a valuable transit country for Europe."
"Freight transportation and hard working lorry drivers have become synonymous with our country."
"According to data from the Lithuanian Road Administration, the number of heavy goods vehicles on principle routes has tripled in the last decade and they are helping to form the backbone of our economy."
"Lithuania has already been racked by the financial crisis and a rise in transport costs would be a heavy blow."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Member States should be given opportunities to make their national road charging systems more efficient."
"I am familiar with the issues of pollution mentioned in this report and I take them very seriously, but additional charges for air and noise pollution are not the answer."
"The problem is much greater than the report suggests."
"In many EU Member States, road infrastructure is in need of further development."
"At the same time, in Lithuania, the funding earmarked for road management and development has dropped by more than 20% in the last few years."
"I endorsed adoption of the directive."
"I think the decision to extend the financing of Eurovignettes by external costs, in other words, by the costs of environmental pollution and noise, is more advisable than the previous version, which was restricted only to covering the costs of road infrastructure."
"The directive is favourable to transit countries, so MEPs from Poland should be particularly keen on its adoption."
"It is also worth stressing the fact that the charges are to be lower the higher the ecological category of the heavy goods vehicle."
"Fortunately, vehicles with a maximum permissible laden weight of 3.5-12 tonnes and car drivers will be exempt from the charges."
"The structure of tolls will depend on the time of day, which, in my opinion, will help to discourage people from using sections of road which are at risk of congestion during peak periods."
"Another important provision of the directive is the one which concerns the way in which income from tolls is spent."
"This money is to be reinvested in transport infrastructure of any kind, while a minimum of 15% of the revenues are to be earmarked for TEN-T projects."
"I think we also need long-term measures which will bring about convergence in the methods which all charging systems of the Member States use to calculate external costs."
"This could guarantee transparency in the signals given to the European road haulage sector."
"In the light of positive experiences in Switzerland since the introduction of the performance-based HGV levy in 2001, there are no objections to the new directive."
"Journey numbers have fallen by 10% in Switzerland since 2001, while the quantity of goods transported has risen by 60% and it has proven possible to reduce emissions - a win-win scenario."
"The earmarking of revenues is aimed at promoting acceptance by the public and reducing external road transport costs."
"I voted against the text presented by the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, which permits the levy of a surcharge for air and noise pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles."
"While I agree with the 'polluter pays' principle, levying additional motorway toll charges on international road traffic, particularly without the obligation to use the revenues for investment in infrastructure improvements, is somewhat questionable at a time of economic crisis."
"Moreover, the adopted text does not help those Member States, such as Italy, that suffer geographical barriers, making it more costly for them to transport goods for import and export."
"This report has been adopted, taking into account the fact that, during the necessary negotiations, the rapporteur had the opportunity to ensure that a review clause would be included in the regulation, concerning the possibility of introducing new models covering a variety of environmental goods following an implementation report by the Commission."
"This review should take place by 2013."
"In addition, the possibility of providing estimates was included, enabling gaps to be filled in cases where Member States have not submitted their data on time."
"A scientifically sound approach to the shortage of resources and to the ecosystem is crucial to the sustainable economic development of the European Union."
"Environmental economic accounts provide a significant database for environmental policy decisions."
"The need for these accounts arises because of the crucial functions the environment has in terms of economic performance and ensuring the welfare of the European Union's citizens."
"These functions include providing natural resources for production and consumption activities, waste absorption by environmental media and environmental services offering life support."
"It is of paramount importance that these economic and environmental accounts are actively used in all relevant EU policy making as a key input to impact assessments, action plans, legislative proposals and other significant products of the policy process."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The environmental accounts show the interaction between business, household and environmental factors."
"This is why they must contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making available data about the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Politics is all about finding the best possible solutions to any problems that arise ..."
"How can this be achieved, however, if the problems and their potential solutions are not fully understood?"
"This is a fundamental issue in particular, but not solely, for environmental policy."
"Political decision makers must therefore have at their disposal data that is both reliable and as exhaustive as possible on the modern world and the environmental situation."
"That was the conclusion reached by the European Council in June 2006, when it called on the European Union and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development."
"I welcome this initiative and the European Commission's proposal, as it will help improve our knowledge of air emissions, environmental taxes, and so on."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"A sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available."
"Hitherto at EU level, key policy initiatives for environmental accounts include the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the EU sustainable development strategy and various sectoral policy initiatives related to the Cardiff process, covering areas such as climate change, sustainable transport, nature and biodiversity, health and the environment, natural resource use and waste management and the international dimension of sustainable development."
"In its June 2006 conclusions, the European Council called on the Union and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development."
"National accounts should therefore be supplemented with integrated environmental economic accounts providing data that is fully consistent."
"To this end, it is necessary for every Member State to collect harmonised and comprehensive data and for the system to be fully harmonised at EU level."
"A sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available."
"Consequently, mandatory data collection by Member States is necessary."
"Environmental data currently available at European level should be expanded in the medium term by adding information to facilitate policy assessment."
"Recycling and prevention of waste, air emissions and climate change, as well as sustainable consumption and production, would be monitored much more easily if high quality data were available about the interaction between environmental and economic factors."
"While this information can be gleaned from environmental accounts, it is essential for this purpose to ensure the cooperation of all Member States and full data harmonisation at EU level."
"The desired objectives should therefore be set out more coherently and the future direction to be taken clearly established with regard to the development of environmental economic accounts."
"These accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making data available concerning the environmental impact of economic activities."
"The relevant information could provide an extremely valuable basis for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"I welcome Mr Leinen's proposal and voted in favour of it."
"European environmental policy is becoming increasingly important in the light of the economic crisis and the EU 2020 strategy, and a sound assessment of that policy is only possible if reliable data is available."
"Environmental data are the only means of assessing environmental policy, and they should be supplemented in the medium term by additional reliable data."
"Furthermore, the data could be monitored more easily if high quality information were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors: environmental economic accounts could contribute to policy evaluation by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Such information will be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"Member States will have to use common methods, classifications and rules laid down in a binding common framework, and in that respect, it is very much to be hoped that these new measures will not involve any additional costs or more red tape."
"As the rapporteur maintains, this proposal for a regulation is a step towards more comprehensive environmental accounting."
"For the sake of sustainable development, it is vital to make the right decisions on matters of environmental policy, namely, those based on reliable data."
"I therefore support and welcome the proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council on European environmental economic accounts, as I believe that this will contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making data available concerning the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Measuring the air quality in our cities and performing an in-depth analysis of that measurement would be a step towards more transparent policy making."
"Although it relates to chemical and physical factors which, at first glance, are of little use in communication between politicians and voters, this indicator is, in fact, the result of numerous economic decisions: it indicates the concentration of polluting economic activities, the composition of the energy mix used for productive activities and for heating homes and offices, the use of motor vehicles and the management of road infrastructure and traffic, the insulation of buildings and the quality of the materials used, and the existence or otherwise of green spaces, to cite just a few examples."
"Air quality also has a significant impact on health expenditure, and particularly on expenditure on respiratory and oncology units."
"It is very clear, then, that an environmental indicator can be turned into an economic and political indicator."
"Furthermore, it can point to new mechanisms for discouraging irresponsible behaviour and for financing worthy projects."
"These links help politicians to take better decisions in the public interest."
"The first step is to establish the correct methods, and it is good that it is being taken."
"This proposed regulation dates back to a decision of the European Council in June 2006."
"At the time, the EU decided to extend existing national accounts, and the statistical data to be compiled, to key aspects of sustainable development."
"To supplement national accounts and data, the Commission proposed a regulation to establish European environmental economic accounts."
"In compliance with the Commission's proposal, Member States should therefore be provided with a methodology, common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, which should be put together within a binding framework for each of them."
"While I think that priority should be given firstly to data already available (that is, collected at regional, national and European level), I believe that if the need arises for additional modules, which does not entail unnecessary bureaucracy or additional costs, in this case, Eurostat should be allowed to gather data from Member States with a view to setting up environmental economic accounts at European level."
"It is for this reason that I also welcomed the introduction of these new European environmental economic accounts, and proposed that their scope should be extended to other modules."
"I voted in favour of the report on EU environmental economic accounts as I believe that there need to be indicators for sustainable development and public welfare, beyond gross domestic product (GDP), that enable the evaluation of European environmental policy."
"In the words of the rapporteur, 'Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities'."
"This idea is important, and is indeed the only way of obtaining concrete data about the real impact of environmental policy."
"If, on the one hand, economic growth cannot neglect the environment, it is also true that environmental policy cannot neglect or lose sight of economic activity and the competitiveness of European business and industry."
"I always see the problem of sustainable development through this prism, whereby economic growth and respect for the environment are necessarily two sides of the same coin."
"Europe cannot and must not forget this, especially at the present time."
"On 28 September 2009, the Commission released a communication entitled 'GDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world', proposing measures for the creation of a database of EU environmental accounts, with a view to better public debate and better-supported decision making."
"By the end of 2013, the Commission should table a report addressing issues such as the situation of our forests and how depleted our fisheries resources are."
"To this end, we need a credible and up-to-date statistical basis, to be created under this regulation."
"The legal framework created with this proposal will allow the EU to assess environmental economic accounts, taking sustainable development into consideration."
"It has never been so vital to pay attention to the dichotomy between the environment and the economy."
"I voted in favour of this report because, besides making it possible to reach policy decisions that are more comprehensive and reasoned, it echoes the proverb 'we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children'."
"It is vital that we bequeath a healthy environment to future generations."
"The definition and provision of descriptive indicators and statistics that allow the development of economic and environmental factors to be monitored, along with possible interactions between these factors, is unquestionably a useful tool for supporting strategic planning, defining public policy and outlining ways towards sustainable development."
"Moreover, as the rapporteur states, the data that is obtained can, and should, contribute to policy evaluation, enabling assessment of the environmental impact of economic activities."
"The information obtained could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"This proposal for a regulation provides only for the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to economic sectors, and economic material flow accounting."
"More data could be gleaned from other areas."
"The rapporteur also mentions something to this effect, suggesting that pilot studies into their practical application should be carried out."
"It should, however, be borne in mind that the national statistical systems and their costs will need to be adapted."
"The Commission seems to take this fact into account in its proposal, even if only partially, by providing for derogations to Member States if it is necessary to make major adjustments."
"This proposal for a regulation only makes provision for the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to economic sectors, and economic material flow accounting."
"More data could be gleaned from other areas."
"The rapporteur also mentions something to this effect, suggesting that pilot studies into their practical application should be carried out."
"However, the definition and provision of descriptive indicators and statistics that allow the development of economic and environmental factors to be monitored, along with possible interactions between these factors, is unquestionably a useful tool for supporting strategic planning, defining public policy and outlining ways towards sustainable development."
"The data that is obtained can, and should, contribute to policy evaluation, enabling assessment of the environmental impact of economic activities."
"The information obtained could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"It should, however, be borne in mind that the national statistical systems and their costs will need to be adapted."
"The Commission seems to take this fact into account in its proposal, even if only partially, by providing for derogations to Member States if it is necessary to make major adjustments."
"Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making data available on the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"Recycling and the prevention of waste, air pollution and climate change, as well as sustainable consumption and production, could be monitored much more effectively if high quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors."
"In my opinion, collection of the relevant data, which has been voluntary so far, should become mandatory."
"Moreover, the introduction of a common framework in this area on the collection, processing, transfer and evaluation of European environmental economic accounts would facilitate the political evaluation of European environmental policy."
"Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, a great deal of attention was paid to the interaction between economic policy and environmental policy."
"That is why factors such as sustainable transport and energy resources have become key elements in other sectoral policies, too."
"Indeed, back in 2006, the European Council called on the Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development, in order to provide the most consistent data possible."
"I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation because I believe it can facilitate the work of national statistics offices by enabling them to compile harmonised and timely environmental accounting data."
"In this respect, the adoption of a European legal basis for the collection of data on environmental economic accounts will mean that estimates can be provided at European level regarding the existing interaction between economic and environmental factors."
"Lastly, I hope that this instrument will be seen as further confirmation of the leading role played by the European Union internationally with regard to environmental accounts."
"I voted against the Leinen report which, in the guise of so-called environmental statistics, unleashes an avalanche of information requiring a huge amount of bureaucracy, and all this in the name of green evangelicalism."
"Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"In its June 2006 conclusions, the European Council called on the EU and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development."
"This Commission proposal for European environmental economic accounts is a valuable contribution to this political approach."
"A sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available."
"Mandatory data collection by the Member States is therefore necessary."
"Environmental data currently available at European level should be expanded in the medium term to facilitate policy assessment."
"Recycling and waste prevention, air emissions and climate change, sustainable consumption and production could be monitored much more effectively if high quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors."
"I abstained from the vote on this document because I do not believe that such information can be gleaned purely from environmental accounts."
"It is essential to ensure the cooperation of all Member States and full harmonisation at EU level."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making data available on the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"A sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available."
"Mandatory data collection by the Member States is therefore necessary."
"We refer, in particular, to the collection of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to various economic sectors and macro-economic material flow accounting."
"In our view, environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"We agree that a verification clause should be introduced and that the Commission should report regularly on the implementation of the regulation in practice."
"We believe it is important to verify the reliability and comparability of the data in order to be able to make improvements and guarantee a high standard of environmental accounting."
"Due account should also be taken of the development of new modules and experience acquired in the course of pilot studies."
"The verification report should be regarded as an opportunity to adjust the regulation in the light of fresh developments and experiences."
"I believe that a better range of statistics on the environmental consequences of the policies of Member States and the EU is needed, as well as on accounting for certain taxes that support environmental policies."
"It is unfortunate that statistics and taxes are lumped together under 'environmental accounting'."
"The aim of this assimilation is to implement the climate market and its stock rights relating to pollution."
"The delegation of powers to the Commission is also heading in this direction."
"I voted in favour as I support the idea of the necessary statistical instruments, although I reject the policies that they serve."
"There needs to be agreement on how to prepare model statistics on the environmental impact of EU and Member State policies as well as on tax accounting which supports certain environmental policies."
"That much is obvious."
"It is, however, regrettable that statistics and taxes are included indiscriminately in 'environmental accounting'."
"The reason behind such a lack of discrimination is the implementation of the climate package and its market trading in pollution rights."
"The delegation of powers to the Commission is also moving in the same direction."
"And yet I am voting in favour of it."
"I want to validate the notion of necessary statistical instruments even if I reject the policies that they may serve."
"It is vital that environmental economic accounts contribute to policy evaluation, making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making."
"We need to know how to define the aim and purpose of this proposal for a regulation, together with its contribution to the overall 'GDP and beyond' strategy."
"This regulation provides only for the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to economic sectors, and economic material flow accounting."
"This is a first step towards developing more comprehensive environmental accounting since, according to the competent European and national statistics offices, it is only in these areas that data for the whole of Europe is currently available."
"It is therefore necessary to continue to make advances so that statistical data on the environment is increasingly reliable and forthcoming."
"in writing. - Recycling and prevention of waste, air emissions and climatic change, and sustainable consumption and production, could be monitored much more effectively if high quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors."
"The relevant data collection, which, until today, was made on a voluntary basis at EU level, should become therefore mandatory."
"Moreover, environmental data currently available should be expanded in the medium term to facilitate the necessary policy assessment of the European environmental policy."
"I agree with the rapporteur's position and I voted in favour."
"A proper and sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available."
"Recycling, air emissions, climate change, sustainable consumption and production must be monitored continuously in order to achieve progress in these areas across the whole of Europe."
"A system for preparing environmental economic accounts is one of the measures that would aid the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to various economic sectors and macro-economic material flow accounting."
"However, the binding nature of this system creates an additional administrative burden."
"Therefore, when introducing such a system, it is necessary to properly assess the impact of its application, set out the desired objectives more specifically and establish clearly the future direction to be taken with regard to environmental economic accounts."
"Attention should be drawn to the fact that Eurostat will be granted the main supervisory and liability functions in these areas."
"The implementation of the functions mentioned requires sufficient human and financial resources."
"However, we must consider whether the European Union budget is sufficient to allocate additional financial resources to increase and maintain the bureaucratic apparatus."
"The aim of the proposal for a regulation on European environmental economic accounts is to provide instruments for use in achieving certain important objectives, such as developing a European environmental accounting strategy and extending the work of the statistics offices, which provide accounting data to administrative bodies."
"I voted in favour of the text because I believe it is important for sustainable development purposes to incorporate environmental topics in EU policies and to have national accounts and a European programme with integrated economic and environmental accounting in the areas of transport, recycling and prevention of waste, air emissions, climate change, and sustainable production and consumption."
"In 2006, the Council invited the EU and the Member States to extend their national accounts to the main aspects of sustainable development, proposing short- and medium-term methods to develop global indicators that could lead to better public debate and contribute to decision making based on the economic impact of the environmental measures to be implemented."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree with this first step towards developing environmental accounting that is more comprehensive, since, according to the relevant European and national statistics offices, it is only in these areas that data for the whole of Europe is currently available."
"New priority modules, on which work is currently in progress and for which relevant data is likely to be available soon, should be identified in a working plan, and this data should also be submitted, especially data on the environmental impact of economic activities."
"Recycling and waste prevention, atmospheric emissions and climatic change, and sustainable consumption and production could be monitored much more effectively if high quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors."
"These data could act as an important aid to taking decisions on environmental measures."
"in writing. - (IT) In 2006, the European Council invited the European Union and its Member States to extend statistical data to sustainable development and to existing national accounting data."
"In its 2009 report entitled 'GDP and Beyond: Measuring Progress in a Changing World', the Commission itself proposed various measures to be adopted in the short and medium term concerning the definition of general indicators to create a more reliable knowledge base for better public debate and more appropriate political action."
"In particular, it also touched upon aspects concerning Europe's environmental economic accounts."
"An in-depth assessment of European environmental economic accounts can only be made on the basis of reliable data and therefore, Member States should be equipped with common methodology and standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules which should be developed in a framework which is binding on all States."
"I am voting in favour of the proposal because the objectives to be pursued and the future direction to be taken regarding environmental economic accounts need to be clearly set out, and so that these accounts can constitute an indispensable basis for environmental economic decision making."
"in writing. - In order to ensure sustainable development and appropriate environmental policies at EU level, it is essential that policy makers are provided with reliable data on the environmental impact of economic activities."
"I support this resolution as it lays out a number of effective measures for the collection of more comprehensive data."
"If the EU is serious about increasing recycling, reducing waste and limiting air emissions and climate change, then it must take action."
"The most effective way to achieve European goals in relation to sustainable development and environmental policies is through full cooperation across all Member States."
"Therefore, mandatory data collection on the impact of economic activities by Member States is necessary."
"The more accurate and reliable the information provided is, then the better our environmental policies will be."
"If a sustainable development policy is to have the desired effect, there needs to be enough information available for the decision-making process to facilitate the adoption of considered solutions."
"The Member States therefore need to assemble a wide range of indicators that together provide an overall picture of the EU in terms of the environment."
"This is the aim of the Commission proposal to Parliament and the Council, subject to assessment by Parliament."
"For these reasons, I voted for this report."
"in writing. - We voted in favour."
"The proposal creates environmental economic accounts as satellite accounts to ESA 95 by providing methodology, common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, intended to be used for compiling environmental economic accounts."
"At the initial stage, the environmental accounts to be compiled within the common framework shall be grouped in the following modules: a module for air emissions accounts; a module for environmentally related taxes by economic activities; a module for economy-wide material flow accounts."
"On the basis of our amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the compromise negotiated with the Council contains, in addition to the accounts initially proposed, a requirement for the Commission to report by the end of 2013 and examine extension of the accounts to cover material stocks (and not only flows) as well as eco-system services."
"Agreement on this requirement for Member States to provide data with harmonised methodology on environmental economy is actually a positive concrete step in the 'beyond GDP' process."
"National accounts cover environmental considerations based on economic performance and the creation of prosperity."
"Under the Commission proposal, they are to provide a source of data on air emissions and environmental taxes."
"The environmental accounts are intended to only show the interactions."
"Sustainable development in the EU requires a reasonable behaviour when it comes to the ecosystem and increasing shortages of resources."
"The citizens must be informed of environmental impacts resulting from economic activities."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Leinen."
"In fact, environmental and sustainability policies have recently taken on a particular relevance, making people pay greater attention to the integration of economic and environmental policies. Climate change, sustainable transport, nature, biodiversity, the use and exploitation of raw materials and natural resources, as well as waste management, have increased their importance exponentially in the policies of Member States."
"For this reason, we can only assess European environmental policies and the related strategies adopted within the EU in a serious and rigorous way if reliable data are provided."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 13:15 and resumed at 15:00)"
"Announcement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make the following announcement."
"In connection with the evacuation drill which took place during voting time, today, all explanations of positions adopted at today's vote will be heard tomorrow - they will be heard together with tomorrow's explanations of vote."
"Tomorrow, we will also complete the votes which were scheduled for today but were not taken."
"This concerns the vote which was in progress when voting was suspended, which we will continue from exactly the same point at which it was suspended, so as to maintain complete continuity."
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Question Hour with the President of the Commission"
"The next item is Question Hour with the President of the Commission."
"Mr President, allow me to begin with a smile as I congratulate all the Members for having survived the fire alarm and managing to take our places, safe and sound, back in the Chamber."
"As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it."
"We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news."
"We are all aware that it is a joint European challenge facing us to find an answer to this drama and this misery for refugees."
"On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission - and, above all, Frontex - has enough resources, whether we, the European Union, have enough capabilities to respond on the ground, and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region."
"I would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area."
"President of the Commission. - Mr Weber, we all regret recent events that have caused the loss of many lives."
"I agree with you on the need to take more decisive action in this field."
"There was an immediate response to assist the countries in North Africa - more than EUR 1 million for humanitarian assistance - and this assistance will continue."
"Through the Hermes joint operation, the Frontex border agency is coordinating a response to the strong migratory pressure."
"However, it is very important that Member States in the Mediterranean region, together with third countries, continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts."
"More needs to be done."
"So my very direct answer to you is that, yes, we need more resources for Frontex."
"The proposals to reinforce Frontex need to be adopted as a matter of urgency."
"We also need Member States to show political will and, above all, solidarity among themselves by offering the requisite technical and human resources."
"As you know, the European Union as such does not have all those resources, so we need the cooperation of the Member States in making them available."
"Mr President, my thanks for your assessments of the situation."
"Given that you state that we currently need more resources for Frontex, I would be interested to hear whether you are not also of the opinion that the Member States have hitherto been too unwilling to provide the resources to make Frontex strong."
"We did have the toolbox already."
"Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly?"
"President of the Commission. - There is an ongoing debate about this."
"In fact, it is one of the topics for the European Council this month, on 23 and 24 June."
"Not only should the Member States adopt the proposal already put forward to reinforce Frontex, but it is also important to step up the logistical response: more planes and more ships are indispensable and we cannot currently provide them from our budget at European level."
"I think there is a political will to do this but it needs to be done in a coordinated manner and this is where an effort has been initiated by the Commission: Commissioner Malmström is working on the matter with the Member States, and I hope the European Council later this month will confirm our thinking."
"At the same time, of course, we also need the cooperation of third countries."
"I myself was in Tunisia, where I spoke with the Prime Minister, and they have promised us cooperation."
"In fact, they are cooperating and we are now trying to reach some form of pragmatic logistical agreements between the Tunisian authorities and our own agencies."
"Not all MEPs are back in the Chamber after the fire drill."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Yes, I noticed that some of my colleagues are still on the fire drill."
"Yesterday, Commissioner Olli Rehn announced a number of important steps in the Commission."
"First of all, he asked for a number of changes to a rescue mechanism."
"He said it is necessary for this mechanism to be able to provide countries with flexible credit lines."
"He said that this mechanism has to be able to go to the secondary market and, most importantly, he said that this can be done by discounted swaps with its own AAA rated bonds."
"This is very important because it means that you can swap bad bonds from countries in difficulties with the rescue mechanism's AAA bonds."
"Secondly, he also said that the Commission should start to examine the possibility of Eurobonds - finally, I may say."
"My question to you, Mr Barroso, is can you confirm that this is also the position of the Commission?"
"Secondly, as time is pressing, will you propose these changes to the rescue mechanism at the next European Council meeting in two weeks' time?"
"President of the Commission. - I want to confirm that all the ideas put forward by Commissioner Rehn have my full support and endorsement, so I will not repeat what he said."
"Regarding the ESM, we are now in the process of establishing it."
"As you know, I hope the governments will very soon agree on that and so I hope that there will be a political decision in the European Council confirming the decisions regarding the European Stability Mechanism and, of course, you know what our position is."
"Regarding Eurobonds, this is not a new idea."
"The Commission has, for many years, including one of my predecessors, put forward the idea of Eurobonds."
"The reality is that so far, Member States have not accepted the idea; namely, when we had the crisis with Greece, the Commission proposed some idea of mutualisation of the debt, which was rejected by most of the Member States in the euro area."
"I think that there is now some progress in terms of accepting the idea of considering several options, and the Commission will, of course, present several options."
"We have always thought that the idea of Eurobonds was an attractive one provided the Member States could support it, but we are not yet there, to be honest."
"We are not yet there and I think what we have to do now is focus on the ESM."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - I do not think that the crisis concerning Greece and the euro is over."
"It is not over."
"So we have to find additional instruments."
"One of the additional instruments is, in fact, what Olli Rehn is proposing - a swap of bad bonds from some countries for a smaller package of AAA rated Eurobonds."
"That is the way forward."
"These Eurobonds can be issued by the EFSF, by the ESM or by a new European agency in the future."
"That does not matter."
"It is the mechanism that is important and it is important that, for the first time, I think, Olli Rehn and the Commission recognise that it is the way forward."
"President of the Commission. - Mr Verhofstadt, the Commission acts as a collegiate body."
"I think you find it easier to agree with what Olli Rehn says than with what I say, but in fact, we are saying exactly the same thing."
"In the annual growth survey, the Commission was defending and proposing collectively more intervention of this kind in the markets; that was unfortunately not agreed to by the Member States."
"So what I can confirm is that we are working along that line; we are trying to have increased flexibility for intervention in the markets but, honestly, I think we should now focus on the ESM and consider, of course, options for the future of the Eurobonds if the Member States are ready to take that additional step."
"Mr President, as you know, my group is composed mainly of non-euro area members, but we certainly do not wish to see the euro fail, as I have already said here several times."
"Our economies are too interconnected for that, and I must say, therefore, that we have mixed feelings about what is happening."
"We are getting mixed messages here."
"The European Council says one thing, the European Central Bank says something else and the International Monetary Fund something else again."
"Most of all, I have the feeling that political opinions are still prevailing over economic ones, as if it were possible to fool the markets with a few promises, and avoid a real solution to the situation."
"I would like to ask what the position of the European Commission is regarding the restructuring of government debt."
"You really do still seem to prefer pouring in more and more money and providing more and more endless loans to economies that are in serious trouble and on the very brink of collapse, or are we starting to see common sense here, and to consider seriously the possibility of restructuring their government debts, because, in my opinion, we cannot avoid this in the long term."
"President of the Commission. - Mr Zahradil, first of all, unfortunately, the economic problems that we have in Europe are not only in the euro area."
"Some Member States outside the euro area are also involved in balance of payment support programmes through the Commission and the IMF."
"Regarding the euro area, as you say, there are discussions ongoing between the Member States, the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank on achieving the best possible comprehensive response."
"As you know, there is not always expert agreement on the best way to obtain that response."
"This is still ongoing work."
"It is fair to recognise that these issues are extremely difficult and complex."
"The magnitude of the challenge is unprecedented and it requires some work of convergence."
"That is why the Commission has been extremely prudent in the way it communicates on that matter because some of these issues are market sensitive."
"One thing is clear: as we have said, restructuring is not an alternative to the painful fiscal consolidation efforts that all the Member States have to make if they want to correct their imbalances in terms of deficit and debt."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, it is true that we do not always understand the European Union's position, but you have just answered that."
"I would like to say three things."
"Firstly, there should be no more restructuring."
"We all know that at some point, there will be a restructuring of the debt, for instance in Greece, for the simple reason that the Greek Government needs to be given the chance to regain confidence and that Greek society needs to be restructured."
"As things stand in Greece, nobody trusts anyone, least of all the government."
"Until the government manages to give its people another outlook for the future, other than one of austerity, it will not manage to revive its economy."
"The most important thing that needs to be discussed by the Commission and the parties concerned should therefore be the need to inject some confidence in the Greek people, without which no measures can be adopted at all."
"Yet the prevailing austerity does not give Greek society time to stop and think."
"That is why they are rejecting it, which could be extremely risky."
"One final question: tax evasion."
"Could not Europe also lend Greece a hand on this matter?"
"Greek accounts are held in banks in Austria, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Switzerland."
"Why not freeze those accounts, or at the very least, challenge banking secrecy so that the Greek Government can ascertain where the problem of tax evasion lies."
"We ask them to put a stop to tax evasion and yet, at the same time, we are not offering them any help."
"It is our banks, the European banks, which are actually covering up this tax evasion,"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, you are right when you say there is a problem with tax evasion in Greece, although, in my opinion, this has not caused the Greek structural problem."
"We are currently addressing the issue of banking secrecy."
"As you know, since March 2009, all Member States as well as Switzerland have agreed to implement the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) standard which stipulates that a State cannot refuse to provide information if so requested by another State, on the grounds that this information is held by a bank or any other financial institution."
"This principle was included by us, the Commission, in the directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, which came into force on 11 March 2011 and which, unfortunately, will only be applied on 1 January 2013."
"The question of banking secrecy has therefore been dealt with at European level from a legal point of view and cannot constitute an obstacle to the full exchange of information on request between tax authorities."
"I believe that all the criteria have already been met, on the basis of administrative cooperation, for Member States and the EU to now give Greece information about any fraud or tax evasion."
"Mr Barroso, I have just one brief question."
"I am pleased that the G8 summit and the e-G8 forum that preceded it discussed the Internet."
"There are also concerns about why those with power are concerning themselves with the Internet."
"We are aware of how sensitive this area is."
"Is there any more you can tell us in this connection?"
"Is this a one-off, or will there be further discussion?"
"Will you be putting this on the agenda again?"
"I think President Sarkozy's idea was an excellent one because the Internet is a global phenomenon."
"We all want an Internet that is open."
"We think it contributes hugely to knowledge and freedom."
"At the same time, the Internet is often open to abuse: there is exploitation, of children, for example, and crimes committed by taking advantage of the freedoms that the Internet offers."
"We have therefore had a very interesting discussion with some of the big names in the creation of Internet initiatives, from the head of Google to Mr Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, and others."
"We talked about what type of regulation is appropriate for the Internet, while maintaining the freedom and potential for innovation that the Internet offers."
"So there was debate followed by confirmation that this matter, the Internet, will appear on a future G8 agenda."
"My curiosity is still somewhat unsated on this issue and I would like to ask you if you would be prepared to tell us, in general terms, about these further negotiations concerning the Internet, as this is an important and far-reaching measure for the future."
"There was not really any negotiation."
"It was more a very general exchange of views, a kind of brainstorming."
"There was a conference beforehand specifically called e-G8, attended by some of the big players in the Internet business and the authorities."
"It was not exactly a negotiation;"
"I did not see it like that."
"We asked these heads of major Internet companies to tell us how they saw the future of this industry and, furthermore, we shared our concerns, our interests and our perception of the Internet with the different members of the G8."
"However, there was not really any negotiation in terms of specific results."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr Barroso, we have enjoyed a series of pantomime exchanges on the euro."
"Every time I have predicted that a country would need a bail-out, you have come back and said, oh no, they don't, everything is fine."
"And now we face the fourth bail-out - the second Greek bail-out - unless, of course, today you are going to tell us that is not necessary either."
"But the question I want to ask you today is perhaps far more serious than anything that has happened in Greece or Ireland or Portugal to date."
"It is about the real sovereign debt crisis which we may face within the next few weeks, and which concerns the integrity of the European Central Bank itself."
"Month after month, I have warned that you cannot go on buying up vast quantities of your own bad debt."
"Mr Barroso, do you accept that the finances of the European Central Bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state?"
"President of the Commission. - No, I do not accept that."
"I think the European Central Bank is a very credible institution that has been managed with great wisdom and intelligence."
"The independence of the ECB is respected by all the Member States of the euro area."
"Of course, we know that there are some difficulties in the euro area."
"As I have already said, they are difficulties which, to be fair, concern not only the euro area."
"Unfortunately, your criticism of the euro area is always ideological."
"The debt problems are not exclusive."
"On average, the debt in the euro area is lower than the debt in the UK, to give an example."
"But, in fact, we have different problems because this is the first time we have had this type of monetary union without some more integrated institutional setting."
"That is precisely why we are now trying to have a comprehensive response, and the ECB is part of the effort we are making to give financial stability to the euro area."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Backing up some of my rhetoric, just yesterday, the respected think-tank, Open Europe, came out with some figures on this."
"It said that a staggering EUR 190 billion of the ECB's exposure is exposure to the Greek state and Greek banks."
"Should the ECB see the value of its assets fall by just 4.25%, its entire capital base will be wiped out."
"Do you accept the findings of Open Europe, or do you go along with Mr Juncker's assertion a couple of weeks ago that, with the situation in the euro being as serious as it is, you actually have to lie in public?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, I do not lie and the Commission has always been very consistent in the information it has given about all the situations."
"The situation is difficult; we have said it honestly from the beginning and we do not pretend the situation is a rosy one."
"Having said this, the European Central Bank's credibility relies on the absolute determination of the euro area governments to do whatever it takes to ensure the financial stability of the euro area, so I have no doubts about the system's ability, of the efforts in the euro area and the credibility of the European Central Bank."
"I have no doubts about the capacity of the European Central Bank to defend European interests, nor about the commitment of the Member States of the euro area to provide all the guarantees the European Central Bank needs to fulfil its independent role as our central bank."
"In terms of exposure of central banks, there are other central banks in Europe and outside Europe which are in a much more difficult and vulnerable situation than the European Central Bank, which is a credible, internationally much respected body of the European Union."
"The EU is becoming even wider and, with the advent of pan-European political parties, seemingly ever deeper, with this inability to achieve consensus being proved repeatedly."
"The contrary position of Germany over Libya and Italian and French disagreement over the recognition of Schengen visas proved this."
"Could you explain to me and to my electorate how it is possible to instigate common policy in important areas, such as international relations and security, without consensus, unless we dispense with the democratic rights of Member States to project their own aspirations unilaterally?"
"President of the Commission. - Frankly, I do not understand the concern that is behind your question."
"In fact, we are a Union of 27 democratic states and we have agreed that in common foreign and security policies, decisions should be taken unanimously."
"If the Member States do not agree unanimously, it is not possible for us to impose a decision on those Member States, and thus we are fully respecting the democratic nature not only of our Union, but also of our Member States."
"I believe that it is in our interest as Europeans, European citizens, that the Member States act together in external matters."
"It is obvious that today in Europe, even the biggest Member States do not have the necessary influence or leverage to talk on an equal basis with the United States or China and other powers, but together, the European Union can make a difference."
"So I hope that the process will lead to increased convergence in terms also of foreign policy matters between our Member States."
"The first thing I mentioned was pan-European parties."
"Could you explain to me why taxpayers should fund political parties at any level?"
"Maybe you could explain to me how useful they are for the EU's aims."
"One other question I have is about Cathy Ashton."
"I note her attendance at Commission meetings is very low."
"Is the UK being correctly represented at the Commission?"
"President of the Commission. - There are two questions here."
"First of all, the European parties are, as you know, recognised as important entities by the Treaty that was ratified unanimously by our Member States."
"So there is a reason to support the European parties because they are, in fact, European entities, recognised as such by our Treaty."
"Secondly, regarding Cathy Ashton, she is not only Vice-President of the Commission, but also High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"She has a very challenging job in which she has to represent the European Union, so of course she has more travel assignments than most of the members of the Commission."
"She makes a great personal effort to be present at almost all the Commission meetings."
"She cannot be at all of them."
"However, I wish to point out that members of the Commission are not there to represent countries."
"They are nominated by countries but they are there to represent the European Union."
"All of us take an oath, when we assume our duties, saying that we are not there to represent countries, and, in fact, the credibility of the institution comes exactly from that fact - that we try to be independent and to serve the general European interest."
"I can tell you that the Member States, including the UK, are very well represented in the European Council by their Prime Ministers and in the Council by the various ministers."
"Mr President, my apologies for the delay in my arrival."
"I waited until the end as a result."
"Mr Barroso, I have a question to ask you that relates to the grave situation in which we, in the European Union, find ourselves."
"2008 was the year of a deep crisis in banking."
"In 2009, this banking crisis led to a deep economic crisis in the real economy."
"The assumption of the costs of banking deficits by the public purses ultimately led, in 2010, to a deep crisis in national budgets."
"This deep crisis of the national budgets is being accompanied by an orgy of cuts, which is leading to dramatic situations in several Member States of the European Union, in part as a result of measures demanded by the European Union."
"There is a risk that, following the banking crisis, the economic crisis and the crisis in the national budgets, 2011 and 2012 will be the years of social crisis in Europe."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr Barroso, is the Commission prepared to discuss with us how we can improve the underfunding of the social welfare net - social security systems - in the Member States of the European Union, in particular, in those Member States hardest hit by the budgetary crisis?"
"Moreover, are you prepared to have a definitive discussion with us about Eurobonds in order to obtain the resources that we need to be able to invest in the economy to facilitate growth and jobs in the hardest hit Member States?"
"Mr Schulz, only today, the Commission adopted country-specific recommendations for each of the 27 countries, and there is also an introductory note in which we express in very clear terms this concern that you have just mentioned, which is very important for us."
"We are well aware that austerity, which is necessary at present because of the need to reduce deficits and debt, is truly very difficult."
"At the same time, we believe that each euro being spent now on debt interest means one euro less for the hospitals, public health services, public education and social security."
"This is, therefore, real austerity."
"This is why we must engage in serious budget consultation in order to restore confidence and, at the same time, implement the structural reforms needed to guarantee competitiveness, whilst still protecting the most vulnerable."
"I think you will like the document we adopted today."
"It looks at all the issues affecting the labour market: how do we attract more people into the labour market, how do we incorporate this social dimension into all our policies?"
"We now need to see how much room for manoeuvre each country has for guaranteeing these goals."
"However, I think we are agreed on the goals."
"(IT) Mr President, to be honest, I did not want to participate in the discussion on the G8, but I did want to put a question to President Barroso regarding culture."
"In the European Union, there are many programmes to encourage youngsters - and others - to meet, so that this becomes a real Union."
"For many youngsters and professionals, programmes such as Comenius, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action, etc. have represented the true coming-together of the European Union, inspiring truly European sentiments."
"(The President interrupted the speaker to explain that the debate was on another subject, but then invited him to continue ...)"
"I would like to know, therefore, what is to become of these programmes, at least as far as the Commission can tell, seeing that they are approaching their expiry dates and we should already have confronted the matter within the Committee on Culture and Education."
"How does the Commission intend to develop the next programme, from 2014 on?"
"I believe that this subject is of particular interest to many people active in European Union affairs and many of the youngsters in our countries."
"The Commission has a keen interest in everything relating to the promotion of this cultural dimension in Europe and in exchanges of every kind."
"I have a strong attachment to it myself and have already met some of the main parties involved in this area."
"At the end of this month, we will be putting forward proposals on the future financing of all sectors, including culture."
"We will, of course, be making substantial proposals in this area."
"We are thinking in terms of rationalising the instruments while protecting the aims of programmes such as the ones you mentioned."
"These are flagship programmes and are extremely important for a citizens' Europe and a Europe that recognises the value of culture."
"I will stick to the topic."
"The Commission yesterday adopted a strong package of reports and measures on fighting the corruption that is costing the EU EUR 120 billion per annum - roughly equivalent to the total EU budget - but eight Member States score less than five out of ten on the Transparency International index."
"The Commission says implementation of anti-corruption instruments is unsatisfactory."
"So would it not have been a good idea for corruption to be raised at the G8 summit?"
"The only reference that I can find, and it was an oblique one, was about developing countries."
"There was no reference at all to how rich countries need to show the political will to tackle the problem of our own backyard and show leadership on this."
"Was not this an opportunity missed to talk about corruption and bribery at the G8, especially as one of the members, Russia, is 154th out of 178 and many of our own Member States show poorly on the Transparency International index?"
"President of the Commission. - The issue of corruption was dealt with when we had this outreach meeting with African leaders, but I can tell you that anti-corruption issues are going to be high on the agenda of the G20 meeting in November."
"Having said that, I think it was a useful discussion because, when there is corruption, someone is corrupted but there is also someone doing the corrupting, so in a way, the G8 members were also scrutinised when we discussed the issue of Africa."
"By the way, I gave them very good news because I announced that the Commission is going to put forward initiatives relating to transparency for raw materials - good or bad news depending on perspective: less transparency makes it easier for some regimes to use revenues from their national resources and raw materials in a non-transparent way, sometimes with the complicity, we have to say, of the so-called developed world."
"That was the angle taken on the issue at the last G8 meeting."
"(NL) Mr Barroso, you were just talking about the European Central Bank (ECB), which you described as independent."
"The point is that the ECB is not independent in the Greek crisis; it has chosen sides."
"The ECB, as a commercial bank, has bought up tens of billions of weak bonds and is now holding up the necessary restructuring of Greek debts."
"My question is specific, and it is as follows: what are you doing to prevent the ECB, with its two hats, from standing in the way of the difficult but necessary steps to restructure the Greek economy?"
"President of the Commission. - The European Central Bank (ECB) is certainly independent, and not only is its independence recognised by the Treaty - so it is therefore legal and Treaty-based independence - but I can also tell you that I have had some seven years' experience in this position, dealing very frequently with the ECB and being present on many occasions when the ECB has shown it does not need our support to affirm its independence."
"I want to reassure you on that point."
"Regarding the issue of restructuring, various options are, as you know, under analysis."
"We are considering the whole debate, but the position of the Commission has already been clearly stated: we believe that the restructuring is not an alternative to the efforts that Member States have to make in terms of fiscal consolidation and structural reform."
"That has been our consistent position and we will maintain it."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Barroso, also on the matter of the G8 summit, I would like to know whether the whole issue of regulating the financial markets has been postponed once again, in particular, with the implementation of a tax on movement of capital, capital gains, the abolition of tax havens, the end of derivatives and ratings agencies, given their total lack of credibility at present and their utter lack of transparency."
"Lastly, I would also like to ask you about an issue related to what is happening here in the EU, with Greece, Portugal and Ireland, whereby a process is being imposed that is chiefly aimed at forcing instruments and processes that exacerbate exploitation and economic decline on workers and countries, and which, in the short or medium term, will contribute to greater poverty, unemployment and inequality."
"Do you not think that this contradicts all the principles that have been expressed, including by the Treaty itself?"
"Firstly, Mrs Figueiredo, in relation to issues of global financial regulation, as you know, since the G20 was established as the principal economic forum for global governance in financial matters, it is the G20 that is given precedence on these issues."
"Some of these points have been addressed to a certain extent. I myself ..."
"I can tell you ... I launched the debate at the G8 about a financial transactions tax, when we were also discussing the problem of development aid, and my position is clearly in favour of this tax."
"We are working on this in the Commission and will table some ideas very soon."
"As for the general issue you raised, the situation of the euro area was also discussed."
"Here, we may have completely different points of view."
"We believe that without budgetary consolidation and structural reforms, there will be no chance to promote our objective: a social market economy."
"Mr Barroso, at the G8 summit, the participants debated their commitments to the neighbourhood policy in the Mediterranean."
"You yourself, on behalf of the European Union, have committed EUR 1.24 billion saying it is for the neighbourhood, which might have been understood as being just for the south."
"We know from the interim versions of the Commission's document that in an initial phase, within the EUR 1.24 billion, EUR 150 million was for the east and all the rest was for the south."
"That contradicts the principle of symmetry and equal attention being paid to both neighbourhoods."
"How would you explain this?"
"What did you really and factually commit to the southern Mediterranean neighbourhood policy within the context of the only amount of money that has been mentioned by you?"
"President of the Commission. - Mr Saryusz-Wolski, my friend, let me tell you very frankly that I understand the concerns that you have with the Eastern Neighbourhood, but I think that the most important issue is not to place East and South in competition with one another: we need both."
"What is important now is to help those who want us to help them, and to do that in an effective way."
"In fact, the approach we have put forward in the revision of the Neighbourhood Policy is clear."
"We are not allocating resources on an East-South cleavage but based on conditionality according to each partner's progress towards reform, or, if you like, more for more."
"Those who do more, those who show that they deserve more, will receive more."
"So we do not have a previously prepared envelope - this is for country A or for country B - the country has to show that it deserves to be supported."
"I think this is the right approach, and in that case we will, of course, fulfil our commitments both to our Eastern European partnership - that is extremely important - but also to our neighbours in the Mediterranean."
"(FR) Mr Barroso, my question actually has a link with the last question and with your answer to it."
"You spoke just now about the aid that you pledged during the Deauville G8 summit, in particular, to the emerging Arab economies: USD 40 billion, mostly in the form of loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), plus approximately EUR 15 billion from the European Union and Member States."
"You mentioned conditionality, which is what my question relates to."
"This aid is indeed conditional upon certain criteria with which you are very familiar: regular, free elections, freedom of association, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, combating corruption, independence of the justice system, reform of the army and reform of the police."
"I would like to know who will actually assess whether these criteria are being complied with, especially as regards these emerging Arab democracies."
"Will our Parliament be fully involved in assessing compliance with the conditions that have been established, or will this be a discretionary power of the Council's?"
"Our idea, and I hope you will agree with it, is that it should be the Commission that coordinates the exercise."
"I am actually very proud of the fact that it was the Commission, together with the High Representative, that presented the blueprint for our response immediately: a partnership for democracy in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean and also a partnership for shared prosperity."
"The Council now recognises that it would actually be a good thing for the Commission to coordinate the exercise, and the Commission must, of course, report to Parliament on the matter."
"Therefore, I can only welcome all expressions of interest and the efforts made by Parliament to be closely involved."
"The events that are currently unfolding in some Arab countries are, in fact, of great strategic importance, not only for those countries, but also for global democracy, for the evolution of the Muslim world and for us here in Europe."
"Therefore, anything we are able to do to mobilise not only EU institutions but also our societies to help our neighbours' transition to democracy is very important, and I can only welcome the interest shown by the European Parliament."
"(EL) Mr President, on the subject of the G8 summit, according to some financial information I was reading, global GDP was USD 58 trillion and the money supply was USD 615 trillion in 2009."
"At the same time, on the subject of 'monetary policy' that concerns you, it confirmed that the USA is issuing new money, new dollars, while our Union is not issuing new money."
"Economists disagree on many things; however, history has taught us two things: firstly, that you cannot save a bankrupt by giving him expensive loans and, secondly, that extreme austerity can never reduce the deficit of a macro-economy in recession which is unable to depreciate its currency."
"The Eurobond is urgently needed, Mr President."
"Do you see it as a means of counterbalancing the spiralling increase in new money being issued by the USA?"
"President of the Commission. - In fact, this question should be in the first part of our debate, but I can respond to the distinguished Member by saying that, over the years, the Commission's position has been very open and, in fact, sympathetic, to the idea of Eurobonds."
"One of my predecessors was the first to put forward the idea of Eurobonds."
"The reality is that there was no agreement between the Member States."
"What the Member States have agreed now was the creation of a European stability mechanism."
"When it is created, it will become the number one international financial institution in the world - the most important in the world in terms of financial strength."
"I think that is where we should now concentrate our efforts."
"At the same time, we are open to discussing with the Member States - and with the Parliament of course - several options regarding the possibility of Eurobonds, provided the Member States are willing to consider that possibility."
"That is, of course, a very important and decisive one."
"The recent G8 summit wanted it to be known that it was providing USD 40 billion to Egypt and Tunisia for overthrowing dictatorships and embracing democracy."
"However, the G8 statement said that it would support countries in the region that move towards not just democracy, but also a market economy."
"It wants these countries to 'reap the benefits of globalisation' and to engage in 'investment integration', which means making it easier for G8 countries to make money in these countries and then take the money out again."
"I would not object to recipients of aid being expected to implement and retain democratic institutions and procedures."
"That would be quite right."
"However, is it not sinister that recipients should be told which economic policies they should choose and which they should discard?"
"Surely donors have no right to instruct these new democracies as to which democratic choices they should make?"
"President of the Commission. - I agree with the perspective which was adopted by the G8."
"I think it is in our common interest to have not only open societies but open economies."
"These countries are our neighbours, and I think the best way to help them is through trade."
"We will never be able to provide the amount of money they need if they stay closed."
"For instance, in the Maghreb countries - as you probably know - the reality is that trade among themselves is almost insignificant."
"They are asking us to open up our markets, but they do not trade among themselves."
"I think it is important that we say: yes we are ready to support you, but you should also open up your economy and integrate into the global economy."
"In fact, we see that a country's progress is very clearly linked to its capacity to integrate in a global economy."
"Just look at Asia with countries that are not yet democracies; it is because they were able to open up that they could participate in the global economy and reap some benefits for their peoples."
"(IT) Mr President, President Barroso, the final declaration of the G8 summit regarding the Middle East states: 'Negotiations are the only way toward a comprehensive and lasting resolution to the conflict."
"Does the European Union - an important interlocutor of the G8 - support this statement?"
"If it does, have you told the Palestinian side, which is planning to take unilateral action during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September?"
"President of the Commission. - Regarding the Middle East peace process, I do not remember a single international meeting in the last 30 years where this issue was not mentioned."
"We have restated our urgent call for resuming the peace process and we have urged both parties to re-engage in substantive talks to bring the Middle East peace process to an effective conclusion."
"We all commended the new US vision on reaching a framework agreement as groundbreaking and forward-looking."
"However, there were different reactions to the details of this new vision."
"To be honest with you, there are different approaches among the G8 partners to the Hamas-PLO cooperation and to the issue of the 1967 borders."
"There were also some concerns around the table about the risks entailed in a potential Palestinian endeavour to unilaterally seek recognition at a United Nations General Assembly."
"I can tell you that we are also discussing this with the Member States and that I hope that we in Europe will have a common position on the matter."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, the G8 countries decided to grant the sum of USD 40 billion to Tunisia and Egypt, as has already been said."
"However, the European Union must present the case for greater transparency, visibility and traceability; in short, better governance of this aid."
"We need to focus on four key points: first, ensuring that development cooperation is in keeping with the principles of democracy and absolute transparency; second, guaranteeing respect for human rights; strengthening the role and capacities of civil society organisations and reforming the system of governance that applies to aid, with stronger involvement by the European Parliament."
"Mr Barroso, the EU must be able to guarantee that this aid reaches the people it is intended for."
"What concrete measures is the EU planning in this respect?"
"Honourable Member, what you said reflects my own thoughts precisely."
"I agree with you completely."
"We are now going to do this with the help of several instruments, so that we can check that the undertakings made by all the partner countries are adhered to and implemented with determination."
"I am able to tell you that all of these programmes will be followed up not only by the Commission's offices but also by the High Representative, who will be appointing a special representative for the region in question."
"We think it is precisely through this kind of dialogue that we will be able to help these countries, especially by increasing participation by civil society."
"I was in Tunisia recently, where I met not only with the government and the President of the Republic, but also with representatives of civil society, women's organisations and trade unions."
"I saw how important they see our commitment to be, not only in the shape of support from governments, but also that of civil society."
"Once again, as I said to Mrs Sarnez, the European Parliament's commitment would also be very important in this respect, in the context of relations with the burgeoning parliaments and political parties in these young and new democracies."
"(EL) Mr President, at the recent G8 summit, you discussed the global economy and agreed that efforts should focus on the objectives of the viability of public finances, economic recovery and action to address unemployment."
"All this is being pursued for the benefit of society and the public."
"However, if we take the example of Greece, tens and hundreds of thousands of citizens recently took to the square and the streets around the Hellenic Parliament quite spontaneously, without being directed to do so, angrily calling for a decent standard of living and prospects."
"You must agree, Mr President, that no policy can be effective if it is not backed or, at the very least, tolerated by society."
"The policy in Greece is basically confined to a dilemma between exhausting austerity or bankruptcy."
"Do these social developments worry you?"
"They are a major political issue."
"What message do you have to send to these people who are seeking, in a dignified and peaceful manner, prospects and a better future for themselves, their families and their children?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, I would like to express my solidarity with the Greek people."
"I understand how difficult these times are for Greece."
"But I also believe that the responsibility of political leaders at European or national level, whether they are in government or in opposition, is to show what countries have to do."
"In fact, without fiscal consolidation, without structural reform, Greece will not come out of this crisis."
"The reality is that some painful measures are unavoidable in Greece and anyone who claims otherwise is lying to the Greek people."
"My appeal to the Greek leaders is to explain in honest terms to the population of Greece the difficult choices that the country has to make."
"We will all support it."
"In the European Council, it was I who proposed a reduction in interest rates on loans granted to Greece."
"But, at the same time, let us be honest."
"Greece has to make some of the effort itself because one country cannot live forever with such high levels of debt."
"This is the honest message that we should convey to the government and the opposition in Greece, and that we in Europe must accept if we really want to help that country."
"Mr President, I am glad that you raised at the G8 summit the issues of the problems of the eurozone."
"It is a crisis, and we all know it is a crisis."
"As the previous speaker mentioned, many Member States are concerned."
"We had issues in Madrid recently when people were protesting on the streets."
"There were protests in Lisbon, of all places, and we have also seen what has happened in Greece."
"Isn't it time, Mr Barroso, that you stood up - you mentioned telling lies a few moments ago - and told the truth and said that there is an option: that these countries should be allowed to leave the eurozone?"
"That is the only way out of it."
"President of the Commission. - I have great respect for all our democratic states, so it is not up to me to tell them what they should do in this matter."
"But we know that Greece has no intention of leaving the eurozone."
"I am in constant contact with both the Greek authorities and the main opposition party and I know very well that they do not want to leave the eurozone."
"Probably some of you, distinguished Members, would like the country to leave the eurozone, or perhaps your country is not in the eurozone and we respect that, but Greece is very committed to the European project."
"Greece has difficulties, and we are trying to support it, but please do not attack the euro on ideological grounds."
"The reality is that there are countries outside the eurozone that have at least comparable problems."
"Iceland is not a member of the eurozone and Iceland went bankrupt."
"Let us put it frankly: Iceland was one of the richest countries in the world in per capita terms before the financial crisis."
"In the European Union, we also have countries that are facing the same kind of difficulties because of very high levels of expenditure."
"So the reality is that the euro is not the problem; the problem is a very high level of debt or a very high level of deficits in the economies."
"The Question Hour with the President of the Commission is closed."
"Sudan and South Sudan (debate)"
"The next item is the declaration by the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Sudan and South Sudan (2011/2717 [RSP])."
"I think Mr Piebalgs is standing in for her."
"Thank you, Mr Piebalgs."
"Commissioner, you have the floor on behalf of the High Representative and the Commission."
"Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, the six-year transition period of the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace Agreement will come to an end in about a month's time."
"This is a historic moment for Sudan, and indeed for the whole African continent."
"The people of Southern Sudan have waited a long time for this moment, when their country's independence will be declared on 9 July."
"The European Union will be represented at the Independence Day ceremony by the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission."
"Following a credible referendum at the beginning of this year, we commended Sudanese parties on the remarkable job they did in organising the referendum."
"We welcomed that President Bashir had publicly said that North Sudan would be the first to recognise an independent South Sudan."
"But the positive momentum of the immediate post-referendum period has vanished."
"There are worrying tendencies towards increased tensions and conflict."
"The recent violent clashes in and around Abyei could well lead to another military confrontation between North and South Sudan."
"We discussed Sudan in the Foreign Affairs Council, both in January and in May, and will revert to it at the 20 June Foreign Affairs Council."
"At the Council, the High Representative intends to present a comprehensive EU strategic approach for Sudan, mainly focusing on an independent South Sudan, but also including elements for constructive engagement with North Sudan, including the Transitional Areas, Darfur and the East."
"In fact, we will be witnessing the birth of not one new state but two."
"The comprehensive approach will be a political strategy document, setting out all the key strands of our policy towards Sudan."
"The EU's main objectives are to support peace between the two states and democratisation and prosperity within both of them."
"We want to see two viable states coexisting as good neighbours sharing an open border, allowing for cross-border exchanges of people, goods, capital and ideas."
"South Sudan will need all our attention in terms of stabilisation, state-, institution- and capacity-building and long-term development."
"Our utmost concern would be to avoid state failure."
"As part of a possible response strategy, we will be looking at a number of important elements: stepping up the EU presence in Juba by establishing an EU delegation; initiating comprehensive political dialogue; stabilising South Sudan and the joint border through specific measures and instruments - including the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Instrument for Stability - and increasing development assistance."
"With regard to the latter, the EU has just made additional funds totalling EUR 200 million available for South Sudan, making our envelope today roughly EUR 300 million."
"We are working together with the Member States in a joint EU programming exercise to maximise the impact on the ground."
"At the same time, we will continue humanitarian assistance and we will work to ensure that trade is part of the comprehensive approach."
"North Sudan, on the other hand, will suffer some losses."
"We need to support reform-minded elements in the North, promote an inclusive political dialogue and enhance our efforts to promote human rights."
"We are trying to step up our political dialogue with the government in Khartoum."
"My recent visit was intended to signal EU re-engagement following Khartoum's positive response to the outcome of the referendum."
"We are, however, extremely concerned about the recent violence and, as I said, the military occupation of the city of Abyei, which constitutes a clear violation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)."
"We urge the parties to abstain from any further provocation and to negotiate the conditions for the long-term peaceful coexistence of local communities living in and around Abyei."
"We also continue to have concerns about the detention of human rights defenders, journalists, opposition politicians and peaceful student protestors."
"One of the basic principles of the CPA was the establishment of democratic governments based on respect for diversity and basic freedoms."
"We want to see respect for fundamental freedoms and genuinely inclusive democratic governments in both North and South Sudan."
"I must also mention Darfur."
"The European Union remains deeply concerned about the continued violence in Darfur, leading to displacements, and the severe impact this is having on humanitarian operations."
"There is positive news."
"The three European citizens who were held hostage in Darfur for several months have been released but, at the same time, we know the situation in Darfur is as it has been previously."
"We will need to continue to support efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in Darfur, trying to secure a positive outcome from the peace negotiation process and create enabling conditions on the ground for a Darfur-based political process."
"We welcome the outcome of the recent All Stakeholders Conference in Doha and hope it will provide for such important developments towards lasting peace in Darfur."
"Lastly, I must mention justice."
"A lasting peace in Darfur cannot be achieved without justice and reconciliation."
"There has to be an end to impunity."
"The Council has repeatedly recalled the obligation of the government of Sudan to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court, pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1593."
"The Darfur people deserve to achieve what they have been longing for for so long - lasting peace and justice."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what struck me most at the time of South Sudan's referendum on self-determination was the inhabitants' enthusiasm and joy, even exultation."
"People were happy because for once, they were having their say."
"For once, after more than 20 years of war, they felt that what they had to say would be listened to."
"We must not disappoint these six million South Sudanese people, but we must not forget the inhabitants of the North either."
"It is important that, amid the democratic impetus brought about by the results of the referendum, negotiations should be as transparent as possible, so as to provide a solid base for the future development of each of the new states, as well as the future development of relations between them and with the international community."
"The viability and stability of both North and South are crucial."
"It is vital for solutions to be found at last to problems that have hitherto remained unresolved."
"I am talking about the problems of citizenship, sharing debt and oil revenues and the difficult matter of undefined borders."
"In addition, the referendums must go ahead in the Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions, within the framework of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"The situation in Abyei is becoming worse every day."
"It is most worrying."
"Abyei must not reach a point of no return that would undo more than six years of negotiations."
"Tensions that are turning into open conflict are threatening to overshadow South Sudan's independence and plunge the region once again into chaos."
"However, the situation in Abyei must not make us forget the situation in Darfur."
"In this respect, the conclusions of the Doha conference must be taken into consideration, as you have just said, Commissioner, and we must not lose sight of the ongoing need to channel humanitarian aid and guarantee the safety of aid workers."
"Transparent negotiations are a guarantee of two viable states, as are the cessation of violence and effective cooperation between the two states."
"This is the framework, of course, that was already outlined during the referendum process It is important that this continues, so as to ensure that the political will of both states and of the international community is put into practice in the form of genuine development projects for citizens of both countries."
"It is these citizens and their well-being that should be the main focus of democratisation, political pluralism, and respect for human rights and for religious, cultural and ethnic diversity in both South and North Sudan."
"Madam President, on 9 July, South Sudan will celebrate its new-found independence and dignity, and it is indeed in terms of dignity and emotion that the Sudanese people are talking about this event."
"Mr Piebalgs, I had prepared a three-minute speech."
"However, while listening to you, I wondered if I should actually speak."
"I must complement you: I think Parliament has reason to be proud of the action by the whole of the European Union and of the way in which this Sudanese affair has been conducted, and like the Sudanese people, I am keeping my fingers firmly crossed that this will continue into independence and beyond."
"You spoke on the main issues, that is to say, the Abyei issue, which is still unresolved, the political decisions that were supposed to have been made on citizenship, debt, currency, etc. Above all, you mentioned everything you are hoping to do in terms of development, humanitarian action, the fact that justice must be done and that we must not sell the International Criminal Court short."
"In fact, you covered all the most important points."
"I will just add a few points."
"As regards the problem of development and humanitarian action, it is true that so much still remains to be done in South Sudan and that we must continue to develop the North and, most importantly, not to isolate it."
"So much is still to be done because the country has lived purely off oil."
"It has not developed a diversified economy; there is no education; there are no roads, no hospitals, and so forth. The needs and expectations of the people are huge, and if we do not want these people to be disappointed with independence, then development and humanitarian action must continue for a long time yet."
"We must keep this firmly in mind."
"As regards the issue of human rights, women's rights and political pluralism, polygamy still exists, even in the South."
"Women are bought along with cows; 80% of women are illiterate; children's rights have yet to be introduced and political pluralism does not exist: there is no culture of political pluralism, as we saw during the elections and the referendum."
"At the same time, it is exciting and wonderful."
"I met with both the South Sudanese and North Sudanese electoral commissions, though especially that of the South."
"They want to create laws."
"They want a good constitution, they want to build their country, and they are telling us, 'we will have money, don't worry, but help us - be there'."
"I think that in this respect, you have fulfilled their request."
"Your visit and that of Mrs Georgieva in the past and the probable visit of Lady Ashton for the independence celebrations are all major events."
"Your wish to present a strategic plan for South Sudan is what we call for after every election."
"We do not want it to be a flash in the pan, but to have proper follow-up and a future for the countries we visit."
"I completely changed the text of my speech for all of this, Mr Piebalgs."
"I would like to thank you, because as I said, it is good to be able to be proud of the European Union, especially during this difficult time."
"Madam President, Commissioner, when the independence of yet another African country, South Sudan, is proclaimed on 9 July, another chapter of colonial heritage on this continent will be closed."
"We want to believe that, once a democratic decision is taken in the referendum, South Sudan will resolve its outstanding issues with its northern neighbour by peaceful means, that is, through negotiation."
"We want to believe that the region will avoid the risk of disputes and clashes erupting because of the borders, demographics and migration patterns due to oil and other natural resources, which are plentiful in both countries, statistically poor though they may be."
"I call your attention to the need for continued cooperation on the part of the international community, the UN, the African Union and the European Union in consolidating both countries, in securing peace and the building of institutions for a democratic and pluralistic South Sudan."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a challenge we face now, at a time when the entire wider region is experiencing a revival and opening up to the requirements and standards of modern times."
"Sudan is once again facing a major historical turning point."
"All the agreements reached at the end of the bloody civil war have not yet become reality."
"The situation in the Abyei province is closer to a crisis than to peace, there is violence in Darfur, and Sudan needs our attention and generous help."
"Another important fact is that the UN Security Council has renewed the mandate of the UNMIS mission in Sudan and will deploy additional peacekeepers in Sudan."
"Our message to the governments in Khartoum and Juba is that they should welcome the UN peacekeepers as friends and ensure their security."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, Commissioner Piebalgs is right."
"We also have one of the greatest challenges facing the European Union in front of us."
"As rapporteur for the European Parliament report on nation building, I have to say that this is an extraordinary opportunity for us to partner South Sudan, one of the poorest and newest 'countries-to-be' on 9 July, and make nation building - that we keep talking about in this Chamber - a reality on the ground."
"This is a country rich in natural resources, but it is also a country with the most awful social indicators."
"A child born in South Sudan today has a higher chance of dying in infancy than attending primary school."
"What a statistic that is."
"Food products provided by aid agencies and intended for distribution to the poor for free are now being sold on the market."
"We need to build capacity from the bottom up."
"They do not have a civil service."
"They do not have trained administrators."
"They do not have the infrastructure that is required for a modern 'state-to-be'."
"They need the rule of law, they need good governance, they need transparency, they need our expertise as partners."
"They need to invite us and we need to provide our partnership of know-how."
"Madam President, you would want to raise the flag and a glass of champagne because, when a populace is able to vote through its own independence, that is only right and proper."
"The unpleasant thing here is that South Sudan is actually inheriting a legacy from the past and that the raising of the flag or of a glass of champagne is possibly somewhat out of place, given the situation in which the South Sudanese find themselves."
"Now that Abyei has been incorporated into the North, the South Sudanese should be praised for taking a stance of refusing to be provoked."
"However, the question, of course, is how long that will last."
"The fact that we, the international community, looked on as the issue of Abyei was left unresolved in the referendum is actually highly irresponsible and a recipe for war to start up again in future."
"The fact that UN troops will have to be sent again to re-establish peace is also something that we can safely assume."
"What I find particularly difficult is the issue of what do we talk about and what do we not?"
"Let us consider the fact that Sudan is trying to influence the forthcoming referendum in Abyei by insisting that those herdsmen who spend part of their time there and part away from there are included in the count."
"Is it justified for South Sudan to argue that, no, they should not be counted, as they are not permanent residents?"
"If that is the view you take, are you not then denying the herdsmen's right to exist?"
"It is a Catch 22 situation for which no answer can just be plucked from the air."
"There are two other factors to mention, too."
"Is South Sudan to be given a fair start?"
"If so, the South Sudanese are surely, in fact, entitled to debt cancellation?"
"The debts in question were run up by the regime in Khartoum, and no one can say that these debts served the people of the South well."
"The other factor is how are we to deal with the riches beneath the ground in South Sudan?"
"While we are at it, is South Sudan covered by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which audits freedom from corruption and examines which oil assets benefit the population?"
"If not, how can we in Europe help?"
"The one thing, after all, that really helps when it comes to European help for South Sudan - and, in fact, for the North - is actually trade and getting fair investments off the ground."
"We are all watching developments anxiously and I hope that we will once again be able to toast the liberty of South Sudan with the flag and a glass of champagne."
"Madam President, we all look at this region of the world with great concern and we are well aware that the risk of a civil war is far from banished."
"The ultimate fragility of the peace process that has been set in motion is demonstrated by current events in Abyei."
"The conflict that has broken out is dramatic."
"The Northern army has occupied Abyei and 15 000 people have taken flight."
"I believe that we, the European Union, must help in a very tangible way as we did before and that this must take the form of getting food and humanitarian aid for the refugees moving as soon as possible and preparing the emergency humanitarian aid for the refugees."
"Even without this escalation of the conflict, in South Sudan, over 40% of the population are already dependent on food aid."
"South Sudan will be one of the poorest countries on earth, and if we want the Millennium Development Goals to also take effect here, it is urgently necessary that the funding made available by the Council - EUR 200 million - should actually be spent on food security, education and health in this part of the world."
"My group advocates the immediate withdrawal of the armed units of the North and the South from Abyei, adherence to the comprehensive peace agreement and recognition of the demilitarised zone."
"With a view to the extension of the UN mandate, which has been discussed, we are calling for the risks and problems, such as those that came to light in connection with the MONUC mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to be taken into account and evaluated."
"We are disappointed that no really strong call for debt cancellation and for an examination of foreign debts made it into this resolution."
"I find that regrettable."
"Madam President, there are two points I would like to put to the High Representative or her substitute in relation to the current situation in Sudan."
"First of all, I call on the High Representative to urgently press the Sudanese authorities to release the Christian, Hawa Abdalla Muhammad Saleh, who was arrested by the security service in a refugee camp in Darfur on religious grounds on 25 May."
"According to reports, Saleh was tortured after arrest and then taken to an unknown location in Khartoum, a personal tragedy that requires Europe to get involved."
"My second point is that, as a Member of the European Parliament, it hit me hard to read the sharp rebuke from an authority on the situation in Sudan who is an international observer in the so repeatedly troubled conflict region of Abyei that the diplomatic pressure from Europe on the murderous and war-hungry regime of President al-Bashir was 'zero and badly coordinated'."
"This is a crushing rebuke, in fact."
"Is the international community, including Europe, giving President al-Bashir, after occupying Abyei, a feeling of invulnerability once again?"
"At this particular point in time, it is worth pointing out how weak a position al-Bashir is in domestically and that it is a more than opportune moment to apply international pressure to the regime."
"I hope, therefore, for European pressure on al-Bashir."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, with the greatest respect for the pragmatic approach you took in your speech, I wish to make two recommendations, in which I would also like to highlight the work of monitoring the referendum that Mrs De Keyser recently carried out so thoroughly, which, in my opinion, has been invaluable for our institutions."
"I refer to a very specific matter: personally, I was not at all surprised that the referendum and its result were followed by an increase in hostilities - almost - caused by the Sudanese institutions and authorities, particularly in the Abyei region."
"It is typical of the constant stop-and-go Khartoum politics to hint at a solution and then to withdraw it, without any warning."
"This is what has produced the disaster that Sudan has become."
"Allow me to make a suggestion: within the European External Action Service, we have created a department which deals specifically with humanitarian crises."
"This department must be alerted to Abyei now and not when we are faced with a huge disaster."
"It must be mobilised because it is a credible department, which has proved its worth, in the Libyan crisis for example."
"I believe that this department should be encouraged, today, to prepare a plan and to present it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, explaining how it intends to act, to enable us to understand how valuable European Union foreign policy can be when we all work together towards the best result."
"My final recommendation concerns our relations with China; we hear from all quarters that China plays an important role in Sudan, making it sound like some kind of ghostly presence that we have to fear."
"Personally, at this particular moment, I advocate the need for very cautious yet favoured relations with China, through which we can assess whether, in addition to economic interests, it is also interested in getting to the heart of human rights issues."
"Madam President, the EU must keep up pressure on the government of Sudan to withdraw troops from the border town of Abyei."
"A solution to the Abyei problem is needed urgently to prevent the escalation of armed conflict between Sudan and South Sudan."
"This conflict is jeopardising the peace process that should have followed the referendum of January 2011."
"The firing of shots by militia men at a UN helicopter at the end of May was an outrageous and cowardly act; as outrageous as the call by the Khartoum government for UN Peacekeepers to withdraw after 9 July."
"The UN presence is more necessary than ever to help observe the parties and stabilise the region, thus preventing the conflict from expanding."
"Ensuring a peaceful transition to independence in South Sudan also requires that the fight against impunity remains at the top of the EU agenda for both countries and for their unhelpfully meddling neighbours."
"The EU should not be tempted to make any potentially 'convenient deals' with President al-Bashir in exchange for forgetting that he and his henchmen must be brought before the International Criminal Court (ICC) to answer for the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed against the Sudanese people in Darfur."
"(FR) Madam President, South Sudan's recent referendum on independence has ushered in a new era for political dealings with this new state."
"With the creation of this young state, what was previously considered an internal matter for Sudan has become an international affair."
"All relations with Khartoum, especially concerning security matters, will now be international affairs and it follows that they will come under international law."
"We therefore applaud the way in which various parties are carrying out their tasks and, in this respect, it is worth mentioning some of the biggest immediate challenges that the newly created state will encounter."
"Firstly, among these parties, I must mention former South African President and President of the African Union, Thabo Mbeki, and the mediation he performed, and I think we should also emphasise the mediation role that our own special representative to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, has played."
"Secondly, the new state's adhesion to the Cotonou Agreement opens up new prospects for development cooperation and relations with the European Union."
"I think this is imperative and we must do everything we can to promote speedy ratification."
"Thirdly, there is the need to develop capacity to manage the mammoth problems that the new, still very fragile state is faced with."
"This also calls for attention from the international community."
"Fourthly, there is a need to also contribute to development in North Sudan, which we must not forget, and which is preparing to draw up a new constitution."
"Lastly, there is the dreadful security situation in the Darfur region and the government's unilateral wish to organise a referendum on its status on 1 July 2011."
"Naturally, I welcome the personal involvement of our Commissioner for Development and his staff in this crucial phase."
"He has understood that this decisive period for the future of South Sudan also constitutes a test of strength for the European Union and others as well."
"(NL) Madam President, the glorious date of 9 July approaches."
"South Sudan will officially become independent - a nation that openly stands up for the key values of the Christian faith, but also a nation that will be very tested, as the sly, old fox, Omar al-Bashir, may have almost lost his hair, but he certainly has not lost the tricks up his sleeve."
"In the Abyei region, he has started to massacre citizens."
"The ethnic cleansing of the southern Ngok Dinka people seems to have begun."
"The lives of United Nations staff there are not safe."
"Baroness Ashton knows that she has our support in her human rights policy, and in respect of the rebels in Benghazi she made clear choices, and rightly so."
"Do the same now in connection with Omar al-Bashir, as the people of South Sudan deserve our strong support."
"(DE) Madam President, in February, many people, including in this House, were full of both hope and concern about the future of Sudan."
"There were differing views on the continuing risk of violent clashes."
"It was clear that the people of Sudan faced major problems and need support."
"Now, the situation in Sudan is making the headlines again."
"The cause of the most recent events is the unresolved issues linked to the forthcoming independence of the South, and these problems cannot be resolved through guns."
"I therefore welcome the recent agreement between the North and South Sudan, brokered by the African Union, on a demilitarised zone along the future border between the two states."
"A 7 000 strong UN force modelled on MONUC could cause more harm than good, however."
"If we just look at the Congo, we can see what MONUC troops can get up to."
"Aid for Sudan must be impartial and not tied to any one interest group."
"It must put the interests of the people of the South and of the North at its heart, and this applies to both material and diplomatic aid."
"In order to prevent further fuelling of the conflict, all supplying of weapons must be halted."
"We are calling for an end to all civil/military collaboration and to the military training mission."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we certainly welcome the peaceful and credible manner in which South Sudan's referendum on self-determination in January was conducted."
"As has already been said, South Sudan will proclaim its independence on 9 July 2011."
"The challenges are huge, both in terms of the new State's internal organisation and in terms of its relations with Sudan at their shared borders and in the oil-rich Abyei region."
"Both Sudan and South Sudan have enormous humanitarian needs to deal with. The primary challenges are security, reaching inhabitants in distress and respect for humanitarian principles."
"The crisis is far from over."
"It is vital that the international community maintains its presence and a very high level of humanitarian involvement."
"We must be very watchful of how the situation develops, as it is already dreadful but could get worse and pose a threat to stability in the region."
"It is also vital that the development aid that is organised for South Sudan is coordinated with and complementary to humanitarian aid."
"The real importance of the link between urgency and development is highlighted in this context, in which state infrastructures are very weak and the humanitarian crisis is set to last."
"Development aid must therefore provide support for state infrastructures and increase the population's access to basic services that are organised at the moment by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international organisations."
"Lastly, the events in South Sudan and the Abyei region must not make us overlook the situation in Darfur, which is considered to be the worst humanitarian crisis in the world."
"The lives of millions of people still depend on outside aid."
"Finally, since I have a few seconds left, I would like to applaud the work done by Mr Piebalgs, which I think has been exceptional."
"Madam President, I want this afternoon to strongly emphasise the need for the EU to work with South Sudan in democratisation and institution-building."
"Yes, this will be a country with one of the highest infant mortality rates and lowest educational indicators in the world, necessitating fast-track accession to the Cotonou Agreement, with access to the European Development Fund and fair debt alleviation."
"But, just as the EU should be proud that we have contributed to a largely peaceful and credible referendum process - and I pay tribute to my colleague, Veronique De Keyser, for her personal leadership - the EU must give priority to helping South Sudan with its constitutional review process, entrenching a multi-party system and preventing corruption from taking any root from the start."
"Madam President, for South Sudan, the 9 July date goes before everything else; for North Sudan, although the comprehensive peace agreement may be coming to an end, its obligations do not."
"The threat of violence remains, not just in South Sudan itself, but in the neighbouring Blue Nile and South Kordofan provinces of North Sudan, and still in Darfur."
"Indeed, I want to ask Mr Piebalgs in his reply to explain what the EU is doing to combat continuing and deteriorating human rights violations, in particular, concerning human rights defenders such as Hawa Abdulla from the AU-UN peace-keeping mission, who has been subject to arbitrary detention and beaten."
"I was privileged to be present in East Timor at the birth of the world's first new state of this millennium."
"I hope that South Sudan can achieve its independence while averting the tragic transition suffered by the people of East Timor and providing peace and prosperity for the Sudanese people, who have suffered too much during the longest running civil war in Africa."
"(IT) Madam President, it is difficult to oversee the final steps in the formation of a new country along a peaceful path."
"The ultimate objective - peace - must be safeguarded, but without losing significant pieces of the global agreement."
"Khartoum's military action in Abyei appears to be jeopardising the good overall outcome of this journey, though not the founding of the 54th African state on 9 July."
"The South must not react to provocation and not lose sight of the final objective, which is not only independence but also the constitution of credible institutions and the advancement of its population, 90% of which lives below the poverty line."
"The people are unlikely to benefit from foreign investment, which already promises to be transparent and not predatory."
"I believe that this - the problem of foreign investment in South Sudan - will soon be a new front line that the European Union must monitor and on which it must assert the credibility it has earned in recent years in this region."
"Madam President, on 9 July, South Sudan will declare independence as an English-speaking new African state."
"The EU has rightly supported the CPAP's process and referendum in South Sudan."
"However, the next few months will remain critical."
"South Sudan must be enabled to establish itself as a viable sovereign state."
"Even without a hostile neighbour to the north, South Sudan faces enormous developmental challenges."
"Infrastructure is largely non-existent."
"There is widespread intercommunal hostility."
"Health care indicators are amongst the worst in the world and the economy is almost completely dependent on oil exports."
"It is therefore essential to increase EU developmental and humanitarian aid to South Sudan."
"However, South Sudan also needs the EU's unequivocal support politically."
"The recent seizure of the disputed border region of Abyei by the Khartoum government suggests that President Bashir is still not fully reconciled to his country's partition."
"Lastly, I am also hopeful that South Sudan will live up to its promise and be the first African Union country to re-recognise the stable and democratic Republic of Somaliland as an independent country also."
"(EL) Madam President, recent clashes in Abyei illustrate just how unfounded celebrations by the USA and the European Union were following the referendum."
"Once again, we have seen that imperialist peace is as bloody as imperialist war."
"Obviously, North and South, which are on the imperialist route and victims to infighting and the 'divide and rule' policy, will find it hard to avoid direct conflict."
"Various imperialist powers have been trying to exploit the oil and gold, copper and uranium deposits in Abyei for 20 years."
"This infighting is responsible for the risk of a new, even bloodier war, now that NATO, the USA and the European Union are directly involved, which is what the Euro-unifying forces seem to be seeking after the war in Libya."
"We urgently need an end to any imperialist intervention in Sudan and to any act of hostility and opposition between North and South."
"We also believe that the people of Sudan, in both North and South, need to take their fate into their own hands."
"That is the only way to avoid war and the only way to control the wealth of their country and move towards a different sort of development."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity to experience the independence referendum in South Sudan as an electoral observer for Parliament and I was impressed by the major backing given by the South Sudanese people to the idea of deciding on the fate of their country themselves in future."
"I also witnessed the major expectations of the people who decided on the liberation of their country from bondage."
"Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of what are known as internal displaced persons, who the decades-long fighting in the South had pushed into the refugee camps of the North, set off back to their former homes in the South."
"Of course, alongside the independence of their country, the people of South Sudan want, above all, to live in peace and find a way to a happier future after the decades of war in which millions of South Sudanese were forced to sacrifice their lives."
"The new state of South Sudan is due to officially become independent on 9 July, extending the family of states in our world."
"The starting conditions are as bad as can be conceived, and much has, of course, been said about this already."
"70% of the population live as nomadic cattle farmers; 80% are illiterate; the dispute over Abyei is widening into a military conflict."
"There have already been deaths and woundings."
"As if that were not enough, the rivalries between the tribes and armed groups in South Sudan are also on the rise, and observers estimate that more than a thousand people have already lost their lives since January."
"The wounded and violated are hardly even counted."
"Sudan was a failed state."
"There is a danger that the state of South Sudan will be a failed state from the very outset."
"I am of the firm conviction that, given the colonial history of these countries, Europe has a major obligation to this region."
"Together with the United Nations and the African Union, this situation calls for Europe's common foreign policy, and it is also that policy's chance to prove itself."
"This is not only about money, but also about supporting the frail and nascent civil society."
"We need to negotiate hard with those who hold the future of the country in their hands, namely, the tribal chiefs and the heads of the military groups, so that they do not dash the hopes of the people of their country."
"(RO) Madam President, in less than a month from now, the independence of South Sudan will be declared, which received massive approval in the January referendum."
"Unfortunately, during this time, the disputes relating to the delimitation of the border and sharing the income from oil extraction have not been settled."
"Therefore, the new state is coming into being under the shadow of conflict."
"This is why I believe that diplomatic efforts need to be stepped up, including by the European Union."
"We welcome your visit to Sudan and that of our fellow Members, including Mrs De Keyser's activities."
"However, as you are aware, the situation has deteriorated drastically recently."
"More than 80 000 people have left their homes, which is a sign of the imminent risk of a humanitarian crisis."
"My question for the Commissioner is about the possibility of having a peacekeeping force present in the area, given the statement made by the UN yesterday, acknowledging the failure of its forces, which have been passive in response to the recent tensions."
"(FR) Madam President, a few hours ago, the Sudanese Government informed the United Nations that the necessary conditions for the return of thousands of inhabitants who had fled the disputed Abyei region on the border between North and South Sudan would be put in place."
"As we know, although displaced inhabitants always leave very quickly, their return takes time and is all too often a source of considerable humanitarian and social problems."
"I therefore propose that the European Union should organise a monitoring mission as quickly as possible, along the lines of the work we did in the Balkans."
"Naturally, this mission could be carried out with the help of the African Union, and there is no reason why third countries could not be involved also."
"Lastly, a word on the rumours circulating about the possibility of 'ethnic cleansing' in the region."
"If what is suspected proves to be true, the international community will, of course, need to act swiftly, with impetus from the European Union."
"Under no circumstances must the tragedy of the former Yugoslavia be allowed to repeat itself."
"(RO) Madam President, the outcome of the referendum on the independence of South Sudan was welcomed by quite a few people."
"It was to mean the creation of a 54th state in Africa."
"However, the events taking place at the moment have sort of dampened the enthusiasm."
"We must be very realistic and acknowledge that, at the present juncture, the peaceful division of Sudan is in jeopardy."
"The occupation of the disputed Abyei region by Sudanese government forces on 21 May and the violence which continued yesterday, as well in Kadugli, show us that the civil war between north and south can reignite at any time."
"This must, of course, be avoided at all costs and our message must be loud and clear."
"The military operations being carried out by the Sudanese Government and the militia in Abyei mark a serious violation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"I sincerely believe that we are all definite about one thing: any escalation of violence must be avoided, as it could result in further human casualties."
"The security situation must be resolved according to the Kadugli and Abyei agreements from the start of the year, including, in my view, through the intervention of a mixed security force commissioned by the UN."
"If these obstacles are overcome, numerous question marks still remain about the viability of the two states which should coexist on the territory of the former Sudan."
"Political will and readiness for dialogue are needed because there is a whole series of issues which remain unresolved: common borders, citizenship, international obligations and, of course, the oil resources."
"On the other hand, I want to highlight the deterioration in the human rights situation and rule of law in Sudan where we have recently seen an increase in arbitrary arrests."
"I cannot help but remind you that Omar al-Bashir is still subject to an international arrest warrant, a fact which the authorities in this country ignore."
"I will end on a positive note."
"I want to welcome the release of the three Bulgarian hostages who worked for the UN Humanitarian Air Service and were abducted from Darfur in January."
"(SK) Madam President, the bloody civil war which has lasted more than two decades in Sudan has devastated the country and destroyed or otherwise tragically left its mark on millions of its inhabitants."
"The atrocities committed during the civil war finally ended with the signing of the peace agreement, an integral part of which was the holding of a successful referendum."
"Prevention is the best cure, and I therefore firmly believe that the EU resources earmarked for Sudan should be allocated not only for humanitarian and development aid, but also for supporting democratic control and the rule of law, which are fundamental preconditions for implementing the basic human rights of the war-ravaged Sudanese people."
"The results of the referendum clearly show the longing of predominantly Christian South Sudan for independence."
"If this happens - and I believe it already is happening - South Sudan, as the youngest state in the world, will need help and support."
"(SK) Madam President, I fully agree with the statement and declaration of Baroness Ashton but, at the same time, I share the concerns over the future development of this country."
"The Abyei region of Sudan has been riven by conflicts for many years."
"The civil war ended just under six years ago, after continuing for more than 20 years."
"This region was the key to the conflict and, according to the statement of the International Crisis Group, developments in this part of the country will influence the fate of the whole of Sudan."
"Will the country remain at peace or will it sink into another war?"
"If the southern part secedes, it will be necessary to show support for as peaceful a transition as possible."
"I would therefore like to express support for the Commission, which has roundly condemned the use of force against innocent civilians, who have been, and still are, the victims of intervention by the Sudanese army occupying this region."
"The EU has the opportunity to be a peacemaker, to assist stability in the region and to strengthen its position not only as the largest donor in the world, but also its political position, and, above all, to help the inhabitants of this country."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to draw attention to what is, in my opinion, a very important factor."
"We in this Chamber are all pleased that as a result of the referendum, a new state will soon be established - South Sudan."
"However, it needs to be stressed that this is only an opportunity, because that state today is lacking in basic attributes which should be a feature of every state."
"It lacks structures and competent officials, and does not have a judicial system."
"In other words, the way also lies open for the action of various forces which could undermine peace and security there."
"In this context, I think that as well as the very important humanitarian aid, it is also necessary to safeguard security, and that the current UN forces are still needed there."
"(RO) Madam President, I, too, would like to welcome the statement made by the Vice-President of the Commission against the background of the deepening conflict between both sides."
"I think that the political leaders must respect the will of the people expressed through the referendum on independence."
"Sudan has a long history of violent internal upheaval and recent developments indicate a return to this past."
"I want to stress the particularly difficult situation facing the population in the conflict zones."
"There is the risk of triggering a humanitarian disaster if members of the international community are not going to intervene."
"In addition, attacks in the areas defended by UN troops have been reported, which jeopardises the lives of soldiers and the return of the refugees."
"I must highlight the importance of the gradual disarming of the groups blocking the implementation of the referendum's results."
"Arms trafficking in the region also encourages more rebel unrest, while compromising the process of establishing independence."
"Madam President, today's discussion on Sudan and South Sudan is encouraging and positive in a world where there is more bad news than good news."
"The European Union has both an opportunity and a responsibility to nurture the new state along and to ensure that democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights are established in Sudan and South Sudan."
"Particularly, I think the record of the European Union - because of the founding principles of Schuman based on peace and prosperity - puts us in a position in which large states worldwide could not be, because they might be seen to be using Sudan to exploit it for their own internal and external policies."
"We can do a great deal, working with the UN, to establish these new states, particularly South Sudan, and to ensure that they do not have civil wars, as often happens when new states occur."
"(SK) Madam President, after the independence which is due to arrive in precisely one month, South Sudan will immediately have to confront a number of humanitarian and socio-economic problems."
"In view of these circumstances, external assistance to support South Sudan in the fight against extreme poverty, to strengthen local organisations, and to speed up the benefits of peace for its inhabitants, will be more important than ever for a long time to come."
"Although it is expected that South Sudan will apply for accession to the Cotonou Agreement, the 10th European Development Fund will not be available until sometime after accession to the agreement."
"There is therefore a risk of a funding gap appearing in the period immediately after the referendum, when South Sudan will be very vulnerable and at considerable risk of national collapse."
"It is clearly necessary to prevent this because of the threat of a humanitarian catastrophe, and we should therefore do everything in our power to help the Sudanese get through this critical period and to prevent a repeat of the bloody conflicts."
"(DE) Madam President, the Northern army forced out 15 000 supporters of South Sudan from the city, and then suddenly, they definitely want to hold a referendum in Abyei in double-quick time in the shadow of an army, when previously they had been unable to even agree with the South about who was entitled to vote."
"This is a truly grotesque undertaking."
"It is not only the differing views on property and belonging that made Abyei the bone of contention of a civil war that lasted for decades; there are also the differing religions, namely the Muslim North versus the Christian and nature-based religions of the South Sudanese, who were forced together by the haphazard borders drawn up by the former colonial powers."
"When considering the most recent escalations, this should not be forgotten."
"It would never have been possible to push the referendum through while the status of the voters of Abyei remained unresolved."
"Similarly, we must not forget the equally disputed regions of Blue Nile and South Kordofan with the Nuba mountains."
"In my opinion, to do so would be gross negligence and it must not be allowed to happen."
"(SK) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I never trusted President Bashir and I do not trust him even now."
"It is quite clear from this that I am a pessimist regarding the chances of anything happening in Sudan."
"I firmly believe that this President is endeavouring, through military force, to intervene against the South, whether by occupying certain parts of the territory or important towns or sources of raw materials."
"It would be very interesting from this perspective to see what preventative actions or preventative steps the Office of the High Commissioner has prepared in order to avoid this happening, perhaps in cooperation with the UN or the African Union, on the one hand, and it would be very interesting, of course, to see the method or steps the office would like to take if that does happen, and in the event that North Sudan does not comply with the peace agreement which was signed, and which I basically believe in."
"(SK) Madam President, South Sudan is a country which has voted for independence, and it will be the newest member of the United Nations."
"It is a country which has voted for independence but which is dependent in virtually all respects."
"It is dependent on its northern neighbour, and it is dependent on aid, whether from Europe or from surrounding African countries."
"It is a country in which the men have not learned to work."
"The men wait for a sign that a war is beginning, in order to take up arms and begin fighting each other."
"It is a country where only the women and children work, where children do not go to school and are therefore not educated."
"It is a country which has no workers, no teachers and no doctors."
"It is a country where everything has to be built from scratch, and it will therefore be very difficult and very demanding to build a proper political system here and to put the country on its feet."
"It is a difficult task, not just for Europe, but also for the UN."
"Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, first of all, I am very grateful for your broad support for the strategy that was presented to you."
"I will just run through a couple of elements that were raised in the debate."
"The people of North and South Sudan are undoubtedly the masters of their countries."
"We are supporting the process, but the referendum definitely represents a watershed: it is a completely new qualitative situation."
"It is not the same situation as before."
"Yes there is violence, there are difficulties, but the situation is different."
"Now we see a light at the end of the tunnel."
"So that is why I would say that it is a great victory for us because we supported the process politically, both through our own actions and in financial terms."
"So that is a completely new situation."
"We never compromised on human rights or International Criminal Court issues."
"Our position is very clear with regard to both the ICC and human rights."
"Whenever there is a violation of human rights, the High Representative makes very strong and clear statements and puts pressure on the authorities."
"It has been said that there is no immediate response, but changes are being made."
"It is not an easy process and we will continue to deal with it."
"On Abyei, the situation is difficult, but again the European Union position will be a very clear and strong condemnation of the occupation calling for the situation to be resolved immediately."
"It is basically up to the United Nations Security Council to decide on the situation."
"It will decide if there is to be another mission and if there is a United Nations Security Council resolution, we will be its greatest supporters."
"But what we need to bear in mind is our strong political stance and declaration and our support for civilian operations."
"I believe, as I said to South Sudan, that we should not expect all the issues to be resolved by 9 July."
"Independence will be declared, there will be ongoing discussions, and the important element is that the African Union Panel, chaired by Thabo Mbeki, has support from both sides, North and South."
"We are very firmly behind the Mbeki panel."
"So we have every reason to believe that all the difficult questions will be answered."
"With regard to the debt issue, work is under way as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative."
"This takes time and the Abyei issue certainly did not help."
"But that issue has not been forgotten."
"China, in as much as we can involve it, is a fully-fledged member of the Security Council and it would be a great help in finding solutions in the country."
"At this stage, I cannot claim that there has been a lot of activity with the Chinese."
"They are in oil, they are in the North of Sudan, but it is definitely a great help when the broader international community tries to find a solution to the issues."
"Last but not least, I am very grateful for your interest in Sudan."
"On the one hand, it is rather far from us but, on the other, it is very close."
"If things go wrong, if people are dying in Africa, the European Union cannot stay on the outside saying 'well, it is too far'."
"Your broad interest in the issues definitely encourages both the High Representative and myself to put together efforts to help people build peaceful lives."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 9 June, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Sudan, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, is a crossroads between the Arab and African worlds, as well as a mosaic of many heterogeneous ethnic groups."
"It has seen numerous conflicts since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1956."
"With the signing of the Naivasha Agreement and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) (2005), 20 years of conflict between the north and south formally came to an end."
"In January 2011, as provided for in the CPA, a referendum marked the last leg of the road towards the independence of the south from northern Sudan."
"In this extremely delicate transition phase, we must keep a balanced approach to both north and south, with particular attention to the needs of the south regarding institution building and governance."
"The aid given by the EU to South Sudan must be measured in terms of the effective capability of this new state to absorb it."
"Indeed, we must ensure that future flows of funding to Juba do not end up being used inappropriately or, worse, adding to the already widespread corruption."
"Europe should also increase its commitment to protect the Christian minorities in the north of the country, who are increasingly the targets of persecution and discrimination."
"Application of Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision on application of all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania (1412/2010 - C7-0369/2010 - 2010/0820(NLE)."
"Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make six brief points."
"Firstly, on strengthening Schengen: the free movement of people is one of the greatest successes and achievements of the EU, and Schengen is one of the Union's major pillars."
"We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened, but rather preserved and strengthened."
"I agree with the remarks that Commissioner Malmström made to this effect a little while ago."
"The five original Member States have given way to the current 25: 22 within the Union, and three outside it."
"Free movement is thus guaranteed within a territory of almost 43 000 km of external maritime borders and more than 7 700 km of land borders, covering 25 countries and 400 million people."
"Secondly, on mutual trust: the abolition of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between the Member States."
"There needs to be a rapid and adequate exchange of information through the Schengen Information System (SIS), good police cooperation and effective controls in place at the external borders."
"The security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and efficiency with which each Member State carries out checks at its external borders."
"If this does not happen, the security of the Schengen area is weakened, the credibility of the European Union is undermined and mutual trust is destroyed."
"Thirdly, on equal rules: there should also be trust in the procedures, which must be clear and fair."
"Candidate countries must be able to implement and enforce all the Schengen criteria effectively and correctly: the same criteria that were demanded of previous candidate countries; no more, no less."
"Fourthly, on transparency: we need to ensure greater transparency, in the interests of both freedom and security."
"I regret that, once again, the Council has not acted as it should in relation to Parliament, denying Members of this House access to the evaluation reports."
"The problem could only be overcome thanks to the diligence of the ambassadors of Romania and Bulgaria, who requested the declassification of the reports and their submission to Parliament, so enabling Members of this House to have access to the content of the evaluations, recommendations and final conclusions."
"Unfortunately, the Council has failed to respect Parliament once again."
"This very transparency is needed to address the outstanding problems that have been pointed out, as although these are not an obstacle to the two countries' full membership of Schengen, they should be subject to monitoring by the evaluation committee so as to verify that the recommendations have been acted upon, along with any changes that are still ongoing."
"Parliament demands access to this information."
"Fifthly, on European citizenship: how often do we invoke the value of European citizenship during our speeches?"
"Since their accession to the EU, in 2007, both Bulgaria and Romania have had a legitimate expectation that their citizens would become fully fledged EU citizens and that they would be able to enjoy the same rights as other EU citizens, including freedom of movement within the Schengen area."
"This is the European citizenship that we are strengthening by extending the Schengen area."
"My sixth and final point is that they have worked hard."
"It is clear that both countries are to be congratulated on the efforts they have made towards meeting all the requirements of Schengen."
"This is clear in the evaluation reports and in subsequent observations by the expert missions that made the evaluation."
"It was also clear during the mission that we made to Bulgaria and Romania, and for this I would like to thank my fellow Romanian Members, Mr Marinescu, Mr Enciu and Mrs Weber, and my fellow Bulgarian Members, Mr Kovatchev and Mrs Nedelcheva."
"We are therefore able to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area, and I hope that the Council will adopt the same position as soon as it receives our positive opinion."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am particularly glad of the opportunity to participate on behalf of the Council in the debate on the extension of the Schengen area to Bulgaria and Romania."
"This has been a consistently high priority for the Hungarian Presidency."
"I am therefore especially pleased that by now, both Bulgaria and Romania have received positive evaluation of their technical preparedness to apply the entirety of the Schengen acquis."
"We welcome the fact that the assessment by this Parliament has also led to similar conclusions."
"I particularly commend the work of the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for his professional and personal dedication."
"For a moment, allow me to deviate from the protocol for the sake of a historic reference."
"When the accession of Hungary and other new Member States from Central Europe to Schengen was hampered by a technical difficulty related to the development of the Schengen Information System, the SIS II, it was the then Portuguese Presidency that helped us with a generous and inventive solution."
"I would also like to thank the Chair, Mr López Aguilar, and all the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for their commitment to this issue."
"The Hungarian Presidency has made considerable efforts to take this dossier forward."
"The Presidency became aware early on that there was a need to address persistent reservations on the part of a number of Member States vis-à-vis the process."
"The Presidency therefore put the state of play of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen on the agenda of the JHA Council meeting on 24 and 25 February."
"On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Presidency's conclusions on the progress made and the need to continue to work in close cooperation with all Member States towards a solution acceptable to all parties involved."
"Both Bulgaria and Romania have taken very significant steps to bring their countries' policy and practice up to the Schengen standards. These include areas such as data protection, police cooperation, the control of external air, sea and land borders, the issuing of visas and the appropriate implementation of the SIS and SIRENE functions."
"In the meantime, the Schengen evaluation of Romania and Bulgaria on all chapters was completed in March with a positive outcome."
"Following the adoption of the relevant reports by the relevant Council working party, the Presidency submitted draft conclusions on the completion of the evaluation process to the JHA Council scheduled for 9 June."
"I know that this will be good news for most in this House, not least those Members from Bulgaria and Romania."
"It will mark an important step on their way towards full participation in Schengen."
"The Council will continue to monitor further progress in all areas since proper follow-up is an ongoing exercise in all Schengen countries."
"In this respect, I can assure the honourable Members that both Bulgaria and Romania will continue to report regularly on the steps taken to remedy the remaining shortcomings."
"They will, in particular, be looking to reinforce further the controls at their borders and to improve cross-border police cooperation as well as their systems for the issuing of visas."
"When Parliament adopts the report prepared by Mr Coelho and the Council adopts the conclusions drafted by the Presidency, only the very last step - adopting the decision of the Council which, as we all know, requires unanimity - will be left."
"In this respect, I would like to underline that the Council may return to this issue very soon to reflect on how it can further the process, possibly in September this year."
"The report prepared by the rapporteur touches upon the subject of access to classified documents - as was also mentioned by the rapporteur in his introductory remarks - which was an important question in dealing with this dossier."
"Parliament's access to classified documents is one of the outstanding interinstitutional issues between the Council and Parliament that the Hungarian Presidency is aiming to resolve."
"While we have managed to agree on the way forward with Parliament's delegations, the implementation of the solution found still requires some time."
"However, the Hungarian Presidency looked, right at the beginning of its term, for an immediate solution in order not to delay the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area."
"In that context, it was at the proposal of the Hungarian Presidency that the Council gave its assent so that Parliament could have access to documents pertinent to the accession of the two Member States to the Schengen area."
"All in all, the Hungarian Presidency is convinced that the enlargement of the Schengen area to include Bulgaria and Romania, now that they meet all the technical and legal criteria, would be beneficial for the entire Schengen cooperation and for Europe as a whole, where one could travel from the Black Sea to the Atlantic without being stopped to show a passport or identity card."
"We all know that this free movement is one of the fundamentals of our European Union - something which is really tangible for our citizens and something of value which we all have to safeguard."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Schengen is indeed a fantastic achievement."
"It is one of the most tangible gifts that the European institutions have given to Europe's citizens - the fact that, as the Presidency said, you can actually drive from Finland to Portugal without stopping at any border control."
"We must safeguard Schengen and the latest debate on reintroducing borders must be stopped."
"We have already discussed on many occasions how we should strengthen Schengen, and not weaken it."
"We need more Europe on this, and not less Europe."
"We need better evaluation, better tools and better guidelines and recommendations on how to interpret the Schengen acquis."
"This will be discussed with Member States in the Council this week, but also later at the European Council at the end of June."
"I would like to congratulate Romania and Bulgaria on the considerable efforts they have made."
"I have seen with my own eyes that they have done a lot of hard work."
"One of the advantages of being late is that you can benefit from the latest technology."
"I have been impressed by the technology and the work that has been put in place by Romania and Bulgaria and I would like to congratulate them on these investments."
"The result is that they both now meet the technical criteria of Schengen and they are committed and deserve the trust of the European Union."
"The Commission welcomes this report on the work by Romania and Bulgaria and I would like also to thank Mr Coelho and the shadow rapporteurs for this report and this approach."
"The Commission has always taken the line that there is no formal link between the CVM mechanism and Schengen accession."
"But, of course, we all know that access to Schengen is also based on trust, and trust, or lack of trust, has been very much debated in the last weeks."
"The decision to lift internal border controls with Romania and Bulgaria must not only be based on the technical evaluation but also on this trust, and unfortunately, that trust is not there today."
"That is why it was so important, as the Presidency outlined, to work with Member States to find a swift solution to this so that borders could be lifted as soon as possible."
"This must remain a priority."
"The Council, which has the say on this, must define a clear framework with clear timetables related to border control so that Romania and Bulgaria can see a way forward."
"They have demonstrated that they are ready to join, that they have made the necessary progress, and hopefully there will very soon be a possibility to achieve a way forward and a decision by the Council."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coelho, and I do this because his work is consistently rigorous."
"I now add that we must help Bulgaria and Romania."
"I trust Bulgaria and Romania."
"They have worked well and hard and they should receive what is theirs by right - this is no gift."
"The Presidency-in-office of the Council and the Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, have both stated that these two countries comply with the technical and legal requirements, and I add my voice to theirs."
"I believe we should not consider any criteria other than the strictly technical and legal."
"These criteria essentially number five."
"They comply with the following: they comply with the data protection requirements, they comply with the Schengen Information System (SIS), they comply with police cooperation, they comply with the issue of visas and they comply with the control of external borders by air, sea and land."
"Strictly speaking, they also comply with the SIS and with the Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry (SIRENE)."
"In view of all this, this House should send an unequivocally strong message to the Council and, notably, to the permanent representations of five countries that I shall refrain from mentioning but which are in the minds of all of us here today."
"I do believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in including Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area, which comprises more than four hundred million human beings, we are adding, not subtracting; we are building a stronger Europe."
"Furthermore, we should avoid double standards."
"Nor should we set conditions for Romania and Bulgaria that we do not ask of the other Member States in order to form part of this area of freedom."
"Thus, to end my speech, I fervently express my wish for a strong, majority-endorsed message to be sent from this House to the Council."
"Congratulations once again, Mr Coelho, and congratulations to Romania and Bulgaria."
"Mr President, I express my thanks to Mr Coelho for his effort, commitment and the particular expertise he has applied to this report."
"I also thank the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Malmström for the support they have given to this report."
"The debate about Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area has been hijacked so much for political purposes that we have almost forgotten what it is we are really debating."
"I want to remind everyone that we are actually talking about very clear, specific criteria which any candidate country has to meet to become a member of the Schengen area."
"There is no moral or legal argument which will make us change the rules for joining now at the end."
"The rules can be improved when approving the new Schengen evaluation mechanism applicable to all Member States, without resorting to double standards."
"It is time for us to be honest and acknowledge that Romania and Bulgaria are being held responsible for everything that is going wrong at EU level and internally in some Member States."
"This notion is completely unacceptable."
"It is not Romania and Bulgaria that are at fault because the European Union and certain Member States are unable to manage immigration and their borders, nor are they responsible for the extremist and populist deviations of a few governments, applying anti-immigration policies and regarding the mobility of European citizens, especially of Roma citizens, as a crime."
"Last but not least, Romanian and Bulgarian citizens have to suffer because of the bad personal relations the national authorities have with certain influential leaders."
"The EU institutions must be the voice of reason and combat this distraction which some are attempting to create."
"The European Parliament and Council must comply with European legislation, while the Commission has to oversee this as Guardian of the Treaties."
"Mr President, we are debating a dossier today which has put on our agenda in recent months a number of issues of principle."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for the extremely professional manner in which he has carried out his job in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, so as to ensure that these principles are respected."
"It has been a pleasure for me to work with Mr Coelho, whose constructive attitude has left its mark on the whole dossier."
"On the one hand, we are dealing with an issue of principle when we examine whether two EU Member States fulfilling the criteria for joining the Schengen area should be admitted to this area."
"The answer according to the rules is 'yes'."
"Both countries have been assessed regarding their technical preparation for this accession, with totally positive conclusions."
"Our rapporteur has gone even further and organised off his own bat working visits to the countries, also accompanied by the shadow rapporteurs, so that they can see how both the command centres and some border points look technically."
"On the other hand, another issue of principle has been to do with the institutional relations between the European Parliament and Council when it came to MEPs accessing documents on the basis of which they had to vote."
"The Council's viewpoint that only some MEPs could have access and vote on a fully informed basis, while the others ought to raise their hands to copy them, was sharply criticised by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I am pleased that our viewpoint won the day."
"Institutional cooperation must be fair, logical and democratic."
"I hope that tomorrow's vote will send a clear, positive message to MEPs about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that European citizens are losing confidence and trust in more and more European programmes."
"It is important that we do not push further forward at a speed and rate we are not fully prepared for."
"This is a feeling felt by many Member States with regard to the Schengen area and we should not rush with further expansion before all involved are fully and sufficiently ready and prepared."
"Of course, I must stress that this debate should not be used as an excuse to criticise either Bulgaria or Romania, who we know have been working very hard to meet the technical criteria that the Commission has set."
"Although there may well be disagreement between us as to whether those criteria have been met, much has been done."
"But this is an opportunity to talk about renewing faith in the Schengen system and the integrity of the European Union itself, and an opportunity to improve a completely outdated and ineffective evaluation mechanism."
"We are currently dealing with a system which is not able to deal with the current or future challenges Europe faces or the political views of its Member States."
"Now is the time to set criteria which not only deal with the technical aspects of the Schengen system, but assess the impact of organised crime and corruption, also within the assessment of existing Schengen Member States, and I would like to see Europol and Eurojust involved in those assessments."
"Perhaps such a new evaluation mechanism would help prevent some of the differences of opinion and lack of confidence in the current system which we are hearing not only in this Chamber but right across Europe at the present time."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, the issue at stake is whether we grant assess to the Schengen area for Bulgaria and Romania."
"I myself come from a new Member State and I remember how it wanted to join the area."
"I therefore very much welcome the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to that area."
"There were some shortcomings on the road to Schengen, but now the problems are resolved."
"Bulgaria and Romania are fully prepared to join the area of free travel in 2011."
"I understand the concerns about corruption and organised crime."
"That is why cooperation within the framework of the mechanism for cooperation and verification should be continued."
"However, we cannot invent new criteria for joining the Schengen area and we cannot undermine the certainty that a state is part of that area as soon as current criteria are met."
"The debates in Parliament have revealed a clear need to avoid double standards when evaluating the implementation of the Schengen acquis in existing and acceding Schengen Member States."
"The file on that evaluation is thus crucial."
"We find it unacceptable that several Member States have suggested, in the Council, changing the legal bases for the proposal so as to exclude Parliament from the decision-making process."
"I hope very much that our rapporteur, Mr Coelho, will defend Parliament's prerogatives, as he always does very successfully, with our full support."
"I would like to thank him for his work and hope for further good cooperation in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Bulgaria and Romania were included in the full application of the Schengen acquis."
"Think about it - the abolition of controls on the internal borders and the creation of freedom of movement are some of the most important achievements and values of the European Union."
"For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States - including my home country of Germany - totally incomprehensible."
"The arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered."
"Given the opinions that have been presented, I cannot understand these arguments."
"A dangerous game is being played with Bulgaria and Romania here."
"For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen."
"Like the other Members on the Committee, we were extremely alienated by the Council's impossible behaviour towards Parliament and by how, at the beginning, it even refused to allow us to review the documents."
"Overall, the opinion on the table is a positive one."
"We expect that Schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until September."
"To close, I would like to quote the Bucharest-based journalist, Sabina Fati. She stated, 'The Romanians are euphoric citizens."
"They look upon Western Europe as a place whose standards they absolutely want to achieve. To turn your backs on them now could lead many of them to become eurosceptics'."
"That is not something that we want in either Romania or Bulgaria."
"Mr President, Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union states that verification, in accordance with evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by the new Member States is an essential requirement for the Council to decide to abolish internal border controls with those States."
"Now, we believe that there would be an urgent need to establish regulatory and operational conditions preventing undesirable elements, who could undermine the security of Member States, from slipping into the EU unnoticed via Bulgaria and Romania, but our assessment is that those conditions do not exist today."
"The reports being discussed in Parliament are not reassuring because of the grave deficiencies which still exist at air, land and sea borders, starting with the performance of border controls."
"It is not surprising that our police forces are faced with numerous cases of illegal immigrants coming from those two countries every day."
"I suggest that we need to suspend the entry process to the Schengen scheme for Bulgaria and Romania as a precaution, not least in view of the foreseeably enormous pressure on the external borders of these two countries, which are becoming the holes in the Swiss cheese that is the European Union system regarding the entry of illegal immigrants."
"(NL) Mr President, I will get straight to the point."
"Bulgaria and Romania, our corrupt eastern European nests of thieves, absolutely do not meet the conditions for accession to the Schengen area."
"I repeat: absolutely not."
"Commissioner Malmström may well idealistically muse how sacrosanct the Schengen acquis is, while the majority in Parliament may well drily consider how marvellous it would be if Bulgaria and Romania were to join the Schengen area, but it is just not realistic."
"It is naive, in fact, it is childishly naive."
"The facts just do not back the idea up."
"Bulgaria and Romania themselves have long since demonstrated that they are not worthy of accession to the Schengen area at this point."
"According to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, corruption is the order of the day in both countries."
"When it comes to trustworthiness, Bulgaria scores just 3.6 on a scale of 1 to 10, while Romania comes in at 3.7."
"In a school report, these figures would be interpreted as a fail, a downright fail."
"Yet we are supposed to allow these countries into Schengen?"
"Of course we should not - never!"
"The facts just do not back this idea up, either."
"In January of this year, a few dozen Bulgarian customs officials were arrested due to corruption."
"In February of this year, nearly 200 Romanian customs officials were arrested, also due to corruption."
"Both countries also have worryingly high scores when it comes to human trafficking."
"Last year, dozens of victims of Bulgarian and Romanian human trafficking were discovered in the Netherlands alone."
"Yet we are supposed to allow these countries into Schengen?"
"It would be an outrage, and completely irresponsible."
"You can want something to happen - you can want something to happen very badly - but you need to see the reality."
"Take the blinkers off!"
"Bulgaria and Romania are absolutely not ready for Schengen."
"They are not ready now, and they never will be."
"(BG) Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Coelho for the objective and fair assessment of what has been done by Bulgaria and Romania."
"I also thank the Presidency and Commission for their support on this report."
"The process for evaluating these countries and their accession must be completed according to the same criteria with which it started. It was already established in 2007 that, once the technical criteria were fulfilled, Bulgaria and Romania would join the Schengen area in 2011."
"This is already done."
"The same evaluation has been reached by the Council's experts: Bulgaria and Romania fulfil the membership criteria."
"All the reservations which we have recently been hearing relate to the foreign policy debates of some Member States."
"Instead of looking at the short term, we need to take action in support of better protection for our external borders, of signing and complying with readmission agreements with our southern and eastern neighbours, and of solidarity with those Member States which are subject to the strongest immigration pressure in southern Europe."
"This is particularly important at the moment when there are internal challenges from and fears among our citizens about illegal immigration, which may threaten security and social advantages in Europe."
"We need effective, workable plans for dealing with the crises which we had in Italy and Malta."
"We cannot allow double standards."
"If we are going to debate and adopt new rules, they must apply to all countries - both old and new."
"Fellow Members, Bulgaria and Romania have completed their job and they are building on these security systems in cooperation with their Schengen partners."
"They have made and are making considerable efforts in the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"At present, I will feel less concerned if the Schengen area's Mediterranean border is guarded as well as Bulgaria and Romania guard their Black Sea borders."
"The rapporteur and other fellow Members were there and they understand what I am talking about."
"This is why the Council needs to decide to admit Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area this September, in order to strengthen security in this area."
"Fellow Members, I call on you to support Mr Coelho's report, which will allow us to give the Council a clear, strong political signal that Bulgaria's and Romania's rightful place is in the Schengen area this very year, in order to make external borders more secure and give our citizens greater peace of mind."
"(SK) Mr President, freedom of movement is one of the fundamental freedoms and achievements of the citizens of the EU Member States, and on behalf of our group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to support the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"I have to say that both the inspection report and the opinion of the rapporteur himself are positive, and that we should thank them, while, at the same time, also expressing our exasperation."
"Exasperation over the way that some MEPs from countries which themselves have problems with illegal immigration and corruption are looking at Romania and Bulgaria today."
"Bulgaria and Romania are fully-fledged Member States of the European Union and our approach to them must be the same as to any other EU Member State."
"So, if you think about the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and if we vote on it tomorrow, I would be delighted if you could view it in the same way as you view your own countries."
"(BG) Mr President, we are concluding during this session our evaluation of Bulgaria's and Romania's readiness to join the Schengen area."
"We will successfully achieve this because Mr Coelho's report is successful."
"The overwhelming expectation is that Parliament's evaluation concurs with the positive position of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and that the citizens of both countries, Bulgaria and Romania, feel that their institutions have done what they need to do and that the light to proceed down 'Schengen Road' is already green."
"The discussions were lengthy, but the good news is that we did not permit the attempts to make ad hoc changes to the Schengen membership criteria."
"The difficult times, of course, have not gone away."
"The governments of both countries need to explain now all the reasons to those who are sceptical and who changed before our very eyes from being former allies supporting Bulgarian and Romanian integration to instigators of the waiting game."
"What underlies these reasons?"
"Objective fears or prejudice, situational prudence or disappointment?"
"I hope that the interior and justice ministers will be at least just as frank with each other as we have been during the process of drafting the Coelho report."
"(PL) Mr President, I have the impression that in recent discussions in the European Parliament, we have been thinking increasingly in categories of defending ourselves along a Limes line - sometimes this runs along the European Union's external border, but sometimes we want to erect and defend borders within the European Union."
"I want to say firmly and emphatically: there are no substantive reasons, today, to delay Bulgaria and Romania's joining the Schengen area."
"We should oppose all attempts at restricting contacts between citizens, and we should oppose all attempts at restricting freedom to travel and be active in the European Union."
"The discussion to which I am listening shows how very divided the European Union is today."
"Those who today are raising artificial arguments against Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area will have on their conscience responsibility for the destruction of the political project which is the European Union, and they will never now escape that responsibility."
"Mr President, it is odd, is it not, that as the Schengen area comes apart in its core countries, there are plans to extend it to include Bulgaria and Romania."
"There are over 900 000 gypsies in Romania and Bulgaria, many of whom would like to migrate."
"Once they can travel freely within the Schengen area, many of them will inevitably find their way to Britain in order to take advantage of our generous benefits and public housing system, like so many before them."
"Perhaps some enterprising British citizens might like to meet the Roma as they disembark at Calais and Heathrow and give them the addresses and location maps so that they can find their way to the homes of our Prime Minister, his cabinet colleagues and all the MPs in favour of EU membership."
"Only when the Roma pitch their caravans on the front lawns of our out-of-touch political class might they change their views on the benefits of EU membership."
"(NL) Mr President, I fear that the European Parliament will once again be showing its most naive side by approving the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area."
"It is clear, in any case, that there are various Member States that will oppose this. They have good reasons for so doing."
"There is a recent report from Europol about organised crime which stated that criminal groups from Albania, Turkey and the former Soviet Union will exploit the opportunities that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area will bring."
"The report I mention also makes reference to the visa liberalisation for the Balkan States, which was also something of an imprudent measure."
"There is the problem of illegal immigration via Turkey, which will occur in much greater numbers once Bulgaria is in the Schengen area."
"What guarantees is the Commission giving that this problem will be tackled effectively?"
"It is giving none whatsoever."
"What steps is it taking to prevent additional problems in connection with the Roma gypsies and the nuisance and criminality associated with them?"
"It is taking no steps whatsoever, either."
"What is the situation when it comes to the judicial reform and anti-corruption measures that are still needed?"
"Those citizens of Romania and Bulgaria who travel to Schengen countries with good intentions will, in any case - and I am convinced of this - understand that the inconvenience of border controls is outweighed by the necessity of protecting all other Europeans against organised crime and mass illegal immigration."
"(RO) Mr President, Romania's accession to the Schengen area is a project which has involved major financial, institutional and human efforts, as it is one of Romania's most important political objectives."
"Romania has invested more than EUR 1 billion and the results have definitely been positive in all the evaluation reports."
"All the Schengen acquis conditions have been met."
"Romania manages one of the European Union's longest external borders, as a result of which it has developed the most advanced, integrated security system, complying with the standards set by the Schengen acquis."
"Romania and the agency Frontex have strengthened their partnership."
"In the Frontex operations carried out in Greece, Romania was the second main contributor, after Germany, of equipment and human resources."
"In the event of a huge influx of immigrants at the border, specialist immigration and asylum mechanisms have been implemented in partnership with similar institutions in other Member States, Germany and the Netherlands."
"In terms of the efforts to combat illegal trafficking, every state-of-the-art method is used to investigate and collect information."
"A unique application has been developed in Europe which allows data to be processed in both SIS I and SIS II."
"The maritime border surveillance system has been presented as a model of good practice."
"At the same time, the authorities have focused particular attention on the fight against corruption."
"Constant cooperation as part of the special mechanism set up by the European Commission has produced the results showing that Romania has the necessary institutional capacity required and political will to achieve the justice objectives."
"I think that accession to the Schengen area is not a gift being offered to Romania, but rather recognition of its merits and efforts, and will be an obvious asset to the security of the EU's external borders."
"Mr Coelho, thank you and congratulations on the way you have handled this dossier."
"(SL) Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled the conditions set and are acceding to the Schengen area on their own merits."
"We cannot allow political arguments to delay the enlargement."
"I am greatly concerned by the populist and extreme right nationalist rhetoric which is, in a very dangerous way, leading the Union to intolerance, racism, discrimination and the thoughtless closing of doors."
"With each enlargement of the Schengen area, we are expanding the area of ​​freedom, security and justice and I am confident that, as in the past, time will show possibilities for economic and other development."
"It is unacceptable that some Members States of the Union should call today for the restoration of internal borders."
"The mobility of European citizens within the Union, the freedom to travel, is one of the key European freedoms, and any restriction would undermine one of the most tangible benefits our citizens have obtained from closer European integration."
"With the enlargement of the Schengen area to Bulgaria and Romania, we will prove that the idea of integration is alive and well, that Europe is heading forward, and that the countries which are knocking at its door have a clear future in the EU, including those of the Western Balkans."
"Mr President, I may have changed my seat here to the ECR Group this week, but I have not changed my perspective on the European Union."
"When it comes to Schengen, it has been the ECR view that this is generally a matter for Schengen area members to decide, including Switzerland, of course, which is in Schengen, but not in the European Union."
"But the closure of the border by France to Italian trains, and Danish demands to mend Schengen shows it is in crisis."
"Pragmatism dictates that the implications of Bulgaria and Romania joining are profound for those way beyond the Schengen area."
"A leaky border will mean that many illegal entrants destined for the UK can reach Calais without hindrance, for example, and Bulgaria has not complied with its obligations on organised crime."
"In summary, this proposal is simply a border too far."
"(IT) Mr President, while Europe pretends not to notice, the 2011 Europol report on organised crime affirms that, with the entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area, the powerful criminal organisations of Turkey, Russia and Albania will be able to expand their activities across the whole of Europe."
"Furthermore, and I quote: 'Illegal immigration from Turkey will spread to the coasts of Bulgaria and the trafficking of drugs and humans by Turkish and Albanian criminal gangs will increase'."
"Moreover, regarding human trafficking, 'Romania and Bulgaria's entry into the Schengen area could give Bulgarian criminal groups and Roma communities new opportunities to increase their already significant trafficking to the rest of Europe'."
"In the final analysis, increased illegal immigration from Turkey and more drug and human trafficking mean less security for European citizens."
"Europe wants to do organised crime an enormous favour."
"The Lega Nord party is, and always will be, against this kind of iniquitous choice."
"Whoever votes tomorrow in favour of this report will be responsible for having voted for the opening of a motorway bringing organised crime straight to the heart of Europe."
"(HU) Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that by voting on the Coelho report tomorrow, the European Parliament will give a clear sign that it accepts Romania's and Bulgaria's readiness and supports the accession of these two countries to one of the most important acquis of the European Union, the Schengen area."
"This acquis means a lot to Eastern and Central European countries, also for historical reasons, because it provides the opportunity to travel freely without barriers."
"The most important message of our debate today for Member States must be that Romania and Bulgaria meet the same accession criteria that the European Union expected from countries that have joined so far."
"It must be emphasised that we cannot impose more requirements for Romania and Bulgaria than we have done in the case of the previous Schengen accession."
"Member States should not use the institution of double standard, as it erodes the very foundation upon which the Schengen acquis is built: the institution of mutual trust."
"It is exactly the events of recent months that prove that Europe's most important acquis requires protection and support."
"I would also like to emphasise that under no circumstances should we bundle two matters here, that is, link the Schengen accession of the two Member States to the matter of the supervision of the Schengen verification mechanism."
"There is a great need for the latter, but the two cannot be connected right now."
"And finally, allow me to congratulate Mr Coelho who prepared the report, whose constructive and consistent work has been truly important in this matter."
"I would also like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for its commitment and the concrete steps it took to facilitate the accession of the two Member States as soon as possible."
"(SV) Mr President, tomorrow, we will vote on whether to allow Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen area."
"For me as a Social Democrat, it goes without saying that all EU Member States that meet all of the stringent requirements for cooperation should be allowed to join."
"It is, of course, important for us to lay down stringent requirements for joining Schengen, but the same objective criteria must apply to everyone."
"Anything else is political hypocrisy."
"Now that all of the experts deem that Romania and Bulgaria satisfy requirements, I think it is clear that they should be allowed to join."
"Some objections have been raised this evening with regard to corruption in both countries, but that is not something that can be combated via the Schengen system."
"Just recently, Commissioner Malmström presented a package for combating corruption that we can use as a basis for further work."
"This is a matter for the whole of the European Union, not just for Romania and Bulgaria."
"Likewise, the fight against organised crime requires more cooperation, not more closed doors."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Schengen is certainly an heirloom of civilisation of the highest value."
"Today, we must welcome an important result, which is that we consider the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania to be among those who can benefit from this fundamental instrument."
"The Schengen area should therefore be consolidated and strengthened further."
"If ever there were concrete evidence of European civilisation, this is it: the right to European citizenship finds concrete expression precisely within the Schengen area."
"The Schengen acquis is, therefore, a fundamental instrument for the legal economy, and I am convinced that on 24 June this year, the Council will take important points for reflection from what is intended to be a strengthening of trust and collaboration between Member States."
"Of course, the evaluation mechanisms must proceed from being intergovernmental systems to being Union systems, as recently announced by Mrs Malmström, just as the governance of Schengen certainly produces increased cooperation and dynamic reinforcement, as well as modernisation, transparency and dialogue."
"The requirements have been met by Bulgaria and Romania and I congratulate Mr Coelho on having combined freedom of movement with the security of citizens in his balanced report, which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"(BG) Mr President, the SCH-EVAL Working Group described the one thousand three hundred kilometre Bulgarian border as a secure external border of the European Union, something which several Bulgarian governments worked for."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs recommends that the Council should approve the two countries joining the Schengen area."
"I want to thank all fellow Members for the professional job they have done."
"Some Member States are setting new political criteria which will delay the Schengen process."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania was even described as gambling with European citizens' security due to crime and corruption."
"The results in this area are clearly not impressive."
"However, this is why there are foreign policy criteria and possible resignations from Bulgarian ministers."
"These issues are the subject of other evaluations, such as the European Commission's Cooperation and Verification Mechanism."
"I want to welcome also the suggestions made by Commissioner Malmström yesterday regarding a new package of anti-corruption measures."
"However, at the moment, Bulgaria and Romania cannot be the scapegoats for unresolved problems relating to security in Europe: the wave of refugees from Africa, the forthcoming elections in some Member States, populist rhetoric and disappointment from the financial and economic crisis."
"No one is interested nowadays in a two-track Europe."
"This is why I call on you to support the Coelho report and urge the Council to take a positive decision."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate my colleague, Carlos Coelho, who has done a masterly job on this report, and goodness knows it was complicated."
"Bulgaria and Romania have done a considerable amount of work on strengthening their border controls and have succeeded."
"The latest assessments are very clear, in all areas from police and judicial cooperation to data protection and policies on visas and air, sea and land border controls."
"All the technical conditions have been met."
"We can accept this as an established fact."
"Bulgaria and Romania are now in a position to implement the Schengen acquis in terms of their technical capacity and human resources."
"Whilst there is now nothing to prevent us from enlarging the Schengen area, it is worth noting the recommendations that have been made to these two countries."
"I hope these recommendations will be strictly monitored, especially as regards the borders between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, because as you know, mutual trust between the Schengen States relies on countries adhering fully to their reciprocal obligations."
"If any of the parties does not abide by its obligations, this breaks the closed circuit and the whole system falls down."
"I sincerely hope that the Council reaches an agreement so that these two countries can become part of the privileged circle of Schengen States."
"All of us in this House are aware of the implications that decisions of this nature have for the citizens concerned."
"Well done again to Mr Coelho on his report."
"(RO) Mr President, I think that the states which have expressed their reservations about Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area must not forget that this process is a legal obligation stipulated by the Treaty of Accession to the European Union for Romania and Bulgaria, which all these countries have assumed by signing the Treaty."
"At the same time, European Union countries must also be aware that it is in their interest for Romania and Bulgaria to join Schengen because they will be able to make their own contribution to the security of all Member States and extend the Schengen area, which is set to strengthen the integration process within the European Union and the common area of freedom, security and justice."
"Acknowledgement from the European Union's missions assessing the smooth operation and connection Romania and Bulgaria have to the Schengen Information System, which operates at the highest security standards, presents a strong argument in this respect."
"This connection will allow all Union countries to have access to online data about stowaways attempting to reach Europe and ensure more effective control at the European Union's external borders."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, we are all aware that both of these countries - Romania and Bulgaria - have invested a great deal in securing the external borders of the European Union."
"They meet the Schengen standards."
"Objective reviews have all come to the same conclusion, namely, that the prerequisites for accession to the Schengen area have been met."
"Our rapporteur also performed a review on the ground."
"He carried out an objective evaluation and reached the same conclusion."
"That is why we will not only be voting in favour of the report but we will also be giving our consent for both these countries to join the Schengen area."
"The Schengen area is also an area of confidence, however."
"That means that not everything is completed with a single, one-off action but that confidence must be built over the long run; investment in security must be ensured over the long term."
"The same applies to all States, I would point out, and not just to Romania and Bulgaria."
"I hope that this confidence remains secure over the long term so that we are able to maintain this freedom of travel, this freedom of movement within the European Union as a major public good over the long term."
"I am distressed by something that I heard today, however, although it is something that I am unable to verify, namely, that police wages in Romania are to be cut by around a third."
"We all know that it is a prerequisite for incorruptibility, for reputable work by the police, that they must be well paid."
"I therefore hope that my information is inaccurate and that the police, who are performing a service in the interests of these countries and of the security of the entire European Union, will continue to be well paid in the future, too, so that they are not susceptible to bribery."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, according to the Coelho report, Romania and Bulgaria are, based on the evaluation reports, sufficiently prepared to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis to their land, sea and air borders."
"They satisfy the basic requirements and the same criteria as other Member States for full integration into the Schengen area."
"In supporting the full integration of these countries, we are demonstrating our Community solidarity and supporting the European idea and the fundamental right of the freedom of movement of citizens within the European Union, thereby creating a stronger Europe."
"As regards the concerns raised in the report about increasing migration pressure in the sensitive area of Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, these are today's challenges for the European Union and the Member States, which need to find global, pan-European solutions to effectively strengthen their external borders, to strengthen Frontex, to demonstrate due Community solidarity and to support the Member States in the south of Europe where immigrants land."
"The topical dialogue on updating the Schengen Agreement must take account of the above challenges."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, involvement in the Schengen area means assuming responsibility."
"Bulgaria and Romania must be admitted so that they can assume their share of the responsibility, along with the other Member States, for protecting Europe's borders."
"I know that Schengen is a sensitive topic nowadays in many Member States and gives rise to numerous public debates."
"It has taken on new significance in recent months with the influx of emigrants from North Africa."
"In actual fact, even old and large Member States have been finding it difficult coping with the flow of emigrants."
"However, these problems will not be resolved by not admitting Bulgaria and Romania."
"Quite the reverse."
"The correct response ought to be to strengthen the principle of solidarity regarding emigration policy and to get all Member States to commit to applying it."
"We not only need to offer the opportunity, but also require Bulgaria and Romania to assume their responsibilities and fulfil their duties at the Europe Union's external borders."
"Commissioner Malmström mentioned trust."
"This is the nub of it."
"The governments of both countries must be given the opportunity to respond to the challenge and prove that they can successfully guard Europe's borders."
"Mr President, dear colleagues, one month ago, I came to Brussels by car and at the Hungarian border, I saw a huge queue of trucks."
"I recall counting 87."
"They were from Germany, Italy, Denmark and Hungary, loaded with goods which people were waiting for."
"They were delayed by a procedure which no longer applies in the rest of the European Union."
"I would like to underline the importance of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to this important space."
"It is important for the interests of the whole of Europe because we have to rebuild the trust of our European citizens in the European Union and its institutions."
"You said, Commissioner, that Schengen is an important gift for all European citizens, but it is also an important tool for not 'less' but for 'more' Europe."
"I strongly believe that the European Parliament will adopt this report tomorrow and that the Council will act accordingly as soon as possible."
"(Applause)"
"(HU) - Mr President, the Coelho report determines that both Romania and Bulgaria have proven that they have prepared properly for the appropriate application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis."
"However, the date of their accession to the Schengen area is still uncertain, as some Member States believe that despite the repeated assessments by various European Union institutions, their accession could cause problems in the Schengen system."
"While acknowledging the deficiencies of the Romanian justice system, I would like to call to the attention of my fellow Members and the Council the fact that the decision they are making directly influences the everyday lives of 30 million EU citizens."
"The abolition of internal border controls is an enormous success of European integration."
"Romanian and Bulgarian citizens rightly expect to be able to enjoy the benefits of the Schengen acquis as full European Union citizens."
"I strongly believe that all of Europe would be stronger if Bulgaria and Romania were to join the Schengen area this year."
"(SK) Mr President, I stand here today in order to give unambiguous support to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"In my opinion, Mr Coelho's report very much proves the opinion that these two countries are fully prepared and have fulfilled all of the conditions."
"Bulgaria and Romania have been Member States of the EU for four years, but some fellow Members appear not to have noticed that, and some of their questions and racist remarks about these countries really concern me as an EU citizen, because if we talk about illegal immigrants from these countries somehow invading our territory, we are actually referring to members and citizens of the EU, and they surely cannot be illegal immigrants."
"In my opinion, whoever meets the conditions should have the chance of becoming a member of the Schengen area."
"This is a fundamental principle of equality on which the EU is built, and whoever doubts this doubts the fundamental principles of the EU."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following Bulgaria's accession to the European Union, admission to the Schengen area is the next greatly awaited event."
"It is justice which we are waiting for."
"After Bulgaria and Romania have made great efforts and coped admirably with the Schengen technical criteria, delaying both countries' admission would run counter to the rules stipulated in the European Union."
"The conditions set in the Union are the same for everyone."
"The same criteria which have also applied to the other Member States must apply to our countries."
"Otherwise, this is discrimination."
"Problems with corruption feature in many Member States."
"Europe must combat this as a whole because four out of every five European citizens consider that corruption is a fundamental problem in their country."
"Europe has problems with the rising number of emigrants."
"We need to find common solutions to these issues, but while adhering to our values and upholding our principles."
"(PL) Mr President, much is being said in the European Union about the crisis."
"Up till now, we have been talking mainly about the economic crisis."
"Now, what is happening with the Schengen area is making people say that it is not just the economy which is under threat, but also the fundamental rights of the citizens."
"Therefore, following the events related to the Schengen area in Italy, France and then in Denmark, I think we have to send a very clear signal which says that no, the Schengen area is not under threat, we do not want it to be suspended, we want it to be strengthened and enlarged, and that we very much want Europe to be open."
"We have to show that we know how to overcome crises."
"I would like to express my thanks to the Commissioner that when Denmark wanted to bring in border controls, a communication on common asylum and immigration policy was released very quickly."
"However, a further step now has to be taken."
"It is not just a matter of voting to accept the entry of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"It is a matter of doing this as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, today, the Schengen arrangements are coming under strong pressure."
"On the one hand, given the current wave of immigrants from North Africa, where the EU is encouraging democratic change, some states have asked for, and obtained, a temporary suspension of those arrangements."
"On the other hand, other states have decided, for reasons which would seem to reflect their own narrow interests towards the applicants, to exploit the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of the area and to try to keep them out, once again."
"Consequently, the rules of the game have been modified during the match, to the disadvantage of the two players."
"I personally support the positive conclusions of the report and praise the author for them but, although I can understand the political reasons for amending the recommendation - the basis of politics is, after all, compromise - I cannot ignore the fact that the new conditionality suggested might facilitate a subjective interpretation of it."
"I pray to God that I am wrong."
"(RO) Mr President, the report we have before us today is objective and fair, highlighting that Romania and Bulgaria are fully prepared technically to join the Schengen area."
"On top of this, in certain aspects, Romania can be used as a model of good practice, as indicated in the assessment documents."
"It is my firm belief that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to this area will not have an adverse impact on the borders' security."
"Quite the opposite."
"It will boost Europeans' confidence in the Schengen area."
"There is often talk about mutual trust, just as has been mentioned in this debate, too."
"However, how can we talk about mutual trust when some Member States are changing the rules of the game midway by introducing new criteria for joining Schengen?"
"The arguments being used today against Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area were not taken into account for any other state which has joined Schengen in the past."
"The only thing that Romanians and Bulgarians expect is fair treatment in relation to the other countries and an objective assessment based on the same criteria."
"Parliament must send the Council a clear message in this respect and insist on a definite date for accession."
"(RO) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur who, in this case, has drafted an extremely important report, but also extremely difficult at the same time, due to the fact that we have conflicting views on this matter regarding the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"Fellow Members, I also want to thank all those who have realised that the European Union expands on the basis of values."
"Last but not least, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area is part of assuming responsibility, which both states did in 2004, to meet the conditions which have subsequently turned out to be fulfilled according to the European Commission's evaluation reports."
"Today, I asked a fellow MEP from a country which has a conflicting position on our accession to the Schengen area what reason he would have for opposing this."
"The technical conditions seem to be met, but the reason would be because it is a controversial policy domestically."
"This situation is unacceptable."
"(EL) Mr President, I consider that the credibility of the European Union rests on the uniform application of the rules."
"I consider it obvious that the integration of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen Agreement must be accepted by complying with the same rules that were complied with when other States became parties to the agreement."
"I welcome Mr Coelho's report and his proposal on the need for Bulgaria to take additional measures, by preparing a special action plan with Greece and Turkey, due to the problem of illegal immigration on the Greco-Bulgarian border."
"I repeat my firm position that Dublin II needs to be revised and the Frontex operational office in Greece needs to operate on a permanent basis."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the Schengen Agreement, as we know, must not promote mass immigration into the social systems and the freedom of travel must not lead to an increase in crime and illegal immigration."
"The fight against organised crime and the improvement of border protection must finally be more valued in the European Union."
"If Italy and its border police's security system reportedly lags far behind the ordinary Schengen standard, it is to be feared that newcomers like Romania and Bulgaria could soon also slacken in their efforts."
"The overhasty accession to Schengen for these countries should therefore be rejected, as the main beneficiaries of this could be organised crime from eastern Europe and even from the Caucasus region."
"I believe that, in combating asylum problems, Denmark has set itself up as a trailblazer for EU-wide rules."
"That is probably why the Commission has reacted so strongly to the announcement of stronger border controls to fight rising criminality."
"We should make clear that, although Schengen requires open internal borders, that is only the case where the external borders are truly secure."
"(NL) Mr President, everyone who has followed this dossier knows that admitting Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area is an extraordinarily difficult dossier in the Netherlands."
"We also have a European responsibility, however."
"That being the case, I have one question for the Commissioner: how does enforcement of the Schengen criteria fit in with general control under corruption policy?"
"Just recently, we heard about border control between Bulgaria and Ukraine, where Bulgarian border officials had been bribed to allow people through the external borders of the European Union that have no business being here."
"I have a second question, which Mr Pirker also asked, namely, what do the substantial police cuts in Romania mean for the enforcement of the Schengen criteria?"
"There has been no consultation about this with the unions."
"What is the current state of affairs?"
"(SK) Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania have, in three years, taken all the measures necessary to be able to join the Schengen area."
"The criteria and the measures for securing the external borders are not simple."
"Both states have fulfilled these and are entitled to be members of the common Schengen area, regardless of the fact that Europe is now facing a flood of immigrants from Africa."
"It is important that the evaluation committee, members of which have visited both states in person, has stated that both Romania and Bulgaria meet the Schengen requirements."
"I firmly believe that MEPs will approve this report and that it will then be clearly approved by the Council."
"I wish the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria the rapture that I personally experienced in chopping down the border gate on 22 December 2007, when Slovakia became part of the Schengen area."
"(FI) Mr President, the expansion of the Schengen area entails the fulfilment of standards, but it is also about trust."
"The applications from Bulgaria and Romania have come at an interesting time, when the EU has begun to question the principle of free movement."
"Formerly, internal border checks were obviously carried out, but the reason for these at the time was the holding of certain events, like sporting events, the European Football Championship, world championships, or certain summit conferences."
"Now, too, many Schengen countries conduct police inspections within the framework of national legislation, on flights inside the Schengen area, for example."
"Now, however, the debate has changed."
"Now, checks should no longer be carried out because of special events, but because of a phenomenon."
"It is a sensitive issue, because it questions the notion of free movement and ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(BG) Mr President, I congratulate Mr Coelho for his well-balanced, objective report."
"The text not only reflects the findings made by the rapporteur when he visited Bulgaria and Romania, but also expresses the European Parliament's desire to remain true to the spirit of Europe."
"In other words, readiness for Schengen membership is based solely on fulfilling technical criteria."
"This is the case."
"Technical readiness, as a result of the good work carried out by Bulgaria and Romania, is a positive finding, which is also being made by us today."
"Now it is important for us to send a two-fold message tomorrow during the vote with a convincing majority."
"First and foremost, there is a message for the Council of Ministers."
"By providing access to the relevant information, establishing a constructive dialogue and taking into account the view of Parliament, the Council will not only show its goodwill in terms of cooperating with us, but it will also send a powerful message about one of the guardians of European values, as well as about transparent cooperation and partnership."
"A strong message will also be sent to Bulgarian and Romanian citizens."
"What the European Union is saying to them is: 'Yes' to equal treatment for all Member States, 'Yes' to identical rules and 'Yes' to the same consideration for the results achieved."
"I am confident that the Council can heed positive efforts."
"(BG) Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Coelho for the comprehensive report."
"I am taking the floor because I am annoyed by the blatant attempts to use the case of Bulgaria and Romania to resolve internal problems and to respond to internal fears."
"The lifting of visa requirements for Bulgaria and Romania more than 10 years ago was met with the same fears."
"However, the European leaders at that time demonstrated courage and farsightedness even when Bulgaria and Romania were not members of the European Union."
"Indeed, they were not wrong."
"This is why we must remember today that the current debate is about rules which must be the same for everyone, about equality between Member States enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and, last but not least, about Europe's so widely acclaimed solidarity."
"Europe is definitely more different nowadays to the Europe of 20 years ago."
"This should not come as a surprise to anyone."
"However, if there is a crisis in the Schengen area, this is a subject for another debate."
"If this leads to a change in conditions, they must be changed for everyone."
"Let us remember therefore that huge groups of illegal immigrants are crossing ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(BG) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on an exceptionally balanced, positive report."
"This is the result of the general attitude and vision which the majority of fellow Members present in this Chamber have, which is that Bulgaria and Romania deserve to and must be part of the Schengen area."
"Obviously, problems should not be shifted to areas where there are none."
"Corruption and crime are prevalent in all European Union Member States. However, success in tackling these problems will only be achieved when all 27 countries combine their efforts."
"Responsibilities and burdens should not be shifted just on to one group of European countries."
"Bulgaria and Romania proved that they can work for a united Europe."
"I think that they will be worthy members of the Schengen area as well."
"Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania proved that they can guarantee the safety of the EU borders and this is fully - I repeat, fully - documented."
"By the way, the officers arrested in Romania and Bulgaria were arrested for corruption."
"Can anyone in this House claim that, for instance, a Dutch officer, a corrupt Dutch officer, would not be arrested for corruption in the Netherlands?"
"Secondly, Romania and Bulgaria did not compete to win the top prize of Transparency International."
"They entered the judicial contract and fulfilled all its criteria."
"Now, if somebody is trying to change the rules of the game during the game, I think this might be illegal according to EU law and is, anyway, unfair according to common sense."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this very useful debate."
"There is indeed a clear need to strengthen the trust and faith in Schengen by strengthening governance and by strengthening the evaluation mechanism - as the Commission proposed long before Christmas - with more involvement of independent experts and the Commission, and also increased transparency involving Parliament in all the steps that are taken there."
"We also need to become much better in immediately assisting Member States which are in difficulties for one or other reason, and we need to clarify under what circumstances border controls might be reintroduced."
"All this needs to be done."
"We also need to fight against corruption and to increase the fight."
"Yes, there is corruption in Bulgaria and Romania, but there is corruption in every Member State, and the Commission proposed only yesterday a report on how we want to enforce the struggle against corruption."
"Some of you were kind enough to refer to this."
"But, in the meantime, we must recognise the enormous efforts that have been made by Bulgaria and Romania in order to comply with the technical requirements of Schengen."
"They are very clear, they are very transparent."
"That is why these countries must be given a clear perspective, a clear framework on what is expected of them, so that Member States will feel ready to welcome them into the Schengen community."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank those who commented positively on the efforts of the Hungarian Presidency."
"It was very important for us to feel your support throughout the entire past five months."
"Today's debate has also shown clearly that there is a strong majority in the European Parliament supporting Romania's and Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area because they have done their homework."
"During the past five months, and for the remaining time ahead of us, we will fight to express this, and for the Council to determine that as far as the technical standards are concerned, Romania and Bulgaria are ready to join the Schengen area."
"Both countries have worked very hard and deserve the maximum amount of appreciation for their efforts."
"Many have voiced their opinion during the debate - those who are for, as well as those who are against or for postponing the accession - that mutual trust is the key word in this issue."
"I also agree strongly with this, and the Hungarian Presidency has aimed to build trust throughout the entire time."
"How did we try to achieve this?"
"On the one hand, we were engaged in continuous dialogue with both countries, watching their efforts and attempting to help them find ways to get a better recognition of their efforts."
"On the other hand, we were continuously in touch with countries that expressed doubts about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"We then made efforts to encourage these countries to contact the candidate countries as well."
"As a result, I can tell you that there was a continuous dialogue behind the scenes in order for the parties to better understand and trust one another."
"This is the mutual trust upon which the majority of our policies are built in the European Union; without it, Member States are unable to make this political decision that requires unanimity."
"This is a time-consuming process."
"We had six months to achieve this."
"I trust that during these six months, we will reach the point where, in exactly two days, the Member States will say 'yes, the homework has been done'."
"What can help create mutual trust?"
"On the one hand, the series of consultations, which I have mentioned."
"On the other hand, that both candidate countries continue their efforts and keep proving that they are capable of defending the external borders of the European Union."
"The conduct exhibited by these two countries, coupled with their enormous growth, pace and rhythm, must be continued in the near future as well."
"On the other hand, I am convinced that the cooperation and verification mechanism - the famous CVM on which the Commission will release a report in July, dealing with the exact same issues that were voiced in this debate - could be helpful, even if officially, it is not part of the conditions for Schengen accession."
"The Commission will issue a certificate concerning the fight against organised crime and corruption."
"We have fought all along for this not to be laid down as a condition, but it will definitely support the building of mutual trust."
"As such, I am convinced that a positive CVM will promote a positive political decision regarding the Schengen expansion as well."
"If you ask me about the general mood regarding any type of admission into the Schengen area, then we all know that it would be difficult to say that the European Union is currently in a particularly welcoming mood."
"Several comments have been made in this debate that aptly demonstrate this."
"For instance, some are saying that with the Romanian-Bulgarian accession, the Roma population will begin to move from these two countries."
"I would like to be very clear: freedom of movement is a basic principle of the European Union, it is effective and valid, it is what our policies are built upon; this freedom is currently enjoyed by the Romanian and Bulgarian Roma population, just as by everyone else in every corner of the European Union."
"Everyone can move freely, there are no visa requirements, and if anyone wanted to leave now, they could."
"However, I am very proud of the fact that a Roma strategy was devised during the Hungarian Presidency which determines clearly the obligations of every Member State in connection with the community of this difficult fate."
"The problem must be treated at its roots: by providing better employment and education opportunities for them, this internal migration pressure will also decrease within the European Union."
"And allow me one more comment: if anyone were to deny one of our most basic freedom rights from the weakest, then these rights would be in jeopardy for all of us."
"And finally, since the ongoing evaluation of the Schengen system has been discussed at length as well, I would like to say that the Hungarian Presidency has already stated this very clearly from the first moment, and this is something we continue to believe in."
"The issue of the Schengen expansion must be clearly separated from the type of evaluation to which we will subject the Schengen system."
"Let us not confuse the two."
"We must preserve the acquis regarding the freedom of movement, and we must utilise our available means better, for instance, to ensure a better mutual control of our external borders."
"This is why we are working on the Frontex Regulation; this is why we are working on reducing the migratory pressure from North Africa by addressing its local causes; this is why there is a new neighbourhood policy; this is why we are working on increasing the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank."
"We are in the final hour."
"There is only one legal problem standing in the way of reaching an agreement with you: the usual 'delegated act' problem."
"It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this order of things."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I trust that the forthcoming session of the Justice and Home Affairs Council to be held in two days' time will make important decisions concerning both the expansion and the verification aspects of the Schengen issue, but in a way that guarantees the freedom of movement of our citizens."
"During the debate, one of our fellow Members said that letting Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen would be a childish decision."
"I totally disagree."
"I believe that when we become adults, we appreciate rational arguments, and if we have been well educated, we recognise when rational arguments are fair."
"In order to act fairly, we cannot compromise ourselves with double standards."
"We have to ask whether Bulgaria and Romania do or do not meet the conditions for entry into Schengen."
"If they do meet them, then they should enter."
"It is perfectly legitimate for their citizens to be seen as full European citizens."
"The people of Bulgaria and Romania should not become hostage to populist rhetoric."
"We know that not everything is as it should be with regard to Schengen."
"We are therefore advocating a new system of evaluation for Schengen in order to be able to identify problems, respond accordingly, and make decisions if the problems persist."
"However, debates on the new evaluation system for Schengen cannot hold the people of Bulgaria and Romania hostage to this legislative process."
"These are different processes, and each has its own pace."
"Finally, Mrs Gyõri, thank you very much for your kind mention of Portugal and the Schengen Information System (SIS) one-for-all scheme, which has facilitated the entry of several countries, including yours, into the Schengen area."
"Thank you for reminding us of that and for making that nice mention."
"I would like the Council to be given a summary of this debate and, I hope, an outline of our votes tomorrow, which I believe will be very enlightening."
"I hope that Council will recognise that when the assembly representing European citizens says yes with a large majority to Bulgaria and Romania, as I hope it will, the Council should follow suit as soon as possible."
"Dear colleagues, I believe that on the basis of the overwhelming majority of positive comments and evaluations in this Chamber today by Members of Parliament, as well as the evaluations of the Commission and of Council, warm congratulations are due to Bulgaria and Romania."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 8 June 2011."
"Romania and Bulgaria have proved once again, if there was ever any need for them to, that they are capable of adopting all the measures required to guarantee a significant level of security at the European Union's eastern border."
"Given the financial, technical, institutional and administrative efforts made by Romania to join the Schengen area, I think that the positive assessment of this dossier must be shown in the period ahead by setting a definite deadline for joining this area."
"The situation should not be unsettled by changing the rules during the game, stepping up the Eurosceptic rhetoric and bringing up a separate issue relating to the need to control illegal immigration."
"Technically, Romania is more prepared than ever to police the European Union's eastern border."
"Yet, applying double standards in evaluating certain parameters is not a worthy and characteristic aspect of the United Europe project."
"I firmly believe that once Romania has been integrated into the Schengen area, it will demonstrate to all Member States the serious and rigorous way in which it can guarantee the eastern border's security."
"Moreover, the results achieved will convince the whole of Europe that it has successfully enhanced the security of the entire Union."
"Freedom of movement is one of the most important European Union values for all EU citizens and the Schengen area is characterised by the absence of controls at shared borders between participating countries and the introduction of freedom of movement within this area."
"Therefore, we must respect the right of all European Union citizens without exception to move freely."
"If Bulgaria and Romania are subject to more criteria than other EU Member States in order to join the Schengen area, then we will be creating double standards."
"We must avoid a system based on double standards, which is very strict towards candidate countries and very soft on countries that are already members of the Schengen area."
"The rules of the Schengen acquis must be the same for all countries and the assessment system must be based on the provision that rules should be met continuously, not only during accession."
"Countries joining the Schengen area must continue to comply with all security requirements because the security of the Schengen area really depends on the rigour and effectiveness with which each Member State carries out controls at its external borders, as well as on the quality and speed with which information is exchanged through the Schengen Information Service."
"Therefore, in order to remove controls at internal borders, it is necessary for the Member States to cooperate as much as possible and take the necessary action, particularly when increasing migration flows, because the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and effectiveness with which each Member State carries out controls at its external borders."
"in writing. - (HU) According to the assessment of the European Commission, Romania and Bulgaria are prepared for Schengen accession, and therefore the Council must make a decision without delay to admit the two Member States."
"We can neither apply a double standard, as it would undermine the authenticity of the European Union, nor can we lay down new conditions."
"Joining the Schengen Agreement and dismantling borders is the step that citizens appreciate the most of the European Union's acquis; in addition to the euro, this is also the symbol of the European Union."
"Freedom of movement is one of the keys to the success of the common market."
"It is, of course, necessary to safely protect the external borders of the European Union, yet this objective is achieved not by keeping out Member States that are prepared but by introducing a continuous and transparent Schengen verification system, which - along with the common European migration policy and the refugee policy based on internal solidarity - represents a solution to many open questions."
"Therefore, I am asking the Council to move forward as soon as possible in these areas."
"Romania is prepared to remove its internal controls at its land, air and sea borders."
"Following the visits made on the ground and the technical evaluations which were carried out, not only the rapporteur appointed by the European Parliament but the group of experts, too, concluded that Romania fulfils all the criteria for joining the Schengen area, which were provisions assumed through the Treaty of Accession in 2005."
"All the shortcomings identified in the past have been rectified."
"Furthermore, my country has set an example of good practice in some areas."
"With regard to the objections raised by some MEPs, I want to point out that they relate to topics which have no direct link with the Schengen acquis, which means that they cannot be used as reasons for blocking Romania's access to this area."
"I understand the concerns of certain fellow Members about making the EU's external borders secure, especially as some states can be regarded as favourite destinations for the flows of emigrants."
"However, I should remind you that European rules must be the same for all Member States and cannot be changed during the game as this would amount to discrimination against Romanian citizens."
"In view of the positive technical evaluation, the Justice and Home Affairs Council must give the green light to Romania's integration into Schengen, from this autumn on."
"If you believe this report, everything is shipshape and Bristol fashion and Romania and Bulgaria have demonstrated that they are sufficiently prepared to implement all of the Schengen rules."
"However, those of us who are familiar with the Europol report OCTA 2011 on the subject of organised crime will be asking ourselves whether the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is deaf and blind, and why on earth we indulge ourselves in Europol at all if we simply ignore its warnings."
"Europol reports that Romania and Bulgaria are transit routes for drug smuggling, gun running and human trafficking."
"Organised criminal gangs, increasingly multi-ethnic, act with extreme violence."
"Many have a paramilitary background."
"These groups, and I quote verbatim from the Europol report 'are seeking to expand their interests in the EU, and may exploit opportunities in the possible accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Zone'."
"Europol Director, Rob Wainwright, stated in an interview that 'The possible accession into Schengen of Bulgaria and Romania and visa liberalisation for Ukraine - one would see these as potential new opportunities for organised crime'."
"We have a duty to our citizens to take Europol's warnings seriously."
"The Schengen Agreement is already opening all the doors to Europe to organised crime and illegal immigration."
"It therefore needs urgent repair before it is extended."
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent report, which fits in with the recent debate on the implementation of the Schengen Agreement."
"The existence of effective controls along our external borders must be an important factor inasmuch as the security of the Schengen area depends on the efficiency with which each Member State controls its external borders."
"Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis."
"We have discussed at length the practical efficacy of the state machinery of these two countries, as well as their levels of corruption; nevertheless, I believe that the application of Schengen should leave this out of consideration, given that - just as happened with the other Member States - it is sufficient to base a decision only on the efficiency of border controls and the preparation of police forces."
"Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007."
"in writing. - The real question is whether all EU citizens, irrespective of their national origin, are to be treated equally and granted equal access to EU fundamental rights."
"Against the background of the global economic crisis, the EU is experiencing a crisis of democracy and solidarity."
"We are seeing the renationalisation of Europe."
"In this context, the debate on Romania's and Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area has provoked stark reactions motivated by pseudo-arguments and double standards."
"This is not about technical aspects, nor about the security of the EU's external borders, nor yet about migration or efficiency of the judiciary."
"It is a European political problem of a strategic character."
"It is about EU cohesion."
"To speak about a lack of preparation at our eastern borders when seeing the permeability of our southern borders is simply hilarious."
"To promote national political agendas at the expense of the aspirations of EU citizens of Bulgarian and Romanian origin is outrageous."
"Indeed, we need better defended borders, a better migration policy, better administrative capacity and honest public servants."
"But this requires more and not less Europe."
"One right step in this direction is the immediate enlargement of the Schengen area to include Romania and Bulgaria."
"We can categorically say that Bulgaria itself, or Bulgaria's citizens to be more exact, do not pose a threat, either directly or potentially, to security, order and peace within the Schengen area."
"Our country has fulfilled, albeit late, all the technical requirements relating to external border controls."
"However, there is a large degree of distrust suggesting that serious disruption may be caused when the control measures are implemented."
"This distrust features in the reports from the European Commission on the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, in the reports from Europol and in a series of statements made by senior representatives of various Member States."
"With the unprecedented growth in smuggling activity and the informal economy, with the prevalence of corruption and the inability to cope with organised crime, there is no good reason for us to get angry at the fact that our membership is being blocked by additional obstacles."
"The European Parliament must adopt a position on principle, which is that the rules of the game cannot be changed midway."
"According to the formal requirements, Bulgaria and Romania are ready for membership of the Schengen area and the European Council must decide in favour of this as soon as possible."
"I am counting on Mr Coelho's report being approved by a large majority to give a clear political signal to Member States."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)"
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0407/2011)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Subject: Quality food schemes"
"In February 2011, the Commission registered its 1 000th quality food name."
"It is clear, however, that the number of applications to register under the protected geographical indication (PGI), protected designation of origin (PDO) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG) quality food schemes varies considerably from one Member State to another."
"Why does the Commission think there are such disparities between Member States?"
"Can the Commission comment on the views expressed by some food producers that the registration process is long and bureaucratic and therefore discourages applicants?"
"How can the registration process be made more user-friendly?"
"Can the Commission provide information on consumer awareness of the quality food schemes?"
"How can recognition of the PDO, PGI and TSG labels be improved and made more relevant to consumers, in particular, in Member States that have few registered products?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, when the European system of protected designations of origin (PDOs), protected geographical indications (PGIs) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSGs) was set up, equivalent systems already existed in some Member States."
"The concept of geographical indications was thus familiar and names had already been registered at national level."
"This explains why there are many registered names in certain Member States."
"Nevertheless, growing interest in the system has been observed in many Member States."
"The procedure for registering a name generally takes several years."
"This is because the applicant group has to draw up specifications and have them approved at national level and then by the Commission."
"The single document summary of the specifications for geographical indications or the specifications themselves for traditional specialties are then published in the Official Journal of the European Union in order to allow objections to be made."
"The objection period lasts six months."
"If there are no objections, the name may be registered."
"If an objection is lodged, the interested parties have six months to reach agreement."
"If no agreement is reached, the Commission issues a decision that is voted on by the Standing Committee."
"This procedure explains the time required for registration to take place."
"On the other hand, once a name has been registered, it enjoys strong protection and international recognition and benefits from communication tools, particularly use of the logo."
"The Commission is aware of the need to speed up the registration procedures."
"Proposals to this end have been made in the context of the Quality Package, including reducing the time for the Commission to scrutinise applications received to six months and reducing the objection period to two months."
"Awareness of the system varies greatly from country to country, often depending on the number of registered names in a country."
"The Commission makes funds for promoting quality products available to operators in order to raise consumer awareness of the system."
"deputising for the author. - Mr President, I want to thank the Commission for its reply."
"I think the labelling of food produce is something that is to be commended."
"But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues: first of all, the fact that there are some diverse standards; secondly, the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration."
"If ever there was an example of bureaucracy at European level, this surely is it."
"In my country, it takes the Department of Agriculture five years from the time that you actually make an application until you are registered."
"Given the crisis in Germany, we need more food labelling, we need more standards; we need more quality control."
"So I would urge the Commission that we should have a much tighter timeframe."
"(IT) Mr President, I am continuing the discussion on quality food."
"In the last two weeks, Italy has suffered economic damage amounting to EUR 20 million because of unsold vegetables - particularly cucumbers - as a result of the EHEC bacterium."
"It has been said that a loss of EUR 4.4 million was the result of the suspension of Russian imports alone."
"The entire fruit and vegetable sector is on its knees."
"I therefore ask the Commission what measures it intends to take in defence of the fruit and vegetable market and what further measures it intends to take to avoid the spread of unreliable information on the origins of the EHEC bacterium, which is hitting the entire fruit and vegetable sector and throwing whole populations into panic."
"We are talking of quality food!"
"Member of the Commission. - My response to the first question is that the Commission is aware of the need to speed up the legislation procedures."
"Proposals to this end have been made in the context of the Quality Package, which I referred to in my first answer."
"The Commission's proposals include reducing the time for scrutinising the application it receives to six months and also reducing the objection period to two months."
"If Parliament and the Council decide to adopt the Commission's proposals, almost one year - or ten months at least - will be saved for the majority of applications."
"As for the other question, there was a Health Council yesterday which dealt with the issue."
"We shall follow up on it at a later stage while taking today's extraordinary Agriculture Council into account."
"I am not in a position at this moment to give further details but we will definitely follow up on it."
"Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I apologise that I did not get here in time for the Commissioner's answer at the beginning."
"I suppose my question refers to the fact that there is a low level of awareness among producers in many countries, and in some countries it is very low."
"Is the Commission taking any steps to try and increase that level of awareness, not just amongst consumers but amongst producers?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, awareness of the system varies greatly from country to country, and the number of registered names in a given country also varies."
"European funds for promotion are available to operators to promote quality products, with more than EUR 19 million being allocated to fifteen promotion programmes between 2006 and 2010."
"Moreover, the Commission wishes to re-examine the policy for promoting agricultural products and a Green Paper is planned for this summer."
"This will be an opportunity to discuss the objectives of this policy once again, and to examine expectations with regard to promotion and quality of products and dissemination of information in this context."
"Subject: Youth unemployment"
"The economic crisis has devastated employment levels among young graduates."
"In November last year, unemployment among young people reached 21% across the EU."
"Youth unemployment stands at less than 10% in only three countries - Germany, the Netherlands and Austria."
"Elsewhere it is dramatic: in the Baltic States, Ireland, Greece and Slovakia, unemployment among young people stands at 30% or above."
"What steps does the Commissioner intend to take to prevent an exodus of young people from Europe?"
"How does the Commissioner intend to emulate the best practices of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria on an EU-wide scale?"
"Member of the Commission. - High unemployment among young people is one of the Commission's top priorities and is one of my foremost personal concerns."
"Lack of jobs could conceivably generate an exodus of young people from Europe, but the vast majority of young people who change countries to find work will probably choose to move to another Member State."
"That is why it is so important to promote freedom of movement for workers within the Union."
"It offers a solution in regions where unemployment among young people is high, given the labour shortages in certain sectors in some Member States that are evident from the Commission's new quarterly vacancy monitor."
"Promoting mobility among young people within the EU is one of the aims of the Europe 2020 flagship initiative: Youth on the Move."
"It outlines a wide range of measures to reduce the current high youth unemployment."
"Let me give you a few examples."
"Youth labour mobility will be promoted in particular through a new EU job mobility scheme, Your First EURES Job, which was launched with the support of this House and the Council."
"Its aim is to help young people find a job on the European labour market and assist employers in recruiting young European mobile workers."
"Your First EURES Job will provide advisory, job search, recruitment and financial support amounting, on average, to EUR 1 000 for more than 2 000 young job seekers and companies willing to recruit young EU workers."
"The Commission also encourages the Member States to introduce a youth guarantee to ensure that all young people are in further education, training or work within four months of finishing their general education."
"In Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, as the Honourable Member rightly points out, youth unemployment rates are relatively low."
"This is due, at least in part, to the comprehensive vocational education and training systems in those Member States, which facilitate young people's labour market integration."
"The Bruges Communiqué of December 2010 on enhanced European Cooperation in Vocational Education and Training for the period 2011-2020 is an important European achievement in this area."
"It outlines objectives and identifies the action needed to improve the quality of vocational training and make it more accessible and relevant to the needs of the labour market."
"I would also, as another element to my reply, like to highlight the Youth at Work campaign."
"Launched in Budapest on 29 April, Youth at Work will bring together small and medium-sized enterprises and young job seekers and will provide information and support to inspire young people to set up their own businesses."
"Over 30 events are planned between now and the end of 2012 when this campaign will end."
"Honourable Members, I hope that the avenues and initiatives I have indicated will be followed up with effective action within the Member States."
"The figures are frightening: the Baltic States, Ireland, Greece and Slovakia, 30%;"
"In Italy, 76% of youngsters say they are going to emigrate."
"I would love to think that youth mobility within Europe is the answer, but most of the countries in Europe, barring the three you mentioned, have unemployment problems."
"What we really need is to focus on the fact that Europe has an ageing population."
"We cannot afford this brain drain."
"These are highly educated, highly motivated young people and what we need is to hold them, to keep them, to introduce the kind of imaginative schemes that you have already mentioned in the three Member States, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission is recommending initiatives to the Member States."
"I think that in some of the Member States, however, we need some financial assistance in terms of training people and keeping them at home, because I think that, rather than feeding the jobs market within the EU, they will be feeding the job markets of Australia and other countries further afield."
"(PL) Mr President, my question to the Commissioner is of a slightly different kind."
"The Commissioner spoke about various measures which are intended to bring down unemployment, but did not say a single word about the fact that an important and more effective method could be for Member States to agree on the mutual recognition of qualifications gained in other Member States."
"Young people today often look for work in other countries, where they have to pass exams which are the same as the ones they have already taken."
"What is going to happen about this?"
"(RO) Mr President, the high unemployment rate means that the investments made by Member States in young people's education are being wasted at a time when the latter feel obliged to emigrate to a state outside the European Union."
"I want to ask you, Commissioner, given that the school dropout rate has reached 16%, and even 40% in Portugal, how will the youth unemployment rate look in 15-20 years' time and what measures are you taking to ensure that this does not happen?"
"Member of the Commission. - In my answer, I highlighted the measures that have already been outlined in Europe 2020 and already they are making their way towards practice in various Member States through effective Commission programmes."
"It is also true that this is more of a horizontal issue for the Commission, and there are in other EU initiatives very relevant proposals including, for example, the country-specific recommendations which we just published today, very important references to the need to reform education policies and improve the performance of education and training systems in various Member States in order to better connect the substance of education and training with the needs of the labour market."
"This can qualitatively improve the employment opportunities of young people in a number of Member States, including Spain and others where the situation is the most difficult and where the reform of the education system was either delayed or ignored in the recent period."
"It is also important to highlight the Single Market Act which, among other initiatives, aims at promoting the recognition of qualifications and diplomas, thus making the European labour market more transparent and more efficient, highlighting and raising more opportunities than in the past."
"It is also important to stress that many actions are supported by the financial instruments of the EU, especially in this context, the European Social Fund, but I should also mention the new Microfinance Facility that provides programmes and, in the latter case, entrepreneurship and self-employment opportunities, and I think these dimensions have to be reflected in the forthcoming MFF proposal as well."
"I trust that the Parliament will be supportive in this area within the MFF."
"Subject: Migration and the Schengen area"
"The principle of freedom of movement in the Schengen area is in danger of being compromised by the North African crisis, as reflected in talks between Italy and France concerning the relocation of migrants coming chiefly from Tunisia and the reintroduction of border controls. This is also confirmed by statements issued by French officials on the need to re-examine certain provisions of the Schengen Agreement."
"What action does the Commission intend to take to prevent freedom of movement in the Schengen area, a cornerstone of European unification, being compromised?"
"Given that the introduction of the Schengen area has shifted responsibility for EU external border controls onto a limited number of Member States, how will the Commission persuade Member States as a whole to show greater and more effective solidarity in the face of a mass influx of migrants and overcome their manifest reluctance to assume their responsibilities in this respect, so as to ensure that the burden is fairly shared?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the question that has been raised by Mr Papanikolaou addresses - as do later questions - the different angles and perspectives of Schengen, the migratory crisis and the pressure put on Schengen."
"So let me first answer Mr Papanikolaou."
"Earlier, we discussed Mr Coelho's report and the need to safeguard Schengen as one of the most beautiful achievements of the European Union."
"The right to move freely is indeed a very important embodiment of the European project."
"More than 1.25 billion cross-border journeys are made by tourists within the EU each year."
"Free movement is also a great boost and a benefit for the Internal Market, so safeguarding this achievement is key to the Commission and an absolute priority for me personally."
"Let me emphasise once again that the Commission's approach is to reinforce Schengen, to improve the evaluation - as we already proposed before Christmas - to clarify the rules, to identify the tools, to assist Member States in need and, possibly, to introduce a mechanism which would bring a coordinated Community-based response to exceptional situations, for instance, when a Member State fails to control its internal borders."
"The Commission's main objective is to have a preventive approach."
"The proposed changes to strengthen the monitoring mechanism, which is designed to maintain mutual trust between the Member States and their capacity to apply effectively and efficiently the accompanying measures, will make it possible to maintain an area without borders."
"This will be done through more on-the-spot visits to check the application of the Schengen acquis to Member States."
"These controls could lead to recommendations to the Member States for immediate actions and deadlines for implementing them."
"Increased trust among Member States will also reduce the recourse by Member States to unilateral initiatives to temporarily reintroduce internal borders or to intensify police checks at internal border zones."
"The spirit of Schengen is a spirit of trust and solidarity."
"It is important that the EU show concrete solidarity to the Member States most affected by large-scale inflows of migrants and persons in need of international protection."
"This solidarity can take different forms by assisting, for instance, where the external border is under pressure."
"Frontex plays a key role here and we have shown in the recent RABIT intervention at the Greek-Turkish border, and in the joint naval operation Hermes, that Member States are ready to assist other Member States."
"We must also foster daily cooperation between national authorities in the field of border surveillance."
"This is the purpose of the European border surveillance system (EUROSUR), which has been progressively developed since 2008, and for which the Commission will present a legislative proposal during this year."
"We can also show solidarity by showing financial solidarity."
"There is a framework programme this year that takes into consideration the management of migration flows."
"We have a financial mechanism to improve the management of these flows at the European level and to strengthen the solidarity between Member States."
"Of course, we now have a large consultation process and we are under budgetary restraints, but you can count on me to ensure that there will still be money under this fund for the future as well."
"Those Member States most exposed to migratory pressures and located at the external borders of the EU must receive adequate financial compensation for the tasks they are carrying out in the interests of the Schengen area as a whole - this by fair burden-sharing in order to support those Member States affected by large inflows of persons in need of international protection."
"It must be clear that any decision on the relocation of irregular migrants and beneficiaries of international protection depends on the Council and on the willingness of the Member States."
"The Member States have not yet expressed any support for such an approach on a general basis with, however, one notable exception - the pilot project on relocation to other Member States for persons who have received international protection on Malta."
"In order to give a timely follow-up to this, I organised a pledging conference a month ago."
"I am pleased to say that over 300 places were made available from Member States and associated countries."
"Others will hopefully be offered in the future as well."
"This is a sign of concrete solidarity."
"I want to thank those countries and I hope that they can also contribute in the future."
"(EL) Commissioner, thank you very much."
"I absolutely agree with you, as - I believe - does Parliament."
"That much was also clear back during the debate on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"At the same time, however, as you well know, there are unanimity issues in the Council on the issue of Bulgaria and Romania."
"You spoke about trust."
"Yes, we want to keep building up trust."
"Does Denmark, in the choice it has made, accept that statement on your part?"
"You also commented on the question of the new mechanism."
"In light of the summit, does this debate on the mechanism strengthen the perception of trust - I recall that, anyway, Article 23 of the Schengen Code makes provision for a mechanism for exceptional situations - or does it perhaps ultimately cause renewed concerns in the Member States and in all the States in the Schengen area?"
"(IT) Commissioner, before the end of next month, the European Commission will formulate the proposal for the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period from 2014 to 2020."
"In addition to FRONTEX, which you have already mentioned, what actions does the European Commission intend funding to support those Member States that have been worst hit by asylum applications and, above all, to prevent the future intensification of the influx of economic migrants?"
"In other words, what actions does it intend funding through the Mediterranean neighbourhood policies to prevent widespread immigration in the coming months and years?"
"Member of the Commission. - Trust can never be commanded, it has to be deserved and earned."
"We can only try to improve the trust between Member States by having a more vigorous governance over Schengen; to make sure that we evaluate, not by the peer-review system we have today, but through an independent mechanism on a European communitarian basis with the involvement of the European Union in order to identify problems or weaknesses in the Schengen system very early on and also make sure that we have tools at our disposal to immediately assist Member States that are in difficulty."
"Hopefully, that should allow us to increase the trust."
"In answer to the other honourable Member, we are now negotiating the framework, so I am not in a position to give you any figures."
"However, as we do today, we are seeking to increase the independence and the resources of Frontex."
"We are also seeking to facilitate Member States' access to the various funds under migration by simplifying and by making it easier when it comes to borders, asylum, integration, etc."
"Of course we need to distinguish between irregular migrants and migrants in need of international protection."
"As you know, the Council and Parliament are now negotiating to have the resettlement programme in place, and this is also an area where the European Commission could look at possibilities for financing quite a lot of it."
"In relation to our immediate neighbourhood across the Mediterranean, in the mobility partnerships: we are looking to include all aspects of irregular, legal and international protection asylum under migration."
"All this demands a lot of political will and some extra resources, and I will do my best to fight to make sure that there are resources under my responsibility."
"Part two"
"Subject: Visa scheme for Kosovo"
"What is the Commission's assessment of the current state of progress towards visa liberalisation for Kosovo (visa facilitation scheme), and what is the timetable for action on this urgent matter?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is currently constantly monitoring all the steps taken by the Kosovo authorities to fulfil the conditions for the launching of the visa liberalisation dialogue."
"We have said all the time that there are two key issues remaining in order to engage in such a dialogue: sound readmission, and reintegration policies in line with the EU standards."
"Implementation of the law on readmission and of the bilateral readmission agreements with the EU Member States needs to continue in a good manner."
"There have been two assessment missions in Kosovo - in June last year and in December last year - to assess the state of play in Kosovo regarding the integration process."
"These have shown that there is a lot of progress, but there are still some things to be done, and we are in dialogue with the Kosovo Government in order to help and assist them to do these last things."
"There must also be progress at the municipal level."
"We receive regular updates from Kosovo, and I also meet with the responsible ministers, and once all these elements are in place, we are ready to launch a new mission to go there and see what steps can be taken in order to open the visa liberalisation dialogue."
"We are not there yet, but there is a lot of progress in Kosovo and we are working very closely with the government in order to support them and help them make progress."
"(DE) Many thanks, Commissioner, for a very good answer."
"I just wanted to ask whether you think it is possible that this mission could still make it to Kosovo this year, or is that something that you really could not judge?"
"Would it not be important that a country so small that we are pouring funding and effort into supporting it could also give its young people the opportunity to really get to know Europe?"
"It is certainly completely counterproductive to 'imprison' the populace there."
"I know that you sympathise with the idea of opening up borders, but do you regard it as realistic that this mission could perhaps still take place during the Polish Presidency?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr Posselt, I fully share your ambition to do everything to prevent Kosovo from becoming an isolated little island in this region, in which we are trying remove visa barriers one by one."
"We are certainly not going to abandon Kosovo."
"The timing is very much in the hands of Kosovo's government."
"We are working with the Kosovans, and as soon as they inform us that they have done everything we asked them to do, they can come to us and we will send that mission."
"It is very much in their hands, but we have no time limits."
"We can come whenever they call and whenever reasonable progress has been made."
"Subject: Countering the use of the Internet by criminals"
"The rapid growth of technology and, in particular, the Internet, is making criminal organisations more and more difficult to penetrate."
"Criminals are now communicating with one another via the Internet, rather than by mobile phone, which had been the method of choice until recently."
"How does the Commission propose to combat the use of the Internet by criminal gangs across Europe?"
"Member of the Commission. - Cybercrime is indeed a growing menace."
"It is going increasingly mobile, and recent threat analysis suggests that organised crime is getting increasingly involved in criminal activities in cyberspace."
"So the Commission is pursuing various activities in the field to improve overall cybersecurity and to prevent and to tackle cybercrime."
"At the policy level, specific objectives and road maps have been set in recent policy documents."
"We have the European digital agenda and the European internal security strategy."
"In that strategy, cybercrime is clearly identified as one of the priorities for us to work on for the future."
"Last year, we also tabled two legislative proposals: one in March, a directive on child online exploitation, was adopted by the Commission and I know it is now being negotiated, and also a proposal for directives on attacks against information cybersystems."
"That was last September; it is also being negotiated between you and the Council, and I know that a lot of progress has been made."
"This, of course, strives to adopt European legislation in the face of recent threats in cyberspace."
"We have, in particular, included provisions to penalise the use of tools such as malicious code that are used to create so-called botnets, which have been used by criminals."
"International cooperation is also key to fighting cybercrime and that is why we are engaging with international partners on these issues."
"We have the working group between the EU and the United States, created last November, where we have had a series of different expert meetings."
"We will report on progress for the next EU-US Summit in November this year."
"We also plan to set up a cybercentre where we could coordinate at European level the efforts that are being made in the different Member States."
"Cybercrime is directly influenced by rapid technological advances, quickly emerging in new business models, but also by the ability of law enforcement and wider society to come to terms with such fluid environments as cyberspace."
"Cybercrime is becoming a volume crime."
"It is for this reason that we need jointly to get our systems in order and share intelligence in order to attack this issue."
"If there is reason to believe that organised crime groups are behind more and more crimes on the Internet, the same investigative measures applied in the detection and prosecution of offline organised crime should be applied, coupled of course with an improved coordination mechanism."
"Finally, ten years ago, the Council of Europe Convention - the Budapest Convention - on Cybercrime was adopted."
"Ten years later, not all the Member States have signed and ratified that convention."
"We are pushing, by all means, for ratification by the end of the year, the tenth anniversary, because it would prove an important commitment by all Member States to fighting these crimes."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"I understand that there are people bragging and conducting so-called criminal business on the Internet, and that gang business includes drug trafficking, human trafficking, prostitution, weapons trafficking, smuggling illegal immigrants across borders, even murder, theft, fraud, armed robbery and much more."
"This is all being done on Facebook, using the system, and it is being bragged about."
"Surely it is possible for Europol and the service providers - perhaps even coordinated by the Commission - to identify some of these people."
"The more they feel that they are immune, the more their numbers will grow."
"I would ask the Commissioner to consider taking some special steps to coordinate a response to what some of these people are doing on the Internet."
"(RO) The number, scope and severity of cyber attacks have grown in recent years."
"Their victims are ordinary citizens, companies or even public, local, national or European institutions."
"The European Union needs to enhance its strategy for combating cybercrime."
"I would like to ask you, apart from the legislative framework and extending ENISA's mandate, what measures is the Commission intending to take to enhance its leading role in guaranteeing cybersecurity?"
"Member of the Commission. - Yes indeed, ordinary crime is also now being carried out on the Internet because it is a useful tool, but there are also new kinds of crime that are facilitated by the Internet, such as identity fraud or the plundering of bank accounts or suchlike."
"You can be assured that we follow this very closely."
"Just recently, Europol made some quite remarkable attacks on some of these gangs, identifying cross-border European gangs involved in child pornography, for instance, but also in trafficking and drugs, so there are a lot of experts at Europol dealing with this."
"Of course we need to do more."
"We need to connect all the alert centres in the European Union, to share statistics, to share information and also to work more together with private companies in order to identify the solutions to this to a certain extent."
"We are also planning - and conducting a feasibility study right now - to set up a European cybercentre by 2013 to coordinate this work, to work as an alert centre and to support the different national cybercentres that already exist."
"We are following this very closely, and Europol, together with the national authorities, is doing its utmost to try to combat this increasing crime."
"Subject: Schengen evaluations and the possible suspension mechanism"
"There is a danger that Commission proposals for governance of the Schengen zone are seen to be prioritising European procedure over European substance."
"The Commission is suggesting a dominant lead for itself in a revised Schengen evaluation process, and Parliament proposes to modify that in order to allow a balance between the role of European and national experts."
"In relation to Schengen suspension, the Commission is proposing an EU mechanism instead of Member State decision, but this has been widely (mis)interpreted to mean that the reintroduction of internal borders will actually be easier in practice."
"Since it may well prove politically too difficult to implement a Community method for both evaluations and suspension, however worthwhile, would it not be better to make European substance the priority by launching infringement proceedings when necessary against Member States in breach of Schengen rules?"
"Subject: Implementation of the Schengen Agreement"
"Freedom of movement for European citizens unimpeded by internal borders following the creation of the Schengen area is one of the basic principles of the EU and the cornerstone of European integration."
"The reintroduction of border controls within the EU does not provide a solution to migration and will, on the contrary, make life more difficult for European citizens and lead to a nationalistic outlook."
"In view of this and the statement by the EP President to the effect that freedom of movement is perhaps the aspect of the EU most appreciated by Europeans, what position does the Commission intend to adopt with regard to Denmark following its recent decision to reintroduce border controls?"
"Is it willing to take measures further to strengthen external EU borders?"
"Will it review the principle that the Member State of entry bears sole responsibility for illegal immigrants?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will take both questions at the same time because they are almost identical."
"They address the challenge of maintaining and further developing Schengen in view of the migration crisis."
"I did briefly touch on this in my reply to Mr Papanikolaou's question, but these elements should, of course, be kept in mind in this context as well."
"In the question, Ms Ludford expressed concerns that the negotiations on the new Schengen evaluation and suspension rules might be lengthy and difficult to agree upon and asked the Commission to prioritise launching infringement procedures against Member States in breach of Schengen rules instead."
"Let me be very clear on this: infringement of Schengen rules cannot be tolerated, but one element does not exclude the other."
"We are also planning to follow a parallel approach."
"We are the guardians of EU law."
"The Commission will continue to make sure that the Schengen rules are correctly applied and respected by everybody."
"The basis of our work needs to be the existing legislation."
"I am convinced that the current legislation can cater for a vast majority of the situations."
"Where there are any differences in interpretation or implementation, the Commission should consult the Member States in question and clarify the rules."
"This can be done by issuing guidelines or recommendations."
"The Commission is ready to use all available means to ensure the correct application of EU law, including launching infringement procedures whenever such action is necessary."
"At the same time, we will work on the preventive measures which should help us to avoid infringement procedures."
"In this context, we now have ongoing negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council with a view to establishing a more efficient evaluation system for Schengen."
"We are currently considering whether and how to complement this evaluation mechanism in order to create mutual trust and ensure a coherent application of the rules."
"Regarding the Danish Government's plan regarding controls on the Danish internal borders, which Ms Koppa referred to, you will, of course, be aware that the President of the Commission wrote to the Danish Prime Minister immediately, pointing out that the first analysis by the Commission raised major doubts about whether the proposed measures would be in line with Denmark's obligations under European and international law."
"President Barroso emphasised that Member States may not carry out systematic intra-EU border controls of goods or people and urged Denmark to refrain from taking unilateral steps."
"We are now analysing the information provided by Denmark and will then decide on further action."
"Ms Koppa also asked whether the Commission will propose a revision of the principle of exclusive responsibility of the state of first illegal entry."
"I would like to underline that this is a principle according to which a person found irregularly on the territory of a Member State is returned to the state of first entry into the EU."
"It is a specific rule under the Dublin Regulation, which establishes that the Member States have to assess which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application lodged on their territory."
"It is therefore not an instrument designed to respond to the challenges related to irregular migration."
"In the Commission proposal for a recast of the Dublin Regulation, this principle remains untouched."
"The Member States that play the biggest role in the applicant's entry into the EU should be responsible for examining his or her application for asylum."
"The European Parliament expressed overwhelming support for this in its vote on the proposal in May 2009."
"This support was confirmed by the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in November last year."
"Commissioner, I am, of course, very glad to hear you stress again the importance that you attach to the maintenance of the Schengen area."
"I know you are very sincere on that, but my worry is that, despite that, people seem to have got the wrong end of the stick and the impression has got abroad - for instance, last week an article in the Financial Times said that 'Schengen as well as the eurozone was disintegrating' - that somehow the Commission is fairly relaxed about the reintroduction of internal border controls."
"I fear that the emphasis the Commission puts, as it were, on its own institutional rights is not being tracked through to its determination in practice, its zeal in practice, to take infringement proceedings if necessary."
"I have not heard of Rome and Paris receiving a letter of the kind that the President sent to Copenhagen."
"(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your clear reply on the question of Schengen and for referring to a previous question on the measure to redistribute immigrants in the Member States, based on demographic, economic and geographical criteria."
"Be that as it may, I should like to point out on the question of the Dublin II Regulation that, for certain countries today like my country, Greece, which lie on the external borders of the Union and actually receive approximately 90% of immigrants who land in Europe, the Dublin II Regulation is unacceptable; it is not something that local populations can accept; it is not something that the countries can accept."
"Consequently, from our point of view, a recast in light - at the very least - of the new developments, is a standing request."
"(EL) Commissioner, you referred earlier to the emphasis placed on the concept of solidarity and on fair burden-sharing."
"You very rightly reminded us that negotiations on the resettlement of refugees from third countries are imminent."
"You also announced last year that we were waiting for the new programme on internal resettlement."
"Could you please tell us if the Commission will be making an announcement soon?"
"Secondly, as regards Dublin II, I should like to point out the following, to add to what Mrs Koppa said."
"France has suspended returns to Greece, as has Germany."
"The European Court of Human Rights has convicted us on specific grounds, both for Dublin II and for its operability."
"What else must happen in order for us to understand that Dublin II needs to be recast immediately, as requested by Parliament?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am sorry if there is a false impression about the Commission's views on Schengen."
"I do not think I have spoken about anything other than Schengen for the last month!"
"I have emphasised how important Schengen is, what a gift it is to the European Union and that we must strengthen it and not weaken it."
"We look very seriously upon all reports of the suspension of Schengen."
"We are engaged in dialogue with Italy, France and Denmark in order to clarify exactly what has been done, what is being proposed, and whether it is in compliance with Schengen rules."
"We are also looking at how we can strengthen the evaluation of Schengen in order to make sure, beforehand, that the current peer review system, which is not very good, is exchanged for something that is done at a European level, with an increased role for the European Parliament."
"We need to have more tools at our disposal to assist Member States."
"We need to be better at issuing guidelines."
"We also need to clarify under what exceptional circumstances suspension can be carried out in order to avoid unilateral action that jeopardises the whole system."
"So you can rest assured that we will do our utmost to strengthen Schengen and that we need more European engagement there, not less."
"Dublin is, of course, related to this, but it is a parallel process."
"This is part of the negotiations on the asylum package that are currently taking place between Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission has proposed keeping the responsibility of the first country of asylum in the Dublin Regulation, but also reintroducing an emergency mechanism in order to suspend that mechanism under special circumstances."
"This is very controversial in the Member States; very few support such an emergency mechanism."
"It is one of the most difficult areas of the negotiations on the asylum package."
"So that is not the solution to the Greek problem."
"In parallel with putting the asylum system in place for the whole of Europe, which would also lead to greater burden-sharing - because if all Member States have a system that works, all Member States could receive asylum seekers - the solution for Greece is to continue with the reform plans that are being implemented under the action plan in Greece."
"The Commission and the Member States are supporting Greece with a huge amount of money, expertise, interpreters and administrators."
"We are assisting Greece in the important work it is doing to build up a system that is in line with European law."
"A lot has been done, but there is a lot still to do. This has to be done in parallel with the negotiations on the asylum system."
"Subject: Future of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)"
"A number of votes and declarations have proven that there is consensus within the EU on various aspects of this fund."
"First of all, it differs from the European Social Fund in both its methodology and its objectives. The two instruments cannot therefore be confused, either formally or in practice."
"Secondly, despite a slow start, changes to the implementing regulation in 2009 enabled the EGF to be used more effectively."
"Indeed, a clear increase in applications to mobilise this tool that brings the Union closer to its workers has been noted."
"There is therefore no doubt that it needs to be made sustainable."
"Lastly, this specific aspect of the EGF calls for it to be regarded as a permanent fund in its own right, with sufficient payment appropriations to ensure that no transfers have to be made in order to mobilise it."
"What does the Commission think about establishing a genuine fund that is on a par with the others, to meet all the needs of the EGF without restricting the role of the European Parliament which has been so involved in this issue?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am grateful for the interest you have shown in the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"This year will be crucial for the Fund's future, because the Commission intends to make a proposal on the rules governing the fund and the way it will function in the next programming period."
"Over the past few months, the Commission has carried out consultations on this matter with the Fund's most important stakeholders."
"In particular, we have closely examined Parliament's own excellent report on the EGF, which was drawn up by Mr Portas a few months ago."
"On the basis of experience gained with the Fund in its present form and suggestions made during consultations, we have great hopes that our proposal will significantly improve the fund after 2013 and will, in particular, solve two problems with the current mechanism for financing."
"The first issue is the time it takes for a contribution to be granted once a Member State has submitted an application."
"A large part of that time is taken up by assessing the application."
"The Commission is looking at ways of clarifying or simplifying the information that the Member States will have to provide to demonstrate that applications are eligible."
"A lot of time is also taken up with the need to request and obtain approval for each application from both arms of the budgetary authority."
"This also holds up payment of contributions from the Fund, to the detriment of the workers, because some Member States are reluctant to advance payments for training, job-search assistance and other measures."
"In addition, the number of applications submitted to the Fund, and thus the overall amount applied for, has increased significantly over the last two years."
"This has made it increasingly difficult to identify sufficient margins from which to draw contributions."
"That is a problem."
"Commission approval of applications to the Fund in 2011 had to be postponed for the first time because sufficient payment appropriations could not be found quickly."
"I am sure you will agree that this is not helpful to workers who have been made redundant and need assistance quickly."
"We need to find solutions for these problems and bring the mechanism for financing the Fund more closely into line with these objectives."
"At present, there are several options on the table."
"For instance, the Fund could be part of the European Social Fund."
"It could have its own budget."
"The Commission has taken no decision yet on the best way of addressing these issues, but it intends to table a proposal in autumn on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund of the future, bearing European workers' best interests in mind."
"I look forward to hearing your views."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on Mr Daerden's behalf, I would like to thank you for your reply."
"Naturally, we will support any initiatives that help speed up procedures when these are aimed at helping workers who have been made redundant due to globalisation or to the economic crisis."
"We simply wished to draw your attention to two particular problems."
"The first is that the purpose of supporting workers should remain the number one priority."
"This means that as the procedures are revised, we will oppose the idea of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) becoming just another instrument, for example, an instrument of the cohesion policy, because that would mean that all the EU's money apart from funds put aside for foreign policy or research and development would belong to the cohesion policy."
"We have specific aims to pursue and we need these resources."
"The EGF is among them."
"We are also asking you to coordinate management of the EGF, in collaboration with your fellow commissioners, with other policies that have an impact in this area, for example, in the field of competition or industrial policy."
"(EL) Commissioner, at the beginning the year, when asked if Greece had filed a request for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to be activated, you replied that it had not."
"This reply caused a stir in Greece, due to the economic and social situation in the country."
"My question to you is very straightforward: six months later, has my country filed a request for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to be activated, in order to support workers affected by the financial crisis?"
"If it has, if you have that information, please tell me if it has been approved."
"If it has not, can you explain why no such request has been filed by Greece?"
"I did have a question for the Commissioner further on, which we will not get to tonight, and which did indeed ask for his view on the merging of the ESF and the EGF, on which you have spoken but did not give us an opinion."
"So, if you are in a position to do that, I would appreciate hearing it, and also, if there were to be a merger, would you see an increase in budgetary appropriations for the Social Fund?"
"Finally, my other question relates to the timing, and you spoke about the difficulty with the Commission and the budgetary authority."
"What about also encouraging Member States, as soon as they have applied for the EGF, to start putting in place themselves the measures that they have applied for under the EGF, because that at least would ensure that workers would not be waiting for the application of the Fund?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am glad to hear in the discussion confirmation of the Commission's objectives in this exercise to bring the EGF into the next financial perspective as a stronger and more effective instrument to support workers who have been made redundant."
"This case is also supported by the fact that, in the near future, fiscal consolidation will remain on the agenda in most of the Member States, and they will find it extremely helpful if there is a strong, quick and effective EU-level instrument to support workers who suddenly find themselves out of a job."
"As I pointed out, some questions remain open, such as the relationship between the EGF and the ESF."
"As you know, the ESF is implemented through shared management, and I believe that the management system of the current ESF is not compatible with the objectives of the EGF."
"No matter what eventual format we find, I think this question of management will be very important in influencing the final arrangements."
"I am not speaking about names, but about the need for a separate fund and the need to pay attention to speed in particular."
"Of course, even now, and probably also in the future, various Member States will find it possible to fund programmes either from the EGF or the ESF and have some kind of room for manoeuvre, but it is very important just to keep the EGF available for all Member States in case there is a need to respond to sudden employment crises."
"The second question pointed to the problem of defining eligibility in the current regulation."
"This is also an issue we are looking at in order to have a greater level of clarity, but at the moment, we are simply working on extending the temporary regulation until the end of this financial perspective."
"I am speaking here about the rules which have been introduced in response to the crisis and to make the EGF more effective in tackling the impact of the crisis on workers."
"Mr President, can you indicate how many more questions you might be prepared to take in this section?"
"Mr Aylward, I did say before you came in that we had 20 minutes per Commissioner, which would mean that we could possibly get to Question 15 by Mrs Blinkevičiūtė, but I am afraid I do not think we are going to make it to yours."
"Perhaps you could put a supplementary to another question?"
"Subject: Collective labour agreements"
"Having had recourse to the bailout mechanism, Greece, Spain and Portugal have come under heavy pressure from the Commission and the IMF to make major changes to industrial relations and collective bargaining procedures under the terms of the respective 'Memorandums', thereby overturning national guarantees for workers."
"For example, in the case of Greece, the Memorandum stipulates the following: 'The government shall ensure that company-level agreements take precedence over sectoral agreements, which, in turn, take precedence over occupational agreements."
"The government shall remove the provision that allows the Ministry of Labour to extend all sectoral agreements to those not represented in negotiations'."
"Furthermore, under Article 156 TFEU, matters relating to collective bargaining are governed by the principle of subsidiarity."
"In view of this: Is the Commission aware that this approach not only is creating a vicious circle of pay cuts and erosion of workers' rights but also runs counter to the Treaties, which the Commission is required to respect?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission acknowledges that the Greek crisis has a high social cost for sections of the population in Greece, but that cost is mainly the result of financial imbalances, diminishing competitiveness and financial difficulties: the very difficulties the Memorandum seeks to resolve and not exacerbate."
"Some claim that, because these are in the Memorandum, it does not observe the principle of subsidiarity provided for in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"I do not believe that is true."
"The measures in the Memorandum were drawn up in close cooperation with the Greek Government and endorsed by the Greek Parliament."
"That shows that they respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union backs up my opinion."
"Article 28 of the Charter stipulates that, in line with EU and national laws and practices, workers or their organisations have the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate levels, and, in cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action."
"However, Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law."
"There is no specific EU legislation regulating which collective agreements take precedence when they are concluded at different levels, nor is there any specific EU legislation regulating the possibility of extending collective agreements concluded at branch level by way of state intervention."
"These issues therefore fall exclusively within the remit of national law, with due regard for the relevant international obligations of Greece, including the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation."
"I trust that I have answered the questions satisfactorily."
"I also trust that I have convinced you that the fiscal, financial and structural measures in the Memorandum are vital if Greece is to come out of the crisis."
"I hope I have allayed the fears some of you may have about the failure to observe the principle of subsidiarity."
"(EL) Commissioner, I am sorry, but once again, you have not given a clear reply."
"You gave me more or less the same reply to my written questions."
"If the Commission really does respect the fact that the collective agreement regime is a question of national legislation, then are you or are you not infringing the role vested in you under the Treaties when you call for the collective agreement regime basically to be abolished?"
"Your interpretation is not adopted by the European trade unions which have filed a complaint against you for infringement of the Treaties."
"My question is this: who is calling for collective agreements to be abolished?"
"Is it you?"
"Is it the International Monetary Fund?"
"Is it Greece's, Portugal's and Ireland's lenders?"
"A clear reply, if you please."
"Member of the Commission. - (microphone switched off until middle of first sentence) ... much of the institutional arrangements including the wage setting arrangements in various Member States."
"These emergency situations have been handled through policies that were jointly developed by the EU, the IMF, the ECB and the governments of the Member States concerned."
"Indeed, there are still some open questions, and also some raised by the so-called Euro-Plus Pact."
"We recently held a number of discussions about the connection between social dialogue and economic governance with the social partners, including the ETUC."
"This is an ongoing discussion."
"I am not saying that all the questions have been answered and that is exactly why I took the initiative of organising a conference on wages and wage setting in the EU."
"This conference will take place with the involvement of the social partners and other stakeholders in September."
"We will continue this discussion and hopefully find the right answers."
"Subject: Review of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community"
"The reference framework for the free movement of workers is laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community and has been revised several times."
"Parliament is currently drafting a report on promoting professional mobility in the EU."
"The Commission representative who attended the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs stated on 19 April 2011 that the Commission was preparing to revise and improve the regulation."
"When, in the Commission's view, is that process likely to begin?"
"Member of the Commission. - The free movement of workers is a fundamental principle of the EU."
"Together with the free movement of goods, services, and capital, it is a pillar of the Single Market and has contributed to European integration over the last 50 years."
"It also has a significant social dimension, insofar as it fosters the social, economic and cultural integration of EU migrant workers and members of their families into the host Member State."
"The body of EU law on free movement of workers gives EU citizens the right to move freely within the Union for work purposes and protects the social rights of workers and their family members."
"As you know, 1 May 2011 was an important date for the EU."
"It marked the end of restrictions on the right to work of citizens from the eight Member States which joined in 2004, who can now work freely in any Member State."
"The Commission hopes that the Member States which still apply transitional measures to workers from Romania and Bulgaria will liberalise their labour markets when the second phase expires on 31 December 2011."
"The end of transitional arrangements means that more EU citizens can take advantage of one of the EU's fundamental freedoms and work freely in another Member State."
"That opens great opportunities for the individual, who can move where there are jobs, and also for the economy."
"I know that mobility and freedom of movement for workers are also important to this House."
"The Commission is pleased with the own-initiative report on promoting worker mobility within the European Union and is following the debate in the parliamentary committees with great interest."
"But we are also aware that, despite the large body of EU legislation in the area of freedom of movement for workers, most EU citizens still feel there are too many obstacles to working in another Member State."
"The situation has been highlighted on several occasions recently."
"The Monti Report of 9 May 2010 - 'A New Strategy for the Single Market' - points out that, while freedom of movement for workers is a success overall from a legal viewpoint, it is the least-used of our four Single Market freedoms."
"Tackling these problems calls for a broad approach, combined with effective implementation of the principle of free movement."
"The enforceability of the right of free movement conferred by EU law is particularly relevant in cases of discrimination on the basis of nationality, as the individuals concerned need to have suitable mechanisms to ensure such rights are properly protected."
"The Commission services are currently evaluating EU legislation on the free movement of workers, and in particular Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, and are exploring the options for improving the enforcement of EU law on freedom of movement, including, where necessary, by presenting an initiative in 2012."
"Parliament's report on worker mobility therefore comes at the right time, and will certainly contribute to the debate on enforcement of EU law on free movement of workers and the choice of any further action on this issue."
"(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your answer."
"We are really looking forward to the revised regulation that will be presented by the Commission next year, but I would like to hear whether you feel that the Commission should evaluate the negative consequences of the free movement of workers, as well as the positive consequences."
"For instance, there has been an exodus from some European Union countries of qualified, well-trained workers, in which Member States had made a significant investment."
"They have moved to other European Union countries."
"Do you not feel that we should establish a certain fund so that we could compensate the losses experienced by those Member States that have lost trained, qualified workers."
"Member of the Commission. - This is a very topical question."
"We have recently had a number of discussions in the context of 1 May."
"I took up this issue with the employment ministers of the Visegrád countries, and of the Baltic states."
"We have been looking at where free movement might lead to a certain amount of tension, especially when it affects certain professions where free movement is not leading to a circular phenomenon, but more of a one-way street."
"If such tendencies are observed, it is primarily up to the Member State governments to draw up the right strategies regarding training, remuneration and career opportunities to improve development for those in the medical profession, for example, which has been a particular focus of these discussions."
"We will continue to monitor this problem and continue to discuss it with the governments of the relevant Member States, as I have already been doing."
"Subject: Reallocation of financial resources in the regional and cohesion funds"
"Is the Commission prepared to reallocate at least 10% of the EUR 51 billion currently available each year in the regional and cohesion funds to fast-start funding for new electricity networks for renewable energy?"
"Mr Martin, thank you very much for the question."
"It is important to point out that, for the current funding period, 2007-2013, the resources under the heading of the structural funds have already been allocated and agreed with the regions and the Member States within the framework of the more than 400 operating programmes."
"Part of the overall process at the beginning of a funding period is to determine the programmes for the current period and to decide what funding is available for the individual programmes."
"In accordance with the concept of shared duties or shared management, it is the Member States and/or the regions that are responsible for the implementation of the programmes on the ground."
"They are also competent and responsible for the selection and implementation of the projects and, ultimately, for monitoring - at least on the initial level."
"Even at the beginning of this period, the subject of energy efficiency and promoting renewable forms of energy was an important point."
"This is one of the priorities of regional policy, which is also implemented in the form of tailor-made proposals in several of the roughly 400 programmes that I referred to earlier."
"On the basis of this agreement with the regions and with the Member States, a budget totalling EUR 9.2 billion is envisaged for a sustainable energy policy in the current period, with the key focuses being renewable energy and improving energy efficiency."
"With a 2009 decision of Parliament and the Council, we also established the possibility that up to 4% of the resources from the European Regional Development Fund could be used for measures to improve the energy efficiency of residential buildings."
"Since then, around half of the Member States have made use of this, with France being particularly exemplary in using and implementing this possibility."
"(DE) Commissioner, please do not be angry, but let us get serious."
"I would like to read my question to you."
"It is as follows: is the Commission prepared to reallocate at least 10% of the EUR 51 billion currently available each year to fast-start funding for new electricity networks for renewable energy?"
"You have now had quite a lot to tell us, all of it correct."
"It is just that none of it is what is at issue."
"What is at issue is sending out a signal and saying, yes, we have understood."
"Yes, we are drawing the conclusions from Fukushima."
"Yes, we really are serious about 2020."
"To push forward energy change, we need to bring the electricity from northern Germany to Austria."
"My father was head of Voralberger Kraftwerke, the power generating company for the Austrian Province of Voralberg."
"I am sure you have experience in this area."
"You need power lines to do this."
"Once again, my question is, are you personally prepared to really get this fast-start funding specifically, which everyone is saying that we urgently need, off the ground and not merely implement what your predecessors decided?"
"Mr Martin, I did read your question very carefully."
"That is why I also gave you a very specific answer based on the rules that we have in the field of regional policy."
"The essence of these rules consists of there being agreements in the Member States, and these cannot be unilaterally altered by either the Commission or the regions."
"Personally, I would want the resources already in place to be used for this, and I would be pleased if that were the case."
"I find myself going from conference to conference, from Member State to Member State, like a living Tibetan prayer wheel, pleading the case for these resources - which are already in place - to be used."
"As the expansion of renewable energies does indeed represent one of the focal points of the Europe 2020 strategy, I assume that, in the forthcoming period, there will definitively be a higher budget for this area, including from the regional policy heading."
"Moreover, there will certainly be investments in this connection, in collaboration with Mr Oettinger, in the field of infrastructure when it comes to trans-European networks in the field of energy provision."
"If, today, regions are seeking to re-dedicate resources in addition to the resources already available, we are certainly very open, in this area, to the idea of opening up this opportunity or, in any case, to holding serious talks in this regard."
"Once again, however, we in the Commission cannot unilaterally alter these agreements."
"Subject: Fulfilment of the objectives of structural funds payments"
"At the end of June 2011, the Commission will present its proposal for the next 7-year budgetary framework (2014-2020)."
"In the case of EU regional policy, there have been substantial problems with absorption capacity under the individual programmes."
"Several programmes have also failed to achieve their objectives."
"How does the Commission intend to include the absorption capacity of each Member State as a criterion for the allocation of structural fund appropriations in the coming budgetary period?"
"Does the Commission agree that payments should be reviewed if a region has been receiving structural funding for years without this resulting in it meeting the targets set?"
"Will the Commission consider a 'sunset mechanism' that sets a closing date on the allocation of structural fund appropriations to individual recipient regions?"
"Does the Commission agree that such a mechanism would help create a more results-oriented cohesion policy?"
"The Court of Auditors Annual Report for 2009 found the highest error rate to be in payments under the EU's cohesion policy."
"This was the same finding as in previous years."
"How does the Commission intend to remedy this situation?"
"Mrs Jensen, thank you very much for your question."
"When it comes to absorption capacity and its consideration in the allocation of funds in the forthcoming period, I make reference right now to the existing rule regarding the upper limit on the allocation of funds - in a word, capping."
"There is a rule that says that, given a certain sliding scale per Member State, only a specific sum measured by the overall GDP of a Member State is available for structural policy."
"The annual allocation must not exceed this upper limit."
"For the forthcoming period, we will certainly consider whether the level of the current upper limit is justified and whether any adjustments are necessary in order to better design or secure the absorption capacity."
"When it comes to the programmes meeting their targets, I must remind you of the fifth cohesion report and the budget review, in which it was made clear that the performance of the programmes must be given more attention."
"For the forthcoming period, a set of tests and incentive systems are envisaged in this regard, which the Commission has put forward in the legislative report package for cohesion policy after 2014."
"When it comes to the error rate, I have made reference many times, including in this House, to the methodological problems involved in auditing multiannual programmes."
"Around half of the EU budget certainly is composed of resources that are allocated for multiannual activities."
"The auditing by the Court of Auditors in respect of budget implementation always only considers the year in progress, and for that reason, methodological challenges result as, in relation to regional policy, the third audit level applies, while the annual audit by the Court of Auditors already takes place under the first audit level and therefore, a higher error rate will always result here than at the end of a programme cycle, as we can prove already."
"In any event, my predecessor, Mrs Hübner, also put in place an action plan together with Parliament in this regard, the efficacy of which is already evident and which has shown its effect."
"One of these measures, however, was also giving Directorates-General the ability to suspend payments for up to six months in justified cases."
"By way of example, this tool was used over fifty times last year."
"All these suspensions of payment were able to be lifted again before their deadlines expired, as the issues about which an objection had been raised had been resolved."
"When it comes to the error rate, however, I would also ask you to always take into consideration that regional policy has, if you like, a kind of snowplough function in this connection, that, in relation to certain statutorily developed elements, we check how they are implemented in day-to-day practice, how effective they are and what problems result."
"The issue of public procurement is repeatedly the subject of discussions with the Member States, regions and final beneficiaries."
"Around 70% of the error rate occurs in this area."
"If we succeed in simplifying this system - and we have launched an initiative to this end together with Commissioner Barnier - we will also reduce the practical error rate in this area, too."
"We are attempting to do our homework in this area and to make progress in this regard."
"(DA) Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Hahn for his excellent answer, which shows that he is taking these problems seriously."
"These problems have clearly not been made any better by the economic crisis, which is making it difficult for many countries to find cofinancing."
"Is the Commission giving particular consideration to what this could mean for the next programme period?"
"Will aid from the structural funds really lead to the development of these regions?"
"Are we seeing results?"
"Is the Commission also considering what can be done to improve the follow-up of the actual objectives - the overall objectives - relating to development, so that these do not only provide projects, but also result in development?"
"Mrs Jensen, it is our stated goal in the next programme period to thematically tie in structural policy - insofar as it is affected, in any case - with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In this area, there are thus key objectives and priorities that are to be applied in the course of a tailored adaptation in the regions."
"It will then be the job of the regions to select a few priorities for themselves as if from a menu, in particular, when it comes to competitive regions."
"The regions will then set and agree very realistic but also ambitious and quantifiable targets together with us in the Commission in a partnership and investment agreement so that, at the end of the period, we will be clearly able to see whether or not the objectives agreed between us have been achieved or perhaps even exceeded."
"If it turned out that they had not been achieved, we would then have the possibility of together examining the causes of non-compliance and whether it was due to domestic or external factors."
"Building on that, we could then draw conclusions for future programme planning and the financial allocation in the subsequent period."
"This represents a very material, very qualitative development of regional policy over the forthcoming financial period."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Implementing measures (Rule 88): see Minutes"
"A new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (debate)"
"The first item is the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013, on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, we have had 23 years of financial perspectives, four distinct periods that have helped EU expenditure and income to evolve in a well-ordered way."
"The existence of the financial perspectives is what has allowed the Union's programmes to be carried out."
"This is why this debate and the vote following it are so important to the Union's finances."
"Parliament is taking the political initiative in Europe's budget for the first time."
"The Commission and the Council will have to react to this proposal and put forward their alternatives."
"Parliament has drafted a proposal that is defined by consensus and collaboration."
"It has involved one year of work, 1 100 amendments and 120 commitments, with 11 parliamentary committees and 10 national parliaments having contributed to it."
"I would like to congratulate all the officials and assistants who have worked over the past year to make this report possible."
"There has also been institutional cooperation from the College of Commissioners, headed by José Manuel Durão Barroso, with the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, Janusz Lewandowski, having provided particular support."
"We hope that the proposal they put forward on 29 June will be in line with the recommendations made in our report."
"We can no longer carry on making more Europe with a smaller budget."
"We want an end to the bad habit of accepting solemn political commitments that cannot possibly be funded."
"We have had enough experience on this issue with the Lisbon strategy, and we do not want the 2020 strategy to be another failure that only serves to increase disappointment and euroscepticism."
"That is why we are making the Europe 2020 strategy the backbone of the forthcoming financial perspective."
"We firmly believe in the efficacy of EU expenditure."
"One euro administered by the EU budget is more efficient than one euro spent individually by 27 national budgets."
"We have proved the idea of added value and we believe it can be applied to practically all EU programmes."
"We call on the European Commission to make this a reality."
"There can be no European policy without sufficient funding for the agricultural policy and the cohesion policy."
"That is why we are asking the Council to maintain the level of expenditure for these two policies beyond 2013."
"Research, development, innovation, investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, trans-European communication and energy interconnection networks, climate change and education are just some of the priorities that this EU budget must cover."
"Cutting the EU budget is not a viable option for those of us who believe in a competitive Europe."
"We consider that an increase of at least 5% is needed over the total expenditure in the current financial perspective."
"This increase is the minimum requirement for meeting the needs of the major traditional policies as well as our new priorities."
"This 5% is an exercise in political realism, and should be the basis for future interinstitutional negotiation, along with the sensible proposal put forward in this report, agreed between the groups in this Chamber, on a new system of own resources."
"This period of crisis and rescue plans may be the worst possible time for starting negotiations on the financial perspective, but for all those of us who believe in the EU budget as an instrument needed to transform 27 Member States into a true Union, the challenge is before us, and our sights must be set high enough to tackle it."
"The good and bad aspects of the report will come out in today's debate, both praise and criticism."
"I know it is impossible for this Chamber to give its unanimous support on such a sensitive issue, but I would like to thank the political groups for their generosity in seeking consensus, and the skills they have contributed over this period."
"Thanks to them, the final report is infinitely better than anything that I could have produced without their support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro and public debt crisis demand solutions at European and not national level."
"This is the message that Mr Barroso, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, has been sending the Member States for months."
"However, a European solution means European funding."
"My group seeks to adapt this funding to the new realities of Europe, both in its objectives and its terms of reference."
"My question to the Council is as follows: is Europe of the 2020s the same as Europe of the 1960s?"
"Are the state of public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and the position of Europe in the world comparable?"
"I think not."
"It is clear that Europe today is no longer in any way comparable to the Europe of the founding fathers."
"It has changed, and it would be irresponsible not to reflect these changes in the ways in which Europe is funded, in other words, in the way Europe is designed."
"(The speaker broke off, hoping to continue his speech later)"
"(NL) Mr President, given his extremely negative reactions to the position of the Dutch Government, I would like to ask my esteemed fellow Member whether he still recognises at all the democratic right of EU Member States to voice their own opinions on behalf of their citizens."
"(DE) Mr Hartong, of course I recognise this right."
"I only hope that you also recognise that the position of the Dutch Government cannot simply be handed down ex cathedra, but that it should be debated in a multinational democracy."
"I have absolute respect for Mr Rutte, who is in favour of a 2.7% increase in the EU budget."
"I have taken note of this and am pleased that you have listened attentively because the positions of all governments are debated openly in this Parliament."
"To this extent, I failed to understand the meaning of your question, but what I believe I can glean from it is that you also support democracy."
"I suppose that this represents some sort of progress."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have here the letter from the representative of Her Majesty's Government on the SURE report."
"The letter says that Her Majesty's Government is disappointed by the draft SURE report."
"Colleagues, I think that means that we have a very good draft SURE report here today!"
"I have to tell you that beyond the three or four words saying that Her Majesty's Government is disappointed by the report, the other parts of the letter are a real provocation: a provocation to Europe and the European Union, because their main point is that no increase in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is possible, and that we have to stick to the old MFF, the same figures, the same resources, naturally the same rebates, and certainly the same rebate for the UK."
"We must change nothing at all."
"Her Majesty's Government is nevertheless a government that wants to take decisions, that wants to reform not only the UK but also the European Union."
"So I do not see why we have to stick to the old MFF and simply continue with the policies of the past."
"I think that the time is now ripe to say to the public that it is not by cutting this EU budget of 1% [EU GDP] that we will solve the fiscal consolidation of the different Member States of the European Union."
"This 1% is only one-fortieth of the total expenditure within the European Union."
"There are other ways to make savings."
"Another suggestion that we can make to Her Majesty's Government is that, if it wants to make savings in the British public sector, it can do so by increasing the role of the European Union."
"Let me give you three examples."
"First of all, foreign policy."
"In the US, there are 28 000 diplomats."
"In Europe there are 93 000: there are four times more diplomats in Europe because we are not working together under a single foreign policy."
"There is a saving to be made there."
"If the British Government invested more in the European Union, they could make savings on their foreign policy, in William Hague's department."
"Another example is monetary policy."
"Around 44 000 people are responsible for monetary policy in the European Union."
"In the US, there are 18 000 in the Federal Reserve Board."
"That is three times fewer civil servants."
"If the British Government wants to make savings, it can join the euro, it can give the European Union more powers and responsibilities, and it can make savings with regard to all those people working on monetary policy in Britain."
"If it wants to make savings in Great Britain, it can do so in the research sector simply by adopting the European patent immediately."
"That would make enormous savings in its research budget."
"That is the answer that we have to give to Her Majesty's Government."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, my group would like to see European financing that reflects Europe's new realities, trends and aims."
"Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe's place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe?"
"Definitely not: they have evolved and changed."
"It would be irresponsible if we failed to adjust how Europe is financed to reflect these changes."
"The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year."
"I would like to congratulate the committee on its work."
"I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) calls on all Member States to participate fully in this debate."
"When I say fully, I mean not simply announcing that the ultimate aim is to freeze European expenditure to 2020, nor dismissing out of hand the notion of European own resources."
"We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets."
"This is why we are proposing the concept of own resources to the Heads of State or Government: to ease straitened national budgets."
"Let me remind you that the European budget has always been balanced, unlike national budgets, which, for the most part, have serious deficits."
"Let me also remind you that over 90% of that budget is spent on projects that benefit Member States."
"Lastly, let me remind the Member States that any money which is not spent will be returned to them at the end of the year."
"Yet we are accused of being poor managers: I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts."
"So please, let us stop treating the European budget as a strain on domestic finances."
"Let us be honest: one euro spent at European level brings far greater returns than a euro spent by national governments."
"Between 20 and 30 cents of one euro of national spending are immediately diverted to repay interest on the national debt."
"Europeans need to be told the truth."
"The truth is that without European funding for education and lifelong learning, the brain drain to China and the United States will gain momentum."
"The truth is that without European funding for research and innovation, our countries would be less competitive globally, while growth and employment would languish."
"The truth is that without European cohesion funding, the gap between rich and poor regions would widen."
"The truth is that without European funding, food security policy, energy policy and climate change policy would be unable to match our expectations and aims."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that without European funding for foreign and defence policies, the European Union would have remained in the wings instead of at the centre of the world stage."
"Of course, money is not the only consideration: how the European Union chooses to invest and to implement political priorities to 2020 and beyond will determine Europe's capacity for influencing the world."
"The European Parliament - and for once, the groups that have already spoken are in agreement with me - is therefore calling on the Council to give serious thought to its position on the financial framework."
"If the Council is seriously committed to seeing growth and employment pick up, then it needs to use the European budget and Community own resources as a powerful lever."
"If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe."
"Our fellow citizens share our ambition and hopes."
"As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, if I may take this opportunity, speaking on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, I want to respond to Mr Verhofstadt who, as ever, has missed the point and who, as ever, is facing in the wrong direction."
"If he had read the report, he would have seen that Her Majesty's Government said that this is a time of crisis in Europe."
"He would have noticed that economies are stagnating, jobs are being lost and industries struggling to compete in a fast-changing world."
"What Europe needed is a budget that is relevant, that is adding value and that engages with the people, but what Mr Verhofstadt and his colleagues are offering is more of the same."
"There is a saying: 'If you do not change direction, you finish up at the point you were heading for when you started out'."
"This budget needs to change direction."
"We and Her Majesty's Government agree that spending should be increased in those areas that add value."
"We agree: investment in research and development, in trans-European networks for transport, energy and telecommunications should be increased."
"We agree: education, small businesses and encouraging the Single Market is wise, sound investment and should be encouraged."
"That will help create jobs and growth."
"But we do not agree that it is acceptable for this House to take that as a reason to demand a bigger budget."
"To Mr Verhofstadt, I have to say this. All over Europe, governments are imposing austerity budgets, and this House would be exceedingly unwise if it does not take on board that message, if it chooses to ignore the letter from the five Heads of Government, because what those five Heads of Government were saying is: more Europe is not the answer; smarter Europe is."
"We need a budget which is more focused."
"In the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013, we rightly talked about priorities, but then we never acted on it."
"There was no evidence of a willingness to take tough choices, the kind of choices which are being taken by governments all over Europe at this time."
"So we accept that there should be increased expenditure on the new priorities but we also think it was time we looked again at the traditional priorities, so here again, it was another missed opportunity for the European budget."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague if he does not accept that transferring from the national to the European budget some key items of expenditure is going to produce cost efficiencies and economies of scale and save national treasuries money."
"That is the central message of Parliament's approach to reforming the financial perspective."
"It is logical and it requires a logical and rational response from London."
"Mr President, I understand Mr Duff's point and, as ever, the theory is right but the practice is not."
"Show me the evidence of where transferring that support makes for greater efficiencies through spending by the European Union."
"Show me the evidence of where it has actually saved citizens money rather than costing them more."
"I say again, this budget is evidence of a call from Mr Duff and his colleagues for more Europe, not smarter Europe."
"The United Kingdom Government is asking for better spending, not more spending."
"Mr President, it is always interesting to see that, as soon as we start talking about a forward-looking budget, the debate is only ever about 'how much exactly?'."
"This debate should actually be about three issues, three priorities which for us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, are crucial."
"Firstly, we need a vision for Europe and we need to decide what added value the European budget brings to that vision for Europe?"
"Secondly, yes, Mr Ashworth, the budget should be renewed and made greener, it should be a forward-looking budget."
"However, a forward-looking budget also means shifts in priorities and still more European money."
"The third priority concerns the EU's own resources."
"Make the system fairer and more transparent, and then we can talk about own resources."
"Let me run through these three priorities, the added value, to begin with."
"Here, too, the tone of the debate is as if the money which goes to Brussels is disappearing into a black hole."
"What nonsense, complete and utter nonsense!"
"If you start looking at what can be done at the European level, there are many reasons for spending money at the European level and specifically not at the national level."
"Take, for example, our diplomatic services, our embassies abroad."
"Do we want to have 27 of those in all kinds of countries in Africa, or do we want to have a single EU one?"
"The latter means that more money will have to go to the EU for that EU embassy, but it also means that 27 times less money is spent in the 27 Member States."
"That is dealing with money efficiently."
"Look also at infrastructure."
"If we, as countries, build infrastructure, how do we then ensure that this also works across borders, in the field of ​​energy networks?"
"There, too, you need European money."
"Or take innovation and research."
"Ensure that they are consolidated so that you see it through together, so that you have economies of scale."
"Now, that is clever investing."
"That is a vision of the added value of Europe and that is why we need a European budget."
"Secondly, the budget must be forward-looking."
"The current budget is too much 'business as usual'."
"We have the 2020 objectives for a smart economy, a sustainable economy."
"We must therefore invest in that."
"The challenge for the EU is dealing with scarcity, the scarcity of natural resources, but also of labour."
"The EU must invest in this so that we can deal with it."
"The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development must be renewed and made greener, so that agriculture can become an example of proper and efficient dealing with natural resources."
"The Structural Funds, too, must respond to new challenges, such as energy."
"Ensure that the Structural Funds contribute to the objectives we have set for 2020."
"That is the innovation we should be talking about."
"What are the new challenges?"
"Sustainable energy - that means infrastructure and we need money for that; foreign policy - the Arab Spring: what has been the European response?"
"For that, too, we need European money."
"Poverty reduction within and outside the EU, climate change, innovation, all good reasons for us to act at the EU level."
"The third priority concerns the EU's own resources."
"The current system is bankrupt."
"The rebates which the British have, and which the Dutch and the Danes want, that is a bankrupt system."
"Make it fairer, make it more transparent, or secure own resources for the EU."
"Consider a financial transaction tax."
"Then you have a fair system where the money goes to the EU and where we can achieve our own objectives."
"This is a clever policy."
"Things do have to change but they must change at the European level, surely?"
"Finally, I would like to put the following question to those Member States which are saying that less and less money should go to the EU, but which, at the same time, are giving all kinds of new priorities to the EU: if you want less money to go to the EU, what are the priorities that we as the EU should work on?"
"Because if you want the EU to receive less money, you also have to make choices."
"So far, we have heard that there are more and more priorities, with less money."
"This simply does not add up."
"Now, that is the question the British and Dutch governments should be thinking about."
"Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, you will understand that the Left has particularly high expectations in relation to the social alignment of the EU and is therefore a little disappointed that your report does not give greater priority to social aspects for the coming years."
"I am sure that the preservation and development of the European model of the social state and the European solidarity principle will be of enormous importance in times of crisis and economic cut-backs."
"Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process."
"Of course you have enumerated many important challenges, some of which go beyond the Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, I do not believe that the proposed tentative increase of 5% will be enough to meet these challenges."
"As Parliament, we should state clearly that we intend providing particular support for a social Europe."
"Other elements, such as ERD, FRONTEX and ITER may need to wait a little longer."
"I believe it is wrong to invite the Council to set negative priorities, in other words, cuts."
"At the same time, we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own-resources system."
"In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand."
"This is not just a useful financial instrument, but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the EU is financed."
"Naturally, this involves an important part of financial market regulation."
"I also believe that we need to do away with the British rebate and ensure that unused EU resources are returned to the EU budget."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, this House will, yet again, be accused of being out of touch with reality if it votes for a budget increase for the period 2014-2020."
"The reason given for this increase is the funding of the 2020 strategy, the one it is said will take us out of the crisis."
"Let us recall what happened with the Lisbon strategy; it was an epic failure."
"Taxpayers' money was wasted and we should not repeat this mistake."
"The European Court of Auditors reports a significant percentage of irregularities affecting different policy areas, averaging 2.8% of the budget year after year, and we continue to flow funds to these regions."
"Projects have seen costs grow by up to three times their original estimates; others suffer delays while being superseded by better technology."
"Such is the case with Galileo, which has gone from a EUR 7.7 billion budget to a EUR 22.6 billion budget."
"More than 40% of the budget continues to be invested in the common agricultural policy, while only 4.7% of the workforce in Europe is engaged in this."
"The common fisheries policy - deemed a failure by Commissioner Damanaki - requires taxpayers to send EUR 1 billion to Brussels every year."
"The European External Action Service costs an extra 500 million each year and has not yet demonstrated its raison d'être."
"All these examples should certainly justify not a budget increase but a budget reduction."
"I would like to think that the UK Government will take a stand, will say enough is enough, and call for a reduction."
"However it seems its coalition MEPs here favour a freeze."
"Taxpayers in the UK will not be thanking them."
"(NL) Mr President, on the eve of World War I, the British Minister, Sir Edward Grey, spoke these words: ' The lamps are going out all over Europe."
"We shall not see them lit again in our time'. We have before us the Polledo report on the political priorities of the European Parliament for the post-2013 period."
"This concerns both the legislation and the budget."
"This is therefore the vision of the EU on the future of European citizens."
"What terrible intellectual, cultural and political poverty pervades this report!"
"What a tendency towards dictatorship by the European political elite."
"This Parliament claims that the EU is adding more value at international level than the sum of individual Member States."
"You are therefore demanding a minimum 5% increase in the EU budget."
"How ridiculous!"
"What a denial of national sovereignty and what contempt for the citizens and governments of our countries."
"Let me make it clear: a right-thinking Member State such as the Netherlands will never be able to agree with this report."
"MEPs with a fresh, freedom-loving vision should throw this report straight in the bin."
"Why?"
"Because, otherwise, the lamps will go out in Europe and we will be paving the way for a dark future for our children."
"My group want the lamps to stay on in Europe and, therefore, we will vote wholeheartedly against the report."
"Colleagues, as you see, we are witnessing a fundamental discussion on the future of Europe and we are waiting for the standpoint of the Commission."
"There is a blue card."
"Mr Hartong, are you ready to answer?"
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to ask my fellow Member Hartong the following question."
"At present, several EU Member States are members of the G8, the organisation of the eight largest economies in the world."
"In the next 10 to 15 years though, not a single European country will be represented there any more."
"How can you then insist that individual European countries continue to play a significant role on the world stage?"
"Do you not think that the only way Europe can really continue to play a role there is to act together?"
"(NL) Mr President, I thank my fellow Member for the question."
"Europe is so wonderful and so powerful because of its Member States, and so by working together, in close consultation, the Member States are able to speak with a strong voice on the global political stage."
"That will continue to be the case."
"Precisely because national governments are working well together, their voices will raise a wonderful chorus."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome on behalf of the Commission the report submitted by the SURE Committee."
"This is a real contribution to the preparations for the next financial perspective, but it is also truly European."
"It is a genuine European perspective on the future of the European project."
"This is desperately needed now when we face numerous common challenges demanding common answers in the era named by Mr Schulz as that of a spirit of 'Entsolidarisierung' ('dismantling of solidarity')."
"My comment relates not only to the report itself, but also to the proceedings in the SURE Committee - in which I participated, so I know what I am talking about - to the skilful management by Jutta Haug and the role of Salvador Garriga Polledo."
"That is the broad consensus and majority vote which will probably and hopefully be confirmed today in the plenary."
"Yes, we share the vision which is contained in the report."
"Yes, we also say that the European budget is not about the duplication of national budgets, but about delivering common goals beyond the capacity of nation states where European funds can realise economies of scale or create synergies."
"In short, the European budget should be used where it makes a difference, as it has the nature of an investment and has no deficit."
"We also share a vision of the so-called 'traditional' policies - namely, the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy."
"Traditional does not mean outdated, but as a mechanism for delivering the goals of the 2020 strategy."
"When properly shaped in the budget, they could create room for much better and visibly better financing of what was under-financed - i.e. innovation, the management of migration flows, the external responsibilities of the European Union that are now so visible in the Mediterranean area, energy efficiency and, above all, how to connect Europe via the trans-European networks and the other cross-border connectors in energy systems."
"The European budget should assume new functions as a toolbox for disciplining the Member States' public finances, but it cannot be blamed for mismanagement of public finances at national level."
"It should act as collateral now for the balance of payments facility, but also in the future for the greater use of innovative financial instruments leveraging European budgets."
"The report is asking for a reform of the financing side and we are to respond by indicating new resources."
"As Mr Daul rightly said, that is how to make the life of a Finance Minister easier - by indicating new own resources for the budget and reducing the direct contribution."
"Therefore, the package to be presented at the end of June is about figures, the Multiannual Framework Regulation, a new proposal for an interinstitutional agreement, but also about own resources."
"Specific sectoral proposals should come later, between September and the end of the year."
"Let me end by repeating once more my conviction that the SURE Committee report is a good input into the discussion about the future of the European Union, and a strong, important point of reference for the Commission."
"Cooperation between the Commission and Parliament is essential, not only for a good start in shaping the proposal, but also for a happy end to the negotiations which are extremely difficult in the present context."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That was a very important discussion between the Commission and Parliament."
"The two institutions would like to back each other, to have a similar approach to the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"We will see the European Commission project at the end of this month, when it will be also be presented in Parliament."
"(In response to a voice from the floor:)"
"I am sorry but we do not put blue-card questions to our guests, they are put only to Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, for the Committee on Development, this is not just a clear report, but a vital one as well, because it establishes that the European Union will be shouldering its responsibility for the poorest countries during the next seven years and that it will therefore make appropriations to this end in the budget."
"It establishes that Member States must honour their own commitments."
"However, Member States still have a long way to go to commit 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to development cooperation."
"If the European Union works together on development cooperation, it will result in savings, elimination of overlaps and ensure better and more efficient spending."
"The report stipulates that action on climate change cannot be funded from the development budget."
"It calls for greater priority to be given to the strengthening of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"It calls for new methods of funding besides just subsidies, for example, combinations of loans and subsidies."
"It emphasises that humanitarian action should continue to have its own independent financial instrument because emergency aid must be neutral and free of the political choices of the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"With these choices, the European Union remains the most important partner for developing countries in the world and that is vital."
"Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety can also express its satisfaction with the report in the form in which it has been tabled before us."
"It takes account of the scarcity of raw materials, the threat to biodiversity, the move towards sustainable energy and, in particular - and I find this key - the importance of sustainability for our economy."
"There is one but, however: we live in a time when all Member States are turning over every euro at least three times before spending it."
"Yet, we are doing something really peculiar."
"We are spending billions in subsidies, such as environmentally harmful subsidies, on things which we subsequently have to spend many more billions to put right."
"On behalf of my group, I have therefore retabled the amendment which was adopted by the Environment Committee, namely, to run down subsidies which have a harmful effect on the environment in the period up to 2020."
"Especially in these times of scarcity, we cannot afford to have that kind of subsidy."
"Mr President, cohesion policy accounts for one of the largest individual budgets in the European Union."
"We need to develop a new policy that is adapted to the new challenges."
"We want investment in a modern infrastructure, in research, innovation and the development of new technologies."
"We want sustainable, integrated urban development and we want a well-educated workforce."
"The regions need specific subsidies to help them to become competitive and to develop economically."
"However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany."
"Eastern Germany requires support."
"However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom."
"This requires a budget that should be no smaller than the current one and that cannot be split into different sectors."
"We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy."
"Cohesion is linked with solidarity."
"However, cohesion is also sensible from an economic point of view and necessary."
"A lack of cohesion is bad news, even for strong national economies."
"For this reason, we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in his report and I would ask for support for the amendment for once again improving the intermediate categories."
"We have reached a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development and I would recommend that this House should incorporate the compromise found by the specialist politicians in the Garriga Report."
"I would ask for your broad support."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to pay tribute to Mr Garriga Polledo, including on behalf of the majority of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), for his excellent work over recent months."
"The debate on future financial perspectives was very heated and the report put together by Mr Garriga Polledo offers an effective summary that encompasses the positions taken by the different national delegations and the various political groups."
"In my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I express my full support for the decision to at least leave the agriculture budget unchanged and I - like many of my colleagues in the AGRI committee - am strongly opposed to the amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) which would accept possible future cuts in agriculture resources in order to fund other activities."
"I feel compelled to remind my fellow Members that the common agricultural policy is enshrined by the Treaties and is one of the few real European policies; it can play an important role in a strategic sector that provides public goods and generates true European added value."
"Mr President, whenever we talk about the European Union budget and European funds, especially about the future Multiannual Financial Framework, we automatically talk about European added value."
"I do not think that there is an area or segment in the European Union budget where European added value is bigger, with so little money."
"However, to ensure that everything we think in this Chamber and all the European projects have a connection to Europe's population and each European citizen, and that all these projects have a future, the youth of today must believe in the European Union project, they must feel increasingly European and we must significantly increase our investments in culture, education and in youth projects and programmes."
"This is why I say that for the European Union to have a future, we need more money for education, for culture and for young people."
"Not to mention sport, which is a priority on the Europe 2020 agenda."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to point out that when the crucial decisions are taken with regard to the economy and financial and monetary affairs, fiscal matters and trade policy, all decisions that affect the budget and our opportunities, the amount of influence that women have on these decisions is currently very small."
"In order to produce a modern budget for the future, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has highlighted some important issues for future work on the budget."
"The skills and experience of women must be utilised."
"We would point out the need for the integration of equality - for equality to be taken into account in the budget."
"I hear my fellow Members talk about the future budget and increased resources and so on. It is not just a question of increased resources, but also of having the political courage to reprioritise aspects in the budget and utilise the skills that women have."
"If we do that, we will not always need to call for more and more budgetary resources, but will be able to use the budget to produce modern policies for the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a proper, reasonable offer by Parliament to the Commission and Council for the further development of the budgetary basis of the European Union in difficult times."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, and the committee chair, Mrs Haug, for their work."
"You have both done an excellent job."
"Despite all the political differences between the various groups, our work was characterised by a struggle to find joint European solutions."
"Other institutions could have a little more of this spirit."
"We want to have genuine own resources, as described in the Treaty."
"Irrespective of other income, the budget is to be financed solely from own resources."
"In other words, we are being faithful to the Treaty when we demand this."
"By the way, let us bring an end to all of these extraordinary targeted rebates."
"This debate should be conducted jointly with our colleagues in the national parliaments without prejudice and with less foaming at the mouth than is evident in some capital cities and commentaries."
"At the same time, we want to know that the unity of the budget is protected and that budgetary policy is not to be taken away from the community budget."
"When we discuss expenditure, we must refer to the obligations that result from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must provide sufficient finance for the EU 2020 strategy to which we have all committed ourselves."
"Growth is the basis for economic and social activity."
"We must discuss European added value and the necessary synergies between the national budgets and the EU budget in greater detail than before because, irrespective of the potential savings to be achieved in the EU budget, a lot of the additional resources required can be discussed in the context of a genuine debate on synergy and potential savings between the EU budget and the national budgets."
"We must tell the Council clearly that if it refuses to take the path indicated by us today, it needs to indicate which political priorities are to be struck off the agenda and no longer financed."
"This is required if we are to be honest with our citizens."
"I hope that the Commission will respond positively to these suggestions from Parliament in its legislative proposals and I expect that the future presidencies will find a way to communicate openly and transparently with Parliament, so that we can complete the assent procedures in the appropriate timeframe."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, as far as I know, Mr Böge is a member of the CDU in Germany."
"I wonder whether his plea for own resources of the EU reflects his own personal position or the position of his party in Germany?"
"(DE) Mr President, I am happy to deal with this question."
"The fact is that I am not just a member of the Christian Democratic Union, but have also been Vice-Chair of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein for 13 years."
"Before this committee expressed its view, the CDU/CSU Members of the European Parliament agreed a position."
"The statement on own resources agreed by the CDU/CSU Members of the European Parliament, which, to a certain extent, contradicts the party's national position, is completely at one with the findings of the Policy Changes Committee."
"I stand by this, also in my capacity as a CDU politician in Germany."
"Mr President, the EU is currently facing the biggest challenges that it has faced in a very long time."
"We must try to put an end to the economic crisis and, at the same time, avoid new crises."
"We need to deal with increased globalisation and competition."
"Major cross-border investments in research, for example, will be needed."
"We need to get to grips with the challenges posed by the environment and the climate and with the sustainable supply of energy."
"We need to reverse the devastating trend towards permanently high unemployment and social exclusion that Europe is experiencing, and, in particular, we must try to help with regard to the crisis affecting our southern neighbours."
"Unfortunately, in a situation where we most need solidarity and well-functioning European cooperation, the threats to the European idea are also growing."
"Right now, these are directed at the EU budget, among other things."
"In the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013, we understand that it can seem strange that, at a time when many Member States are making cuts in their own budgets, we are demanding more money for the EU budget post 2013."
"However, at the same time, it would be completely unreasonable to ignore these challenges, to give in to euroscepticism and give up the political ambitions that the Member States have given us in the Treaty of Lisbon, for example."
"We must also remember that large cuts will not benefit the most vulnerable Member States, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, but, on the contrary, will reduce the EU's ability to support them."
"The UK Government is only speaking on behalf of the net contributors and no one else."
"Therefore, in the report by the Policy Challenges Committee, we have tried to find a reasonable balance between restraint, the ambitions that are needed and a future-oriented reform of policy areas such as agricultural policy."
"We arrived at a proposal of a 5% increase in appropriations for the next period compared with 2013."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Garriga Polledo, who succeeded in securing a broad majority in support of his report."
"The point is that this extra 5% is to be used precisely for investments within the key areas that are focused on the future, in particular, research, growth and employment."
"It is clear that there is a need for action in these areas, and without resources, we will not be able to meet these challenges."
"To do this, however, we also need to be able to change our view of the EU budget."
"Remember that this EU budget is still lower in relation to the Member States' economies than it was when Sweden joined in the 1990s, for example, despite enlargement from 15 to 27 Member States."
"The increase in the EU budget has also been significantly slower than the increase in the Member States' national budgets, the UK budget for example, which is something else that is not mentioned when Her Majesty's Government speaks."
"I, personally, am absolutely convinced that austerity measures are not the only way out of this crisis."
"We must find a way back to growth and jobs by finding resources for investments, and for that we need these joint actions."
"Mr President, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in collating the views of this House."
"I am sure that we are all in complete agreement as to the challenges that we face."
"The question is simply how we will get the funds to stretch, and now we are not only talking about funds in the EU, but also funds in the Member States, and that is a balancing act."
"In committee, we decided to recommend increasing the future budget by 5%."
"Five percent sounds like a lot, at least it does if we go home to our own capital cities and explain that we need another 5%."
"On the other hand, 5% is very little when we consider the challenges that the EU is facing, and when we know only too well that the EU has actually been given a number of new tasks that it really ought to take care of properly, and we cannot do that without funds."
"However, in order, at the same time, to be credible when asking for more money, we must also have the courage to look at existing structures and existing costs."
"Our credibility will then increase significantly if we manage to show that we can also reallocate/reprioritise and save money before we ask for more."
"Now, I am talking about unjustified advantages within agricultural policy as well as the fact that our anti-corruption policy is, to a large degree, not as successful as we always claim it is, and the fact that, to a certain extent, the EU's administration is rather unwieldy - the very fact that we are here in Strasbourg is an example of this."
"These are the sorts of things that our group wanted to raise as examples that could be discussed, for this is what will bring us credibility when we later ask for more money."
"However, we have not always been entirely successful in doing this in this report, which also explains why some of my fellow Members will be pressing the 'no' button, or perhaps the 'abstain' button, in tomorrow's vote, even though a large majority of our group supports the report."
"Many people are, after all, disappointed that we are not able to discuss a new way of allocating existing funds as well."
"Another issue that we absolutely must address is how we are to finance the EU budget, and in this regard, our group has been very clear."
"We want a serious debate about what is referred to as own resources, and this is also important in order for us to eliminate the unhealthy elements in the current financing structure: more rebates, unclear and non-transparent arrangements and so on."
"This is an absolutely crucial issue if the EU budget is to have a positive future."
"Mr President, the Polish delegation in the European Conservatives and Reformists will vote in favour of adopting the report on the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"However, this does not mean that we have not noticed the document's weak points."
"It is a sheer waste of time to expand upon proposals for own resources and European taxes."
"Europeans already pay too much in government levies."
"We need to place greater emphasis on monitoring of EU expenditure and on a critical assessment of current policies in this field."
"Turning a blind eye to the money wasted will not solve the problem, and it is also unfair to European taxpayers."
"The predominance of the Europe 2020 agenda may mean that EU policies are reformed at the expense of much more important obligations - those enshrined in the Treaties, which refer to the promotion of economic cohesion between Member States."
"Yet European added value, which is linked to European cohesion policy, must not be ignored."
"Its effects can be seen more clearly in Poland than anywhere else."
"We are not the only ones to benefit from accelerated growth thanks to cohesion policy."
"Accelerated growth in Central Europe also makes a significant contribution to growth throughout Europe and improves investment conditions, yielding profits not only in Warsaw and Prague, but also in Amsterdam, London and Berlin."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with the statement by Mr Ashworth, which played off a smarter European budget against a higher budget."
"I do not consider this to be a true alternative."
"Indeed, we must pursue a smarter budgetary policy by identifying precisely where money can be saved, where management can be improved and where the administration is particularly constraining."
"However, the task of this special committee was to find out how much money we need in order to be able to deal appropriately with the new political challenges faced."
"Thus, what we need is openness to reform and political courage."
"We need to organise ourselves in such a way that we can respond to the major challenges posed by 2020."
"I do not believe that this can be achieved from your position, Mr Ashworth; instead, I would back Mr Böge, who I believe is correct and faithful to the Treaty when he says that we need to have the courage to return to a system that involves what are genuinely our own resources."
"This will make the European Union stronger and our financing system more transparent."
"This will make it clearer to our citizens where the money is to come from."
"From the perspective of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I would like to add that we are mainly thinking of the financial transaction tax because it will regulate financial transactions and give us the opportunity to establish smarter policies."
"Thus, this is one way ahead that will not strangle the Member States, instead opening up new alternatives for us all."
"That is why I believe Mr Verhofstadt is right when he says that we must, of course, be prepared to take up joint initiatives such as the establishment of the European External Action Service, while at the same time making savings at national level."
"Naturally, we cannot just drop one element and add another."
"European responsibility means paring back national expenditure in order to pool resources at European level."
"Why is that?"
"It is because together we are stronger and because we can obtain European value added that is good for our citizens, particularly in the areas of research policy and education policy."
"The major tasks ahead of us are ecological transformation and the establishment of intelligent energy networks."
"We need money for this and for broadband networks in rural areas."
"These are the tasks for the future and this requires a smarter and bigger budget."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(NL) Mr President, Mrs Trüpel is again sounding her familiar credo: 'We must have more Europe, more Europe will do us good and more Europe means more money'."
"We already know the percentage by which she and Mr Verhofstadt would like to see the MMF increase. It is too bad then that we are seeing our citizens moving in completely the opposite direction."
"The confidence in Europe is diminishing."
"Our citizens see this House as a money-devouring machine asking for more and more money."
"Is it not time that you rethought your credo and came up with a different tune for a change, one which is in line with what Mr Ashworth is advocating?"
"(DE) Mr van Dalen, I believe that you are making a serious political error."
"If we in Europe fall back into a pattern of following political national self-interest, then we risk destroying 50 years of work on the European project."
"What we do here is not a waste of money."
"We must take decisive action against any corruption and financial scandals as they arise."
"Naturally, we are on your side on this issue."
"However, when it comes to generating European added value, as we have done in many areas, we need to work together to develop this because, when they go it alone, the national states are weaker in the face of international competition."
"You will not achieve good results with 27 national states acting unilaterally, but only by pooling forces."
"This was recognised by the founding states after the Second World War."
"We should work on developing this, not destroying it."
"Mr President, having been listening to this debate, the speech I am about to make goes against the grain."
"My first question is this: can a single currency be sustained without a strong European budget?"
"The answer, in my opinion, is no it cannot."
"The sovereign debt crisis proves exactly that."
"It proves that if we had a strong budget, there would not have been a speculative attack on the sovereign debts of Greece or Portugal."
"This is exactly what we must respond to, and I believe that this is the main problem to which Mr Garriga's report fails to respond."
"This report lacks ambition."
"The possibility of a marginal 5% increase in European budgets only seems a lot to Her Majesty, the Queen of England."
"In fact, the real problem is that it is not possible to establish priorities for growth and job creation with a European budget that is essentially frozen."
"It is not possible to respond to the new obligations resulting from the Treaties with a budget that is essentially frozen."
"It is not possible to think that cohesion policy is succeeding, because it is not succeeding when Europe is regressing towards social divergence internally."
"My final observation is that we will vote for the financial transaction tax but we believe it will only see the light of day if Europe has the courage to implement it independently of others."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, much has been said and I would like to add a different note to this meeting."
"Years ago, I was having dinner with the late President Gerald Ford in the United States and he was describing to me how the G7 came about."
"He said he wanted to have a meeting with Callaghan - I think it was - the British Prime Minister, on some issues and Callaghan said why not combine this with a good game of golf?"
"So Ford said, well, the Canadian Prime Minister, Trudeau, is a good player, we should invite him, and then Trudeau - welcoming the invitation - said he had some issues to solve with the French, so why not invite the French Prime Minister."
"But then when they all discussed it over the phone, they said the Germans are going to be very suspicious, so we need to invite them to this meeting."
"And when the Germans accepted, they then said that Italy was chairing the European Union for these six months, so they had to be there."
"Ford then said to me: you know, Niki, this was the first time I realised you have a Union that is so split, divided and unbalanced."
"One day, you should have a European budget that is strong enough to compete out there in the global world; the guys are going to be very tough out there."
"Be careful."
"Mr President, I am very pleased as an MEP that I am living at this moment."
"(DE) Mr President, the Committee on Budgets has been working intensively on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for some time now and the report from my fellow Member is an important contribution to this."
"Never before have the people of Europe had such high expectations of the EU, while, at the same time, criticising it harshly."
"Three points seem to be important: firstly, above all, the link to the citizens of Europe."
"It is completely understandable that our citizens should lose their personal orientation against the background of the impact of the structural crisis and the ever-increasing demands of globalisation, inevitably leading them to question the European project as a whole."
"This is a subject that must be considered carefully when drawing up the next MFF in order to ensure that Europe is better understood, accepted, practised and supported."
"Secondly: this acceptance among citizens and at a political level in the Member States will be all the greater if the EU budget can generate tangible added benefits for Europe."
"It will therefore be regarded as being of value to European unity."
"Thirdly: in addition, we welcome the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy is to be the reference point for the forthcoming MFF, which also entails consideration of the timeframe."
"(PL) Mr President, anyone not in the know might come to the conclusion that the European Parliament is behaving irresponsibly by proposing a budgetary increase."
"I would like to state quite clearly that the work of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 has, above all, been very matter-of-fact and business-like, and extremely realistic."
"It has been dominated by discussions on how much political decisions will cost."
"We must remember that the Member States, including those which have published letters, agreed to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Our committee has attempted to give some indication of how much joint political decisions will cost."
"We take political decisions extremely seriously."
"If the Member States decide to take certain measures, and we, as representatives of the citizens, are of the same opinion, we must have realistic funds."
"In this context, the report which will be put to the vote is well thought out and based on compromise."
"It is a realistic report and, most importantly, it is a report which forms a very good basis for the opening of talks."
"I think that today, in this Chamber, we can say that the European Parliament is ready to open negotiations."
"As an MEP from Poland, I would also like to express my strong belief that the Polish Presidency of the European Council will be one which engages in a serious and extremely realistic debate."
"Since Poland and the Polish Government are pro-European, I believe that this debate, while certainly difficult, will also be extremely beneficial in terms of future measures."
"What matters most is that negotiations are opened, and Parliament is ready for this."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, the plenary agreed and mandated a special committee to draft the position of the European Parliament in relation to the next financial perspective."
"Now, following exactly eleven months of work, the Policy Changes Committee is presenting the fruits of its labours."
"This was a task that required discipline and concentration and that could only be achieved by adopting an approach characterised by openness, solidarity and mutual trust."
"For that, let me express my sincerest gratitude to those Members involved in the creative process."
"The report we have produced, drawn up under the leadership of Mr Garriga Polledo, is a genuinely good result."
"It is something of which we can be proud."
"However, as we all know, good results require not just hard-working Members, but also excellent staff."
"We certainly had this, not just in the shape of our personal assistants and our group staff, but also, above all, in an excellent secretariat."
"This super team, led by Monika Strasser, was not just competent and professional, but was also more than usually interested in its work."
"It was patient and creative, extremely well organised, and, at the same time, spontaneous and flexible."
"Best of all, it was always cheerful and open."
"They obviously enjoyed all the hard work."
"I would like to thank this nine-strong team from the bottom of my heart."
"Thank you very much indeed."
"(Applause)"
"From the outset, Mr Garriga Polledo and I wanted to deliver a report that could be supported by three quarters of Parliament."
"We actually received a majority of more than four fifths in the vote in committee."
"We were very pleased with this. Our call for a seven-year financial perspective which is expressed in a structure that reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, while, at the same time, respecting all the policies for the European Union and avoiding increasing the European budget to unrealistic levels, must be seen to be reasonable."
"It is realistic and achievable."
"Our report contains 174 paragraphs, all of them arguments for more Europe."
"We genuinely need more Europe."
"Please read the report."
"It offers the best basis for convincing our citizens in local debate and for entering into serious negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately notable by its absence today."
"Thank you for your excellent work."
"(DA) Mr President, I, too, believe that this is a very well-balanced report with a clear, but also very flexible mandate for the Committee on Budgets, which is to negotiate an agreement with the Council, and I would reiterate Mrs Haug's call for it to be read - and for it also to be read by those Heads of State or Government and finance ministers who were quick to express their negativity with regard to the result."
"This has been a sound and sensible process, as has already been said, and I would like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Haug for their excellent work."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for its very active role."
"This work has actually enabled us to go through all parts of the EU budget and the various policy areas that we would like to see reflected in the budget."
"This is therefore a solid achievement."
"Is the result sufficiently ambitious?"
"I believe it is."
"We are strengthening the Europe 2020 strategy, which is intended to equip the EU to face the challenges posed by competition from China and other rapidly emerging economies and bring about our switch to more renewable energy."
"I would have liked to have seen stronger wording with regard to the common agricultural policy, and I would also have liked us to have investigated the possibility of making savings in the Structural Funds."
"After all, this is money that the Member States receive back and would very much like to have."
"I therefore also think that it is necessary for us to have this possibility of a 5% rise, so that there is the opportunity for new policy areas and for meeting new demands, as well as for investing in transport, energy and research - areas that the EU must invest in in future."
"We have a grip on the EU budget."
"The report that we are debating and adopting today concerns a ceiling for the EU budget."
"We are not talking about the specific funds that are paid out, but rather a ceiling, and below this ceiling there must be scope for us to be able to deal with new challenges."
"We do not know what will happen between now and 2020, and I therefore support this report."
"(CS) Mr President, over the last few months, we have been busy preparing the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014 to 2020."
"We are acting in this just like the puppy and the kitten in the fairy tale by the famous Czech writer, Karel Čapek."
"They decide to make a cake, and in order to make it really tasty, they throw everything that they like into the pot."
"The result is a cake that gives them belly ache."
"I am afraid the same will happen with our budget framework."
"We are also throwing lots of ingredients and fine-sounding commitments and recommendations into the pot, but we are not at all sure that they will go well together."
"We are well aware of how badly the Lisbon strategy turned out."
"We now have the 2020 strategy and we are trying to make a budgetary framework for it."
"There is a problem both with the set objectives and with the instruments recommended by the report."
"In my opinion, the fight against climate change represents the worst of the set objectives, and in the case of instruments, I see a major problem in the so-called own resources and the option of issuing bonds."
"In reality, own resources mean a new European tax, which I do not want."
"Eurobonds are a way for the EU to get into debt along with the Member States, which I do not want."
"For these reasons, I cannot back the report."
"Welcome"
"I have just received information that the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Muhammad Shaaban, is in the official gallery."
"I should like to welcome the representative of the United Nations."
"A new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (continuation of debate)"
"We now continue with the debate on the report by Salvador Garriga Polledo on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe."
"(FR) Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, and I thank him and congratulate him on his work, is an ambitious summary that looks to the future."
"Indeed, his report calls for greater resources so that the Union can better implement its objectives as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It forcefully raises the question of own resources and therefore, indeed, the issue of whether our institution enjoys freedom in its fundamental political act, that of voting on its budget."
"It proposes extending and expanding common policies, in particular, cohesion policy which has made a major contribution in the past to making the European Union a model of cooperation and understanding between peoples, and may continue to do so in the future."
"With the future Multiannual Financial Framework, if we listen to the European Parliament, cohesion policy will be able to move into a new phase thanks to the creation of intermediate regions."
"Thus, we propose a new package for this fund which strengthens equal opportunities between all our European territories, regardless of their past in economic terms, regardless of their handicaps when compared with more developed regions and regardless of how vulnerable they may be to the economic crisis that we are experiencing at present or any crisis that we may have to face in the future."
"Cohesion among the different territories of the European Union is a key, strategic objective on which the very future of Europe depends."
"The proposals that have been made are a step in the right direction, and if they are acted upon, lay sound foundations for the future."
"Mr President, the vote on the report by Mr Garriga will be a simple choice: choosing a Europe that is moving forward, a vote by people who, leaving aside their political affiliations, believe in the future of Europe."
"(PT) Mr President, at this time of serious economic crisis in the euro area, resulting from neoliberal policies, and from a lack of solidarity and economic and social cohesion, it is unacceptable that a break with and change in the policies of the European Union and its financial resources is not being advocated."
"When experiencing an economic and social crisis, one of the most significant challenges we face is finding a new Multiannual Financial Framework in which the Union budget for economic and social cohesion is significantly increased, whilst obligatory national contributions are reduced to, at most, 10% of the project on the table, particularly for the countries with the greatest financial difficulties; a framework in which there is a commitment to investment, to public services, to support for production, to the creation of jobs with rights, and to the eradication of poverty, social inequalities and all types of discrimination, particularly on the basis of gender."
"There is also a need to promote peace, cooperation and development aid, and to significantly cut spending on the military and overseas representation."
"For all these reasons, we consider this report a long way from what is needed for a better, fairer future for Europe and its citizens."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I take the chair for this sitting, all of you will understand if I express to you my sorrow and consternation at the death of Jorge Semprún, which took place a few hours ago, at the age of 87."
"In Jorge Semprún, we celebrate someone who was imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration and extermination camp, someone who fought Nazi forces in France and the Franco dictatorship in my country, Spain."
"We also celebrate the outstanding, politically-committed writer, who collaborated, in particular, on our European Book Prize programme, and the reassured pro-European politician."
"I mourn his death as both a colleague and a friend of his and I am going to ask President Buzek to send his family and the Spanish Government a message of heartfelt condolence and support, which I am sure that all of us here share."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, there is no doubt that we are facing one of the most critical moments in the economic history of the European Union."
"For this very reason, the committee that we have managed to establish during the course of this year certainly has a fundamental role."
"We have no preconceived ideas against increasing the budget, although we think we do need to investigate where cuts can be made."
"It is clear that we need to cut the European budget because, unfortunately, sometimes European funds are not used properly."
"Indeed, perhaps it is precisely because of the way that these funds are used that many European citizens are no longer so convinced that the European Union is worthwhile."
"To cite an example, we would call your attention to the various funds channelled towards the enlargement policy - sometimes we do not know where they end up."
"What is there to say about the incalculable amounts spent on integration and which have achieved so little?"
"There are also some virtuous regions that do not access the funds, which are then granted to other regions that either fail to use them, or use them poorly or for not entirely legitimate ends."
"We would ask for maximum focus on this whole issue and for steps to be taken so that Europe can recover its credibility, including through rigorous measures."
"(NL) Mr President, obviously, I will have to confine myself to a couple of essential comments."
"First of all, despite its bulk, I cannot find anywhere in this report a single serious attempt to make proposals for structural savings, for example, the abolition of what, in my view, are totally superfluous European institutions, such as the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and a good few European agencies of all kinds."
"Nor, indeed, has any attempt whatsoever been made to ask the question of whether Europe would not be wiser to confine itself to a number of carefully defined core tasks."
"On the contrary."
"Secondly, I absolutely shudder at the repeated suggestions that the EU should impose its own taxes or that it should issue European government bonds, which will sooner or later have to be paid back by somebody."
"The suggestion in this report that measures of this kind would not increase the total tax burden on the citizens is a lie, of course, and a deception of the worst sort."
"Besides, this would further undermine the last vestige of supervision and control that the Member States are exercising on the European institutions' spending diarrhoea."
"Those are the basic reasons why I cannot possibly support this report."
"(RO) Mr President, the current challenges which the European Union is faced with require a firm, sustained EU-level response."
"The response to these challenges is the 2020 strategy, an instrument created to bring recovery and strength to Europe."
"The report presented today places the 2020 strategy at the heart of the next MFF being drafted, together with the new situation created by the areas of competence and policies stipulated by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"At a time when many Member States are faced with difficult fiscal adjustments, the EU budget, 95% of which is used for investment, must provide a very high level of European added value."
"The report calls for the continuation of two extremely important European policies - the common agricultural and cohesion policies - at least at their current level."
"The allocation of resources under these policies must be based on new criteria which will ensure the proper use of resources to achieve maximum efficiency and compliance with convergence and cohesion criteria."
"The transport and energy policies must be enhanced."
"Allocation of funding to research and development, at both European and national level, must ensure the progress of all European policies."
"The seven-year period, the new structure proposed and greater flexibility provide additional security in implementing and adapting to changing priorities."
"For the sake of stability, the EU budget's system of resources needs to be rethought so as to replace current national contributions with European resources."
"The European Council recently adopted ambitious targets for the EU's development."
"This same Council must accept that the 5% budget increase being proposed by the report is the minimum condition for achieving these targets."
"The forthcoming MFF must be implemented with an economic governance system in place which can ensure the financial stability required to implement European policies."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Salvador Garriga."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to start my speech by praising the work of the rapporteur and all the members of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE Committee)."
"Above all, I must praise their determination over the past year of work to achieve a majority agreement and majority support in Parliament for a report such as the one we are presenting today."
"This report is the road map that the European Union must follow if we want to meet the political, economic and social objectives we have set ourselves, and also if we want to overcome the challenges we are going to face in the coming years."
"This is the script we must follow in order to emerge from the crisis, and to ensure that our growth is intelligent, sustainable and integrated, as set forth in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and innovation, if we want to carry on fighting climate change and investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable development and solidarity between our countries, and if we still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport networks - in short, if we still want more Europe - then we must call for a bigger budget for the European Union."
"That is why we warn in this report that without sufficient resources, we will not be able to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves."
"We know that some members of the Council do not agree with increasing the budget - we have seen as much here."
"They were not in favour in economic boom times either."
"Now they say it is because of the crisis, but they wanted cuts when the current financial perspective was negotiated too."
"That is why we are asking the Council, if it does not agree with this budget increase, to tell us which objectives it does not want to be met."
"In this report, we do not only set out the policies we want to achieve."
"We also show how to finance them and we put forward a discussion on own resources."
"This discussion, designed to bring to an end the false debate of the net contributors, seeks funding without hand outs, funding without exceptions, funding that is fair."
"We have put forward various options for doing this, but I have a preference for one of them, and Commissioner Lewandowski knows very well which one it is: it is the tax on financial transactions or, as it is known in many of our countries, the Robin Hood tax."
"This tax would make it possible to raise between EUR 200 billion and EUR 300 billion."
"It is a tax that penalises speculators and would force all those who have profited by gambling with our money to pay up."
"It is a tax that would increase transparency and reduce financial speculation and, above all, a tax that would not affect citizens, because it would force those directly responsible for the crisis to pay for their excesses."
"We are really only asking you for one thing: to set your sights higher."
"We ask you to set your sights higher to ensure that the European project continues on track and does not become stalled, because that would cost us our future."
"(DE) Mr President, I was born into the European Union in 1975 and it has shaped my political life ever since."
"That is why it pains me all the more to have to pour cold water on this matter."
"When there is talk of increases, then discussions must lead to a consideration of the correct use of resources."
"Although the report is ambitious in seeking to find the greatest possible majority support from the House, I believe it lacks ambition in the objectives and aims it seeks to achieve in its current form."
"The agricultural and structural budgets are left untouched."
"However, more money is being sought for research and development."
"The only response that occurs to the House and to the report is more money, although there is no clear indication where this money is to come from."
"We hear talk of the Union's 'own resources', but there has been no definition of what these resources actually are."
"If people were serious about wanting structural reforms, they could have taken up the suggestion made by David Cameron, for example, of going to the Council and saying: funding is to be frozen, but we demand that unused resources should be able to be carried over to the next financial year, so that we can continue to spend them on viable projects and to save money."
"The future viability of the EU should not be measured in terms of decimal places."
"To this extent, I am more than a little disappointed by the present report."
"Mr President, this morning, Mr Daul came running to speak here in the plenary on the need for a bigger EU budget, but he was running so fast that he was running out of breath and had to stop speaking."
"This reflects very well the debate on the multiannual budget."
"The EU budget is fixed at about 1% of EU GDP; the Commission and Parliament say, 'that is not enough, we want more money'."
"Yet the EU is unable to spend the money available; billions of euro in regional cohesion funds remain unspent."
"Some money has to be returned to Member States."
"So why do you need more money if you cannot spend the money you have?"
"But then, here in this Parliament we have a couple of 'Pavlovs': Mr Schulz, Mr Daul, Mr Verhofstadt, all absent now - they have run away instead of speaking here to focus the budget on quality rather than quantity, for example, by limiting regional and cohesion funds to the poorer Member States, saving 30% of those funds, and investing that money in innovation and future oriented policies."
"But I am sure that the EU Pavlovs will yet again run into the brick wall of the EU Council later this year."
"(FR) Mr President, as has already been said, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, some similar, some different, but in all cases exacerbated by the crisis, national budgets are struggling."
"In each of our countries, no matter what majority is in government, the budgetary situation needs to be addressed."
"We have two options."
"One is to all act alone, trying to reconcile spending and income, in some cases, according to what I have heard, worshiping austerity as an ends in its own right, making swingeing cuts to public spending and social benefits, thereby exacerbating the situation for citizens."
"I would plead in favour of the second option, namely pooling our budgetary efforts, making budgetary solidarity work, playing the own resources card, not least through a tax on financial transactions."
"That is the purpose of the budgetary complementarity that we want to achieve through this convention-style conference, a proposal that we made to the Council during the conciliation procedure and that we have reiterated in this report."
"We need to work together - the European Union, national parliaments and governments - to find a way of pooling our spending and budgetary approaches."
"We cannot have our cake and eat it: we cannot make cuts and, at the same time, invest in infrastructure."
"It is not possible to contribute less but receive more."
"I think that this convention-style model of dialogue between governments, the European Union, national parliaments and the European Parliament is the right way to rebuild confidence in Europe, both now and in the longer term."
"(NL) Mr President, this is a very bad report and one which deserves to be thrown in the bin straight away."
"Right now, when people everywhere are facing incredibly painful austerity measures, it is too insane for words that we in the European Union should be proposing to spend even more money."
"To think that we are behaving in that way when things could be so different: no more throwing money around, no funding for cycle paths and crêperies in a country like the Netherlands."
"We should concentrate our Structural Funds on the poorest countries and only on innovative projects of pan-European significance in the rest of the Member States."
"According to the report, everything should remain as it is: more money has been requested for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, no reforms of the Structural Funds have been proposed, nowhere are there any concrete proposals for more efficiency."
"This Parliament ought to be ashamed of itself, in particular, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"While, in the Netherlands, nota bene, the Rutte cabinet is leaving the sick and the disabled out in the cold, the same groups in this House have a burning hole in their pockets."
"Austerity champions at home, big spenders in Brussels."
"This is an outrage!"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise several aspects of this important report, beginning with the European Union's revenue system."
"By now, it is clear that the current mechanism has too many inconsistencies, the most famous of which is the United Kingdom's correction mechanism."
"Various other corrections and compensations have since been added, making the EU revenue mechanism entirely inequitable and anything but transparent."
"At this point, it would be better to move towards a direct revenue system based exclusively on the gross domestic product of the Member States, or towards a shared and unified form of revenue such as value added tax, for example."
"Obviously, European citizens must not suffer any extra burdens, nor should Europe replace the tax policies of the Member States, which must remain autonomous and absolutely sovereign in this area."
"The report sets out various priorities, some of which are important and others less so, but in any case, they are all very expensive."
"We can raise resources by using instruments such as project bonds and Eurobonds, which must, however, be managed with the utmost rigour so as not to risk the creation of further debt, which would be dangerous."
"We, as Members of the European Parliament, can make an immediate contribution to improving Europe's finances."
"We must, at long last, choose a single location for the work of Parliament, which would bring savings of tens of millions of euro each year."
"This is not demagogy but simple ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the mocking of Her Majesty's Government by Mr Verhofstadt when he shared with us his logic as to why Britain should hand over more money and more power to the EU was further evidence of the palpable disdain in which the UK, its national government and its citizens are held by some in this House."
"What Mr Verhofstadt failed to mention is that other savings are available to the UK."
"Businesses forced to spend GBP 30 million to comply with EU regulations could save this by taking back control from Europe."
"UK fishermen would love to have the GBP 3.3 billion in their pockets: the value of the catch lost when the EU let other countries fish in their territorial waters."
"Commissioner, you state that the European budget is not a duplication of a national budget."
"However, it cannot be divorced from the realities of its citizens."
"Currently, the UK contribution is GBP 6.4 billion, rising to over GBP 10 billion if the rebate goes."
"It can only be met by raising taxes, cutting services, schools ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are five questions we need to ask ourselves:"
"The first is: what budget is required for the 2020 growth and employment strategy?"
"Secondly: what budget is required by a currency union?"
"Thirdly: what potential is open to us to make savings?"
"Fourthly: what budget is required by the United States of Europe?"
"Fifthly: what role is Europe 2020 to play?"
"Do we want to play a role at all?"
"We, the European Parliament, take our responsibilities seriously."
"We deal in plain speaking."
"In Austria, we have a saying: if you do not pay up, the band does not play."
"We want to achieve our goals, meet our obligations, accept the challenges and keep our promises."
"More functions, greater competitiveness, more sustainable growth, more jobs, more research and further integration cannot be achieved with less money, without a financial review, without an evaluation of existing disbursement of funds and without our own resources."
"More Europe will also create a potential for savings in the Member States."
"More Europe will also create more efficiency and is our response to globalisation, to the future and to sovereign debt."
"What is it that we want?"
"We do not want to freeze the budget."
"Anyone seeking to freeze the budget will damage Europe and weaken our ability to fulfil our duties to our citizens."
"We want to introduce a transaction levy as a resource of our own, accepting the challenges and adhering to the Treaty rather than burying our heads in the sand."
"That is our strategy."
"Let us really set the ball rolling and vote in favour of this report."
"(SV) Mr President, I have to say that in all my years in this Parliament, the work of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the most pleasant and the most visionary, in short, the most enjoyable - it really is very fine work."
"It includes everything that is necessary and positive for Europe's future."
"However, I am personally extremely concerned about what we did not do, and that is set priorities."
"We have taken on board all of the new challenges, but we have also retained all of the old ones."
"It will perhaps not be possible to deal with both."
"We should have set priorities."
"We should have been much more rigorous in setting priorities, but what is most worrying of all in this context is the fact that we have left the setting of priorities to the Council."
"That does not bode well for the future, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mr President, the public, the hardworking taxpayers across Europe who actually earn the money which so many in this place are so keen to spend, want Europe to do less and they want Europe to do it better."
"They want a lean European budget which takes into account the fact that, whether we like it or not, we are living in an age of austerity."
"They want Europe to focus on the very limited number of areas where Europe can actually add value, and leave the rest of the activities to our Member States."
"Unfortunately, this report proposes none of these things."
"Let us be clear: the suggestion of a 5% increase is completely unacceptable and the idea of so-called own resources is equally unacceptable - it is just a power-grab by the EU."
"The budget should be modernised, funds should be reallocated to programmes which actually deliver future benefits and not cover up past failures."
"Financing of euro bail-outs should be left to those countries that actually wanted to join the euro in the first place."
"Those of us who warned that it was a mistake should not be forced to contribute to it."
"The committee had a chance to pursue many of these constructive and future-proof suggestions; they rejected it."
"They have done none of those things and the report should be rejected by this House."
"(HU) Mr President, the report we have in front of us is perhaps the most important one of this period."
"The European Parliament is the first among the institutions to draft its thoughts about the next seven years, but without prejudice to the Commission's right to submit proposals."
"However, this is the only possibility to avoid a scandal about our right to consent that would oblige us to reject the proposal of the Council."
"Thus, all of our partners know what the European Parliament wants and they can incorporate that into their ideas as far as possible."
"To my dear fellow Members, may I recommend two documents that are worth reading before you turn your thoughts to rude criticism: the Treaty of Lisbon and the report itself."
"Supporting own resources is no more, no less than what is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I consider the message that the European budget needs a slight increase to be very important."
"Slight in a sense that this 5% will also be modified by inflation, which means that we are not talking about an abnormal increase."
"It is not about increasing the expenditure on agriculture or cohesion, but about the fact that these cannot be decreased."
"Miklós Zrínyi, a writer of dual Croatian-Hungarian origin who lived in the 1600s said - in connection with the Turks at that time - 'Do not hurt the Hungarians!'"
"Quoting his words I say: Do not hurt the agricultural policy; do not hurt the cohesion policy; because those who hurt these policies not only hurt the Hungarians, the Romanians, the Slovaks, but all citizens of the European nations."
"The lesser the voters' support behind a politician, the more he refers to citizens."
"I believe that we, who enjoy the support of a greater political force, likewise represent citizens' interests, and this is the reason why we say: do not hurt the agricultural policy and cohesion!"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Chair for the work they have done on this report."
"The debate today on the report highlights that there will be a fight in the Council on a number of issues, including the overall increase, the UK rebate and own resources."
"To be fair, apart from the issue of the UK rebate where UK Members will be in a minority of one, I think the Parliament has tried to reach some compromises."
"When you have long, complicated and important reports like this, compromise is almost inevitable, but I do welcome some of the compromises."
"I welcome the compromise on the duration and the structure of the next financial perspective."
"I also welcome the compromise on cohesion policy."
"I believe that cohesion policy is vital if we are to achieve jobs and growth in the EU post-2013."
"Therefore, for cohesion policy, we need adequate funding at least at the level we have now, if not more into the future."
"The next financial perspective must be about jobs and growth if it is to be relevant to citizens."
"Therefore, as well as a strong cohesion policy, we also need policies for funding research and development in our universities and SMEs."
"FP8 therefore needs adequate funding for the future."
"We also need to invest in our infrastructure in the European Union - infrastructure like transport, energy and improving broadband in many rural areas - and our rural areas themselves should not be forgotten."
"To deliver all these policies on jobs and growth, we need delivery mechanisms."
"We also need partners."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for an excellent report and for his excellent work on the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013."
"One of the main objectives of future financial frameworks is to establish instruments to take the EU 2020 strategy to the grassroots level."
"There is a realisation in this report that, without a cohesion and agricultural policy that is robust and strong in terms of its budget, this objective will not succeed."
"Cohesion policy, for example, is not the only tangible instrument that will enable us to develop innovations and create jobs and growth."
"We need reform, but we can also implement it within these policy sectors."
"Consequently, I appeal to you, Commissioner, to ensure that, in the forthcoming financial period, both regional policy and agricultural policy maintain their existing budget levels, in accordance with Parliament's opinion."
"I am, moreover, glad that the report also gives consideration to regions where conditions are especially tough, such as the sparsely populated areas of the north."
"They will also need their own additional budgets in the forthcoming financial period"
"(NL) Mr President, the key word for Europe is 'confidence'."
"The European institutions in general, and the European Parliament in particular, need to restore confidence among the citizens."
"How can that be achieved?"
"Firstly, not with more Europe or more money for Europe, but with a better Europe, a Europe with an added value, and Europe should not interfere with matters, such as sport or tourism, which Member States can deal with perfectly well on their own."
"Secondly, commit the cohesion fund to the genuinely poor regions in Europe."
"We still have fifty percent going to rich Member States, such as Germany and France."
"This is unacceptable."
"If we sort this out, we will be able to rein in the unnecessary throwing around of money and still come out with a net profit."
"Thirdly, investment in future-proof agriculture and industry."
"The Polledo report has been a failure."
"Everything and more has been chucked into one big melting pot and our citizens are expected to digest this gunge."
"Bon appetit, but be careful you do not choke on it."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done, which has resulted in a report that enables a good start to be made on building a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), and that constitutes a challenge for the Commission and the Council."
"This is an ambitious report, whilst simultaneously being a realistic report."
"I hope that all the institutions have drawn the correct conclusions from the financial, economic and social crisis that is slow to loosen its grip on us."
"One conclusion is clear to me: only a united Europe that shows solidarity and strengthened, harmonised and convergent economic governance will be up to the task of successfully confronting the political challenges we have before us."
"We need more and better Europe."
"We need to give priority to the Community method rather than the intergovernmental method."
"We need to increase the budget."
"The Europe 2020 strategy has been agreed, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable."
"It will be the guide for the next financial perspectives."
"However, this strategy will only be successful if there is a budget corresponding to its activities; to its objectives."
"As such, the MFF needs to have the financial backing to match the ambition and commitment of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Cohesion policy is also the result of the solidarity principle."
"It is important that this cohesion be economic, social and territorial, and that it act as a pull on the poorer regions."
"I therefore believe it essential that funding for cohesion policy at least remain at the same levels, along with funding for the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"It is also important to make progress towards an MFF, more than 80% of whose funds do not come from national budgets."
"(HU) Mr President, the crisis compels us to review both national and European Union budgets from the aspect of efficiency and to see how they serve our goals, and how much added value, European added value, they bring to this effect."
"I would like to talk about a field that has not been mentioned so far today, namely, cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, which was elevated from the competence of Member States to EU policy level by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Our desire to achieve great improvement in this field must be reflected in the subsequent budget period."
"We definitely have to provide funds for the Stockholm programme, which is a rather ambitious programme."
"Europe is in need of well-educated immigrants who reach Europe in compliance with the regulations, and of a common migration policy with adequate resources."
"The events in North Africa have drawn attention once again to the importance of a common European immigration policy, and have shown the need for integration supported by resources and for European solidarity."
"The last few months have also highlighted the fact that protection of our common values, non-discrimination and human rights also need protection and resources, that we need to simplify the use of resources for the management of extraordinary situations, and that we need our own resources to create a better, stronger and more extensive Europe in the coming period."
"Mr President, congratulations to the rapporteur for all the work he has done."
"It is tremendous in terms of the achievement of trying to get a consensus."
"There are three areas for amendment which I would plead in favour of."
"Firstly, in the longer term, we need a five-year financial perspective."
"If it is the case that 2020 is a seven-year dimension, we should have an absolute condition that the next one will be for a five-year period."
"Secondly, there is insufficient work done on looking at how we get a statement of assurance for expenditure."
"Those who are arguing for more money at a European level would have a stronger case if we knew that we had an absolute cast-iron understanding of where the money actually goes."
"Last but not least, in reply to Mr Verhofstadt, it is unwise to single out any one Member State when there are a number of Member States which are net contributors to the budget."
"I would urge very strongly that we should have a limit on the net contribution of Member States as a percentage of GDP because, looking forward, it is unrealistic to think you can get Member States' approval when their net contributions are doubling at a time of significant austerity."
"(DE) Mr President, the 5% increase in the budget is explained by spending on the External Action Service, border protection, the war on terrorism, an increase in development aid, support for research and transnational infrastructure."
"Overall, this request from Parliament is absolutely justified."
"However, Parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the Garriga Polledo report."
"We would have more credibility if we were to show where Europe can be more efficient and where money can be saved."
"This certainly includes the large number of agencies that enjoy an extremely expensive autonomous existence, and agriculture, where some Member States have still not succeeded in introducing a more market-appropriate flat-rate acreage payment scheme."
"As the rapporteur for the future of structural policy, I would also say that European cohesion policy should also be included here."
"Happily, many regions have succeeded in exceeding the threshold for the maximum funding of 75%."
"However, if there is less poverty in the various regions of Europe, then European solidarity may also recede."
"The money saved could be better invested in European added value, for example, in a smart link between Structural Funds and transnational networks in the border regions."
"This is currently under discussion by the Committee on Regional Development, as is a proposal for an intermediate category of 75 to 90% GDP, as suggested in the Garriga Polledo report."
"Perhaps Mrs Krehl was dreaming if she believed that we had already agreed on a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development."
"I do not believe that the temporary Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the right body to make recommendations for such an intermediate category."
"We are making things too easy for ourselves if we simply also define the more prosperous regions as requiring particular support."
"The way I see it, this is an invitation to waste money."
"We are leaving the tried and tested phasing-out/phasing-in system but are no longer offering any incentive."
"We are guaranteeing a permanent subsidy for all regions almost up to a level of average economic strength."
"There can be no future for a system like this in European regional policy."
"We therefore need to drop paragraph 73 from the report."
"Otherwise, the report is acceptable."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Pieper, I am surprised to hear you say that Mrs Krehl must be dreaming."
"A large majority voted in favour of the intermediate goal when the vote was held in the Committee on Regional Development."
"I believe that we will get the backing of the majority here, too, because there is majority support for the solidarity of the regions."
"That is why we need this intermediate goal."
"I should be interested to know why you refer to this majority as a dream."
"Mr Pieper, can you explain why it is a dream?"
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, this is your perception of the issue."
"We in the Committee on Regional Development have a different proposal from the one contained in the Garriga Polledo report."
"That is my first point."
"My second point is that significant fundamental resistance to the intermediate category still exists within the political groupings."
"You are well aware of this."
"That is why I find your question surprising."
"I think that you are dreaming when you simply claim that we have come up with compromises and that these are unambiguous."
"Anyway, it is a matter for the Committee on Regional Development to prepare the matter for debate in plenary."
"I am very surprised by your extremely optimistic view that our work is complete."
"(FR) Mr President, the debate on the European Union's financial perspective raises questions about the European project, its scope and its ambition."
"This report is laudable because it seeks to mobilise the Union's budgetary resources in order to comply with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This puts it at odds with the narrow vision of most Member States."
"Whereas Member States see Europe in terms of their financial contribution, which they want to see reduced, and the financial returns, which they want to see increased, this report argues in favour of strong and integrated Community policies, be they long-established policies or new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution."
"It is true that a 5% increase in the European budget would be better than the Member States' budgetary plans for 2012."
"However, the crux of the matter - and probably the stumbling block - will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report."
"We are aware of the downsides of austerity policies: how they affect employment and have left growing numbers of citizens despairing."
"We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions."
"I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions."
"Let me conclude by saying that we need to impose a tax on financial speculation, which would increase our citizens' support for a well-financed Europe."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for highlighting the number of challenges in front of us."
"I also welcome the very clear message in the report calling for a significant increase in research and science because that is one of the priorities we need to have."
"I would like to say - and I say this to the Commission - that politics and leadership are about priorities."
"Without priorities, there is no leadership."
"There are always those tasks and challenges that are more important than others."
"That is the case with the budget of the European Union as well as in Member States."
"We need to further increase research and science, but we also need to increase the amount of science and research in regional funding."
"We need to take into consideration the development of the agricultural markets and decrease the spending there."
"But let us remember that we need to set priorities at all levels, at the European level as well as in Member States."
"I must say that I dislike EU-bashing or Brussels-bashing, but I also dislike Member States-bashing, because it diminishes the importance of the spending we have in the Member States: health care, social security, pensions, education."
"This is not a conflict between the EU and the Member States."
"This is an ongoing struggle for leadership and priorities."
"If we do not dare to set those priorities, we do not show leadership."
"I must say that if we cannot understand the tough situation Member States are in today, we do not understand the reality for citizens."
"We need to set priorities and not solve problems just by increasing budgets."
"So I would ask the Commissioner to show leadership, to be courageous, and to remember that research and science, infrastructure ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013."
"It begins with the request for coherence between objectives and instruments, and between the new role that the European institutions must perform - in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recession - and the resources that, together, we decide to invest."
"Such coherence also implies a serious response to the demand for innovation from the public, from the recipients of EU policies, and from Europe's social groups and industries."
"We did the same for cohesion, which is a crucial issue for deciding what we want the European Union to be in the coming years."
"Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew."
"On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus."
"However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe's cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years."
"(FR) Mr President, the 500 million citizens of the European Union currently make up over 8% of the world's population."
"By 2050, that figure will be 5% or 6%."
"In 2100, we will make up 3% of that population."
"This throng of Europeans continues to maintain, largely through national budgets, 2 000 embassies, 27 armies, 50 joint forces and more."
"I believe China is currently employing extra deputy ministers just to receive all the mighty European ministers who arrive to petition Beijing for favours and bilateral agreements."
"All of this is starting to look ridiculous on the world stage."
"Dividing up 8% of the world's population between 30 sovereign budgetary policies is madness."
"Essentially, that sovereignty remains absolute."
"Europe manages 2.5% or one-fortieth of total budgetary expenditure in Europe."
"The Member States' contributions make up one-fortieth of their national spending."
"Yet apparently, even that is too much."
"Let us now consider the question of own resources or maybe another time."
"Let us stop carping about the 2.5% of public spending with which we are supposed to maintain the whole apparatus required to implement the 2020 strategy and to fulfil all the responsibilities accorded to us under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We did not devise the strategy and competences: it was the Member States who did that."
"In view of these realities, Mr Garriga Polledo's report is modest."
"Yet there are those who want to restrict us yet further and who would deem the report ambitious."
"That is why this House should adopt the report."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is vital to the future of the European project, which should involve solidarity and ambitious aims, particularly in view of the budgetary crises that Member States are currently struggling with."
"Taking an ultra-liberal approach, the majority of Heads of State or Government in the Council are choosing to keep slashing budgets wildly and are willing to sacrifice investment in key forward-looking policies such as those funded by the European budget."
"A budget freeze will dent growth, no matter what other Members might say."
"An increase of at least 5%, as recommended in this consensus report, is the minimum if we are to tackle the challenges and stand together."
"European solidarity includes the need to finance the 2020 strategy, not least its social objectives, which include combating poverty."
"The report has also persuaded me that European solidarity should be strengthened by the creation of intermediate regions in order to ensure that the cohesion policy provides fair coverage for the whole of Europe."
"Finally, another example is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which offers real solidarity for European workers."
"The report recognises the valuable role played by this Fund."
"The increase in the Multiannual Financial Framework is necessary."
"It should not be seen as a burden on Member States because the European budget provides added value and will, in future, include a tax on financial transactions."
"(EL) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon created new fields of competence and strengthened Union policies, as reflected in the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2013 to 2020."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garriga, on his integrated report, which sets out the political priorities of a different Europe from the Europe we know."
"Given the major internal challenges faced by the Union and its citizens and bearing in mind its enhanced international character, we realise that the main objective of its policy must be to reduce the existing social, economic and territorial inequalities."
"A planned and successful cohesion policy constitutes per se European added value and will surely prove to be to the benefit of all the Member States of the Union."
"The new programme and the new seven-year framework are based on actions in the EU 2020 strategy and are designed to help Europe to recover from the crisis, by promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"The political priorities and objectives set are to promote employment, to strengthen innovation, research and growth, to address climate change, to improve education levels, to achieve social integration and to combat poverty, alongside policies on immigration and to safeguard resources to develop inaccessible and border areas."
"The Union budget is the main mechanism for activating solidarity between the Member States and is a strong tool for a reform that could mobilise additional private and public resources to support investments that will act as a catalyst in terms of the exponential effect of spending by the Union."
"The European budget must be increased and must be based on real own resources if we want a strong Europe for its citizens and towards the rest of the world."
"The Union budget is a tool for global and integrated development at a time when the Member States alone cannot ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often said that money forms the sinews of war."
"We must remember that money also forms the backbone of a peace project like the European Union."
"If Europe really intends to implement the policies enshrined in the Treaties, including the new policies found in the Treaty of Lisbon, it needs the financial wherewithal to realise those aims."
"Consequently, I am in favour of establishing own resources and a tax on financial transactions."
"The necessary increase in the European budget must go hand in hand with significant savings from optimising our spending."
"For example, let us create a real Common Foreign and Security Policy to give Europe more influence on the world stage, but also in order to make the best use of public money."
"The report by Mr Garriga Polledo is crucial, almost a complete recast: it recommends a very strong political and financial framework for the European Union."
"What is more, two key Union policies are given their rightful place."
"On the common agricultural policy (CAP), which is crucial for food security and self-sufficiency, the report advocates renewing the CAP budget."
"On the cohesion policy, which is the financial instrument used to create regional solidarity and encourage regional economic development, the report proposes enhancing its objectives by creating a category for intermediate regions so that regions at the same developmental level can benefit ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words on the need to move towards own resources reform."
"I believe that the dominating role of GNI-based revenue makes a decision on the EU budget over-politicised and less efficiency-oriented."
"It facilitates demands to freeze or to reduce EU spending."
"It leads to the logic expressed in the context of the 2011 budget negotiations that if we cut our national budgets due to the crisis, we should apply the same approach to the EU budget."
"It is, however, not at all obvious that with an additional own resource that would reduce the dependence on GNI, we can expect a revolution in EU capacities to finance growth and structural change."
"There is always a risk that the same coalition that adopts the budgetary decision in the Council can also adopt the same decision in the European Parliament."
"If we care for Europe, we should move away from responding to the expectations of Finance Ministers and move towards citizens' expectations."
"The success of a national politician returning home from Brussels negotiations should not be based on the message that the government will pay less to the EU budget but, for example, on the message that the EU will help to make small companies fund innovation projects."
"It is clear that the way EU costs are financed should be fully transparent."
"This could be easier to achieve with only one tax, but it is also feasible to build the revenue on a group of taxes that meet criteria on transparency, equity, visibility, efficiency and sufficient harmonisation."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I will begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"I welcome the fact that the priorities put forward in this report are in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and make growth central to European policy."
"We need more and better Europe."
"As such, we should promote the areas that contribute most to competitiveness, like research, innovation and energy."
"We therefore need to significantly increase financing of science and innovation, so as to promote scientific excellence throughout Europe."
"It is also important to strengthen the European system for financing science so as to realise the objective of investing 3% of gross domestic product (GDP)."
"The new budget should also promote increased energy efficiency and support the construction of future infrastructure, energy infrastructure in particular, thereby creating the necessary conditions for European industry to be competitive."
"There is a need to increase the role of industry, in particular, that of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), so contributing to reinforcing Europe's position of leadership in a globalised world."
"(IT) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for his excellent work throughout the year, which has received broad political backing."
"I welcome the message that this report has managed to get across: the solution to the crisis is the assertion of the Union's status as a global player."
"The future financial framework mirrors the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and is grounded firmly within the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, suitable funding is required for the Union's priorities to be credible."
"The development of energy and transport infrastructure, investment in research and development, learning and youth policy must find fresh impetus in the Union's future budgets, while the fundamental pillars of the cohesion policy and the agricultural policy should continue to receive the current amount of funding."
"Europe and its big projects clash with budgetary constraints at national level, meaning that greater involvement of the private sector through project bonds or public/private partnerships is the key to raising competitiveness and growth."
"Together with the rest of the Italian delegation, I am concerned about the proposals to add these so-called 'intermediate categories' to the regional policy, as this risks harming the weakest regions of the Union."
"I will conclude by asserting that financing the Union entirely through a system based on own resources is the only way to ensure the future and the development of the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Staff Regulations is to be presented together with the MFF package."
"This question of how the EU is actually administered is dealt with very succinctly in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the Garriga Polledo report."
"Commissioner, I would ask you to be ambitious when presenting the Staff Regulations."
"After all, the question of what we do, which has been discussed in detail here, is at least as important as the question of how we do it."
"The question is what role will the European Commission play in future when implementing all the points in the 2020 programme we have presented today."
"I would like to see the Commission choose a stronger role for itself, rather than delegating all the tasks to others."
"That is why it is important, in the context of the Staff Regulations reform, that vacancies should be created for these new tasks, so that the Commission itself can also get involved."
"We have an enormous number of free days."
"The Commission's officials have up to 13 weeks paid leave."
"Commissioner, I would suggest that you take some of these free days and reallocate them to the implementation of the budget, so that we can actually achieve the political goals we want to achieve."
"I would ask that we should also be provided with an EU 2020 strategy for the administration of the EU."
"This would require action not only from you, but also from the entire college and the President of the Commission."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on having drafted such an excellent report on the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"The report gained very strong support within the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013."
"I hope that the report will serve as a key foundation for negotiations on the new multiannual European Union budget, which will commence shortly."
"I am very pleased that MEPs have decided to support the amendment I tabled regarding the strengthening of policies on youth."
"At a time when young Europeans are some of the main victims of the economic crisis, we should support all initiatives aimed at improving the situation of young people and, in particular, those aimed at improving access to education and their professional situation."
"Programmes such as 'Youth in Action' and 'Lifelong Learning', which have a very low cost per beneficiary and are extremely effective, should therefore be maintained as a separate element of future multiannual financial frameworks, and these programmes also deserve significantly more funding."
"At the same time, I would like to commend the proposal to maintain a high level of funding for cohesion policy."
"Cohesion policy not only plays a key role in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy; its primary task is to strengthen European integration and solidarity by reducing the social, economic and territorial differences that still unfortunately exist within the European Union."
"(RO) Mr President, the rapporteur started his presentation with a very important sentence, saying that we need to combine traditional European Union policies with our new priorities."
"Neither one nor the other can operate without each other."
"In this context, I would like to welcome the vision of the common agricultural policy outlined in the report."
"I will remind you, if I may, of some of the important ideas, the main one being maintaining the level of the CAP budget during the forthcoming financial programming period."
"The traditional role of European agriculture, along with the new ambitions we are aspiring to, fully justifies maintaining the level of this budget."
"Secondly, the need to maintain a CAP system based on two pillars, while promoting rural areas as part of the second pillar, is closely linked to the Europe 2020 strategy objectives."
"One final point is the need for a reformed CAP in the future, aimed at using the budget more effectively, based on a fair distribution of payments as one of the options for achieving this."
"(LT) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for the tremendous work they have done."
"Today, we have a clear parliament position on what we and our citizens expect from the forthcoming financial programming period."
"We all understand that we will have to fundamentally change the direction of current policy and this is reflected clearly in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"We have to develop a safe single European energy market, ensure that the whole of Europe is connected through transport networks and eradicate the disparities that still exist among the various European Union regions."
"We must completely review the common agricultural policy, which must guarantee a fair and uniform system of direct payments, and many other important areas, without which we will be unable to create a competitive and strong Europe."
"Of course, this will require major investment, particularly in research."
"Therefore, it is necessary to look for new financial instruments, such as the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, etc."
"I believe that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Mr President, one of the key issues that has emerged out of this debate is: 'What exactly is European added value?'"
"I hope that the Commission, when it comes up with its proposals at the end of this month, will give a clear explanation as to why certain budget headings have a clear added value."
"It seems to me that it is precisely that which we need to know, because then we will be able to justify what we are voting for."
"Secondly, the debate will also be strongly influenced by the debates on own resources."
"One of the issues which has poisoned the debate is the decision on the British rebate taken in 1984."
"How has it been able to continue for so long?"
"I think that either the British Government should not be entitled to any rebate at all or that other countries which find themselves in a similar situation to that which Great Britain was in in 1984 should be treated the same."
"I hope that the Commission proposals will, in fact, move in this direction."
"(ES) Mr President, this obsession with focusing only on the quantity of the cuts to be made and not on how or what to cut, and even less on how to increase revenue, is already a cause for concern."
"Firstly, more Europe means a better Europe insofar as it means less economic power for the Member States."
"Secondly, we must, of course, also review expenses."
"However we must be careful about where we do so: one proposal would be to reduce military spending; another would be to reduce the two European Parliament sites to a single one."
"We believe that these are the most important suggestions."
"Thirdly, what most concerned me was seeing Mr Lewandowski smiling, in what I believe to be a worrying way, when the subject of the tax on financial transactions was mentioned."
"It worried me, and I would ask him how it could be so bad, so detrimental, to ask those who have become rich by speculating to pay for the crisis instead of asking those who are least to blame for it to do so, and not do as you did yesterday, calling for Spain to reduce social spending through a reduction in expenditure on ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(LV) Mr President, I should like to remind fellow Members of one thing - when approving the budget, we must remember that among residents of Europe, scepticism is growing regarding what we do here."
"In this regard, it seems to me that the budget is not sufficiently coordinated with the ambitious goals included in the EU 2020 programme."
"I also have a question: you, Commissioner, promised Latvian farmers that direct payments would be evened out with this budget."
"However, if it is approved as it stands now, it will be difficult for you to keep your promise."
"I want all that we talk about and that we discuss to correspond also with the interests of our constituents."
"Mr President, I thought the EU could not get any worse and then I came across this report."
"It starts with a hefty helping of self-delusion: 'never have Europeans been more demanding of the EU'."
"Well, increasing numbers of British people are demanding that we come out of it."
"Perhaps that is what they mean."
"It dismisses utterly the idea of freezing the budget after 2013 and insists that even an increase of 5% would allow only a limited contribution to the EU's objectives."
"Well, we must be thankful for small mercies."
"Tucked away in the middle of paragraph 166 is a call for an end to rebates."
"This is the device by which the United Kingdom pays only an unacceptable net contribution instead of an outrageous net contribution."
"Insisting that the UK should pay over its hard-earned money is bad enough, but paragraph 169 suggests that the EU should have the power to levy its own taxes without our consent and without our control."
"That is simply unacceptable."
"(PL) Mr President, we have achieved an important consensus."
"The report that has been presented is a necessary continuation of what has gone before, while also proposing the expected changes."
"Stability is a characteristic feature of EU policies, hence, the proposal to maintain the current budget for cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy."
"Levelling the playing field in terms of development contributes significantly to strengthening the common market, which yields positive outcomes for all EU Member States."
"The common agricultural policy benefits every consumer in the EU."
"It is worth bearing in mind that farmers have very low incomes, in spite of the support they receive from the European budget."
"The new tasks with which agriculture has been faced in respect of the environment, the climate, animal welfare and unrealistic WTO negotiations mean additional costs for farmers."
"Who will pay?"
"The changes that we expect include an increase in funding for sustainable and smart development, and an emphasis on innovation, scientific research and education."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament is sending a clear message today, both to the European Commission and to the prime ministers of the European Union, for a budget up to 2020 which is commensurate with its responsibilities and public expectations."
"As far as cohesion policy is concerned, the message is clear."
"'Yes' to a cohesion policy with sufficient financing to make a decisive contribution to development, to new jobs and to innovation."
"'Yes' to an independent cohesion policy."
"'Yes' to coordination at all policy making levels, from strategic planning through to implementation."
"'Yes' to the creation of an intermediate category of support for the regions."
"'Yes' to special measures for island and mountainous areas in Europe."
"However, there are also two clear and important 'no's'."
"'No' to any splitting of this policy in different sectors and, finally, 'no' to the imposition of sanctions in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"That concludes the 'catch the eye' procedure and I apologise to the 11 or 12 Members who were on the list and have been unable to speak, but clearly there is no time for their speeches."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have already used up my speaking time so I shall make just two short remarks."
"First, in the present international context of austerity, the European budget, which is without deficit, cannot be blamed for the mismanagement of national finances."
"It can, however, help create jobs and growth because it is about investment."
"In this, it differs from national budgets, which are mainly about social transfers."
"Second, as regards promises to the farmers in Europe, gradual convergence is realistic."
"A flat rate is not feasible at the moment, and I believe it will remain that way in the coming years."
"Finally, on behalf of the Commission, I expect the forthcoming vote to reflect the broad consensus in this Chamber, making the voice of the European Parliament strong and influential."
"We will end the debate with a speech from Mr Garriga Polledo as rapporteur, whom I wholeheartedly congratulate on his excellent work on this subject."
"Mr President, I firstly want to thank the national delegations, who I understand have resisted pressure in their Member States and will vote for this report."
"I feel that this is not a debate on budget volume, but rather on the supremacy of the Community method, and I think that those who have focused this debate on efforts to reduce the Union budget have made a mistake."
"They want new priorities and a reduced budget;"
"I say to them that going down this route will mean that they end up with a reduced budget and fewer priorities."
"I certainly do not understand how they can sit in this hemicycle and defend an intergovernmental approach."
"Leave that step to the Council; you should defend a European Union, with its policies, priorities, responsibilities, and an adequate budget."
"We do not want an increase of 5% in European public spending; instead, we are seeking to alleviate national budgetary burdens and gather certain transnational investments into the EU budget, where they can be more efficiently utilised."
"That is the European added value that all groups in this Chamber accepted in the Policy Challenges (SURE) Committee this year."
"I think this is certainly a far-reaching proposal; it is an ambitious proposal and requires important decisions to be made in the Member States, and we would ask them to rise to the challenge it entails."
"I want to acknowledge the constructiveness of the proposals and the debate, which I feel has been sufficiently vibrant and has fully expressed the mosaic of viewpoints which unite the European Parliament."
"I think that we come out of this debate, in any case, in a much richer position as a House and with a much improved political profile."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12:00."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Due to the current crisis and the drastic public spending restrictions, Member States are finding it increasingly difficult to record economic growth."
"I must stress the need for the EU to respond to demographic challenges."
"The decline in the proportion of the working population, combined with the rise in the proportion of people in retirement will put a strain on social protection systems."
"I support the idea that all the funding provided by the EU should help improve the general state of the European environment."
"Consequently, the positive and negative impact on the climate and environment and the use of EU funds should be analysed at every level."
"Investments at EU level can achieve considerably greater savings at national level, especially in the areas where the EU unquestionably provides greater added value than national budgets."
"The continuing debate on the forthcoming programming period shows us that it will be necessary to focus to a greater extent this time on a more comprehensive approach to this primary economic instrument for EU policies."
"The global financial crisis and the intense global competitive pressures from the economic tigers of China and India show us that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will have to be set up in such a way that it corresponds to the main objectives of the 2020 agenda."
"The rapporteur's idea of merging all policies relating to the 2020 agenda into the single area of the MFF looks extremely bold."
"The rapporteur is quite right to propose a legally binding review of the limits in individual areas half way through the programming period."
"Also of interest is the idea of bringing the timing of the MMF into line with the political cycles of EU bodies, thereby increasing democratic control and accountability."
"The rapporteur's idea that we must consider reforming EU revenues is undoubtedly correct in principle."
"It is also entirely appropriate to move across gradually to a system of own resources for the EU, thereby replacing the current system of Member State contributions, as this leads to comparisons of the balance between the EU and Member States, causing the general public to draw the wrong conclusions over the meaning of EU membership, which is an entirely mistaken conclusion given the current interconnectedness of economies and policies."
"Mr Garriga Polledo's report sets out to define the European Parliament's political priorities for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period after 2013, both in terms of legislation and the budget."
"Two elements in particular caught my eye: firstly, that cohesion for growth and employment is a political priority."
"I fully support the creation of an intermediate region category."
"This would apply to all regions where GDP per capita falls between 75% and 90% of EU GDP."
"This would serve to create a better balance between regions."
"The proposal puts into practice the principle of territorial cohesion as set out in Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"On the subject of the financial perspectives, I am in favour of taxing financial transactions so as to build up own resources for the European Union."
"in writing. - I want to draw attention to the proposal in this report for a financial transaction tax (FTT)."
"A financial transaction tax could deal with two problems at once - how to finance ever-growing demands to put new EU policies in place, and how to make the financial sector contribute to the resolution of the economic crisis that it helped to cause."
"The tax revenues could moderate payments EU Member States currently make to the EU budget."
"At the same time, they will allow the smooth development of policies to safeguard the economic future of Europe."
"We would have the resources for investment in research and development, fighting climate change and in building solidarity between the regions of the EU."
"Europe should lead the world by levying this tax within its borders and campaigning for it to be introduced in the rest of the world."
"I urge the European Commission to act promptly on foot of this report and meet the demands of this democratically elected Parliament to bring forward appropriate measures."
"Let us look at the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)."
"The EU's expansion to 12 new countries, generally with lower levels of development than the average for the 15 previous Member States, has brought undeniable challenges and demands in terms of realising the principle of economic and social cohesion."
"However, what we have seen is a relative cut in the Structural Funds from 0.42% to 0.37% of EU gross national income (GNI)."
"In other words: they have been cut in relative terms at the time they were most needed."
"The results are plain to see: instead of the promised convergence, what we have is a visible divergence, exacerbated by the effects of the economic and social crisis, and by the functioning and development of instruments like the Single Market, to the benefit of some and to the clear detriment of others."
"This is the MFF now serving as a benchmark for the debate on the financial perspectives 2013-2020, with the proposal being, essentially, to maintain it."
"The 5% increase will not raise the EU budget substantially above 1% of Union GNI."
"Once again, this is threatening the heralded principle of cohesion."
"This is made even worse by the fact that available resources are now channelled into other purposes - included, nonetheless, in the Treaties: militarism and overseas intervention, amongst others - that make this principle even more secondary in nature."
"Although there were grounds for freezing EU expenditure during the economic crisis, we cannot use the same arguments that we did two years ago when considering the Multiannual Financial Framework today."
"Instead, we must ask ourselves questions regarding the principles governing the EU's functioning in the next seven-year period: is it to be an EU based on solidarity, which fulfils its obligations and establishes an innovative economy and a common foreign policy in line with the Treaty of Lisbon?"
"Or is it instead to be an EU which did admittedly include ambitious objectives in the Treaty, but which everyone knows was only playing make-believe?"
"I am a staunch advocate of the former, and I support the rapporteur's opinion as regards the need to increase funding in the next Multiannual Financial Framework by 5% compared to 2013 levels."
"This change would bring us closer to achieving the ambitious goals enshrined in the Treaty, and a 5% increase in expenditure would actually mean a very small increase, since inflation currently stands at 3.2%."
"Furthermore, this insignificant increase in the EU budget will benefit the poorest regions, which gain most from EU assistance granted in order to ensure that differences in development are overcome."
"I hope that the next Presidency, which will be held by Poland, will make it a priority to reconcile the positions of the 'net payers', such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom, with Parliament's position, as set out in the ambitious Garriga Polledo report."
"In the past, MEPs had only limited influence in talks on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) of the Union."
"The fundamental change ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon applies precisely to this long-term programming of the budget, which must be compiled afresh by the Council after approval by the European Parliament."
"This was the reason for establishing the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE), which defines in its report the political priorities of the European Parliament ahead of the start of talks on the next MFF following 2013."
"It is clear from the report of Salvador Garriga Polledo that adequate funding will have to be secured for EU policies if the Union still wants to focus on achieving the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Without sufficient new resources after 2013, the Union will be unable to fulfil either the current political priorities or the new tasks and objectives from the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In view of the inadequacy of the EU's traditional own resources, a specialist discussion was started in the SURE committee on new own resources for the EU budget."
"We have a great opportunity in the next financial framework to show European citizens that the Union is capable of thinking and acting in their long-term interest, and achieving effective results in securing internal cohesion and solid growth."
"I therefore entirely agree with the rapporteur's priority statement that the sums earmarked for the common agricultural policy and the cohesion policy in the next period must not be lower than in the current framework."
"The draft proposal, which was supported by eight committees, starts out from challenges to which the new Multiannual Financial Framework has to respond as well."
"The current crisis is the last warning for Europe to react to the transformation in world order."
"Like all transformations, the emerging order will produce winners and losers."
"Europe shall not be among the losers."
"Jean Monnet warned in his time: 'Europe has never existed."
"One must genuinely create Europe'."
"The founding father of European integration did not regard this task as a single act, but as continuous work."
"Accordingly, we must assess expected conditions and specific circumstances and determine what we have to do to make sure that Europe exists and does not end up as a loser."
"The Commission submitted the Europe 2020 strategy last year, whose aim is recovery from the crisis and the preparation of the European economy for the next decade."
"The three key areas that promote economic growth are the following: knowledge, innovation, education; or 'intelligent growth' that puts digital society in the centre, sustainable development that promotes more efficient energy use and enhances competitiveness, and inclusive growth that increases participation in the labour market."
"The new Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union must be established at Community level and national development programmes should be adjusted to each other in a way that they result in an optimal implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy by creating the necessary synergies."
"People expect concrete results from the EU more than ever during economically difficult times."
"We need better, simpler legislation which serves the interests of Europeans."
"Regulation needs to be pruned."
"There is no reason to draft European legislation unless there is a real need for it."
"The EU's forthcoming budget should respond more effectively to the day-to-day problems faced by the public."
"The budget should support growth and new jobs, but, above all, it should create European added value."
"At the end of this month, the Commission is to publish its proposals for the EU's budget after 2014."
"With the economic crisis, the Member States of the EU have had to make tough decisions with respect to their own budgets."
"In times of crisis, the EU's budget should not be increased either."
"On the contrary, it should be cut."
"I hope that, ultimately, we will rid ourselves of much of the foolishness that is associated with the EU."
"Parliament's monthly trek between Brussels and Strasbourg costs European taxpayers a good EUR 200 million a year."
"This money can be put to better use."
"The various discounts that are granted to the United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany should be abolished altogether."
"This year, the United Kingdom alone will receive a rebate of some EUR 3 billion because of a discount on contributions negotiated in 1984."
"It is time the EU and its budget were reformed."
"The money that European taxpayers provide has to be used more effectively and bring European added value to the Member States."
"An increase in administration, red tape and unnecessary EU legislation does not represent that."
"The new Multiannual Financial Framework is extremely significant because the European Union's future will, to a great extent, depend on it."
"The debate on the financial perspective is not an easy one because many Member States are feeling the effects of the economic crisis."
"Their reluctance to increase the EU budget is quite understandable."
"Nevertheless, the financial sceptics should be aware of the extent of the benefits the common market confers upon the individual Member States' economies."
"European integration has a positive and stimulating influence on the economy."
"In addition, the European Parliament would like the new financial framework to be structured in such a way as to increase competitiveness and promote social integration."
"The EU budget funds measures which are absolutely vital for the citizens of all the Member States."
"This is not an abstract statement."
"Cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy have an impact on the daily lives of millions of citizens."
"There can be no doubt that some of the tasks performed by the EU would not be carried out by any other body."
"Increasing the level of social, economic and infrastructure cohesion or ensuring equality of opportunity in the agricultural sector are objectives which deserve our support."
"It is worth spending European money on them."
"The European Union cannot carry out more measures in more Member States with a smaller budget."
"This is not feasible, and this is why we need a larger and ambitious budget."
"As the rapporteur writes, European Union assistance is essential if the Member States are to be in a position to meet future challenges."
"The Europe 2020 strategy indicates the appropriate areas where this assistance should be focused, by outlining the priorities and vision of a strong, stable and modern Europe; a Europe which will have learnt its lesson from its recent economic problems and a Europe which will ensure jobs, energy security and healthy food for its citizens."
"Budgetary plans should take account of the most important objectives of sustainable development, at the same time as being flexible and focused on concrete measures."
"I barely need mention the fact that money must be spent transparently and for good reason."
"Public acceptance and understanding are nowadays an integral part of EU policy and form the basis for the EU's functioning."
"in writing. - To achieve the 2020 goals, a European approach is needed."
"At the same time, one has to realise that more Europe cannot be achieved with less money."
"Freezing the resources by Member States will not be a sustainable option."
"Once Member States have accepted long-term strategic all-European political commitments, it is not possible to deny them financing."
"This will only undermine the EU's credibility in the eyes of millions of citizens."
"In practical terms, much better coordination of the programmes is required, concentrating on their complementarities."
"Financing the new priorities - R&D, innovation, and energy and transportation networks - will be unrealistic while retaining the present level of resources."
"The real internal EU challenge is to make the older EU15 and younger EU12 meet at the end of the next financial framework."
"Continuing with old programmes and designing new programmes has to be given in-depth scrutiny."
"Commitment to the EU's principles of equality and solidarity should end the existence of different standards and also prejudices in decision making."
"The EU can succeed when all its Members are treated by the same standards."
"A true financial perspective has to look even further forward than seven years."
"However, I support flexible mechanisms for necessary adaptations."
"The European Union's poorest regions are developing rapidly at present, and one of the reasons for this is European funding."
"Although many new roads have been built or repaired and Internet connections have been installed, there are still a great many needs to be met, since there is a very large gap between these regions and the most highly developed regions."
"When we joined the European Union, there were fears that Poland and the new Member States would not make proper use of the opportunities afforded to them by membership, and that European funds would be spent without due consideration."
"Fears were also voiced regarding corruption, since opportunity - or a great deal of money - makes the thief."
"Meanwhile, analyses have shown that European money has been spent wisely in Poland, and has not been linked with dishonest practices."
"Therefore, in view of the gap we are trying to bridge and, at the same time, the EU's future goals, we must not reduce either the EU budget or the funds for implementing cohesion policy."
"Even if the European Parliament votes through an increase to the European budget, which I hope will be the case, it is now important to convince the individual Member States that it is worth supporting Parliament's political position."
"I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr Garriga Polledo for having prepared a comprehensive report, and for the impressive amount of work he has put into drafting compromise amendments."
"I agree with the rapporteur that cohesion policy, which has proven its effectiveness, should be given a place in the new Multiannual Financial Framework which is commensurate with its importance."
"However, we should strive for better coordination and complementarity of the individual funds, and for simplified procedures."
"Changes to systems for monitoring and managing funds, aimed at increasing the effectiveness of their interventions, should be based on a thorough analysis of their current functioning."
"I also support the view that unused funds should remain in the budget earmarked for cohesion, and not returned to the Member States, and I believe that we need a thorough analysis of the possible consequences of including the European Development Fund in the EU budget, in particular, in light of the EU's obligations to third countries."
"Europe is experiencing a crisis."
"The tax shortfalls of self-governing regions exceed 20% of the budget, compared to the period before the crisis, which is unsustainable."
"The revenue shortfalls for municipalities look very similar."
"They cannot fund their core competences, they are laying off employees and they are getting into debt."
"In such a situation, we should not be surprised that they fail to understand why the European Parliament is asking for more resources."
"However, if states coordinated their policies and funding in the area of priorities, they would achieve better results and would save more funds than the amount by which we want to increase the common EU budget. There is therefore no better alternative than the one we are discussing today."
"We must discuss it and debate it more, not only in the European Parliament, but especially with ministers in the Council, with members of national parliaments, and also in the regions, so that they understand that a joint solution will bring not only the best result for our citizens, but will also lead to savings in national budgets."
"Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors find themselves not just paying the EU budget through the huge redistribution mechanism, but actually paying two and three times over."
"In future years, real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees."
"This will have to be financed by the net contributors, in other words, the hard-working German, French, Italian, Dutch and Austrian citizens, from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries."
"The people in the economically strong EU countries are angry - at least every bit as angry as the demonstrators in Athens - because they have to tighten their belts for the sake of the PIIG states."
"Demanding budget increases in this difficult situation is out-of-touch and scandalous."
"We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors."
"Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings."
"Farming subsidies, the largest and most contentious budgetary factor, should be renationalised."
"This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector."
"If the enormous amount of money paid in taxes were to reach small and medium-sized farmers instead of big landowners, agricultural factories, large businesses, monarchs and golf clubs, then maybe it would be possible to halt the decline in farming."
"The adoption of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo marks an import step for this House: it constitutes a clear, pragmatic and realistic statement of the European Parliament's budgetary ambitions post-2013."
"Firstly, on cohesion policy, which is key to regional development. I believe that we need to maintain the cohesion policy budget and create an equitable aid model for all regions with intermediary income so as to make future EU investments in the regions transparent and fair."
"The 5% budget increase is reasonable."
"It is not, as the Eurosceptics claim, an example of European profligacy, but rather a courageous admission that if we do not give ourselves the means to build Europe together, we will remain isolated and powerless."
"Consequently, so as to be able to finance the actions linked to the EU's new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon, I am supporting the request for the question of own resources to be examined and for new forms of Community income, in order to ease the pressure on national budgets and to do away with the belief in a 'fair return' which is economically inaccurate and politically unsound."
"The European Parliament is presenting the European Commission and Council with its vision of the European Union's priorities for the 2014-2020 period for the first time."
"It is now the European Commission's turn to take into account in its legislative proposal the European Parliament's opinion."
"I should stress in particular that the development of a competitive agricultural sector and economic and social cohesion should be maintained as priorities for the period ahead."
"MEPs have also given their due attention to Europe's research efforts."
"The European Parliament's entire vision is firmly grounded in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"When determining the framework of the next budget, the first question to ask is whether we want more or less Europe."
"In my opinion, Parliament has already taken a stand in this question."
"We have already stated that we need more Europe by accepting the ambitious goals of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Now we have to declare loud and clear that these objectives can only be achieved if we assign sufficient resources to them."
"In a period when many Member States are suffering from the 'Mediterranean dilemma', whereby the country needs fiscal expansion in order to stimulate growth, but it cannot be done because never-ending austerity measures would be inevitable due to the country's indebtedness, we cannot respond by decreasing or approving the current EU budget that is fundamentally aimed at development."
"We cannot, because it would mean depriving regions lagging behind of their only chance to put their economies on a path to growth."
"The creation of 'intermediate regions' as proposed in the report means that relatively rich areas of poorer Member States will still receive support, and will be able to prepare gradually for the point in time when they lose this additional funding entirely."
"The possibility of creating such a group of regions is undoubtedly a very welcome development for the main beneficiaries of cohesion policy, which have to make long-term plans."
"Parliament's adoption of this proposal today would send out a very important message in the debate on the future shape of cohesion policy."
"The Galliga Polledo report devotes much attention to the Europe 2020 programme."
"I believe that earmarking significant amounts of money for the objectives of this programme may result in a drop in funding for programmes which are important for European cohesion and development, such as the cohesion fund."
"The outcomes show that this fund has been the most effective tool to date for accomplishing the goals enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is therefore important for its funding to be increased."
"Many European countries have been severely affected by the economic crisis and for them, the cohesion fund is now a driving force making it possible to fight unemployment proactively and to mobilise regions."
"On the other hand, it is important for the EU to provide financial support for energy projects and innovation."
"These two areas of investment are the key to the rapid growth of the European Union."
"At present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the EU, mainly Russia."
"This entails significant capital outflow beyond our borders, and we should therefore earmark more funds for supporting infrastructure investments which allow for a diversification of supply and a subsequent drop in prices, including the Nabucco pipeline, which is the most important project in terms of diversification."
"The report also fails to set out any clear guidelines regarding support for shale gas exploration in the near future."
"The EU must not forget that making wise investments today in sources of energy will mean capital savings tomorrow."
"(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to say that the microphone at my desk, number 759, is not working."
"I already asked for it to be repaired yesterday."
"I would ask for the services of a technician please. Thank you."
"Colleagues, as you know, because of the fire practice, the voting and explanations of vote were suspended yesterday, so we will be taking those today as part of the vote."

"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) Mr President, I should like to express my overall satisfaction about the adoption of Mr El Khadraoui's report."
"I believe it represents a step forward for consumer and environmental protection, including in terms of the positions of individual Member States, which sometimes complain of delays."
"Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order."
"I come from a country whose government was rather tardy in expressing its interest in this directive."
"I therefore hope that Parliament's decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future."
"(IT) Mr President, the 'polluter pays' principle is, without doubt, essential for resolving environmental problems aggravated by European industrial development."
"However, it is not always right to attack a single category; we also need to defend the principle that it cannot be solely road hauliers to pay, but also those in Europe who do not put enough energy into supporting an alternative transport system."
"Europe still has too few programmes to restructure the transport sector for more ecological solutions with a low environmental impact, and there is also a dearth of resources to improve its efficiency and environmental performance."
"Once again, therefore, we need to remember that we cannot cut traffic volumes because, by contrast, the amount of journeys and haulage needs to be increased."
"Therefore, road hauliers cannot be the only ones to pay for the ecological problems caused by others."
"(FI) Mr President, the rapporteur, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and, obviously, Parliament as a whole, have to be congratulated on this excellent piece of legislation."
"This was the result of compromises being made and which received willing support."
"I think that it is extremely important that heavy goods traffic is included when we speak about climate change and sustainable development."
"In this way, we can show the public that we are really concerned about how emissions from heavy goods traffic, especially during the rush hour and on congested roads, are causing problems."
"One thing I agreed to here, for the sake of compromise, was that the money that is being charged here for heavy goods traffic can be spent on rail transport or shipping."
"That may be possible in some cases, but I hope that when these decisions are being implemented nationally, it will be realised that it is heavy goods traffic that is paying for it."
"These funds could be used for improving, repairing and building roads and would, in this way, be of benefit to heavy goods traffic."
"Mr President, in relation to the carrying of heavy goods vehicles, this is quite serious as far as Ireland is concerned."
"We are on the periphery of Europe, with two sea bridges to mainland Europe where all of these extra charges for road use and pollution are going to apply."
"I understand from the exporters' association in Ireland that this would add EUR 150 per trip, or EUR 300 per round trip, for haulage from Ireland, which depends heavily on this type of haulage and also very heavily on exports."
"This will ensure that we will be less competitive."
"I believe that the Commission and the Council must look at this and must take into consideration the peripheral regions."
"It is not a major issue for the mainland European Member States but is certainly a major issue for Ireland and for other peripheral countries."
"(PL) Mr President, I wish to make it quite clear that the recommendations Parliament has adopted today will not be so straightforward under the conditions existing in Poland."
"These recommendations result in an increase in transport costs, and hauliers with older vehicles will obviously be in a worse situation."
"It is, however, to be welcomed that additional funding will be available to invest in sustainable transport and, above all, that there will be an opportunity to construct high-speed rail links and water transport links."
"However, I would like to echo previous speakers who have said that these recommendations have negative as well as positive aspects."
"They will also give rise to a whole series of complications for a great many hauliers in my country."
"(DE) Mr President, I have two comments to make on the so-called Eurovignette."
"On the one hand, I would have liked to have seen a clear formulation to the effect that the financial resources collected there really are to be used for road building."
"My second point is that I assume that the provision stating that the countries can exclude small commercial vehicles weighing between 3.5 and 12 tonnes from the Infrastructure Costs Directive will be respected by the Member States."
"After all, a lot of medium-sized enterprises use vehicles in the 3.5 to 12 tonne range. Most of these businesses will be unable to sustain higher costs."
"Such businesses are often the pillar for potential employment and enterprise in our rural areas."
"Mr President, the Eurovignette proposal is well intentioned."
"There are many commendable aspects to it."
"To reduce carbon emissions from vehicles is very commendable; to reduce heavy goods vehicle congestion is very commendable; and the spending of 15% of the tolls on infrastructure is very commendable."
"I would have liked to support this particular measure but I had to vote against because, as has been said already by my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, Ireland's economy is heavily dependent on exports."
"The Eurovignette measures, if adopted in our country, would have devastating consequences."
"Any additional charges on Irish hauliers would have a major negative impact on our exports."
"I think I am supported by the Spanish, the Portuguese and also the Italians."
"We are peripheral nations."
"We are totally dependent on our international markets."
"The high cost of diesel has pushed hauliers to the brink."
"Regrettably, I had to vote against the measure."
"(IT) Mr President, today's vote represents a marked step forward in bringing in the 'polluter pays' principle, including in the road haulage sector, which makes a significant contribution to atmospheric and noise pollution."
"Despite the criticisms of industry organisations, I think that the Council's position is the best compromise available right now, even though I hope that improvements can be made in the future."
"I voted in favour."
"I must point out, however, that we need to identify better ways to use the revenues, making it mandatory for the Member States to invest these resources to improve the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and infrastructure for reducing pollution."
"This is the only way that, in future, we will be able to say that today's decision has had positive results."
"(IT) Mr President, thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam, environmental and sustainability policy has gained greater significance and attention has focused on integrating economic and environmental policy, as well as introducing environmental considerations to other policy areas."
"The key sectors include climate change, sustainable transport, nature and biodiversity, health and the environment, the use of natural resources and waste management, as well as the international dimension of sustainable development."
"The Council, in its conclusions of June 2006, called on the Union and its Member States to extend national accounts to the fundamental aspects of sustainable development."
"National accounts must therefore include an integrated economic and environmental accounts statement with fully coherent data."
"I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation because it creates new uses for national accounts data, environmental statistics and other statistical domains."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Leinen report because I am convinced that by recording this data in the various countries, we will learn far more about the situation in these countries."
"However, I have chosen to speak again because a number of contributors to the debate have said that we should only deal with these accounts and ignore GDP completely."
"I would like to advise you against this."
"That is an extremely dangerous development."
"Gross Domestic Product is an indicator of economic development and prosperity."
"If we want to stop measuring this or only want to use social and environmental criteria in our measurements, then we are heading for a disaster."
"Thus, all of this can only supplement GDP figures."
"GDP must be at the centre of our analyses, as agreed in the Rosbach report."
"I believe that this should also apply here."
"I should like to emphasise that yet again."
"Mr President, sorry, could you tell me which subject we are on now?"
"I did not hear it."
"(The President: 'On Coelho')"
"The Romania/Bulgaria acquis?"
"Thank you."
"(DA) Mr President, we have today voted on and adopted in Parliament a decision recognising that Romania and Bulgaria are ready for admission into the Schengen cooperation."
"I do not doubt that the purely technical aspects are in place and that an enormous amount of work has been done to be ready for admission."
"However, I think that there are a number of reasons why we should take seriously the concern felt by European citizens on account of the rising level of corruption in many Member States and the increasing level of cross-border crime."
"We ought therefore to have utilised this situation to strengthen our police cooperation and our fight against corruption before we set about extending the Schengen area."
"It is not a question of directing criticism at these two countries, but of taking advantage of the opportunity before extending Schengen to demand some relevant answers for the concerned citizens who are witnessing this rising crime in Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the European Union in 2007, yet both countries still carry out border checks as a result of the partial application of the measures contained in the acquis."
"As careful assessments and visits carried out by groups of experts have shown, even though the two countries have shown substantial commitment and made obvious progress in implementing the acquis, some shortcomings still remain, for example, in the fields of equipment, performance of border checks and training."
"We are of a mind to confirm our support for their full adhesion to the agreement, although we think it is essential for the two countries in question to inform us in writing, within six months, that additional measures to close these gaps have been implemented."
"Indeed, the fact that the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area is one of the most sensitive regions for the Union's border policy in terms of illegal migration is something we cannot ignore or fail to consider."
"(BG) Mr President, the most important part of this very well drafted report from Mr Coelho was at the end."
"This is where there was a very clear mention about the danger from the emigration wave which may inundate Europe from Turkey and, through Turkey, from the countries in the Middle East and North Africa."
"Up to a quarter of a century ago, Europe was protected from such emigration waves for two reasons: the Iron Curtain and the totalitarian regimes in North Africa."
"Both totalitarian systems kept their citizens under submission and were more likely not to allow them to leave their country than the opposite, but these obstacles do not exist now."
"This is why I voted for this report."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Coelho has mentioned the significance of the emigration pressure from Turkey on Bulgaria and Greece."
"However, I wish to say that it will not be enough for these statements just to remain words on a piece of paper."
"Resources and programmes are needed, which will be used to protect the Union from this emigration wave."
"(FI) Mr President, it is obviously very important that in the European Union, the same principles can be applied to all the Member States of the Union."
"In this respect, the Schengen Agreement is one step forward towards this kind of closer cooperation, that is to say, freer movement, but we must obviously remember that free movement also has to involve a certain sense of responsibility."
"Now we must hope that, when Romania and Bulgaria join the Schengen area, the problems that have occurred on their borders are actually addressed, and that adequate resources are channelled there to ensure that this sort of illegal migration and the other occurrences can be prevented."
"Of course, basically the situation is that there cannot be a two-tier system in the European Union: the same rules have to apply to everyone."
"In this way, we can also ensure that the same opportunities are pursued in these countries as elsewhere."
"Resources are needed, because we know the problems and dangers that are occurring there."
"Mr President, as you are well aware, British Conservatives normally take the view that we abstain on questions to do with the euro or with Schengen because we are outside both, and therefore arguably it is none of our business."
"However, in this case, I believe it is our business; we know that Bulgaria and Romania have serious problems with crime and corruption and I do not believe that their border controls are as good as those which would obtain in other Schengen countries."
"They will therefore become a route and a conduit for illegal immigrants into the European Union who, within the Schengen area, would then be free to come to Calais and would definitely have the effect of increasing illegal immigration into the United Kingdom."
"For that reason, I voted against the report."
"(IT) Mr President, the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme is especially significant."
"There are four reasons - which I consider to be paramount - why I voted in favour of the report: 1) the simplification and streamlining of procedures in order to make it easier to access funding; 2) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for growth and employment; 3) innovation for a competitive manufacturing sector capable of meeting the challenges of the market; and 4) the risk finance facility, which so far has produced very good results."
"Lastly, I should like to point out that the triangle of knowledge, education and research - on which the future of the cohesion policy rests - can only be consolidated in Europe through a steadfast commitment to research."
"(DA) Mr President, there is broad consensus in Parliament on the need to reform our research programme."
"Nevertheless, I have to express my regret that the Commission has been so vague and unambitious in its mid-term review."
"It could, in fact, be made very much better and much more could be done immediately."
"The Commission could reduce the application deadlines, secure funds for demonstration facilities and use international accounting standards instead of inventing its own."
"All of this creates pointless bureaucracy that frightens industry away."
"It prevents Europe from progressing from ideas to invoices."
"In future, therefore, we must reduce the chaotic jumble of programmes and the amount of bureaucracy, and we must focus on the major challenges: climate change, energy and food - in short, we must use our research to create jobs."
"Parliament has today shown that it has the will to do this."
"Now it is up to the Commission to show the way."
"(IT) Mr President, research and innovation play a central role in the European Union's development and competitiveness and they are crucial in terms of reaching the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is the main instrument for funding research in Europe, as shown by the report voted on today."
"However, there are still many problems being caused by excessive amounts of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"In its resolution of 11 November 2010, Parliament asked the Commission to introduce procedural, administrative and financial simplification measures into the current management of the Seventh Framework Programme, yet these measures have still not been addressed."
"I call upon the Commission to acknowledge Parliament's observations and to identify solutions to make it easier for SMEs to access the seventh and eighth research programmes."
"(FI) Mr President, I was also happy to vote in favour of this report, and I thank my colleague, Mr Audy, for doing such a good job."
"I have two matters to raise."
"Funding is extremely important, and it could be a little more ambitious, since it is being stated here that this level is credible and necessary."
"We have to increase funding to achieve vital growth in Europe."
"Some time ago, I myself was listening to a Finnish research group which was receiving funding through this programme."
"They do cell research, in which they are quite close to a breakthrough which would even allow them to develop cures for cancer."
"They have had no information, however, as to whether the funding will continue."
"They are quite at a loss."
"In my opinion, this funding should be continued and it should be sufficient."
"The other issue, on which we are clearly receiving feedback, is that a lot of working time is spent on red tape."
"This needs to be cut, so that things can be prioritised properly."
"(LT) Mr President, I am pleased that today, we are discussing the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Many of the points mentioned in the document are very true, particularly as regards young researchers and more active participation by industry in projects under the Framework Programme."
"The document expresses concern over the rather low participation rate among certain Member States."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that there are objective reasons for this."
"The financing schemes in force today are, in a sense, more favourable towards the old European Union Member States."
"This is also reflected in the figures."
"The amount of financing that a project participant from one of the new Member States receives is half what it would be for a participant from the old Member States."
"As a result of this situation, a gap is forming in the Community and new Member States are being excluded, which I firmly believe is wrong."
"I therefore feel that it is necessary to review the financing schemes and to strive to ensure during FP8 that there are no more disparities or discrimination, so that we can successfully address the challenges mentioned in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"(HU) Mr President, the current Seventh Framework Programme ensures that the European Union can raise its research policy to an adequate level."
"With its budget in excess of EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, we can consider it as one of the most significant programmes supporting research in the world."
"We need to prepare a mid-term review based on concrete data in order to ensure that the Seventh Framework Programme continues to meet European requirements."
"I believe that the simplification process is the most important thing we can underline in a mid-term review."
"Experience also shows that the complexity and difficulty of administrative procedures was one of the biggest problems for our researchers."
"The other important thing is the facilitation of the participation of SMEs in the programme."
"Unfortunately, in this respect, we need to make further efforts, although some improvement has been achieved in programmes concerning cooperation."
"We were very pleased to welcome the introduction of the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility."
"This should be continued and increased until the end of the Seventh Framework Programme, and in the course of subsequent programmes."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the report."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted against the Audy report."
"I am unable to lend my approval to a document which blocks the INDECT project."
"I do not agree with the statement that the project, which is being carried out at the well-known AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, violates the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Its research goal is, after all, to accomplish the goals set out in resolutions on the fight against paedophilia, sales of weapons via the Internet and the fight against drug trafficking and human trafficking, which are issues we have raised many times in this Chamber."
"It is an innovative project, which does an excellent job of filling the gaps in the EU Member States' security systems, particularly as regards the Internet."
"The people it affects are those who break the law, and they are the ones who have most to fear from its goals."
"What is more, the project provides a good basis for the construction of an integrated security network, ensuring defence against cyber attacks."
"Russia, the United States and China have put in place similar solutions, and we have been eagerly awaiting them for several years at EU level."
"I do not therefore understand why funding for the entire project is being withheld, all the more so since this is the only project which the Audy report singles out in this way."
"(SK) Mr President, I voted for the report, but concern remains over the public funding of embryonic cell research."
"According to the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice, embryonic cells are considered to be human embryos, and therefore beings from which life arises."
"These cells, since they represent the first stage of the human life they will become, must be legally defined as embryos, the patenting of which must be ruled out."
"On the basis of this statement, the European Commission should immediately take into account the decisions and conclusions of the European Court of Justice and adapt its policies on the funding of science and research to them."
"(DA) Mr President, today, we voted through the last in a long line of free trade agreement texts."
"Fortunately, Parliament is, on the whole, still in favour of free trade, and that also applies to the agreement with Canada."
"However, the demand for sector-specific analyses comes up again and again."
"The impact assessment for the EU-Canada agreement indicates clear benefits for both sides."
"Sector-specific analyses are simply a way of looking for a reason to say no, because the truth is there will always be both winners and losers."
"It is our responsibility to do what is best for the majority."
"Free trade is best for consumers as it provides greater choice and lower prices."
"It is best for businesses because it extends their market and creates growth and jobs."
"Free trade is the international division of labour, ensuring that we all do what we are best at, while allowing everyone else to do what they are best at."
"(DE) Mr President, of course I welcome any trade agreement between two countries or businesses because, if correctly managed, world trade can help improve living standards and contribute to progress."
"On the other hand, I always worry that the large number of bilateral agreements will cause us to lose sight of the overall picture and that we will end up with a patchwork of agreements that makes it hard to achieve a genuine agreement within the framework of the WTO."
"For me, bilateral agreements are always the second best option."
"The best option really would be to continue with trade talks in the context of WTO negotiations and to conclude the agreements that world trade is waiting for and that the global economy desperately needs."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an incontrovertible fact that the rating agencies have now amassed huge and unchecked power."
"Their initial function was to provide valuable information to investors, but over time, they have morphed into supreme and uncontrollable arbiters of the international financial markets."
"In my view, it is unacceptable that businesses and even Member States are subject to the judgments of three large American companies, whose ratings have not always been correct and indeed have, at times, led to astonishing blunders, as in the Lehman Brothers affair."
"Greater controls are therefore to be welcomed and I hope that the new European authority will manage to operate at optimum capacity, with real powers to intervene and even to issue penalties where necessary."
"I also believe that it is a fine idea to introduce the principle of civil liability in situations of obvious negligence."
"Greater competition is required in the sector and we must break up this historic oligopoly and try to bring in new, independent and possibly European organisations, which would therefore have a proper awareness of the economic context and reality of our continent, which is entirely different from the way of thinking in the United States."
"For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the report in question."
"(LT) Mr President, I am delighted with the document adopted today on guaranteeing independent impact assessments (IAs)."
"IAs are the basis of the legislative process."
"I feel that the effective independence of IAs must become a general principle, applied to all types of IAs, particularly environmental impact assessments."
"A guarantee of the implementation of this principle should also be contained in the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which is likely to be reviewed in the near future."
"I am pleased that the proposals in the Committee on the Environment, for which I provided amendments, concern environmental impact assessments, which really is crucially important."
"The European Commission must also play a more active role in defending the interests of the European Union and its Member States in cases where projects being undertaken by third countries may have an impact on the European Union or on one or several of its Member States."
"I believe that this document is a step towards ensuring security for us all."
"(DA) Mr President, I would very much like to speak on this subject, as I think it is somewhat absurd that we are laying down provisions on CSR here."
"It is all well and good that we can presumably all agree only to enter into free trade agreements and partnerships with countries that respect human rights."
"That is actually already in the Treaty."
"However, I think some politicians have forgotten what CSR stands for."
"It stands for corporate social responsibility."
"Thus, it is a question of what enterprises do on their own account over and above complying with the legislation."
"This is used as a competitive parameter in business, thus creating a drive for enterprises themselves to keep on improving this aspect of their business."
"If we come along and steal this away and turn it into political legislation, we completely remove this competitive parameter, and that - if I may say so - is sheer political stupidity."
"(IT) Mr President, the external dimension of social policy includes all the European Union's actions and initiatives to promote labour and social standards in non-member countries."
"Even though both the Treaty of Lisbon and the Europe 2020 strategy attributed an unprecedented level of importance to social policy, the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues."
"However, it is becoming ever clearer that we need to stop concentrating strictly on the markets and instead take a more holistic interest in people, which means protecting them, the rights of workers and the right to work."
"The European Union must make it a long-term goal to be able to ensure that men and women have the chance to gain dignified and productive employment, in conditions of freedom, equality, safety and dignity."
"In future, it will therefore be necessary for Parliament and international and European trade unions to work together and add their positive and urgent recommendations to the initiative voted on here today."
"(FI) Mr President, I supported the report because European business enterprises are of especially great importance in international trade."
"We always have to act in accordance with European values and international social and labour standards, even in third countries."
"Corporate social responsibility is only useful as a voluntary exercise if consumers are given reliable and accurate information on the activities of companies, the origin of products and the conditions under which goods are produced and sold."
"Certificates, brands and standards are important for consumers, and image and reputation are directly linked to a company's success."
"In the age of social media, it is difficult to hide information from consumers on a company's practices abroad."
"Responsible entrepreneurship is always the backbone of competitiveness and successful business."
"The European Union, too, must be a pioneer in the promotion of social standards."
"I think that the notion of corporate responsibility should be included in all EU policy and trade agreements."
"(SK) Mr President, it may be an interesting venture to support and promote social responsibility in external relations."
"It concerns me that we are not going as far as we might in our activities."
"Social responsibility must be focused on the poorest, on those at the margins of society, on those who have no qualifications and who are most exposed to manipulation."
"In short, it must be focused on those who are furthest from the labour market."
"The French programme on learning and working together, initiated by the organisation ATD Quart Monde and the French state, is a fine example of a solid enterprise preserving the authentic social responsibility of a partnership with the most disadvantaged workers."
"In this way, the Union can bring real added value to the policy."
"(IT) Mr President, 2011 offers a strategic opportunity to draw the lessons from the four years that the regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation has been in force."
"Since its entry into force, the main problem which has emerged seems to be the difficulty in understanding or accepting the specific role of development cooperation in the context of the European Union's external action."
"We therefore need to clarify the fact that development cooperation is the one policy area of external action, besides humanitarian aid, which has not been designed to serve EU interests, but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations on this planet."
"Through today's vote, we will underline the need for a separate development cooperation instrument that specifically and exclusively targets developing countries and expressly pursues the objectives laid down in Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
"To conclude, Mr President, we are asking, in particular, for the delegated acts procedure to be used when taking decisions on general objectives, priority areas and expected results, as well as the allocation of funds which fulfil the criteria of Article 290 of the TFEU."
"(PL) Mr President, despite the fact that the European Parliament has repeatedly acknowledged the advantages that would be conferred upon the Internal Market by improvements to the framework of contract law, the introduction of a new system of contract law using an optional instrument has encountered a series of major problems, in terms of both substance and procedure."
"Above all, the proposals put forward reflect the Commission's position, which is not supported by the substance of public debate."
"We do not know the positions held by the individual Member States, or those held by consumer and business representatives."
"Diverging legal interpretations may result from the lack of clarity of some of the proposed documents, which will be used as a basis for judicial decisions."
"Finally, the introduction of an optional instrument would have a significant economic impact on businesses and consumers."
"There may be very high costs associated with the necessary training, the replacement of standard contract forms and possible court proceedings."
"In my opinion, it is unwise to impose additional financial burdens on businesses at a time of economic difficulty."
"On the basis of the above, I voted in favour of rejecting the report."
"(IT) Mr President, the possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in today's strongly globalised economy."
"As far as education and vocational training are concerned, the key factors listed in the European strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level and in the Member States."
"The projections suggest that the demand for skills will continue to rise."
"Industrial and technological change increases the need for workers with high and intermediate skill levels, but low-skilled labour is, conversely, being squeezed out."
"Therefore, especially where young people are concerned, action needs to be taken quickly: the continuing rise in youth unemployment is one of the most important challenges facing Europe."
"To attain these goals, we believe it is essential for education and vocational training to continue to be treated as a long-term common political priority, which can be translated into reality only with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders, the EU institutions and those involved at local and regional level."
"Mr President, I voted against the Hirsch report as it fundamentally sees education not as a means by which people can improve their knowledge and skills, but solely as a tool for increasing the profits of big business."
"I completely reject that approach."
"The report claims that the implementation of the EU 2020 goals is a way to secure employment and a better standard of living."
"This is simply untrue."
"The EU 2020 strategy will deliver neither jobs nor a better standard of living."
"It offers more neoliberal policies and a race to the bottom in wages and conditions."
"This report disgracefully calls for employers to be able to terminate apprenticeship contracts should the apprentices be deemed unsuited to their employment."
"That is a recipe for gross exploitation."
"I reject the call for the increased involvement of private higher-education institutions in the expansion of vocational training and instead demand meaningful training opportunities provided through massive public investment."
"(FI) Mr President, I supported the report because youth unemployment is a challenge facing the whole of Europe, and one that is troubling all of society."
"It is also behind the unrest in the southern Mediterranean countries."
"In the prosperous societies of the Nordic countries, youth unemployment is visible, for example, as exclusion and an increase in substance use among adolescents."
"Youth is all about mobility and changing jobs."
"Youth unemployment is serious when young people have no access to work of any kind because they are poorly educated or lack work experience, nor are young people lacking in a proper education or work experience in a strong position when competing for jobs."
"That is why we have to focus our energy on providing wide-ranging, high-quality education and, furthermore, pay attention to the perspective of gender, so that the underlying causes of youth unemployment can be eliminated."
"We should also remember the role of further training because it is that which promotes lifelong learning and prepares people for changes in the labour market."
"(IT) Mr President, it is highly significant that Parliament is using this resolution to send a strong message to both the Member States and the younger generations to ask for greater commitment to European cooperation on learning, vocational training and higher education in order to bolster the Europe 2020 strategy."
"We know that youth unemployment has severe repercussions on poverty and social exclusion, as does the prolonged period of insecurity in which 40% of European young people live."
"Strong backing should be given to a combination of education policies and a new incentive-based welfare system for enterprises that provide full-time employment for young people and women."
"Ensuring that the skills being learned are in line with the competences - including for citizenship - required for the new goals of sustainable and intelligent growth is essential, as are policies for the transition from education to the workplace and speeding up the recognition of professional qualifications, titles and academic credits."
"Those Member States which, like my own, are cutting resources for education and research at a time of crisis must know that they are hurting young people, and hurting the future of Europe."
"(ET) Mr President, I was involved in the preparation of the report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and indeed, unemployment in Europe is high, but unemployment among the young is, on average, twice as high."
"There are Member States in which the figure is even higher, such as my home country, where it is actually three times higher."
"I support the initiatives in the report as practical steps to turn this situation around towards improvement."
"We do not see the sense in training a large number of people who have been in higher education but who then do not find any use for it in the labour market."
"We must concentrate more on vocational training and retraining."
"What is completely unacceptable, however, is the action taken by the Council on education in terms of budget cuts."
"Their actions are also incompatible with the fulfilment of the Europe 2020 strategy, which has already been adopted."
"They are not putting their money where their mouth is."
"I voted for the adoption of the report. Thank you."
"(GA) Mr President, I also voted in favour of this report, especially since it is estimated that there will be 15 million jobs available to people who have tertiary qualifications between now and 2020."
"At the same time, it is estimated that there will be 12 million fewer jobs for people who have no qualification or a very poor one."
"Therefore, something must be done about this and there is evidently a great need for education and training."
"Twenty-one per cent of young people across Europe are out of work and it is therefore important that they remain in education until they, too, have a suitable qualification and that there be collaboration between colleges and business so that those qualifications are suitable."
"In addition, it is important that there be independent evaluation of those qualifications."
"If all those things are done, we can solve this problem in the future."
"(IT) Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important piece of work that allows us to set out a new financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe."
"We need a budget that is designed for the challenges of the present day and that can provide a strong and innovative response to current needs."
"Its top priority must be research and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, to stimulate growth and employment, while the second objective is to reform the common agricultural policy in order to promote and support the competitiveness of agriculture in Europe."
"However, particular attention should be paid to the future of the cohesion policy, which I consider to be a very important instrument and one which provides financial support for investments that drive economic growth and, above all, the creation of new jobs."
"On this subject, I would like to revisit a point that I think is particularly important: the establishment of a new intermediate category."
"I believe, of course, that this new category cannot be created by siphoning off resources from existing ones, which are essential for supporting the balanced, harmonious and sustainable growth of our communities."
"(FI) Mr President, this extremely important report was adopted, and I would like to mention just a few details."
"The first is Amendment 18, tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which states that some fairly precise cuts can be made under the common agricultural policy, according to the kinds of current reforms that exist."
"In other words, we get a clear picture of the ALDE Group's view of agricultural policy, although it has been worded very cleverly."
"The obvious and basic premise here is that agricultural policy is what is to be cut, if we have to cut anything."
"The other important point, on which I voted differently from my group, was Amendment 37d, which originally points to the significant savings that could be made if the European Parliament were to have a single seat."
"There is no point arguing about that: savings will be made."
"It does not make any difference, no matter how we vote: we know that savings will be made."
"I would hope that here at long last, people understand that the public is really tired of savings being made that concern them but not savings that concern us."
"This cannot be explained away to the public and nothing will be improved by voting on it."
"Savings will be made and we have to make them."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the Union because, at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so-called European spirit, I am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the Union with credible instruments, beginning with adequate funding."
"The request for a 5% increase in the next budget is therefore just and necessary."
"Perhaps it will not be enough, but it is essential in order to provide answers to the big questions that lie ahead: these resources are needed to tackle real problems, such as greater cohesion between the regions, a greater capacity for research and innovation, and a greater capacity to generate growth and provide jobs."
"Without adequate resources, none of these problems will be properly dealt with, beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy, which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place."
"That is why I voted in favour and I hope that the Commission and the Council will follow the recommendations of the report."
"(PL) Mr President, the economic crisis, demographic problems and growing unemployment are having a significant impact on the budgetary constraints of the Member States."
"A European budget providing opportunities for long-term planning should therefore be a tool which promotes the growth of the individual countries' economies."
"The Europe 2020 strategy, which stimulates job creation and promotes social integration, is, to my mind, a key component in helping countries exit the crisis."
"In this context, it is particularly important for its scope to cover small and medium-sized enterprises as well."
"I therefore agree with the proposal to ensure greater support for all programmes and instruments supporting these businesses, including programmes aimed at competitiveness, innovation and use of the Structural Funds."
"Maintaining competitiveness, increasing economic growth and fighting unemployment will be the greatest challenges faced by the EU."
"I would therefore like to highlight the urgent need to support growth through investment in knowledge-based economic sectors."
"Strengthening the link between education, scientific research and employment will promote integration, mobility and specialisation."
"(IT) Mr President, I am speaking to express my satisfaction as well as to explain my reasons for voting in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, which somehow manages to set out serious and effectives goals which contribute to strengthening the cohesion policy."
"I do have one doubt, which we have expressed by voting to adopt the amendment removing the wording on the creation of an intermediate category for cohesion policies in those parts of Europe where gross domestic product (GDP) falls to between 75% and 90% of EU GDP."
"This really concerns us, not because we do not believe that the focus of the cohesion policy should be extended, but because we think that without additional resources, this extension risks depriving and reducing the resources for the areas referred to in Objective 1 - the so-called convergence objective - which need just as much attention and support from the European Union."
"To sum up, I am pleased with the report and I am pleased with the work that has been done, but I have some concerns about the attention that we seem to have paid to a policy that could have confirmed the so-called 'facing-out', as we are used to seeing."
"(SK) Mr President, the contents of the new Multiannual Financial Framework must present a clear vision of the future of the Union and its citizens."
"The current economic and social challenges that we face need to be reflected not only in impressive speeches but, first and foremost, in concrete budget chapters."
"Whether we look at the current difficulties and ambitions of the EU and its regions from a regional or a global perspective, the most pressing issues remain the energy shortage, the slowdown in economic growth and unemployment."
"We must therefore still regard the development and innovation of European energy infrastructure as priority areas that need considerably more funding."
"In my opinion, a return to coal-burning is not, in the current environmental context, a solution for the future or for the creation of a fully-fledged trans-European transport network."
"These two areas are an essential precondition for developing the competitiveness of the EU as a whole and for the operation of the Internal Market and, as such, they deserve particular attention when drafting the budget."
"Firstly, I welcome the commitment in the report to at least maintaining the CAP and cohesion funding at present levels in the next perspective."
"There was much controversy in our group as well about the intermediate category, and it was decided to have a free vote."
"It does not affect my colleagues in Ireland or ourselves at all because even though we are in the IMF - and we are broke as a country - we are well above the European average in GDP terms; so whether there is an intermediate category or not does not affect us."
"However, we do think that there is a need for a fundamental appraisal of cohesion policy going forward because, as more and more regions go above the 75% threshold, the policy is either going to become redundant or be reformed, and that is what we expect to happen."
"Written explanations of vote"
"The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU."
"Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further."
"There is no denying that technically securing borders will not automatically make them secure as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system."
"Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area."
"For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately."
"I am voting for this report, given the positive results of the evaluations carried out on both countries to establish whether they meet the requirements of the Schengen acquis."
"Whilst both Romania and Bulgaria are currently ready to open their borders, although the Bulgaria-Greece border is very sensitive, Bulgaria needs to take additional measures and a tripartite approach common to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey needs to be adopted."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution on the application of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania."
"I agree with the rapporteur's position that, although there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future, they do not constitute an obstacle to full Schengen membership for these two Member States."
"The inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen area is very important both for these countries, their economic growth and investment development, and for the whole of the European Union, for increasing integrity and solidarity among Member States."
"I voted in favour of the report on Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area."
"This is the second time that Bulgaria and Romania's application of the Schengen provisions has been examined; the first assessment took place in 2010."
"Let us bear in mind that Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis (data protection, Schengen Information System, air, land and sea borders, police cooperation and visas) when they joined the European Union in 2007."
"Now, however, all Member States need to agree on their effective participation in the area without internal borders."
"For its part, the European Parliament has been consulted."
"Schengen cooperation started on 14 June 1985, with the Schengen Agreement, allowing for the abolition of systematic border controls at the internal borders of the signatory states and for the creation of a common area, with free movement of persons."
"Currently, free movement is guaranteed on a territory with 42 673 km of external sea and 7 721 km of land borders, covering 25 countries and 400 million citizens."
"Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus only partially apply the Schengen acquis at the moment and checks are therefore still carried out at the borders with these three Member States."
"Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the EU in 2007."
"Taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by teams of experts, the European Parliament and the Council have concluded that, although there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up, they do not constitute an obstacle to full Schengen membership for these two Member States."
"I support the proposal that Bulgaria and Romania should inform the European Parliament and the Council, in writing in the course of a six-month period, of further action that they intend to take as regards recommendations, submitted in assessment reports and mentioned in subsequent reports, which have yet to be implemented."
"Since the Schengen Agreement was concluded in 1985, its five founding states have expanded to 25, 22 of which are European Union Member States."
"Schengen enabled the abolition of internal border checks between signatory states and the creation of a single external border where border checks on entry to the Schengen area are carried out."
"Bulgaria and Romania adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the European Union in 2007."
"On the basis of the results of the evaluations and of the monitoring visits carried out, the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, has reached the conclusion that all the conditions necessary for the application of all parts of the Schengen acquis have been met: specifically, checks at the land, sea and air borders, police cooperation, visas, connection to the Schengen Information System (SIS), and data protection."
"These countries should become full members of the Schengen area."
"This is an important step forward for these countries, as well as a strengthening of European citizenship."
"I am therefore voting for this report, and would congratulate the rapporteur."
"I voted for this initiative because Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the EU in 2007."
"Following the relevant expert evaluations, and in spite of the fact that there are still some problems to be resolved, both countries have shown they are prepared to implement the provisions of the Schengen acquis and can therefore fully accede to it."
"This is a very important report concerning not only my country, Bulgaria, but also the European Union as a whole."
"I am confident that our efforts will be rewarded very soon."
"Our borders have been ready for some time to defend Europe's borders."
"However, the decision which was so greatly expected has still not been forthcoming."
"I believe that the motive for this is completely political."
"The report also refers to the inspections carried out at our border with Turkey, which meet the Schengen requirements and prove our readiness."
"I sincerely hope that this report will be voted for at the next session of the European Council because the faster we move on this issue, the more we will all gain - politically, economically and socially."
"I voted against the full application of the Schengen measures in Romania and Bulgaria."
"Notwithstanding the generally positive judgment on the progress made by these two Member States in terms of security, the report itself admits that numerous technical and administrative shortcomings were detected in the bodies tasked with ensuring the border security of both States and, in particular, in the bodies tasked with checking and monitoring sea and land borders."
"Secondly, the report acknowledges that if the two countries were included in the Schengen area, their geographical position next to the Turkish border would create two new routes for illegal migrants who currently only head for Greece, which, at this precise moment, is the only Schengen State in the Balkan peninsula."
"The admission of Romania and Bulgaria would therefore considerably increase the size of the EU's south-eastern Achilles heel and cause a threefold increase in the pressure it currently faces."
"The draft resolution therefore flies directly in the face of the citizen's need for protection - which Lega Nord has always put at the core of its programme - and I cannot support it."
"The decision on admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area now remains a purely political one."
"The report supporting Romania's inclusion in this area, adopted by the European Parliament, only serves to confirm that the opinions of the Union's experts are correct - Romania has done a good job, made its borders secure and fulfilled all the required conditions."
"The opinion of Parliament in Brussels is advisory and now, as in the past, the decision lies in the hands of the Council's politicians."
"Applying double standards and talking about mandatory criteria which, once they have been met, are regarded as 'only technical' is not at all characteristic of a democratic, fair Union, as we know it."
"This is why I can only hope that the opinions of the experts and those of the European legislative will not continue to be ignored by politicians from Member States."
"Hiding behind words without resolving the matter directly can no longer be an option when admission to the Schengen area has never been a political problem, but a technical one."
"The assessments of the independent experts and those of Parliament, which voted overwhelmingly in favour of Romania's integration into Schengen, should count as a crucial factor in the European Council and, consequently, the procedure should be unblocked."
"The Schengen area and, in particular, freedom of movement, is an acquis communautaire that genuinely means something to our citizens."
"President Barroso reminded us that 'freedom of movement is to Europe what foundations are to a building'."
"Free movement is one of the Union's greatest achievements."
"I am delighted that Parliament has approved Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area."
"Huge efforts have been made to guarantee border security: their fourth generation surveillance systems are far more impressive than our second generation models."
"Yet there are still barriers to the free movement of workers: firstly, legal and administrative obstacles that affect all aspects of citizens' lives; secondly, social dumping: although Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guarantees equal treatment for workers, the work of the Committee on Petitions proves that the reality is quite different; thirdly, social protection, which varies from one country to the next and so does not encourage mobility."
"I would therefore like to propose a minimum basic social protection for the Union."
"Although social protection falls under the competence of the Member States, the lack of harmonisation is clearly damaging the Internal Market."
"in writing. - I voted against the Schengen acquis being extended to encompass Bulgaria and Romania simply because I do not think provisions have been made to make sure they adjoin the passport-free area safely and effectively."
"Corruption and organised crime are still rife in these countries which are also portals for illegal immigration."
"Sex trafficking, child prostitution, trafficking of children and managed criminal gangs would all potentially flourish under open border conditions and not enough has been done to curb these crimes in these Member States."
"I voted in favour of Mr Coelho's report on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania."
"We should congratulate the two Member States on the work that they have done."
"Both States have met the criteria for the full application of the Schengen acquis."
"Nevertheless, this report emphasises that the region includes one of the Union's most vulnerable external borders in terms of illegal immigration."
"Bulgaria will have to implement transitional measures when it enters Schengen."
"Both States will have to cooperate fully so as not to jeopardise a system which depends on mutual trust between the Member States."
"I support the rapporteur's position."
"As Bulgaria and Romania meet the requirements for accession to the Schengen area, I welcome its expansion to include them."
"However, I think these additional measures and the solutions given to the shortcomings mentioned are important, not least as regards the illegal immigration phenomena recorded in Bulgaria because of its peripheral geographical location."
"The proper functioning of the free circulation of people, products, services and labour will depend on the robustness and harmonisation of policies on external borders, as that is the only way to preserve social peace and economic stability within the Union."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"Some Member States, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, want to change the rules of the game."
"However it is not reasonable to add other criteria such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime."
"These issues are undoubtedly important, but the proposal is purely politically motivated."
"Adding new criteria would create a two-tier system for the Member States."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report on the grounds that such moves are important to reaffirm European solidarity at a time when it is being severely put to the test."
"The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU."
"Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further."
"There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system."
"Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area."
"For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately."
"Today's vote in the European Parliament has highlighted that Romania is ready to apply the Schengen acquis."
"According to the rapporteur Mr Coelho, all the shortcomings which were identified in the past have been successfully rectified by the Romanian authorities."
"Romania is capable of providing proper protection, whether at its air, sea or land borders."
"This is why I find it regrettable that there are still doubts about our readiness to apply the acquis and that some Member States continue to protect their so-called 'national security' by putting unjustified obstacles in the way of a Member State which has earned its right to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner."
"The European Parliament has spoken today with one voice about fairness."
"For how much longer is the Council going to continue ignoring our position?"
"The evaluations and additional visits by expert teams have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Mr Coelho."
"The rapporteur, who has been monitoring this area over several sessions of Parliament, believes that although there remain unresolved issues that justify regular monitoring, these do not constitute an obstacle to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area."
"Given his experience in this area, I believe I can safely endorse his evaluation, and his demands for external border security."
"The decision to open borders to these Member States will provide improved freedom of movement and, on a more practical level, will enable Bulgarians and Romanians to feel more integrated with a Union of which they are fully-fledged members."
"I hope that the symbolism of the moment will also translate into greater fluidity of trade between countries, and into the handling of immigration and security issues in a more integrated way."
"The rapporteur rightly warns of the sensitivity of the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece region in terms of illegal immigration."
"I agree with him when he points to the need for Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area, and an approach to combating a potential sharp increase in migration pressure common to Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria."
"This report, drafted by our fellow Member, Mr Coelho, concerns the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania."
"The Schengen Agreement was concluded on 14 June 1985."
"By abolishing checks at the internal borders of signatory countries and creating a common area, it made the free movement of people and goods throughout the European Union possible."
"Given that Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis in 2007; that the documents show both Bulgaria and Romania are ready for EU accession from a technical point of view; that all the accession headings were met in March 2011; and that the delay in the adoption of the new Schengen evaluation system to minimise existing problems - I fear that insecurity will increase - cannot prevent the entry of these countries into the EU, I am voting in favour."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done in drawing up this report, despite the obstacles the Council placed in the way of accessing certain documentation considered essential to achieving this."
"Verification that new Member States meet the conditions necessary for the full application of the Schengen acquis is a precondition for the adoption of the Council decision to abolish border checks at internal borders, after it has consulted the European Parliament."
"In this case, the report considers all the conditions for abolishing border checks with Bulgaria and Romania to have been met."
"The decision to include these countries, which joined the EU in 2007, in the Schengen area will have to be taken unanimously in the Council by the governments of all the countries already belonging to Schengen."
"The rapporteur mentions the need for additional measures to be taken on the Bulgaria-Greece-Turkey border, which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration."
