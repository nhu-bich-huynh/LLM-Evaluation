"Text"
"And finally, the Charter."
"I gather that the document was well-received at Biarritz and that it can be adopted following a number of legal clarifications and subject to an official declaration at the Summit in Nice, to be incorporated at a later stage in the Treaties."
"In my opinion, the Convention did sterling work and I am proud to have been part of this Convention."
"The sooner the document can be incorporated in the Treaties, the better, because in that way, the Treaties will gain a constitutional dimension and the citizens will be drawn closer to Europe, because it will mean that a piece of legislation specifically for their benefit has got off the ground."
"Mr President, Mr Moscovici, Commissioner Barnier, although no progress was made at the Biarritz summit in the area of essential structural reform of the Union, I have faith in the ability of France, as the country holding the Presidency of the Council, under the leadership of her innovative President Chirac, to pilot structural solutions too in a direction which will cause the stream of development to continue to flow and which is acceptable to all at Nice also."
"However, we have to express our concern that there were cries of defiance in certain matters."
"The impression that spread to the citizens of Europe via the media was that there was conflict between the small and large countries."
"The Union cannot develop as a Community of 27 members if we cling to the notion that it is mainly a system of intergovernmental cooperation in which the Union' s bodies are merely responsible for implementation or control matters in a very loose way."
"Already there are numerous examples of how just one country can obstruct matters which almost all countries consider to be important."
"It is the large countries just as much as the small that bear the responsibility for this sort of thing."
"Examples include the European company, the pan-European liberalisation and privatisation of the postal services, which is stumbling along, the opening-up of competition in the energy sector or the commencement of the harmonisation of taxation."
"A cautionary example of inappropriate behaviour is offered surprisingly by Austria, which has just experienced unjust treatment itself, as that country is warning its neighbour, the Czech Republic, against using its nuclear power plant at Temelin."
"The Union does not now need visionaries with tunnel vision leading up to the year 2030, but problem-solvers that can see the problems that enlargement over the next 3 to 8 years will bring with it, and see the solutions to them."
"Solutions have to be found within the circle of the Union' s institutions through the discovery of a more flexible approach, if necessary by empowering part of the Union to engage in more essential cooperation, by strengthening the position of the Commission, and by switching in the main to a system of qualified majority decisions."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights proudly conveys what European values are, but it is fruitless to create an artificial controversy with regard to its rapid and binding constitutionality."
"In this too it is time which must bring decisions to maturity, for example, among ourselves in the Nordic countries."
"Thank you, Mr President. I would like to make some brief comments to set the seal on this debate, but first want to thank each of the speakers, to whom I have listened very attentively, for the quality of their interventions and their candour."
"To put it briefly, everybody has touched on the 'larger states and smaller states' debate, and I would like to join Mr Moscovici in saying that I feel that this is an inappropriate way of describing the division that exists."
"It is not that we are unaware of this division or act as if it did not exist."
"I simply feel that we have to move beyond and rise above it by means of proposals that ensure a more efficient functioning of the Community model in the spirit of the Treaty of Rome."
"On an issue that I regard as critical - that of the Commission itself - I have heard Mr Van den Bos echo the concerns of Mr Poettering regarding the place that is to be occupied by one or other country within the Commission."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, none of the options that are on the table would entail a country 'losing its Commissioner' , even if I feel that this to be an inappropriate description if one recalls that the Commission is an independent body."
"Under every option, each country will have at least one Commissioner."
"The question we must answer is whether all the countries will have a Commissioner at the same time, and thus whether we are to have a big - and one day a very big - Commission that will inevitably have been restructured, or if they are all to have one Commissioner but not necessarily at the same time."
"In the latter case, the question we must answer is when will this principle of a rotation which treats both larger and smaller states on a strictly equal basis come into effect."
"Each option has significant consequences."
"Whatever the scenario, there will therefore be a major reform of the way that the Commission operates, and I feel that we must in the coming weeks make careful use of the time still available to us in order to assess the implications of each option before taking a decision at Nice, the aim being, I would repeat, to preserve within an enlarged Europe the effectiveness, credibility and if possible collegiate nature of the Commission."
"A further word on the Charter. The Commission has been an active participant in the open discussions entered into via the Convention."
"I am thinking in particular of my friend and fellow Commissioner, Antonio Vitorino, who was very active throughout these discussions."
"I would point out that right from the start the Commission indicated that it was in favour of the idea of giving legal effect to this Charter."
"Personally speaking, I feel that the minimum could be, to echo what Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mrs Berès have said, a link with Article 6 of the Treaty, which could be established as soon as Nice."
"I nevertheless feel that we cannot stop there and that we must take things further after Nice."
"Mr Berthu talked about this Charter as if it were a thunderbolt that had dropped out of the sky."
"All the same, we did make reference to the intelligent and open work that culminated in this Charter, in which national parliaments representing national opinions participated."
"The national governments participated fully and have all approved this text."
"We are thus talking about an open piece of work which has not fallen from on high or been imposed from above."
"That is why in the final analysis it has met with general approval."
"Both Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Barón Crespo have mentioned the European Parliament."
"I would like, in my turn, to confirm that we will be talking about Parliament during these negotiations."
"It is one of the points that have been broached in the discussions and I honestly feel that, beyond what we are able to achieve in the negotiations themselves, anything that the European Parliament itself can quite clearly say on the way it is to be structured after enlargement will be very useful to us because it will enlighten our work and the work of the Member States."
"Finally, a word on the Biarritz spirit or climate: Mr Dupuis has surely misunderstood what I said."
"I am not of aware of having shown myself to be overoptimistic."
"In any case, I spoke of purpose and determination."
"I do not yet know whether we will achieve real reform at Nice, and one sufficient for a Union that has 27 Member States and quite clearly may subsequently have many more, provided that the democratic process in the Balkans is consolidated and strengthened."
"In any event, the Commission has its place and is striving to secure genuine reform."
"I simply said, Mr Dupuis, that success or failure, genuine reform or inadequate reform, would be assessed on the basis of whether the Community model - which does indeed, Mr Moscovici comprise the three institutions you mentioned, but others too - would emerge from Nice weakened, intact or strengthened."
"We are striving to strengthen it, and this is a way of allaying the concerns of many Member States, and not just the smaller Member States, on the place and the role that they will occupy within this Community model."
"I have specifically mentioned some of the factors that will enable us to ascertain immediately whether the reform is sufficient or not."
"The extension of qualified majority voting and codecision to real issues, the preservation of Article 250 in its current form, the place and role of the Commission in closer cooperation, in respect of more than just the first pillar: these are some of the factors that will allow us see straight away whether we are talking of success or failure."
"On this point I must make it quite clear that I totally agree with what Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos have just said."
"Lastly, as Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Poettering have just suggested, I believe that we must indeed raise the debate to the political level and the correct level, that of the final decision, which is to say the level of Heads of State and Government."
"I am personally very pleased that the discussions at Biarritz were marked by the desire to come up with genuine reform."
"This was my impression at least."
"My interpretation of the climate and the weather at Biarritz might well have differed from that of Mr Moscovici, who doubtless knows the Pyrenees better than I do. It was cloudy and it was windy, but what I really wanted to emphasise was the tone of the debates, and their invigorating and purposeful nature."
"This was what struck me personally, and gives me some confidence that there will be genuine results at Nice."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for her intervention."
"I can reassure her and state that we, like the Presidency, are determined to press ahead on the basis of the proposals made by Mrs de Palacio concerning European energy policy in the areas of reserves and conservation and support for renewable sources of energy, not least during the negotiations which we have just been talking about in the context of the IGC on the extension of qualified majority voting in environmental matters."
"The Commission is striving to make progress, is doing its job, on all these issues. I know that in this matter, just as in the matter of maritime safety which I mentioned earlier, which was discussed at some length at the Nice European Council, we can count on the resolve of the current French Presidency of the Union."
"That concludes the debate."
"I have received seven motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will be taken on Wednesday."
"Constitutionalisation of the Treaties - Reinforced cooperation - Island status"
"The next item is the joint debate on the:"
"Report (A5-0289/2000) by Mr Duhamel, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on constitutionalisation of the Treaties (2000/2160(INI));"
"Report (A5-0288/2000) by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on reinforced cooperation (2000/2162(INI));"
"Oral Question to the Council (B5-0542/2000) pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure, by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on Article 158 of the EC Treaty concerning island status;"
"Oral Question to the Commission (B5-0543/2000) pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure, by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on Article 158 of the EC Treaty concerning island status."
"Mr President, first of all, I wish to thank Jacques, Jacques Delors, and also Altiero Spinelli and Fernand Herman, I wish to thank everyone, from Vaclav Havel to Carlo Ciampi, from Joschka Fischer to Jacques Chirac, from Michel Barnier to Pierre Moscovici, from Chris Patten to Costa Simitis, not to mention Florence and the plethora of current Members of the European Parliament who, since 1999, have carried forward the great movement in favour of an European constitution."
"My thanks go to everyone from Jo and Giorgio to Iñigo, from Dany to Frassoni, from Richard to Elmar, from Bayrou to Andrew."
"Thanks to you all, a new idea is gaining ground on the continent of Europe: the idea of a European Constitution."
"The concept of a constitution is a new idea for Europe, while at the same time a very old idea, dating back to the origins of the modern age and connecting us with the most profound debates on democracy."
"To the right of us, we have Joseph de Maistre, the counter-revolutionary thinker, who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of a constitution, because a constitution is made - shock, horror! - by man and - surprise, surprise - for man."
"""But man does not exist"" , he said, specifying that he had met many a Spaniard or a Frenchman and even perhaps a Persian, but ""I have never met man."
"If he does exist, it has escaped my notice"" ."
"To the left of us, we have Karl Marx, the revolutionary thinker, who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of human rights, because, in his view, the human does not exist in the abstract, and humanity could not constitute anything at all."
"At the beginning of the twenty-first century, criticisms of these two kinds are still being levelled and, sometimes, there is nothing to separate the two."
"Nor, sometimes, is there any difference between the crimes and acts of inhumanity committed by men in denial of other persons' dignity."
"The lessons we have learnt from the twentieth century, however, is if we see people everywhere only as French, Germans, Danish, Irish, Arabs, Hutus, Tutsis, Serbs, Bosnians and Persians, we end up forgetting our common humanity."
"Without this fundamental point of reference, at best there is mutual lack of understanding and at worst there is mutual killing."
"The British and the Irish, the Serbs and the Croats, the Israelis and the Palestinians, the peoples on both sides can only exist if, as a precondition, human beings exist."
"Taking away their humanity to leave only their nationality is to take away the person. Then they are lost."
"They cannot accept the other as being the same."
"All they see is the enemy, and they destroy each other."
"As you know, the European Community was born out of rejection of this destruction."
"We have managed to avoid war for fifty-five years!"
"Strasbourg is a place that appreciates the importance of this record."
"This achievement within the Western half of Europe is something we wish to extend to the whole continent."
"Enlargement will guarantee this."
"With peace guaranteed, Western Europe has started to attend to business in search of prosperity."
"Let us not criticise commercial Europe too much, I speak as a Socialist: it provides greater wealth to all of us."
"Yet the European Union should not be described as just one large marketplace, it has other purposes as declared in the Treaties: European integration, freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, fundamental social rights."
"Peace, prosperity, democracy and justice are values which, each in their own way, virtually all the Members and the groups in Parliament, and the majority of elected representatives and political groups wish to see achieved by Europe and for Europe."
"Democracy in Europe is in better health."
"Thirty years ago, great countries in the South of Europe lived under dictatorship, and Eastern Europe was subsisting under the yoke of the Soviet Union."
"Today, we have just experienced one of the last democratic revolutions in Europe, that of October 2000 in Serbia."
"We feel sure that, very soon, we will be joined by a democratic Serbia."
"What better evidence of the European Union than this association between the victory of democracy and entry into the great family of the Community!"
"Democracy in Europe is in good health, but European democracy is in a bad way."
"One in two European citizens did not vote in the elections of June 1999."
"It is not something that we are about to forget."
"One in two of my students does not know who Romano Prodi is, although they are almost all quite clear on Michael Schumacher or Monica Lewinsky."
"That tells us something about how far politics in general have decayed, and just how distant the European institutions are from the citizens of Europe."
"Some resign themselves to this state of affairs, and others are delighted at it, but not us."
"That is why we want to see European democracy being strengthened by a European constitution."
"What do we actually have right now?"
"We seem to have almost everything, yet in the finally analysis we have nothing."
"Seven Treaties, hundreds of articles, an impossible tangle of standards, preferences, regulations, procedures, core legislation and secondary legislation."
"The European Constitution does exist but no one has ever found it."
"It remains undiscovered, invisible, illegible and unintelligible."
"We want a proper constitution."
"Let us at least agree on this objective, and if we do agree, then let us state how to achieve it."
"Parliament is proposing one route involving two phases, two stops: reorganisation of the Treaties, the fast track, and adoption of a constitution, the gradual track."
"The report proposes these two phases as commitments that should be entered into at Nice, because it is possible."
"It also states that before being completed, there should be a European referendum, because it is a dream which we need."
"At all events, do not kill it off today."
"If we want to achieve it, then we can, all together, citizens, Members of Parliament, and governments of the European Union."
"Today, the 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament is stating one simple message loudly and clearly: the European Constitution is something you can achieve and something that we indeed want."
"Mr President, the issue I wish to discuss is far more specific, even though it must be said that some of us consider reinforced cooperation to be the panacea to combat the hypothetical freezing of the European integration process, supposedly inevitable due to the increase in the number of Member States following the next round of enlargement."
"Some would consider this to be the equivalent of throwing a lifebelt to enable certain states to survive the shipwreck of Community construction, and to others it involves creating a hard core of supposedly elite countries, or patanegra states, as we would say in Spanish, states that would, by virtue of their power, cohesion and weight, act as a veritable cabinet."
"There are also, Mr President, those who see reinforced cooperation as the ideal instrument with which to create an ""à la carte Europe"" or a ""variable geometry Europe"" , in which Community solidarity and cohesion would be diluted in a range of various intergovernmental cooperation schemes."
"This would be a Europe that is neither democratic, nor efficient, nor transparent, but simply a self-service organisation."
"None of these approaches seems acceptable or realistic to me."
"My report therefore simply suggests making the existing provisions more flexible by following clear and coherent criteria:"
"First, we must establish cooperation within the Community framework and not in parallel intergovernmental operations."
"Europe cannot be brought closer to the citizens by making its structure more and more complicated."
"Second, we must maintain the unity of Parliament and the Commission and increase their participation in both establishing and developing reinforced cooperation."
"The experience of the Maastricht Social Protocol and of Economic and Monetary Union show that the participation of all the members of these Institutions is technically feasible and politically advisable, and preserves the coherence of the system and the participation of all European citizens in decisions that affect them all the time."
"Dividing up legislative and executive powers or replacing them with a greater number of bodies, secretariats, parallel chambers and the like does not lead to democracy but to inefficiency."
"Third, we must increase the scope of reinforced cooperation to include the common foreign and security policy and the common defence policy, which in the last few years have been crying out for a Community channel to avoid the dispersion, slowness and inefficiency that end up transferring decisions and the task of solving specifically European problems to the United States of America."
"Fourth, we must eliminate the veto and reduce the minimum number of Member States required to set in motion Community reinforced cooperation."
"I say ""Community"" , ladies and gentlemen, because this is what we are talking about, making Community instruments more powerful instead of replacing them."
"The dividing line between those who want a political Europe and those who want to reduce it to a market lies in strengthening the Community rather than intergovernmental operations, and not the opposite, as the President of the Commission explained quite recently in this Assembly."
"We do not need a Europe with divergent objectives, but a Europe with a common objective, albeit with various speeds."
"Finally, we need reinforced cooperation that is open, not closed, and which includes rather than excludes those current or future members that do not sign up immediately - a form of reinforced cooperation that acts as an impetus instead of creating further obstacles."
"Mr President, I have had the satisfaction of noting that the proposals presented recently at the Intergovernmental Conference coincide in the main with all or some of the criteria I have set out."
"I hope that the spirit of Biarritz that we have talked about so much today will materialise, as spirits that do not materialise become ghosts and the attic of European construction is full of such ghosts."
"Finally, I must thank the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its chairman for the kindness with which they received my report, the contributions which enabled me to improve it and the tremendous support that was given in the final vote."
"With this support, Mr President, and in the hope that our resolution will be useful in this final, decisive stage of the Intergovernmental Conference, I ask the House to vote for this report."
"Mr President, I am outlining here a resolution which was approved and discussed last week by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I would like to thank the Chairman, Mr Napolitano, who conducted the proceedings and signed the resolution."
"This resolution draws the attention of the Community organs and the forthcoming Nice Intergovernmental Conference to the issue of the islands, of island status, or rather the principle that island status as such should be recognised as one of the criteria for Community intervention because of the actual conditions which any form of island status involves for the regions concerned."
"Anyone who has studied the issue is aware of the mystery of the translations: while the Italian version adopts the principle that island status is one of the valid criteria for Community intervention, the French and other translations express a different concept and the English translation is ambiguous and could be interpreted in either way."
"I will not focus on the linguistic issue but I will restrict myself to pointing out - because it is an important, historic fact - that the official version drawn up by the Intergovernmental Conference of Amsterdam, which was, moreover, in French, is identical to the current Italian text."
"It expresses the idea, that is, that island status is in itself an adequate criterion."
"In effect, the text which was officially issued by the Intergovernmental Conference - which I will pass on to Commissioner Barnier and to the Minister, should your legal offices not have already done so - clearly shows that this was the opinion actually issued by the Intergovernmental Conference but that it was mistranslated into other languages."
"I will not continue for there are more powerful arguments than the linguistic argument."
"There are sections of the Treaties which establish the principle of cohesion and there is Declaration 30 which, in affirming and applying the principle of cohesion in this context, reads, and I quote the exact wording: ""The Conference recognises that island regions suffer from structural handicaps linked to their island status, the permanence of which impairs their social and economic development"" ."
"It is not, therefore, on the basis of a number of languages or a number of translations, but on the basis of a fundamental principle of the Charters, of the Treaties, that is, the principle of cohesion, that we call for the islands to be recognised as such, as the possible beneficiaries of specific interventions and specific attention."
"Commissioner, Mr President, we are not begging: we are simply asking the Community to allow us to be citizens on an equal footing with the other citizens, not privileged citizens."
"If, for example, you look at the development chart, you will see that, in Italy, over the past few decades, it has followed the limit of communicability exactly: it has expanded and been extended to areas and regions which were easily linked with those which are more developed and has remained distant from those which, like the islands or other areas, had and continue to have appalling connection problems."
"Mr President, I come from a land, an island, which has always had this problem, a never-ending problem - like other Italian islands and, I believe, tens and hundreds of islands of other countries - an island which has always made a major contribution, which has always been firmly in favour of national development and which, today, values European development in addition to and alongside national development."
"The effects of development, progress, news and communications, however, have always reached that island, as they have reached other islands, years later than elsewhere."
"If Europe wants to be something more than merely the scene of the globalisation battle, if it wants to be a complete Community, moving, united in all its components and expressions, towards new progress and new civilisation, we call upon you, not to give us more than the others but to allow us to be citizens on an equal footing with the others."
"We are not asking for anything specific or tangible; we are not asking for funding: we are simply calling for this principle of island status to be universally accepted, so that the citizens of the European Union can all start the race on an equal footing, with equal chances of reaching the finish line."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen of the House, you wanted us to have a debate, this morning, on those issues regarding which this House thought it necessary to add to the opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference that was issued in April."
"Initially, you planned three reports: constitutionalisation of the Treaties, reinforced cooperation, and the ceiling on the number of Members of the European Parliament."
"I note, at any rate, that for today, the last matter has not been referred to us, and I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Barnier."
"The Presidency takes note of this, but the situation must be noted. It is one we regret."
"Who better than this House to give an informed opinion on this issue of major importance in view of the imminent enlargement?"
"Finally, one last point of a quite different sort, which Mr Segni, backed by Chairman Napolitano, wished to bring up, and which I noted, the question of islands."
"I shall now return to each of these points, but only briefly in order to leave time for the debate."
"With your permission, I shall begin - and I would ask Olivier Duhamel not to hold it against me, I am not overlooking him - with the issue of reinforced cooperation which is actually on the agenda for the IGC, unlike the issue of constitutionalisation, which will come afterwards."
"Let me go to the heart of the matter, focussing on the salient points of Mr Gil-Robles' report, which I shall simply describe as excellent in my view."
"This is a point I already made in presenting the results of the informal Council meeting in Biarritz."
"I think it is safe to say that the conclusions of your rapporteur - as indeed he noted - for the most part echo the concerns expressed by the Member States in Biarritz."
"First of all, Mr Chairman, I note your agreement as to the reasons justifying making this mechanism more flexible so than it can be properly implemented within an enlarged Europe."
"I note your concern that the institutional framework of the Union be respected and the need to design an accessible instrument, as well as your wish to eliminate the veto within the Council. All these are principles which met with general approval in Biarritz."
"I also understand your determination to prevent any interference with what you term the 'institutional indivisibility' of the European Parliament or the Commission."
"We are, once again, all agreed that the institutional framework of the European Union should be respected."
"There is no case for going beyond the Treaties or challenging the existing framework."
"Nonetheless, we have here a special instrument of an exceptional nature which is, of necessity, somewhat specific in relation to the civil law."
"Let me stress that there is absolutely no question of using this instrument in order to compensate for failing to introduce qualified majority voting in some areas."
"Qualified majority voting is indeed the prime objective at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Nor is there any question of creating an à la carte Europe."
"However, in spite of the clear guarantees which must surround reinforced cooperation, such cooperation is nonetheless exceptional in nature, and shows that it was not possible, at a given time, for the fifteen Member States to come to an agreement on stepping up cooperation in a specific sector."
"Hence, it will not be easy to say that everything is going ahead just as if the fifteen Member States were involved, if you will forgive me belabouring such an obvious point."
"And so, while respecting the existing constitutional framework, I must say I think it would be difficult to envisage more than a procedure for an advisory opinion from Parliament when such measures are adopted."
"As for the arrangements for implementing reinforced cooperation, these present another, more complex problem."
"I do realise the value that Parliament places on its own indivisibility, and indeed I understand it perfectly, but then, for that very reason, how is it possible to justify Parliament' s issuing a legitimate opinion as if it were a conventional codecision or consultation situation when in fact probably half, or perhaps two thirds of all the Member States might not be involved in this reinforced cooperation?"
"In such circumstances, what legitimacy would Parliament' s vote have, if expressed by a majority of Members of Parliament representing States that were not involved in such reinforced cooperation?"
"Would this not be another way of reintroducing, by the back door, the veto which you yourselves wanted us to get rid of?"
"Objectively speaking, this is a real matter of principle which makes it impossible, in my view, to adopt exactly the same rules within each area of reinforced cooperation as within the European Union, and this is all the more true in the very specific and delicate area of foreign security and defence policy."
"I think we must clearly keep in mind what specific situations this arrangement is intended to deal with."
"It must not become the norm, and it must be given a degree of flexibility, within the limits of a number of principles."
"I now come to the constitutionalisation of the Treaties."
"I could confine myself to thanking Mr Duhamel, and to simply pointing out that his text contains a quite unwarranted attack on President Prodi - his were, of course, humorous comments - or even observing that he has not said exactly how he wants this constitution to be arrived at."
"Fortunately, his report is available, and the term 'constitution' unites, or covers, a number of requirements."
"Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties."
"Next, the creation of a proper reference text clearly establishing the principles and objectives of the European Union and, finally, the distribution of competences between the various decision-making levels within the European Union."
"This is a question which Parliament, to give credit where it is due, asked very early in the day, as soon as it took office, in fact, in July 1999."
"It is a response to the real requirements which I have just listed."
"It is also true, however, that we must as a Presidency take account of the fact that the Member States have so far indicated that they are not yet ready to discuss a constitution, even if an illustrious list of political representatives has raised the issue."
"The fact is, it is easy to see why Member States are not yet at that point."
"While a constitution can provide a response, at least in part, to the questions I listed, it is a project which in real terms goes a lot farther than that."
"A constitution, by definition, is a fundamental act of immense political scope, in the best sense of the term."
"It cannot be seen as simply an exercise in tidying up the wording or even in assigning competences."
"In my opinion, a constitution goes a lot farther than that, and this future development, the precise shape of our future in Europe, is something that we have not yet clearly decided between ourselves."
"I feel we cannot talk properly about a constitution and plan ways to draw it up until we know what we want to put in it."
"As you know full well, that presupposes our taking certain political decisions, with a scope that goes much farther than meeting the three requirements which I have just mentioned."
"I note, moreover, that among the Heads of State and Government who did declare an opinion on this, not all were equally as approving of the idea, far from it."
"Let me come back to the three matters I mentioned."
"Firstly, simplification of the Treaties."
"Yes, it is a laudable objective, and some brilliant legal minds have tried their hand at it."
"In particular the European Institute in Florence, at the Commission' s request - and I expect Michel Barnier will mention this - did so with a result which I would describe as extremely honourable, despite the particularly arid aspect of the exercise, but I do not have the impression that the authors of the report, to which Mr Duhamel refers, indeed - managed to avoid a certain contradiction between the objective of clarity and the objective of legal certainty."
"Treaties are not rewritten without affecting existing legislation."
"That is understandable. It is extremely difficult to rewrite treaties which have been negotiated, sometimes down to the last comma, and the next item in our debate provides an eloquent example of this."
"Next, there is - and once again it is inevitable, yet questionable - an element of randomness, which is understandable, in the decisions made by the European Institute of Florence."
"I am thinking, for instance, of the way in which the authors of the report attach equal importance to each of the common policies, even though their respective importance is obviously very different, and this is expressed by provisions which are also very different in nature."
"I shall not continue, as we are not here, or I, at least, am not here, to discuss the Institute' s report."
"In any case, I noted that your rapporteur was actually proposing an alternative solution which would involve, if I understand correctly, making a distinction between, firstly, the provisions that would be part of a framework treaty and, secondly, the other provisions, particularly the common policies, which would form part of a protocol to be appended."
"What I wish to suggest is that, whatever the option selected, being personally not only open but also favourable to the idea of a constitution, this approach raises fundamental questions."
"This is neither a technical nor an innocuous exercise and we must ask fundamental questions before doing anything."
"The second matter is the distribution of competences."
"It is a question often raised, but less often debated."
"There has not, to date, been any conclusive outcome to this debate, but that should certainly not deter us from making some improvements."
"It is a complex exercise."
"We must take care not to destroy the aspect which has made the Community so special since the very beginning, this blend, which varies according to sector, but always very subtle, of shared competences."
"An exercise of this type must not upset the balance or cause us to regress, in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, as some parties seem to wish."
"That is what I wanted to express at this stage."
"Speaking on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office, it would be inappropriate for me to say more, for as you know we have taken a decision to focus until December on the four key questions on the agenda."
"We are not unaware that other questions are being raised."
"A number of honourable Members have raised these questions, as have the Commission and Parliament."
"Theses issues, or at least some of them, will no doubt come up for discussion very shortly."
"The Nice meeting is going to be held, the conclusions of that gathering will be made public, and then we will have the situation after Nice."
"This will not necessarily be in the form desired by your rapporteur because, as I said earlier, not all Member States will necessarily be ready, but an extremely useful contribution will have been made."
"I think we will see matters more clearly in Nice, and I think it is the results of the IGC - for we must not underestimate the impact that the outcome of the IGC will have on our ability to go further - which will determine whether we shall be able to look into the opportuneness of opening up new working areas and, if appropriate, of defining working methods and a work schedule."
"One last brief word on the way in which a text of this type would be drawn up, when the time comes."
"You rapporteur proposes adopting the method of the Convention."
"Why not, indeed?"
"This method has, it is true, demonstrated its worth in drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Several Members of this House, but also representatives of Member States have already pointed out that the traditional method of the Intergovernmental Conference was certainly not the best method."
"I myself stressed that the method adopted for the Charter was an avenue worth exploring."
"Do we need a Convention or do we need some other method?"
"That remains to be seen, including, moreover, the process of adopting, ultimately, the future European constitution which, I am convinced, will one day come to exist."
"And now, one very quick word about the island regions."
"As usual, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with its chairman, and yourself, Mr Segni, brought up questions that were both extremely pertinent but also extremely complex."
"I shall attempt to respond as precisely as possible to one question. To tell the truth, I do not know the answer at the present time."
"I understand that our Italian friends, for the most part, have found some discrepancies between the different language versions of Article 158(2) of the Treaty, some shades of meaning and outright differences, which may give rise to differing interpretations."
"This question was raised as early as 1997, I believe, after the new Treaty was adopted but before it was signed."
"According to the information available to the Presidency, forgive me if I have to be technical at this point, it appears that the clear majority of the language versions, unlike the Italian version, as far as the implementation of cohesion policy is concerned, refer only to the less favoured islands and not to islands in general."
"It is clear, however, as you have stated so clearly, that this question is not just a matter of linguistic or semantic debate, but instead concerns an extremely important and sensitive issue, which is the handling of island issues within the European Union and the policies which may be set up and implemented within these territories."
"As I said, given the lack of information available to us, I am not in a position to deliver a definitive opinion on this matter today, but the Presidency is, of course, willing to help clarify the matter by, for instance, referring the matter to the Council' s legal department within the Council and even within the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I think we might then have more relevant information so as to be able to clarify the matter and, at that time, to give you a comprehensive answer."
"That is all the information I wished to give you."
"I shall now end in order to leave the floor open for the debate."
"Mr President, before I in turn discuss the two excellent reports presented by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Duhamel on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which both have an institutional or constitutional dimension, allow me to begin this speech by responding to Mr Segni who brought up the status of the islands."
"Mr Segni, as I myself returned only two days ago from an official working visit with Mr Hatzidakis to one of the larger islands of Europe, Crete, I was able to assess the sensitivity associated with the dual handicap of underdevelopment and remoteness, even without a handicap that I personally know better than most, due to my previous posts, i.e. the handicap of mountainous regions that often goes hand in hand with remoteness."
"I would therefore like to assure Mr Segni that, like him, the Commission itself has noted certain discrepancies between the various language versions of Article 158 of the Treaty."
"Clearly, these linguistic differences are prejudicial to a clear interpretation of the text as, depending on which version you consult, either all or some of the islands could be concerned."
"However, Mr Segni, I personally do not think that there can be any ambiguity as to the content, as the text of Declaration No 30 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam specifies that Community legislation must take account of the structural handicaps relating to islands and that specific measures in favour of such regions may be undertaken where justified."
"Island status as such is not a criterion for eligibility."
"And that, I understand, is what you are lamenting."
"Disadvantaged islands are, of course, covered by cohesion policy."
"This is the case of many islands that I visit within the scope of Objective 1 or the cohesion appropriations, due to the very fact of their socio-economic situation and in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Structural Fund general regulation."
"Mr Segni, I have decided to instigate a study on the socio-economic situation of the islands, in order to assess the situation and get as precise a diagnosis as possible of these island regions and I myself will present the results of this study, which I hope will be available during the second half of 2001."
"I will say in passing that these results will complement the debate that I also intend to instigate in 2001 on the cohesion report, an important public debate in which the European Parliament will take part and which will enable me to prepare the guidelines for the future regional policy for the period 2006-2013."
"As for the idea you suggested of introducing this debate into the IGC, frankly, Mr Segni, it seems to me that, taking account of the scope and difficulty of the other subjects on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference, it would be more appropriate to rectify the text according to the procedures laid down by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as in previous cases of clerical errors in the articles of treaties, in order to standardise the different language versions of this article quite precisely."
"But I understand that, behind the linguistic aspect, your question expresses another concern."
"With regard to this, I have told you of my intention, at least before being able to respond and if the governments agree when the time comes, to get a clearer and more objective view on the basis of the study that I am going to commission on the situation of all the islands of the various Member States of the European Union."
"I would now like to discuss, in turn, the two reports presented by José María Gil-Robles and Olivier Duhamel."
"On the report on reinforced cooperation, I must remind you that it is not a simple matter, and Mr Gil-Robles is well aware of this as he had to fight for it."
"At the very beginning of the negotiations, this issue was not on the agenda."
"We all fought, and I thank the Portuguese and French Presidencies for coming to realise that we had to add this issue of reinforced cooperation to the notorious three leftovers from Amsterdam."
"Thus, on content and form, I am pleased to see, that the positions of the European Commission and the European Parliament are very close."
"After this IGC, Mr Gil-Robles, I think the instrument of reinforced cooperation will be more clearly defined and, if I may use this expression, more 'workable' in relation to the current content of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"For the Commission, there are five essential components of reinforced cooperation."
"It must take place, as you said yourself, within the institutional framework, with a suitable role for each institution: that is the first point."
"It must remain open to all and, as I said earlier, it must be an instrument of association, integration, and definitely not an instrument of exclusion: that is the second point."
"It requires strict conditions, but also practicable conditions: that is the third point."
"Guarantees are needed for those not, or not yet, participating in reinforced cooperation: that is the fourth point."
"Finally, the fifth point: reinforced cooperation must not be seen, as is sometimes the case, as a way of concealing or hiding a lack of agreement on qualified majority."
"As far as I can see, these two issues, although they are sometimes related, basically have nothing to do with each other."
"I think that the report presented to you today, ladies and gentlemen, echoes these five features."
"It is important to ensure that this reinforced cooperation remains within the framework of the European Union and respects the roles of the institutions, in particular the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Furthermore, Mr Gil-Robles, most of the delegations to the negotiations in which I am participating agree that the future treaty should recognise an enhanced role for the Commission and the Parliament in implementing reinforced cooperation."
"We now need to work together to ensure that this intention or direction actually becomes reality."
"I am therefore prepared to support the request in José Maria Gil­Robles' report aiming to enhance Parliament' s role and I support the idea, at least, of replacing the consultation of the European Parliament in the first pillar with its assent."
"However, in our opinion, the roles currently envisaged by the presidency in its very latest proposals regarding the procedure for i.e. the CFSP, are still inadequate as they stand."
"That is why, yesterday, when we were discussing various points, I put forward a number of amendments which will usefully serve to specify or enhance the role of our institutions and the place allotted to them according to the pillars, in the context of implementation of reinforced cooperation."
"We must ensure that the required coherence between actions under the three pillars is also strengthened, a task that will fall primarily to the Community institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, reinforced cooperation cannot, and must never allow the acquis communautaire to be unravelled in any way."
"I would remind you that the procedure can be simple, with a qualified majority and the withdrawal of the veto, because we want to maintain strict conditions."
"Strict conditions, moreover, such as those laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which we think must be maintained, may justify or allow for simple procedures."
"I completely share Parliament' s wish for the fundamental principles to remain unchanged, but I have noticed, Mr Gil-Robles, a willingness on your part to make some of these conditions more flexible, as in point 11 of your resolution, and I would like to exercise a certain amount of caution in this respect."
"Finally, we all agree that reinforced cooperation should not - I have said this before and I will say it again - become a characteristic feature of the European Union."
"It must remain a mechanism that the Member States may use only when all the other possibilities for progress on the road to integration involving all Members have been ruled out or are not feasible."
"Reinforced cooperation must not, therefore, become the universal cure-all in order to conceal our weaknesses."
"To be more specific, I think that reinforced cooperation cannot be designed as an alternative to qualified majority voting, which remains and will always remain, in the view of the Commission, the main subject under negotiation."
"That concludes my comments on the report presented by Mr Gil-Robles."
"As a final comment, and this refers to the report presented with great passion by Olivier Duhamel too, I should like to say that the report on reinforced cooperation and Mr Duhamel' s report are both equal to the reputation of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I would therefore like to congratulate the members and the chair of the committee, Mr Napolitano."
"Moving on to the second report, which we welcome most warmly, Mr Duhamel. We think your report provides an excellent starting point for the discussion of the constitutional work that we are to begin immediately after Nice."
"Despite this remark, let me say from the outset that our duty, here and now, for the Intergovernmental Conference to succeed, is to concentrate all our energy and all our efforts on the IGC agenda as it stands, in particular when extended to reinforced cooperation."
"We needs must do this because we are a long way short of the target."
"Mr Duhamel, you will undoubtedly agree with me that if Nice is not successful, there will be no room, or at least no credibility, for consideration of the future of European integration, at least within the current framework."
"We must therefore succeed in Nice, and open the doors to enlargement and to new and future reforms."
"First of all, however, the objective of these negotiations is to get the door open."
"Yet, inevitably, certain questions are now being asked, so forcefully by yourself, for instance, and must be asked in Nice, even if they are not the subject under debate at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I think that Nice could be the beginning of the next stages of discussions on several related topics."
"First, the reorganisation of the Treaties."
"I thank you for the positive reference you made to the study by the European Institute in Florence that we commissioned, and I also noted Mr Moscovici' s constructive approach in this respect."
"I must, however, remind you that we had commissioned a report on the basis of the existing legislation and this is what we were given, but naturally, as soon as the contents of several hundred articles and several Treaties are assembled into 93 articles, since it is possible to work on the basis of the existing law - as, I think, the Florence Institute did - the legal interpretation of this new text is bound to be different."
"This is a good piece of work that constitutes a basis available for the future exercise of reorganising the treaties."
"That is the first point."
"The second point is the legal nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a matter which, as the Presidency said, may well not be answered in Nice."
"But, like many of you, we think that this work cannot be left at that and we must, perhaps in Article 6, give this Charter legal force."
"In any case, I will fight for that."
"My third point, finally, is the possible clarification of the definition of competences within the European Union."
"I know that Olivier Duhamel' s report essentially slots into a wider perspective: that of a constitutionalisation that would go way beyond the current institutional framework and which would only be completed in the long term."
"It seems to me, however, that we need to clarify the current legal and institutional situation first of all, which is what your report also proposes as a first stage: ""a reorganised Treaty"" , as you say in point 9 of your resolution."
"Like you, Mr Duhamel, I think the European Union should be equipped with a clear, simpler fundamental text."
"It is a necessary and feasible task."
"We are not talking about changing the institutional framework established by the Treaties, and certainly not about increasing the competence of the European Union, but about making European construction more user-friendly."
"It is essential for European democracy, our primary reason for uniting, as you reminded us, that the citizens have access to a constitutional treaty, a text which, according to the wish of Vaclav Havel, all the children of Europe can learn at school without difficulty."
"The important work carried out at our request by the European Institute in Florence, to which I have referred, shows that it is legally possible to assemble all these essential elements in a single text comprising a small number of articles."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the drafting of this fundamental text could be the opportunity to provide answers to other questions of a constitutional nature which will be asked in Nice and which I mentioned just now: the legal nature of the Charter and the clarification of competences."
"Is a reorganised treaty, enriched with other elements of a constitutional nature, already a constitution or must this expression be reserved, as you yourself recommend, Mr Duhamel, for a new fundamental text which would be drafted according to new methods?"
"The word ""Constitution"" does not scare me, I even think I have used it in your presence, ladies and gentlemen, at the very beginning, when I was not yet an official member of the European Commission."
"I raised the issue of the constitutionalisation of the Treaties during my hearing before the European Parliament, prior to the investiture of the Commission."
"I would like to assure you of my personal availability and even my passion, Mr Duhamel, which will be at least equal to yours, in order to participate in this work."
"I also agree that we should move as far away as possible from the references that you yourself rejected, in the context of our work on this subject: on the left, those of Karl Marx and, on the right, as you said, those of Joseph de Maistre, even if the latter, I would like to say, while stating my disagreement with a number of his writings, at least had the merit of being from Savoy."
"I would therefore like to indicate my availability and that of the Commission to work in the direction you wish, working through the process of constitutionalisation stage by stage."
"In any case, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear and must remain so: none of the questions we are discussing can constitute a condition to be achieved prior to the enlargement of the European Union towards the Mediterranean, Baltic, Eastern and Central European countries that are currently candidates."
"The Commission is not in favour of calling another Intergovernmental Conference before the first round of enlargement."
"The reform of the institutions needed to enable this enlargement to take place must be carried out now and there must be no Nice leftovers, in any case definitely not the Amsterdam leftovers."
"Then there would no longer be any preliminary work at all on our part."
"The conclusions of the European Council in Nice could announce, in the way you recommend, a mandate and timetable for the work on matters of a constitutional nature."
"Again, I think that any discussions after Nice should be open to all, to the Member States and the candidate States, in a suitable form that we shall have to define."
"Finally, I think that the Commission, which has participated actively in the work of the Charter and which is participating actively, as is proper, in the work of institutional negotiation, will, after Nice, also have to play its part in the collective brainstorming that is related, quite clearly, moreover, to another exercise which we have undertaken on governance."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, my wish is that the Commission, in accordance with the other institutions, should mark out the route to be followed."
"It is ready to do so by means of a report to be drawn up following Nice on these matters of clarifying competences and simplifying the Treaties, which could be available before the end of the Treaty of Nice ratification period."
"As for the continuation of the work, I will also say that the report you presented, Mr Duhamel, contains many very interesting ideas."
"Like you, the Commission was impressed by the quality and form of the work of the Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights and I think that this method is one worth continuing and from which lessons can be learnt."
"You mentioned the idea of a referendum to be held simultaneously in all the Member States."
"This too, I feel, is an idea of great symbolic and democratic significance, and I think it is worth looking into."
"Mr Duhamel, you spoke with great passion, and that is what this subject requires, given the resistance and reluctance shown by some."
"In fact, a great deal of passion is needed here, and that is what we need now, too, in order to make a success of the institutional reform."
"We need a great deal of passion, both on your part and on ours, in order to make a breakthrough."
"By way of a thank you for the response, and the amount of attention you are giving this constitutional debate, let me remind you of the additional dimension it has in relation to all the complex matters we are working on in the context of negotiations for institutional reform, such as qualified majority voting and the weighting of votes, which are subjects that are not easy to understand and which must be explained to the citizens."
"The issues of a possible constitution, a fundamental treaty, the clear definition of competences and the Charter all have one common feature: the fact that they have a political and a democratic dimension, I was about to say a citizens' dimension."
"These will give the Nice talks, even if they have to be gone into in further detail after Nice, that citizens' dimension which the European Union needs."
"It has been my opinion for a long time that the main failing of the construction of Europe is that it is a matter for the elite."
"Admittedly it is sometimes handled with courage and tenacity, but it remains in the hands of the elite, behind closed doors, to some extent, as far as the general public is concerned."
"The worst scenario for the construction of Europe in the days to come is that this silence will be maintained, as silence is what fuels fears."
"This silence encourages all sorts of demagoguery and all sorts of anti-European campaigns."
"We must break this silence and initiate debate involving the public, and it is by means of initiatives such as yours, Mr Duhamel, initiatives which can speak to the hearts and minds of our citizens that we shall be able to contribute towards redressing this democratic deficit."
"So that is also why I wished to thank you, as well as to thank you for the form and the content of the initiative you have taken."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Duhamel report has provided us, the European Parliament, with the opportunity, barely two months before the European Council in Nice, to reiterate our position on the further development of the European Union, and in so doing to take account of the need for the EU to become primed for action on the enlargement front over the next few years, as well as to demonstrate to our citizens the medium-term prospects of the European Union."
"Commissioner Barnier, you made this point a moment ago, and rightly so."
"The Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats will therefore use its large majority to vote in favour of Olivier Duhamel' s outstanding report, which focuses on the essential aspects."
"During the first phase, we will need a constitutional treaty that will amalgamate the existing foundations of the Treaties of the European Union currently in force, in a clear and comprehensible manner."
"At the same time, however, this constitutional treaty should be elaborated in such a way that it renders the common values of the European Union comprehensible, incorporates the fundamental rights of the European citizens laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and improves the composition, role, and modus operandi of the European Union' s bodies, looking beyond the Nice Summit, thereby improving their efficiency."
"What this European constitution will also need to do is clearly establish the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union, inject the dynamism of European integration into those areas where it is badly needed, and provide for joint action to be taken, for example in the sphere of foreign and security policy."
"It is also important, in this context, to respect and safeguard the lowest layer of democracy and local self-administration in the EU Member States."
"We must not, as has already happened with a number of directives, end up with an interplay of European and national bureaucracies which restricts and overrides the citizen' s ability to shape policy at a local level."
"We therefore propose that local self-administration should form an integral part of a future European constitution and would urge you to endorse this proposed amendment."
"Mr President, I would like to focus on the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, which duly establishes the European Parliament' s position on the fourth of the major issues to be addressed by the current IGC."
"It outlines the framework within which reinforced cooperation is to be developed and sets out the conditions that govern it."
"This framework must be enforceable both on the countries that want to participate in closer cooperation and on those that are not participating in it or at least not from the start."
"Reinforced cooperation must therefore respect the principles set out in the Treaties and be conducted within the single institutional framework of the Union."
"On the other hand, it must not constitute a barrier to trade or precipitate splits in the common market, breaks in the links of solidarity and cohesion between the Member States or, as Commissioner Barnier has said, an unravelling of the Community acquis."
"The implementation of reinforced cooperation must not result in new bodies being set up to swell the ranks of the European institutions."
"In stressing this point, the joint memorandum from the Benelux countries, as well as Mr Gil-Robles' report, rejects the idea of having a specific secretariat or directorate for each and every closer cooperation initiative."
"Openness and transparency must be ensured under all circumstances."
"No Member State should ever be refused the chance to participate, at any time, in an existing area of reinforced cooperation, and this guarantee must be extended to include future Member States."
"The rapporteur is quite correct in firmly stressing the need for the Commission' s powers of initiative and the participation of Parliament, at least on a consultation procedure basis, to be the norm whenever there is reinforced cooperation."
"Moreover, reinforced cooperation within the three pillars will initially have the objective of moving further towards European integration."
"It may also prove essential if we are to overcome persistent obstacles."
"On the other hand, should the effect of this reinforced cooperation be to destroy institutional balances, to exclude the Commission and to throw off the democratic control of the European Parliament, it would not be achieving its aims and it would be better to dispense with it."
"Mr President, the interested citizen who wants to know how the EU is run is scarcely going to pore over the Treaty of Amsterdam as bedtime reading."
"If by chance she should nonetheless do so, it is doubtful if she would be any the wiser."
"Not even very committed EU cognoscenti could easily plough through those Treaties which in fact regulate a whole range of our common activities here in Europe."
"The Treaties are difficult to understand, at times contradictory, difficult to read and uninspiring."
"Beautiful and important European values are jumbled together with technical clauses in an unholy mess."
"This is really quite unacceptable."
"If we want to increase knowledge about the European project, as well as commitment to it, there is a minimum requirement that it must be simple to find out how the Union is run and why it is run in that way."
"That is not the case today, a fact which Mr Duhamel' s report does an excellent job of bringing out."
"Following the Nice Summit, which we all hope will be successful, it is important to take this next step in order to create a more democratic Union."
"It is time to review the Treaties."
"For my group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, it is important that, to begin with, the European Treaties should be made more citizen-friendly."
"This means simplifying, rearranging and pruning them."
"The proposal from the Florence institute suggests a place to start, but the next step is to create a proper European constitution."
"The people of Europe need, deserve and, according to opinion polls, want a common constitution clearly expressing the EU' s values and objectives and clarifying the division of power and responsibility both between the institutions and between the institutions and the Member States."
"People' s rights ought to be regulated by incorporating the conclusions from the Convention."
"This is an exciting process."
"It is certainly not simple, but it is incredibly important."
"Naturally, people must be enabled to participate in this work, especially citizens of the candidate countries which will hopefully be members in a few years' time."
"The work must under no circumstances be used as an excuse to delay enlargement."
"A constitution is a matter for the whole of Europe."
"Work on the constitution ought to be informed by an ambition both to simplify matters and to remove some of the tasks carried out by the EU."
"This is necessary if the EU is to be able to function in the future."
"A clearer distribution of powers is required, as well as a clearer definition of the subsidiarity principle."
"We learned a very great deal from the work of the Convention."
"It is a working method which, with certain changes, ought to be used to give people a still more important place in the process."
"A future European constitution must not be a product off the Brussels drawing board."
"Vaclav Havel said in this Chamber, and Commissioner Barnier quoted him recently, that he wanted to see a European constitution which could be handed out to, and understood by, every eleven year-old in Europe."
"I think that is a very commendable objective."
"The decision to embark upon the work must be taken today."
"It is a hopeful sign that the French Presidency is favourably disposed to this."
"I shall now do what I can to convince my fellow countrymen to run with the ball during Sweden' s Presidency."
"Mr President, the fundamental rights of the people are not merely promises, but are the inalienable rights of each individual, bestowed neither by politicians nor the state, but respected, and derived from human dignity; and these rights are only effective when they are the law of the land, enshrined in laws by Parliament and upheld by courts. This knowledge is intrinsic to modern democracy and is at the heart of the constitution of each Member State."
"The European Council is violating this fundamental consensus within Europe, by refusing to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, make it legally binding and denying the citizens, whose rights are being infringed, access to the European Court of Justice."
"Fundamental rights constitute an essential defence against the state."
"It is therefore ironic that the Heads of State and Government should be the ones making the decisions about the fundamental rights of the citizens of Europe."
"Is it any wonder that these heads of governments refuse to submit to the regime prescribed by the Charter, and make it legally binding?"
"The Council' s claim to power is the main stumbling block in the current constitutional process and it is the root cause of the Union' s democratic deficit."
"Not only do the Heads of State and Government want to be the de facto and sole legislators of the Union; they also want to be its government."
"Who can still doubt that they regard themselves as the sole providers of the Union' s constitution?"
"To a large extent excluding Parliament, the citizens and - where possible - excluding the Commission too."
"It has always been the task of democracy to curb the power of princes."
"The question we must ask ourselves today is whether we want a Europe ruled by princes or a European democracy."
"If we want a European democracy then we must initiate a constitutional process and make the Charter of Fundamental Rights its cornerstone."
"Mr President, Mr Duhamel' s report, which we are discussing today, is a very important one to my mind."
"After all, it concerns the all-important question of how the process of European unification is to be further developed."
"It is about the future of the European Union."
"As is well known, opinion on this differs widely in the various Member States and amongst the various forces of society."
"This is also replicated in my own group."
"As I see it, this diversity of opinion is indispensable, and also enriches the process, because if we want to build a common European house, we must keep a close eye on whether everyone is keen to live there and also accepts it as their own."
"The previous round of European elections showed us just how far the Union still has to go to achieve this goal: low election turn-out, prejudice, justifiable frustration at the lack of democracy and transparency, over-regulation, bureaucracy and opaque decision-making processes."
"Unfortunately, none of this has changed yet."
"But there is an extremely urgent need for radical change."
"Our Parliament, as the only institution of the Union to have democratic legitimacy, has a big responsibility to lead the way in this respect."
"Which is precisely why I welcome this report."
"We need to simplify and reorganise the Treaties as a matter of urgency."
"The text of the Treaties must be comprehensible, above all from the point of view of the citizens."
"We need to instigate a constitutional process. The Nice Summit must pave the way for this by granting the necessary mandate, initiating a procedure and setting a timetable."
"Having said that, Mr President, I am more than sceptical about one particular aspect."
"Firstly, I do not think we will be able, realistically speaking, to adopt the constitution called for in the report in time for next elections in 2004, and secondly, nor should we in my opinion."
"After all, it is unacceptable for the fifteen Member States alone to discuss and decide on a constitution, when we all know full well that by the end of this decade the European Union will have 27 members."
"As I see it, there are three key points: firstly, we need a truly wide-ranging public debate in all the Member States."
"Secondly, the candidate countries must be directly, and fully, involved."
"Thirdly, I am absolutely convinced that a constitution could only have democratic legitimacy if it were to be made the subject of a Union-wide referendum, because what this in fact amounts to is something akin to the re-establishment of the Union by its citizens."
"Should we do otherwise, then I do not think a Europe of the citizens will be within our reach."
"Mr President, the Duhamel report, which I shall be discussing, once again raises the European Parliament' s old idea of giving Europe a constitution."
"The main aim behind this, which is not clearly stated in the resolution, would be to lay down for Europe, even for the fundamental texts, majority-style collective decision-making procedures, completely different, therefore, to the unanimous Council votes or the votes on ratification by Member States used today to amend the Treaties."
"These collective procedures would for once and all establish a supranational power in Europe."
"We should nevertheless first ask ourselves what exactly our citizens want for the Europe of tomorrow."
"Their desire is quite clear and was restated with great clarity by the Danish people in their referendum."
"Our citizens see the national authorities as the most legitimate, and want the main decisions to be taken at national level."
"We must therefore conclude that if European cooperation is to remain democratic and close to the people, it must be based on the prevailing situation in each nation."
"Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it."
"This is why we appended a minority opinion to the European Parliament report and tabled several amendments, which are, in fact, more than amendments, because if they were adopted, the whole meaning of the resolution would be overturned."
"Europe needs a Charter that acknowledges the pre-eminence of its national democracies, not a constitution that would turn it into a superstate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has very real problems, such as poverty, unemployment, taxation, and lack of security, yet what is proposed instead of addressing these issues?"
"A constitution!"
"That is strange enough in itself, but what will this constitution bring?"
"In its form, so much hot air!"
"In its content, nothing but jiggery-pokery!"
"As to the results it will achieve, a disappearing trick!"
"The hot air as regards the form is to be found, for example in paragraph 11 of the French version of the Duhamel report, a constitution against, I quote, ""a backward step"" going backwards."
"But a backward step is always backwards!"
"Paragraph 20 speaks of a constitution to discuss, and I quote, ""their shared future together"" ."
"But if this future is shared, then obviously they are together."
"Paragraph 8 states that the constitution will deal with, and I quote, the ""issues not settled"" ."
"Well, outstanding accounts may be described as 'not settled' , and there may be answers outstanding, but not issues."
"According to paragraph 4, we need a constitution because the Treaties are ""unreadable and invisible"" ."
"If it is unreadable, people must have attempted to read it, so it cannot be invisible, and so forth."
"What is so serious about Mr Tautology' s report is the fact that he is proposing a constitution based on jiggery-pokery."
"First our nations are abused by this sort of constitutional rapist fiddling with their equality."
"In the enhanced European house, some nations will be sitting at the military, monetary, and possibly tax, tables, and others will be left out."
"In an à la carte Europe, we will then have some nations eating from the set menu."
"That is why reinforced cooperation means reinforced exclusion."
"As nations cannot withstand this attack on their equality, democracy is being abused."
"Paragraph 8 of the constitutional resolution states that Europe' s constitution must be adopted, and I quote, ""with no risk of the process being blocked"" and, as paragraph 7 of the Duhamel report says, ""without a referendum"" there can be no democracy."
"And that is where the jiggery-pokery becomes abuse."
"The rule of unanimity with the sanction of a veto, if required, is the last bastion protecting the smaller nations and sovereignty."
"Because it proved impossible to simply do away with the rule of unanimity, it is being sidestepped by means of reinforced cooperation, which is nothing more than the abuse of sovereignty."
"Who stands to benefit from this?"
"The unemployed?"
"Pensioners on EUR 700 a month?"
"Street children?"
"The Palestinian children of European society?"
"No, it will be the elite that profits from this, the caste which goes by the name of Olivier, Pierre, Dany, all their fathers' sons, the oligarchy."
"That is why men and women prefer Zidane and Schumacher, because at least with Zidane, they have the dream of breaking out of the social Palestine in which you imprison them, whereas, with Prodi, the prospect every morning, every evening and every day is gloomy."
"Mr President, a whole host of names has already been found for the instrument of reinforced cooperation, presumably with a view to making it more comprehensible to the citizens."
"It is not the name though, but the practical form it takes, that will decide whether it will serve the interests of the European Union."
"The report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs argues that differentiation can only be deemed to serve any purpose if it is conceived as a process which allows for exceptions to the rule."
"However, it seems to me that the report inclines in the opposite direction."
"I have always rejected any form of differentiated integration for reasons pertaining to legal theory, but also for pragmatic reasons, believing that it would allow a majority of Member States to determine the direction of policy, and deny countries joining at a later stage any codecision rights in these matters."
"I still clearly recall how, in the time before Amsterdam, in what was still the institutional committee, discussions on flexibility went on for weeks."
"The arguments against and the warnings about a multi-speed Europe, are still ringing in my ears."
"No one has been able to explain to me yet why things are any different now."
"Mr President, I intend to talk about islands."
"When the intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam inserted a special reference to islands into Article 158 on economic and social cohesion, adding the word ""islands"" as a special category under the regions which deserve particular attention within the context of cohesion policies, we here in the European Parliament who had first fought for this development thought that it marked the start of a new era for island regions."
"This conviction was strengthened when declaration No 30 to the new Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted, stating that the intergovernmental conference recognised that island regions faced different problems due to their island status which, because they were permanent problems, hampered their economic and social development, adding that the intergovernmental conference also recognised that Community law should take account of these problems."
"Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed because, in addition to all their other problems, islands are paying the price for the different translations of the point in question."
"According to the first version, the text covers all islands, whereas according to the second version, it only applies to islands with problems."
"Obviously the second version is incorrect, first because regions lagging behind economically are, in any case, covered by the Structural Funds and, secondly, because if this interpretation were correct, there would have been no point in adopting declaration No 30."
"As chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, I should like to reiterate that the European Parliament has always highlighted the fact that island regions are at a permanent disadvantage by reason of their isolation."
"Commissioner Barnier, who was in Crete last weekend and whose position I welcome, saw the ships tied up in the harbours in Crete."
"They have been tied up for five days now and their cargo is not being moved."
"The cost of transportation from an island to the mainland is three times the cost of transportation by road."
"Farmers are often forced to cultivate a product and, if the product does not do well, it is destroyed."
"A kilo of oil, which is a staple product of the Greek islands, costs less than a packet of cigarettes."
"And let us not forget that these people sometimes die on small islands when the weather prevents them from being moved to the mainland."
"We must therefore move in this direction."
"Mr President, despite your final statement, which we would like to be of consequence but we fear will be otherwise, the criticisms made a while ago by this Assembly regarding the current Intergovernmental Conference have proven to be justified."
"Firstly, with regard to the method, which is a tired, lifeless procedure according to public opinion, which in fact marginalises the other institutions of the European Union and in which governments are victims of their own labyrinth."
"Second, with regard to an inadequate agenda, which has left out issues that are particularly relevant to the future of the European Union and its citizens' interests."
"In spite of everything, however, at least the agenda has included one very important point, reinforced cooperation, which must be seen as an incentive for progress and not for dispersal or creating cabinets."
"We must ask for maximum progress to be made in this field in a coherent manner - as indicated in Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado' s excellent report - seeing reinforced cooperation as a last resort that would make it possible in all areas in which decisions are not taken by a qualified majority and also with regard to the CFSP and defence, for the permanence of the single institutional framework to be guaranteed, for a sufficient critical mass of countries to take part in it and, of course, for it to be open at all times."
"This will help to stimulate European construction beyond this IGC and possibly in spite of this IGC."
"In order to achieve this objective we must ask the Nice Council to open up the important reformist approach that can bring together political consensus and public support."
"I am referring to a constituent process of the European Union that would form a new stage - as proposed in the Duhamel report - first by simplifying the treaties and then through a new political instrument creating a system to put an end to the democratic deficit within the European Union. This would be a system of government in keeping with those we use to run our national affairs, beginning with the separation of powers and other principles of the rule of law."
"We need a constitution for the European Union, and this constitution must start right now by including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new Treaty in Nice."
"Mr President, I shall focus my scant sixty seconds on the report by Mr Duhamel, which is a good report, because it has the courage to state things clearly and the eloquence of our rapporteur just now has finally convinced us."
"Yes, the intergovernmental method, in which one blockage appears after another, is close to collapse and this is not going to be belied by the Treaty being presented on the cheap at Nice."
"Yes, it is in the greater interest of the democracy of our continent to have a new founding text and a clear and effective constitution."
"And yes, the drafting of this fundamental law must be steered by the most direct representatives of our citizens, the European Parliament, and must be ultimately validated by the citizens themselves."
"What would happen, however, if the work of the Convention described in the Duhamel report were to become bogged down indefinitely and this constitution which so many people, from Fischer to Chirac, wish to see, were not to be declared until 2004?"
"In this case, as stated in my Group' s Amendment No 37, we should have to go back, in order to reach a decision, to the sovereign people and give the European Parliament that will be elected in 2004 a clear mandate for a constitution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the point raised by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr Segni on the status of the islands which are part of the European Union is an old, controversial issue which clearly cannot be limited to purely linguistic points."
"The issue is a political one and must be tackled and resolved once and for all as such."
"I find it difficult to understand how it is that the Treaty can call for social and economic cohesion to be achieved if, years on, we have still not succeeded in eliminating the ambiguity of the treatment reserved for the islands, which is due to the contradiction between Article 158 of the Treaty and Declaration 30 on the island regions, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Can we not, at last, put an end to this ridiculous line of reasoning which decrees that some islands shall be disadvantaged and others privileged solely on the basis of how far they are from land?"
"I represent the constituency which contains the two largest islands in the Mediterranean - Sicily and Sardinia - and I can say in all honesty that both islands are severely disadvantaged in structural terms precisely because they are islands."
"I will end by calling upon Parliament to make every effort to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference restores to the islands their right to grow and develop."
"Mr President, we have heard that progress was made at Biarritz on closer cooperation."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gil-Robles, on a clear lucid report setting out Parliament' s position."
"My British Conservative colleagues support moves towards greater flexibility."
"We have reservations on the abolition of the veto and progressive elimination of the pillared structure so we shall be constrained to abstain on the overall vote."
"Minister, it is recorded that on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution - an event that was to have such desperate consequences throughout the world - the Russian Orthodox Church was engaged in complex discussions on the design of vestments during Lent."
"This is an apocryphal story to illustrate the dangers of dwelling on the detail of technical matters to the extent of obscuring the massive challenges to be faced."
"I hope the Treaty of Nice is achieved and seen to be a success and that closer cooperation is included as a welcome move in the direction of flexibility."
"But will it be sufficient to ensure that enlargement takes place within the timetable envisaged?"
"Mr Moscovici, will the Nice Treaty really be welcomed and acclaimed in Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Tallinn and Ljubljana?"
"Unless this is the case, it would not be a victory, merely another missed opportunity."
"I hope that the French Presidency will find a more efficient and imaginative way of assuring the candidate countries and the public throughout Europe that we are not only addressing important technical issues but above all the political necessity to provide our continent with stability through the certain and guaranteed enlargement of our European Union."
"Enlargement, Mr President, forces us to face up to the question of whether we intend to move towards purely economic Union or to continue in our endeavour to achieve political Union."
"In my view, the unity of Europe cannot but be political."
"A simple single economic area, even with a single currency, is no replacement for political Union."
"We cannot put this sort of limitation on our ambitions because that would presage the break-up of the Union, even of economic Union."
"Obviously, it would be best if we had or if, in Nice, we could set up institutions to take single common decisions by a suitable majority, possibly a double majority of populations and Member States, which are binding on us all."
"No such institutions exist, or at least not to the required extent."
"Even if all the demands of the French Presidency for qualified majority voting are accepted, large areas of political cooperation will remain uncovered."
"Reinforced cooperation is therefore a de facto requirement, not as an ideal solution, it is certainly not that, but as a practical solution in a time of need, of vital need."
"We must accommodate the Member States which are willing and have the power to move forward and block the Member States which are not willing to move forward."
"The danger, however, is that reinforced cooperation will break up the unity of Europe through the back door, resulting in a patchwork of intergovernmental cooperation."
"Cooperation must therefore offer all the guarantees proposed by the rapporteur, be open to all the Member States, respect the spirit of the Treaties and not undermine the acquis communautaire."
"We need Parliament to control these issues, but I share the view of the President-in-Office that control must not turn into a new veto."
"If, therefore, we insist that Parliament must be able to exercise preventive control, we will have to confine ourselves to controlling questions of legality, not political expediency."
"In addition, the initiative of the Member States ought to be non-binding; more importantly it cannot be subject to a Commission proposal for an initiative because that would do away with the initiative of the Member States."
"Mr President, two brief observations regarding the reports on our agenda today."
"With regard to the Gil-Robles report, I can simply say that it is an example of sound work carried out by our Committee and that the vast majority of our Group will support the report."
"The Duhamel report took a long time to prepare and its content is substantial and interesting. I would like to highlight two amendments tabled by our Group."
"The first amendment concerns the duration of the Convention' s work."
"In our opinion, the new Constitution should even be ready to enter into force by the next European elections."
"Two years of work should be more than sufficient and we hope that the majority of Parliament will support Amendment No 37."
"The second point concerns the difference between the first and second stages."
"We feel that it is essential not so much to simplify and consolidate the Treaty as to turn it into a succinct Constitution which all the European citizens will find readable."
"I therefore feel that it is not really feasible to divide the work into two stages."
"In conclusion, I would in any case like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work and to assure them of the support of my Group."
"Mr President we are at a crucial juncture, firstly because the report by Mr Gil-Robles, which I will cover in just one sentence, enables us to identify and support opportunities for closer cooperation and to dispel the risks and, from that point of view, it is a very good piece of work."
"Nevertheless, I would like to concentrate on the Duhamel report, to emphasise how much progress the idea of a constitution has made, including in this House."
"Everyone, or almost everyone, who has spoken has done so in support of this idea and we feel that this is already a huge victory."
"Why are all these people fighting and militating for the idea of a constitution?"
"They are doing so in order to ensure that Europe becomes a democracy. In other words, all the decisions that are now trapped within the so-called intergovernmental debate, discussions in the corridors of power and behind-the-scenes diplomacy, all these decisions that are taken behind closed doors and shrouded in obscurity will become the business of the citizens, the general public, European public opinion."
"We, of course, take the view that this is the purpose of the constitution, over and above the already positive purpose of clarifying the Treaties."
"As a result of the Duhamel report, we finally have a credible script."
"Even if this two-stage process is not ideal, at least we can see where we are going."
"My last point is that, when it comes to drafting the Constitution for real, the key point will be to determine wherein the legitimacy of the European authority lies, and, in our opinion, it must come from the peoples, from our citizens and their representatives, the European Parliament and perhaps the national parliaments."
"Democracy is the power of the people."
"Mr President, I should like to say a few words to the effect that, in my opinion, the Duhamel report is a truly excellent document, which makes quite substantial progress."
"In fact, I wish it went even further and explicitly discussed a constitution and not merely a framework treaty, a type of treaty, a single treaty or a treaty of treaties, which nevertheless incorporates the Declaration of Fundamental Rights."
"I concede, however, that the political situation has not been conducive to going that far and I therefore give my unreserved support to the Duhamel report currently before us."
"At the same time, there is one point I would like to highlight. I do not think it is right that we should call for or move towards the requirement for a compulsory referendum in every Member State to approve the specific amendments that have been proposed."
"In Portugal, for example, we did not hold a referendum to approve our membership of the European Community or to approve the Maastricht Treaty. These issues were approved by Parliament, in the context of effective representative democracy."
"I fail to see why we should force all Member States to hold referendums, regardless of whether these form part of their traditions or not."
"That is my only reservation. In any case, I warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Duhamel, on his excellent work."
"Mr President, where is the journey into, and with, a united Europe to lead?"
"The debates we are having now will add something to this key issue, which is to be addressed in the decades to come."
"Do we in fact need a constitution for Europe?"
"To what extent should certain important competences, which hitherto have been the preserve of individual Member States, now be the subject of Community policy?"
"The excellent reports by Mr Duhamel and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado expertly point the way on both issues: improved intelligibility of the Treaties, a constitutional framework, fundamental rights, delimitation of competences, constitutional state, democracy and separation of powers; no superstate in Europe, a new method of developing the Treaties."
"The Duhamel report contains important pointers on all these issues."
"The same goes for the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado."
"Reinforced cooperation, so as to escape the stranglehold exerted by national vetos."
"At the same time, we must be sure to retain a European approach, even in areas of reinforced cooperation, and ensure that reinforced cooperation does not exclude countries, but brings them closer together in the long run."
"Both reports leave some questions open, i.e. the answers given are only of a provisional nature."
"Do we really want to hold direct referendums on key European issues?"
"We venture a tentative 'yes' ."
"However, this issue still needs to be discussed in greater depth Do we really want to let a third of the Member States press on ahead?"
"Do we not need at least half of them?"
"We would prefer it if as many Member States as possible could tread the common European path in unison."
"Our task for the future is to make this a reality."
"Reinforced cooperation between a few countries cannot be in the interests of Europe as a whole."
"Mr President, the question tabled by Mr Napolitano on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, refers to a very real issue and I think Commissioner Barnier' s response and that of the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici, were very clear."
"That is, there is an error in the Italian version of the text resulting from an incorrect translation."
"Consequently, the description ""less developed"" is applied to the island regions as well as to the other regions and, according to Mr Barnier' s proposal, what is required here is the amendment of the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention."
"On the other hand, I believe that we should welcome the information that Mr Barnier has just given us; he has proposed a study of the specific problems of the island regions, in accordance with Article 158 and Declaration No 30, appended to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I believe that this would actually be enough to solve the problem raised by the question by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Mr President, the European Union' s achievement has been to interpose a European-wide transnational legal order between national and international law based on the Treaties which, as the European Court of Justice has pointed out, have some of the characteristics of a constitution."
"No-one would hold up the existing structure of the Treaties as a model of their kind and it must be in the interests of the politician, administrator, businessman and citizen to simplify their structure."
"The proposals in the Duhamel report which do that must be welcomed."
"The second part of his report is more ambitious and hence contentious, questioning the mechanics of the way in which the Treaties - and hence the quasi-constitution - is changed."
"It is true that to an English common lawyer this is unknown territory."
"But to those in the United States, Canada or Australia this is much more familiar ground."
"It is an important topic which requires serious attention."
"I say to my own countrymen that it should not be dismissed out of hand."
"Rather, while I am far from convinced by a number of the detailed proposals in the report, I welcome the debate it opens because it raises important questions which require thought-through, considered and dispassionate answers."
"Mr President, as the last speaker, I too should like to congratulate Mr Duhamel on his excellent work and Mr Gil-Robles on his work."
"We have had an in-depth debate on two issues which, although different, converge at one point."
"And both reports basically deal with the manner in which the European process is to continue; the manner in which the framework and the vision of Europe are to be shaped still further."
"Mr Gil-Robles' proposals on reinforced cooperation are, on balance, positive."
"At the same time, Mr Duhamel' s proposals for a constitutional charter for the European Constitution, a constitution of which we are in dire need, are also fundamental."
"And now a word to the President-in-Office, Minister Moscovici."
"The European Parliament has tabled important proposals."
"Now what we need is for the summit in Nice to demonstrate the political will to ensure that the Nice Treaty combines these proposals, and other proposals formulated on other occasions, into an integrated institutional framework which allows the European process to advance properly and the European Union to welcome the new Member States in a positive and sound manner."
"I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the reports by Mr Duhamel and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado will take place shortly."
"The vote on the resolution on the oral questions with regard to the status of the islands will take place on Wednesday."
"VOTE"
"(Procedure without report)"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0268/2000) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 93/42/EEC as regards medical devices incorporating stable derivatives of human blood or human plasma [13561/1/1999 - C5-0331/2000 - 1995/0013 B(COD)]"

"Eriksson (GUE/NGL), rapporteur."
"(SV) Mr President, in accordance with Rule 69(2), I want the discussion of this matter to be discontinued now and re-referred to the Committee."
"We have now obtained a clear position from Parliament but, after yesterday' s debate, it is unclear what the other institutions want."
"I therefore wish to insist upon re-referral to the Committee."
"Mr President, it is probably in order for myself, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee, to say that we have done our best to fulfil both the Council' s and the Commission' s desire to get this proposal through quickly."
"We have worked a little too quickly."
"In the course of yesterday' s debate, we did not, unfortunately, obtain clarity on those issues which really need to be clarified by the Council and the Commission."
"We therefore want the matter re-referred to ourselves."
"We are ready to ensure that it can be put to the vote during the November part-session so that it may, in that way, also be possible for it to be adopted during the French Presidency."
"I therefore support Mrs Eriksson' s proposal on behalf of the Committee."
"(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the Committee responsible)"
"Report (A5-0277/2000) by Mrs Sartori, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments (Council Regulation (EEC) No 1969/88) [COM(1999) 628 - C5-0307/2000 - 2000/0807(CNS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"

"Amendment No 3:"
"Mr President, with regard to Amendment No 3, the votes were 72 for and 56 against."
"Since the honourable Member said she would vote against, this amendment is repealed."
"That does not alter the outcome."
"I am quite clear about that in my mind."
"Mr President, I was seeking your clarification of the Rules on the set of circumstances that were just raised."
"If a machine is not working, is it the case that a vote that is entirely disregarded?"
"If so, it seems to me that is a matter that may require of an amendment in the Rules of this House."
"It clearly is the case that the intention of the House was, by a tied vote, not to carry that particular measure."
"Mr Evans, it is, pursuant to the Rules, for the President to decide whether the result was valid or not."
"Needless to say, the President always hopes that all voting machines are working."
"Should a machine not be in working order, this does not in any way affect the conclusion reached by the President that this vote was carried out in a lawfully valid manner, and I obviously have no intention of changing that conclusion."
"These are the rules."
"Neither do I intend to change the Rules of Procedure."
"That is how it is."
"I do not want a debate on this."
"The rules, ladies and gentlemen, are crystal clear."
"Mr President, I know you hope all the voting machines were working."
"I am afraid mine did not, so that made the majority ""two"" , not ""one"" ."
"That is making matters too complicated, Mr Howitt."
"I will not take this into consideration."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I am sorry to rise again on a point of order but I do so to challenge the ruling you made earlier, not in the context of the debate but in the context of the Rules of this House."
"If there is an equality of votes and if the honourable Member did vote, even though her machine did not work, then the procedure in any parliamentary assembly is that amendment falls."
"Therefore, in those circumstances I want you to tell me which part of our Rules suggests that your ruling is right, when clearly it is not."
"Mr Atkins, that is not how we are going to do things here."
"The rules are crystal clear."
"We held a small procedural debate on it a moment ago."
"Virtually all Members of the House are familiar with this rule."
"The President decides on the validity of the votes."
"I am interested to hear that other parliaments do things differently, but in this Parliament, our rules apply."
"Mr President, I am able to dispel an illusion that certain MEPs have."
"During the vote, which is the subject of the dispute, I voted against by mistake; I actually wanted to vote in favour."
"I have already notified the Registry."
"There was therefore more than one surplus vote."
"Mr President, what is being asked for here is a recipe for chaos."
"As we have heard, some people voted the wrong way, some people' s machines did not work."
"The Rules as they stand are quite acceptable and ensure that you will not have a situation where some people have not voted, where some people' s machines did not work."
"We cannot change the Rules."
"Otherwise it would make things quite impossible: when we have a very tight vote with only a difference of one or two votes, there would be people jumping up all over the place saying their machine did not work, they did not vote, or whatever."
"Mrs McKenna, you are absolutely right."
"I believe we can now close the subject."
"The vote was clear."
"The result was established by the President."
"It is valid."
"There is nothing to add to or detract from this."
"I suggest, honourable Members, that we do not discuss the matter any further."
"Mr President, it is now almost 2 p.m."
"Could you ask the House if wishes to continue voting or if it wishes to stop?"
". (FR) Behind the convoluted wording of this text, there is an outline of a raft of measures, all harmful to workers."
"What is the meaning of the expression ""the deadline within which Member States are required to guarantee unemployed individuals a chance to access an active employment measure should not exceed two years"" , if not a threat to unemployment benefits?"
"What is the meaning of ""the introduction of the opportunity to move towards retirement gradually, via part-time work"" , if not a threat to the age of retirement, which is already far too high in many countries?"
"There is no ambiguity about the repeated calls for making flexibility in employment more common."
"With regard to the passage on work experience in companies, apprenticeships, joint work/training contracts, it aims to make more widespread a practice already adopted by many States which consists, on the pretext on helping workers or unemployed young people, of making a partially or completely subsidised workforce available to employers."
"The icing on the cake for the property-owning classes is the report' s recommendation of something already practised by many States, which is ""the contributions in respect of fiscal and parafiscal charges"" by the authorities on ""domestic work"" , which clearly means taxpayers' subsidising the maids and chauffeurs that the rich are likely to hire."
"Texts like these confirm the fact that the role allotted to the European institutions, including Parliament, is to be of service to the narrow band of the well-to-do."
"It significant that the report reiterates that full employment is one of the Europe' s key objectives under its strategy for economic, employment and social policy. Nevertheless, we must also ensure that we move beyond vague statements and make genuine changes to our macroeconomic and social policies in order to make real progress towards full employment and good-quality jobs."
"It is also significant that the report restates the need to discourage children from dropping out of school early, by giving appropriate support to those with educational problems and raising the age for compulsory education or training to 18. At the same time we must adopt those measures needed to guarantee access to high-quality education and to training geared towards all young people, paying particular attention to lower-income families and those from the most vulnerable parts of society."
"The report does well to state the need to reduce gender gaps with regard to employment, unemployment, pay and sectoral segregation by 50% in the Member States over the next five years. It is also crucial, however, for there to be a real improvement in good-quality jobs, in salaries and in professional development, which we have not yet seen."
"Recommendation for second reading - Trakatellis (A5-0268/2000)"
"I welcome the EP' s adoption of the Trakatellis report as it provides for the setting of high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives."
"EU citizens are entitled to expect the highest level of safety with blood products."
"It is imperative that we safeguard the health, safety and confidence of patients, users and third parties and set conditions on placing such products on the market."
"We must at the same time seek to guarantee continuity of supply of safe products at affordable prices to both individual citizens and public health authorities."
"There is an Italian proverb which says, literally: ""laughter makes good blood"" ."
"Pensioners and the elderly - who, like everybody else, would like to have a healthy circulation - therefore approve of the fact that, every so often, I am able to introduce a lighter note into our proceedings, such as this preamble to my explanation of why I voted for the Trakatellis report."
"My reason for voting for the report is, of course, that pensioners and elderly people are greatly concerned with their health, for it is they who are most frequently hospitalised, and they therefore welcome not only the movement of goods but also the healthy circulation of the blood."
"Souchet report (A5-0228/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Souchet report which is intended to further facilitate the process of turning agricultural products into packaged agricultural products."
"As you know, pensioners, like children, love eating jam."
"I am telling you this because it would be a good idea for the European Union to facilitate the processing of agricultural products further, in order to make it possible for surplus products such as oranges, citrus fruits and other produce to be made into packaged food products - and I stress the word packaged - which could then be used both for the people of the European Union and for other peoples, especially those who do not have enough food."
"MacCormick report (A5-0304/2000)"
"We have voted in favour of Mr MacCormick' s report seeking to uphold Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity. It is not that we think that the purpose of immunity is to place any Member of this House above the law, but because it is, in certain cases, necessary in order to protect the institution and the independence of its Members in the face of measures of persecution."
"Many of us noted the very important development, in section II, paragraph D, on the ""Independent nature of European parliamentary immunity compared with national parliamentary immunity."""
"It is because parliamentary immunity is independent that our institution has the power to review requests for waiver, particularly with regard to 'fumus persecutionis' i.e. the presumption that criminal proceedings have been brought with the intention of causing the Member political damage."
"If we have the power to review requests for waiver, then we have all the more the right to consider breaches of parliamentary immunity, when this is attacked without such a request even being presented!"
"If European parliamentary immunity is independent, the French authorities ought to have consulted us regarding the waiver of Mr Le Pen' s immunity."
"We ought to have studied the outrageous reversal of the concept of flagrante delicto which those authorities committed."
"Before passing judgement, the French Court of Appeal and the Council of State ought to have notified the Court of Justice in Luxembourg that the question had been referred for a preliminary ruling."
"In the absence of these crucial formalities, the President of the European Parliament clearly ought not to have allowed a criminal trial instigated in completely invalid conditions to have any effect on Mr Le Pen' s mandate."
"This is the legal course that our Parliament should follow in order to be consistent with its principles and its legal code, as well as with the letter and the spirit of the treaties."
"A great many of us here would like to hear this stated by the Court of Luxembourg, which is the guardian of the law."
"Klaß report (A5-0195/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted against the Klaß report."
"This is because it confirms the possibility of turning traditional vines into GMO vines and therefore the possibility that, in the future, we will be drinking genetically modified wine."
"I asked the pensioners who sent me here to the European Parliament to represent the Pensioners' Party whether they would like to drink genetically modified wine."
"They replied: 'If genetically modified wine were to cure me of my liver trouble or to prevent me getting liver trouble, then I would be quite happy to drink it."
"Otherwise, why should I agree to drink wine which is different to the wine our ancestors always drank?'"
"Mr President, in the course of this discussion on the Klaß report, I have been unable to comprehend why some people have persistently confused the terms 'genotype' and 'genetic modification' ."
"This has actually hampered the discussion because 'genotype' is a prototype in wine, and wine growing is an extremely varied and dynamic sector characterised by long-established traditions and ancient cultures."
"Vine material provides the basis for optimum grape and wine production in terms of quality, class and quantity."
"Therefore we need these types of vine in order to preserve the variety of the wine, in terms of characteristic flavour, and to prevent cut-price enterprises from undermining this regional variety of vine propagating material and working against it."
"I am particularly disappointed at the European Parliament' s vote on the report on the reproduction of vine plants."
"I am disappointed that Parliament has neither understood nor tried to understand the message of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and of the Greens, who have tried to draw attention to the underhand way in which the executive committee acted in order to water down the issue of GMOs in its reports so that we will end up with vast amounts of them on our plates and in our glasses."
"No, I have not got the wrong debate."
"The Greens are perfectly in tune with public opinion and consumers, who are concerned about future food products."
"The Greens are in tune with wine growers, producers and merchants who are worried about the introduction of GMOs into vine plants."
"By refusing, by 397 votes to 115, to back the amendments proposing to withdraw the references to GMOs, the European Parliament has failed in its role of guardian of the precautionary principle and is guilty of allowing GMOs to be infiltrated into vine plant reproduction through the back door, in contempt of European regulations."
"In my country, Greece, vines are extremely important; they are an integral feature of the landscape and have been bound up with its culture and economy for centuries."
"And, Greece is the only Member State which produces and exports raisins."
"Material for the vegetative propagation of the vine must meet high specifications both from the phytosanitary point of view and as regards certification of the variety or clone, since it is the initial material which a vine-grower wishing to produce high quality vine products and safeguard his income will use to start a vineyard."
"We all know that the directive on material for the vegetative propagation of the vine needed amending, because huge changes have taken place in the 32 years since it was drawn up, both on the market and in the technical and scientific area."
"The changes dictated by the situation on the ground and the requirements of the sector need to be made, but they need to be made in a direction which serves producers and consumers and the report does not move in this direction."
"To be precise, there is no scientific proof that genetically-modified vine varieties pose no risk to human health or the environment and the fact that authorisation may be granted only if all the appropriate steps have been taken to avoid endangering human health does not constitute a safety valve."
"At no point does the report clarify either who will grant the authorisation or what controls will be carried out."
"Given that research into genetically-modified products has been developed and is controlled by a number of large multinational companies which are only interested in increasing their profits and have no interest in protecting human health or the environment, the precarious nature of the supposed authorisation and controls, which are riddled with holes, gives even greater cause for concern."
"It is proposed to allow material for the vegetative propagation of the vine which meets reduced specifications to be marketed when temporary difficulties arise without, however, specifying what these difficulties might be."
"Or even, by way of derogation, for standard material for vegetative propagation to be supplied when demand cannot be met from other categories."
"The main point here is that material for vegetative propagation which meets reduced specifications gives a poorer quality vineyard, thereby jeopardising the vine-grower' s income, while suppliers are in a win-win situation because they are able to sell poor quality products."
"As far as the definition of the clone is concerned, it is inadequate because, basically, the clone is a sub-division of the variety with special characteristics which have to be made known and the definition given does not cover this."
"We note that a newer, more complete definition has been issued by the committee of vine experts."
"As far as new scientific techniques such as in vitro propagation are concerned, reference should be made to the fact that meristem propagation is excluded from in vitro propagation of material because, as we all know from numerous years' experience and experiments by institutes, mutations occur when these points of the plant are used."
"In this proposal, economic interests have prevailed over other considerations."
"When that happens, this very often has unforeseen adverse implications."
"In a number of Member States, growing grapes constitutes an important economic sector, especially since they are used to produce alcohol."
"To some, alcohol, like tobacco and drugs, is a product which can cause a great deal of harm to the users and the people around them; to others, it is mainly a source of employment which can generate large sums of money."
"The proposal to amend the directive on the marketing of vegetative propagation material of the vine is being justified as a tool to reinforce the internal market and to bring a 30-year old regulation up-to-date."
"However, it also seems to be about widening the scope for genetic manipulation."
"Yesterday, the proposal of the Greens and Social Democrats to postpone the decision on the Klaß report until a broader decision-making process on the genetic manipulation of plants is in place, was turned down by a narrow majority of this Parliament."
"For me, this is a reason not to vote in favour of the Klaß report, certainly not at this stage."
"Riis-Jørgensen report (A5-0290/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Riis-Jørgensen report, although it does have some shortcomings."
"Yesterday, I overheard Mr Smith, an Englishman talking to Mr Rossi, an Italian."
"They are old friends and work in the same profession: they both work for furniture factories."
"Mr Smith' s salary is ITL 2.5 million per month whereas Mr Rossi earns less: only ITL 2 million per month."
"The reason is that Mr Smith' s pension contributions are low whereas the amount paid by Mr Rossi is very high."
"But why?"
"This situation is due to the fact that British pension laws make workers' pension contributions bring more return than Italian laws."
"I therefore put it to you, Mr President: are not such discrepancies in contributions also a restriction upon free competition in the European Union?"
"We must give credit to the explanatory statement of this report for stating, quite openly, that, ""Competition policy is clearly one of the most important policies of the European Union."""
"This is really a polite euphemism for the true state of affairs."
"The sole purpose of the European institutions is to try to set some rules for competition."
"Even if it is regulated, the law of the jungle still applies, which means that, whatever industrial or financial groups hold sway, working class consumers and workers are always the victims."
"It is significant that the only aspect of State aid to businesses that perturbs the rapporteur is ""distortion to competition"" and not the fact that this aid always means that the majority of the population is being robbed to help major companies generate private profit for their shareholders."
"With regard to company mergers, which the rapporteur hopes that the Commission will assess, such an assessment should describe not only the competitive advantages and the additional benefits that companies gain from them."
"It would also be useful if the assessment showed how many redundancies they cause, because all the mergers that have been authorised by the Brussels Commission have led to restructuring or, in other words, redundancies."
"These mergers may have brought profits to the shareholders in the companies involved, but they have also cost their workers, their families and society as a whole very dear."
"In April 1999, the Commission proposed a wide-ranging reform of the Community system of competition with regard to the application of Article 81 (prohibiting agreements between undertakings) and Article 82 (prohibiting the abuse of dominant position)."
"The rapporteur generally welcomes the proposals in the Commission White Paper on this subject but is apprehensive of the possible implications of the reform, which aims principally to decentralise the implementation of competition rules."
"She feels that abolishing the notification and authorisation systems and enhancing the role of national legal systems in disputes concerning Community competition law will lead to the renationalisation of this policy."
"While we would not all agree with every aspect of EU competition policy, it has certainly been a successful policy over a period of 43 years and it has helped to prohibit the abuse of dominant positions by companies within the European Union."
"I would not like to see a situation where the primacy of Community law with regard to the implementation of EU competition rules and regulations was threatened in any shape or form."
"The uniform application of EU competition laws throughout the EU must be paramount."
"Therefore, I welcome the call by the rapporteur to the European Commission to provide additional guarantees concerning the application of competition law within the Member States."
"This will include, in particular, involving the European Parliament more closely in drawing up and implementing competition policy and monitoring the quality of legislation on competition within the various Member States of the EU and the applicant countries to the EU."
"There must be clear mechanisms set up for allocating cases between national authorities and the European Commission in order to prevent shopping around for the most advantageous legal system which might be available for various legal applicants."
"In principle, the decentralised application of Community law can only be a success if there are strong commitments given that this will be uniformly applied across all the territories of the European Union."
"This report reflects the European Commission' s policy of giving priority to competition policy, even when, in the name of this policy, workers' fundamental rights are threatened, or privatisations go ahead. These privatisations turn public-sector companies that are accused of enjoying a monopoly into effective private monopolies and often undermine public services that are essential to improving people' s quality of life, which is what has happened in Portugal."
"The social dimension is totally absent from the report and the rapporteur even goes so far as to state that ""when examining whether a conduct restricts competition, focus should be on the harm caused to competition, not to the competitors."" Its view is that that ""competition cases should be based on economic analysis"" ."
"The report also advocates mergers between companies, even between those on a large scale, on the pretext of international competitiveness, but it ignores any social consequences that may result from this situation."
"We therefore felt bound to vote against the report, which is what we did."
"Jonathan Evans report (A5-0281/2000)"
"Mr President, in order to explain the reasons for my declaration with reservations in favour of the Evans report, I would like, this time, to tell you about a conversation between Carlo and François."
"They are the same age, 50 years old, and they have been doing the same job for the same number of years."
"Carlo has invited François to dinner."
"'Why are you inviting me to dinner?' asks François."
"And Carlo replies: 'I am inviting you to dinner because, although I am still a young man - 50 years old - I have been given early retirement by my government."
"Tomorrow I am not going to work, I will become a pensioner, because my country, Italy, has a system of early retirement."
"However, I know that you will have to continue to work for another 10 years."
"That is why I am inviting you to dinner.'"
"I put it to you once again, Mr President: is this not also a State aid which should be included in the survey?"
"Mr Fatuzzo, I am unable to answer that question, for this is an explanation of vote."
"I am not the executive but rather the President of this House at this moment in time."
"During the debate yesterday evening, I welcomed the work of Mr Evans, but I was immediately bound to express my deep disagreement with the rather too liberal, not to say ultraliberal, tenor of his report."
"Not only did Mr Evans deny the fact that state aid was cut in the period 1994-1998, even though the Commission itself acknowledged this reduction, but, even more seriously, he continually and obsessively dwelt on the exceptional nature of state aid, even though the Treaty envisages the granting of such aid in order to achieve the objectives established in the Treaties, such as the environment and social cohesion, and even though the Commission itself acknowledges that certain policies cannot be supported by market forces alone."
"Hence my recommendation last night not to endorse the report as it stands."
"Whilst I could agree with the requests for increased transparency regarding state aid, and for the European Parliament to be informed about the follow-up to aid approved by the Commission, I called for state aid to be maintained in order to develop social cohesion, research and innovation or environmental protection, to offset gaps in the market, to promote European competitiveness in relation to other countries and to confront the fraudulent machinations of competitor countries, such as Korea in the field of shipbuilding."
"I added that the supervision of state aid should be carried out within the strict framework of the Treaties' provisions and not according to the prevailing liberal ideology."
"I believe that, somewhere between the 'all-powerful state' , which nobody wants anymore, and the 'non-existent state' , which is simply the modern form of the survival of the fittest, this thing that many would call the 'European social model' requires us to look for the balance between what can be regulated by the market and what state authorities should regulate!"
"That is why I put forward and voted for the Socialist Group' s amendments."
"As the right forced them to fight, I did not vote for the report."
"State aids have been traditionally used by Member States as instruments of industrial and social policy."
"Notwithstanding the move towards greater deregulation within the European Union, state aids can still play a constructive role in achieving social and economic progress."
"I am a member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Connaught/Ulster."
"This whole region has been classified as an Objective 1 area for the seven-year period 2000-2006."
"If a particular region is accorded such classification then the businesses which set up in that region are entitled to receive a higher percentage of state aid than within a non-Objective 1 region."
"In fact, one can recall that 40% grant aid is available for fixed investment costs for new businesses setting up within the Objective 1 region in Ireland."
"There can also be a further top-up arrangement of 15% for fixed investment costs for small and medium sized enterprises."
"For the purposes of this grant aid, a small and medium-sized enterprise is a company that employs less then 250 people."
"Permission to grant such grant aid to companies setting up in the Objective 1 region serves a very positive economic and social purpose."
"It ensures that the further drift from rural to urban areas may be arrested."
"It also ensures that greater inward investment can take place into this region in an effort to bolster job opportunities for young people growing up in such areas."
"I welcome the recent statement that radical changes are now being implemented by IDA Ireland in terms of attracting more jobs to the Objective 1 region in Ireland."
"IDA Ireland has been reorganising that focus so as to win half of all new jobs from Greenfield Projects in the Objective 1 region over the coming three years."
"This re-focus is beginning to take effect and given time and the implementation of the Government' s Programmes on Infrastructure, as outlined in the National Development Plan for the period 2000-2006, the IDA is certainly confident that it can reach this target for new projects in the Objective 1 region."
"There are too many regions presently at a disadvantage from an uncompetitive infrastructure and from the lack of the business support services which are needed if the required level of new and modern business investment is to be achieved."
"I believe the Regional State Aid Guidelines which have been put in place to help job creation in the Objective 1 region can be implemented in their entirety and will redress regional imbalances which exist in Ireland and elsewhere."
"I would also point out that many Irish-speaking areas within the constituency of Connaught/Ulster and Udaras Na Gaeltachta will also be playing a pivotal role in creating new industries in the Objective 1 region over the coming years."
"My opinion of paragraphs 4, 17 and 18 is positive, but is negative on paragraph 2, on the other hand."
"State aid should certainly not serve as an incentive for companies to relocate from one Member State to another."
"That would only encourage companies to use government funding to make labour more flexible by constantly moving to the areas with the lowest wages, worst working conditions, lowest prices for land and the most backward environmental requirements."
"I drew the attention of the European Commission to this issue in July 1999, and received a positive response."
"I therefore agree with the thrust of paragraph 4 which supports this viewpoint."
"I am less pleased with the idea expressed in paragraph 2 that state aid should not go up."
"That aid could well be indispensable to the protection of the environment and public services and to guaranteeing equal income levels for people living in economically disadvantaged regions."
"I back the criticism voiced with regard to tax exemptions, which fuels unfair competition in favour of aviation, as compared with other modes of transport, and I also support the incentives to save energy and look into renewable energy sources."
"My final verdict is therefore positive."
"Unbridled competition has become the latest neo-liberal fad."
"The principle of market rules as the sole form of social regulation tends to do away with man and his creativity as individuals in the economy and the productive process and, more importantly, is indifferent to man' s prosperity and only interested in the welfare of enterprise."
"Everyone knows that, even if the rules of competition are transparent and apply to everyone, not that this ever was or ever will be the case, not everyone has access to those rules on equal terms, with the result that the familiar law of the jungle applies, might is right and monopolies rule OK."
"Sometimes, when the consequences of this policy cause an outcry, state intervention, aid and other economic and fiscal incentives come along and go some way to restoring the situation."
"Intervention does not even break the surface of the capitalist system and often supports selected companies and businesses."
"However, it is not these ""deviations"" that are being targeted in the desperate attempt to abolish state aid; its purpose is to increase the profits of strong companies and consolidate their position on the market without any danger from new competitors."
"The less developed regions of the EU, the less developed sectors and the poorer social classes know that, without state intervention, the development differential will increase steadily at their expense."
"They know that, without a strong, productive and efficient public sector, there is no light at the end of the tunnel."
"They also know that the economy is being restructured and the public sector sold off not for their benefit but in order to support big business and increase its profitability."
"Selling off the nation' s silver is one of the quickest ways to weaken the grass roots factor and minimise the means at its disposal."
"In other words, apart from increasing profitability, it also hands big business an important political weapon to combat grass-roots demands."
"We find the constant pressures and concomitant institutional measures, such as the proposed state aid register and scoreboard, unacceptable."
"There is a danger, once the EU is safely in control of large state aid, of its turning its attention to small-scale aid on the pretext of the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Big business is showing, in the choices it is making, that it is seriously worried about the possibility of competitiveness controls by the Member States, not by the Commission of the EU."
"The intolerable situation being forced on workers by the choices made by large companies and the EU is already causing widespread reaction."
"The number of demonstrations against ""globalisation"" and the rule of the uncontrolled laws of the market is increasing rapidly."
"Attempts to erode measures to protect workers still further, the attack from all fronts on the rights which they have fought for, in conjunction with attempts to minimise the specific weight of the public sector and the balancing function which state aid can exercise, do nothing except increase grass-roots dissatisfaction and leave workers no choice but to fight and resist."
"That concludes the votes."
"(The sitting was suspended at 2.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"2001 budget procedure"
"The next item is the joint discussion on:"
"the report (A5-0300/2000) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the EU draft general budget for 2001: Section III, Commission, (C5-0300/2000 - 1999/2190(BUD))"
"the report (A5-0292/2000) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the EU draft general budget for 2001 (C5-0300/2000 - 1999/2191(BUD))"
"Section I, European Parliament;"
"Section II, Council;"
"Section IV, Court of Justice;"
"Section V, Court of Auditors;"
"Section VI, Economic and Social Committee;"
"Section VII, Committee of the Regions;"
"Section VIII, Ombudsman"
"the report (A5-0251/2000) by Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the ECSC draft operating budget for 2001 (COM(2000) 360 - C5-0340/2000 - 2000/2060(BUD))"
"the report (A5-0236/2000) by Mr Colom i Naval, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Interinstitutional Agreement on financial statements."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would also have been delighted to welcome our Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Budgetary discussions are nearly always guided by the principle that money is not everything, but without money, all is nothing."
"It is marvellous to have you with us Commissioner."
"So here we are in October 2000, with only a short while to go before the financial framework for Budget 2001 is agreed."
"Over the past few weeks we have repeatedly scrutinised all the figures, forecasts, and categories of our budget."
"We have turned each individual budgetary line inside out, so that the figures we decide on on Thursday are viable, and so that Budget 2001 does not have a fairytale-like quality."
"We will submit a budget that accords with the principles of wholly economical budgetary management."
"We have been very careful with the European taxpayer' s money, very strict yet still reasonable."
"The figures that we, as Parliament' s Committee on Budgets, are to put before the House, will not meet - and of course we are a little disappointed about this - with the unanimous support of all our fellow delegates in the specialist committees."
"But we set our own rules, and even kept to them and acted in accordance with previously adopted principles."
"By the time we had finished, our draft for the first reading could be said to be true to the motto that the art of drawing up a budget is to spread the disappointments evenly."
"No doubt it is the Council that has been left most disappointed, but it has absolutely no one but itself to blame for this, indeed it probably deliberately provoked it. How else are we to interpret the Council' s proposal that payments should be increased by a maximum of 3.5%?"
"Parliament, at any rate, understands that the payments to be included in Budget 2001 are a function of the commitments entered into in previous years and those we hope to enter into in 2001, and we must determine them accordingly."
"Even the Commission' s estimate of payments for the preliminary draft budget has been very cautious, too cautious as far as we are concerned."
"If you look at the budgetary implementation schedules for headings 2, 3, 4 and 7, then you will note that only an average 8% of all commitments are covered by payments."
"Quite a number of budgetary lines are not covered at all."
"When you then consider that the Commission would concentrate initially on cutting back the amounts outstanding in such a situation, which naturally we would also favour, there would, however, be far too great a risk of not being able to continue with a budgetary line deemed important by Parliament."
"It is a mystery to me how, on this basis, the Commission is to preserve the strict relationship between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations, which it is in fact committed to do under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Therefore, in principle, we have raised the payments in headings 3, 4 and 7 to a level that will ensure 25% coverage of the commitments to be entered into in 2001 as regards individual budgetary lines."
"However, we sometimes asked ourselves during the discussions, how the Council could justify its vote, for example with regard to heading 1."
"When the Commission put forward a proposal, in late spring, to take the EUR 300 million required for the revision of heading 4 from the margin left in heading 1, the Council vehemently resisted this straightaway."
"On no account was the margin to be reduced!"
"But that did not stop the Council from cutting agricultural expenditure by a total of EUR 555 million."
"Where is the logic in that?"
"Essentially, we have reinstated the preliminary draft budget in its entirety."
"Above all, we want there to be sufficient money available under heading 1B, for the development of rural areas."
"There must also be adequate funding available for those areas whose aim it is to achieve a knowledge-based society and to improve the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union."
"We took the Commission' s line and increased expenditure for research by 8%."
"What is particularly dear to our hearts though, is something that we have campaigned for from the very outset of this budgetary procedure, i.e. to be able to make an appropriate contribution, through the European budget, to fighting unemployment."
"The level of unemployment in Europe is still intolerably high."
"Countermeasures must be taken against this at every political level; i.e. at local, regional, national, and I hardly need mention, at European level."
"Three years ago, we launched our employment initiative, which involved helping small and medium-sized enterprises to acquire risk-bearing capital."
"We are all aware that most jobs in Europe are in small and medium-sized enterprises, and that they are the ones that create the most new jobs."
"We all know too, that it is no longer all that difficult for high-tech SMEs to acquire capital, because - and our initiative helped bring this about - the capital market situation of these companies has in fact improved considerably."
"Therefore we want an employment initiative with a slightly different emphasis."
"We want to carry on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they are able to benefit from our common market in exactly the same way that larger companies do."
"Above all, we want to equip them to make use of the new technologies."
"The various instruments we have at our disposal to this end should enable us to succeed in this, whether we are talking in terms of start-up capital, sureties, loan guarantees, or even the joint European venture instrument."
"Cross-border cooperation between SMUs is precisely what we need to create the European added value we are all always so keen to achieve."
"We should therefore continue to deploy this instrument, albeit using simplified procedures, as proposed by the Commission."
"We have therefore earmarked almost EUR 120 million for two budgetary lines combined."
"If you now take a look at the lines covering labour market measures and local employment initiatives, you will see that a total of almost EUR 150 million has been made available for job creation measures under heading 3."
"That, to my mind, sends out a clear signal."
"Clearly, we also want to help with the reform of the Commission, and provide support where this has an impact on the staffing situation."
"We accept that 400 new posts need to be created, but would attach certain conditions to this."
"We expect the Commission to set out, before the second reading, how it intends to implement the Budget more efficiently."
"We expect it to explain to us what steps it will take to ensure that Parliament receives better information more quickly, and is kept up-to-date on the implementation of the reform package."
"We expect it to step up the efforts it is making to bring the legislative process more into line with the budgetary process."
"In addition, naturally we take the view that it would not be acceptable simply to create 400 additional jobs, i.e. on top of those already in existence."
"Therefore we welcome with open arms the fact that early retirement arrangements have been put in place as part of the reform process."
"Quite often, the drafting of the Budget is seen as a methodical way of establishing the sad fact that we cannot get by on our revenue."
"I believe that is what many of us - i.e. many of you - think when you consider heading 4 of the budget."
"After all, we are very poorly provided for when it comes to financing our external policy."
"For more than a year now, Parliament has been urging the Council to work with it on negotiating stable and secure reconstruction aid for the Balkans."
"The Council has persistently refused to do so."
"The people of the Balkans have repeatedly been promised aid by the various Council Summit Meetings."
"However, back home, the Council shirks from countersigning the promised cheque."
"In other contexts, people would say they had been 'duped' ."
"In drawing up its preliminary draft budget in June, not only did the Commission endeavour to secure the financing for the Balkans aid, it also tried not to cut back on the other areas of external policy too heavily."
"That is precisely when it did the logical thing and proposed the revision of heading 4."
"But not only did the Council refuse to negotiate with us over a possible revision of this kind, it even went so far, at its first reading, as to reduce the funding for the Balkans, MEDA and TACIS by EUR 200 million, EUR 150 million, and EUR 20 million respectively."
"And I have only mentioned the worst of the cuts at that."
"This is completely unacceptable!"
"Parliament will abide by its traditional priorities."
"We will make appropriate sums available for those of our budgetary lines concerned with democracy and human rights, cooperation with non-governmental organisations working in the interests of the poorest countries, our cooperation with Latin America, South Africa and Asia."
"We will adopt the Council' s proposed level of funding for MEDA, and would urge the Council to join us in using the flexibility instrument, should it become apparent in the course of next year that MEDA requires more money."
"But let us return to the Balkans."
"Our margin will allow us to pitch the level of reconstruction aid EUR 50 million higher than the figure decided by the Council."
"Add to this our carry-over from Budget 2000 to Budget 2001 under the Notenboom procedure and we will have the amount that the Commission deems appropriate."
"Following the happy outcome of the elections in Serbia, we are, however, now obliged to support Serbia with financial aid and not just with fine words and grand proclamations."
"Parliament' s preferred approach is twofold."
"We have created a new budgetary line entitled 'democratisation' ."
"EUR 60 million have been set aside for this purpose, which is money our Budget can easily spare."
"But we want to reinforce the point that this is intended for the democratisation process in Serbia."
"We have created a second budgetary line entitled 'reconstruction' ."
"We have included a so-called token entry in this."
"We urge the Council to join Parliament in weighing up all the possibilities that the Interinstitutional Agreement has to offer, and to set an appropriate level of funding for aid to Serbia."
"This is irrespective of the EUR 180 million we transferred last night for emergency aid, for the remainder of the year, because this money has come from the emergency reserve and is only to be used for humanitarian aid, i.e. to help the Serbs get through the winter during the last few months of the year."
"In addition, though, we expect the Council to finally get together with Parliament and take a look at the multiannual allocations, both for MEDA and for CARDS, and decide on a suitable figure."
"We cannot go on like this, slugging it out with one another budget after budget; always over the same issues, and always going through the same motions."
"On Thursday we will adopt a trim, but sensible budget."
"All I can say to the Council is: follow our example."
"Our goal cannot be to diet to the point of collapse."
"All too often, weight-consciousness turns into anorexia."
"But there is more to a viable and dynamic Union than a supposedly slimline budget."
"If we want to command respect on the international stage, strength and competence are the order of the day!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the budgets of the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman, are purely administrative budgets."
"However, they provide an insight into how the policies of individual European institutions are translated into concrete action."
"As your rapporteur, I have made three guidelines central to my deliberations."
"Firstly - and this applies to all public budgets - we must make responsible and economical use of our taxpayers' money."
"Secondly, we must be prepared for the major challenge of enlargement in terms of staffing; in other words, we must now create the financial leeway we need to be able to rise to this challenge when the time comes."
"Thirdly, at the end of the day, the taxpayers must get added value for their money."
"Only then will the European institutions do justice to their task."
"Following in-depth discussions with the relevant institutions and the honourable Members, whom I would like to thank most sincerely for their excellent and friendly cooperation, I am able to put before you today a draft budget that fully accords with these three guidelines."
"With a total of EUR 980 million, the European Parliament' s budget, which I am submitting today, is the largest individual budget."
"My efforts were directed at developing delegates' working conditions in such a way as to enable us to master the new challenges in our work arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This Parliament represents the people of Europe."
"We are the only institution in Europe that can claim this with complete justification."
"Hence the administration of this House is there to serve the delegates, and not vice versa."
"I believe that through this budget, we have succeeded in turning this consideration into figures and using it to good effect."
"Scientific preliminary work is one area in particular where there is still plenty of room for improvement in our work."
"I hope that the administration will take this up over the next few months and work towards a solution."
"We upheld the demands of Parliament' s Bureau as regards the establishment plan, in so far as this could be justified by the Committee on Budgets."
"Also, in light of the fact that Parliament now has a transparent promotion system, which rewards on the basis of merit and not just according to length of service in a post, we approved all the announced promotions."
"The Committee on Budgets supported the necessary increases in funding in the sphere of information technology, especially with regard to data security - where there is a great deal of room for improvement in this House - as well as the increases needed for enhancing the security of our buildings and of all those who work there, and for the legal service."
"One point I would like to make very clear is that when it comes to the buildings policy, we are suffering the effect of increased interest rates."
"In fact we are directly linked to the interest rate set by the European Central Bank, which is why we have proposed that we should pursue the buildings policy already adopted, because this will help to release us from this burden of interest as soon as possible."
"I would like to take this opportunity to expressly thank the Vice-President, Mr Gerhard Schmid, who is responsible for budgetary issues, for his constructive cooperation."
"I believe that we succeeded, in the course of the conciliation negotiations between the Bureau of the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgets, in submitting a well-balanced draft."
"We have made no change to the Council Budget, as per the agreement between Parliament and the Council."
"However, I would also like to take this opportunity to make the Council aware that the Council Budget is a purely administrative budget too."
"The Council would do well to ensure that that is how things remain in future, particularly in the sphere of foreign and security policy."
"Programme expenditure has no place in the Council Budget."
"It must be provided for in the Commission Budget on a permanent basis."
"Being one arm of the budgetary authority, we will continue to keep tabs on this."
"The European Court of Auditors is giving us the least cause for concern at present."
"The Court of Auditors has honoured the commitments it made of its own volition years ago."
"That is why we have released the funds required for the extension of the building of the Court of Auditors."
"However, I would also expressly like to point out that we will make very sure that total spending remains within the target of EUR 25 million at 1998 prices."
"I believe the European Court of Justice is the one institution that will understand why we should want to keep a suitably close eye on this."
"The biggest problem we face at the moment is the hold-ups that have occurred within the translation service of the European Court of Justice."
"The consequences of this are no longer to be tolerated, because proceedings at the European Court of Justice now take an average of almost two years, simply because the translation services are no longer able to keep up with the work. Therefore, with effect from the new year, we intend to make a substantial contribution to reducing this translation backlog."
"But here too, we will monitor very closely whether any real improvement takes place in the situation at the European Court of Justice."
"Should this prove not to be the case, we will be forced to take further measures, which will certainly be less kind than those we are proposing for the 2001 financial year"
"The Economic and Social Committee is still a real problem child."
"We want this committee to retain its viability, but it pays the least attention to Parliament' s demands as part of the budgetary authority. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue."
"We do not just make resolutions to please all those involved, they are supposed to have an impact on the financial management of all the institutions."
"The Economic and Social Committee must get its own house in order if it wants to avoid jeopardising its continued existence for good."
"I hope that this issue will be tackled courageously over the next few months."
"I also hope that the Nice Summit will send out a clear signal in this respect."
"But it is this committee, in particular, that has follow-up work to do here."
"The Committee of the Regions is currently giving less cause for concern."
"Things are not running quite as smoothly as we imagine them to be there either."
"This is another area where our resolutions should be treated with due respect."
"A better system is called for, particularly where promotion policy is concerned."
"However, as I understand it, one is currently being prepared."
"That being the case, I believe we will be in a position to approve the necessary promotions within the Committee of the Regions."
"Finally, we also handle the Ombudsman' s budget."
"We could be relatively restrained here because the Council has in fact already arranged for all the necessary measures to be taken, so that all we have to do in this round is confirm them."
"With your permission, I would like to make two closing comments."
"It seems to me to be very dangerous to work for one particular institution, because the sickness record is disproportionately high there."
"Naturally we will have to examine, on the basis of these reports, what measures need to be taken to improve the state of health of the staff in this institution - and I am not talking about Parliament or the Commission - for whom we do, after all, have a special responsibility."
"Secondly, we suggest that the budgets of both data protection officers - that of the Commission and that of the officer provided for under the Schengen Agreement - should be given separate sections, so that the rights of the budgetary authority are fully upheld and transparency is duly assured on an ongoing basis."
"The comprehensive set of figures that I have put before you today, in my capacity as rapporteur, is something to be proud of."
"I would be delighted if you could support the Committee on Budget' s proposals when it comes to Thursday' s vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ECSC Treaty will expire in June 2002."
"In other words, the year 2001 will see the last full annual budget, and will also form the background to the assessment of the Commission proposal and the proposal that we are in the process of submitting to Parliament."
"The Commission has proposed that the appropriations should be increased to EUR 190 million, as compared with EUR 176 million the previous year."
"This corresponds, or rather, comes very close to what Parliament proposed during the previous budgetary procedure, i.e. EUR 196 million."
"Therefore, we emphatically support this proposal, although we feel the breakdown of allocations could be better."
"We believe that changes are called for here, and would urge the Commission to look into this."
"It is the situation with regard to administrative expenditure that we are most concerned about."
"We suggest a cut in redeployment aid, aid for research and social aid, and I intend to be more specific here."
"In other words, we do not approve of cuts in the sphere of research."
"On the contrary, we feel that there should be increased efforts in research, particularly in view of the candidate countries."
"As a result of enlargement, coal production will double and there will be a significant increase in steel production, and we believe therefore, that we urgently need a modernisation and restructuring process."
"We must step up our efforts to this end, and we need research into environmentally sustainable technologies."
"We suggest that as soon as the ECSC Treaty has expired and the appropriations have been transferred into the EU budget, the candidate countries should be given the opportunity to participate in the coal and steel research financed by the Community, following the example of the SOCRATES and LEONARDO programmes."
"We believe this to be an important proposal, in terms of achieving environmentally sustainable, modernised steel and coal production in Europe, and also with respect to the financing of these areas and the conversion measures."
"Secondly, we want a review of the relationship between he social measures and the redeployment aid."
"The social measures were cut from EUR 31 million to EUR 29 million in the Council' s proposal."
"We cannot comprehend this."
"We believe that it is imperative for structural redeployment aid to be provided in this area."
"The level of employment has dropped from 15% to 5% since 1999, and it is vital that we respond to this."
"On the other hand, we do not believe that the redeployment aid can be cut."
"Its capacity has not been fully exploited in recent years."
"In 1999, for example, only half of the allocation was actually used."
"However, the Commission, in making this increase, wants to cover the whole period up to June 2002."
"This seems odd to us because there will still be an operational budget in the second part of 2002, and so we are calling for a review of the relationship between redeployment aid and social aid."
"In addition, we want there to be a review of the administrative expenditure."
"Parliament has been proposing cuts for a long time now."
"In view of the decline in ECSC activities, and the conversion, it is debatable as to whether we can really still justify having an administrative budget of this size."
"Another important point I would like to make is that once the Treaties have expired, we no longer want a separate regime for the ECSC, but feel that it should be integrated into the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"The Commission has echoed this proposal, and we are now prepared to support it."
"Maintaining a separate entity would entail extra costs without achieving any added value, and instead we should set up a specialised sub-committee operating under the framework of existing EU structures."
"Furthermore, we propose that Parliament should be kept informed on a regular basis."
"In a statement before Parliament in 1973, the Commission undertook to accept the binding nature of Parliament' s positions with regard to the ECSC."
"We expect this commitment to be transferred to the new structures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two dangers threaten the health of MEPs: heart attacks and attacks of modesty."
"I hope, therefore, that you will forgive me if I avoid the latter and describe my short report as extremely important, and express my pleasure at its almost unexpected success with the Commission and the Council."
"The report was unanimously approved by the Committee on Budgets a few weeks ago and, to date, no amendments have been tabled."
"It is to be hoped, therefore, that on Thursday it should in principle be approved without any difficulty."
"Nonetheless, allow me to explain some of its basic elements."
"The proposal I am asking you to support by voting in favour of the report is the result of a long process and fulfils an aspiration that has been held by Parliament almost since its inception."
"Since 1985 - and I did say 1985 - the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets has been trying to ensure that European Parliament procedures take account of the financial impact of the resolutions voted upon in plenary."
"And then, a long time ago, 15 years ago, a working party was set up for that purpose."
"We also asked the Council - with what success we do not know - to adopt a similar approach."
"Although in the Decision of 24 June 1988 on budgetary discipline, the Council established a link between legislation and finance that was subsequently incorporated into the EC Treaty as Article 270, you will grant me that even the Council itself has not taken great pains to comply with this Decision."
"What is the problem, ladies and gentlemen?"
"I think I can say that, essentially, the problem is the tremendous increase in legislative work in the European Union as a whole, in particular the exponential growth of legislative codecision, the huge range of legislative decisions taken in parallel."
"In accordance with current legislation, the Commission currently sends us, together with its drafts, a balance sheet that includes what is basically a multiannual proposal for budgetary programming corresponding to the draft."
"Nonetheless, as everyone knows, the human race can be divided into two classes: those who adhere to the budget and those who do not."
"That is why, when the Ministers for Foreign Affairs meet and take some commendable decision or other, such as helping Kosovo or Serbia, the least of their concerns is whether there is enough money to finance the decision and whether it has to be taken from elsewhere, such as aid to development in Africa, the MEDA programme or the promotion of human rights in the former Soviet Union."
"This is the trouble with the Cars proposal, for example, which is currently under discussion."
"When a legislative conciliation takes place on social, cultural or environmental issues - and the Commissioner will recognise that I am right - the Commissioner for Budgets, the Ministers for Finance and the members of the Committee on Budgets all pray that a financial blunder will not occur."
"The agreement reached in July involves an increase in the information contained in the financial statement."
"In future, all new proposals must be accompanied by an assessment of their compatibility with the financial perspective and its needs with regard to lists of budgetary posts."
"The Commission is implicitly required to consider at the beginning of the legislative procedure whether it has the necessary human resources and whether the proposal might require a revision of the financial perspective or a redeployment of previously approved programmes."
"In short, an opportunity cost analysis."
"Many of the problems explained to us by Mrs Haug arise from the fact that the total cost of the programmes exceeds the total amount of the corresponding heading in the financial perspective."
"The poor implementation of some programmes can also be explained or justified by a lack of staff."
"Commissioner Patten thus proposes reducing the cost of the MEDA programme and simultaneously increasing its staff by 25 posts."
"This is a prime example of what we are trying to avoid a priori."
"We are therefore also going to change our internal Rules of Procedure in order to take account of this agreement."
"We believe that this declaration should be included in the Interinstitutional Agreement, but in any case, I would like to say to you that it only makes sense within the context of an Interinstitutional Agreement with a financial perspective."
"I shall end, Mr President, by thanking the other institutions for their diligence in the handling of this joint declaration."
"Parliament reiterated its suggestion during a three-way dialogue that took place halfway through the Portuguese Presidency and concluded with an agreement at the first conciliation presided over by France in July."
"This is a real record, which I hope will now lead to greater consideration of the financial constraints in our legislative activities."
"Thank you, Mr Colom i Naval."
"Modesty has prevented you from ending the list of rapporteurs with your own name."
"It is now my great pleasure to welcome to this Chamber a brand new minister from my country, who will be speaking in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your welcome."
"It is with no little emotion that I stand before you for the very first time in this magnificent hemicycle, which is laden with so much meaning."
"I am honoured to be participating in this part-session of the European Parliament, which will examine - and I am sure adopt at first reading - the Community budget for 2001."
"This is a unique opportunity for me in more ways than one, as Florence Parly, the French Secretary of State for the budget and chairman of the French budget committee, is unable to be here today. She has asked me to send you her apologies and to speak on her behalf."
"The examination of the budget is an important aspect of parliamentary life."
"The budget is also of major importance to the governments and citizens of Europe since it sets out Europe' s broad guidelines for action in 2001."
"In Brussels last week I was able to see for myself the high level of consultation within the trialogue, and so now I am here today."
"I would like to say that this budget procedure has been conducted in an excellent atmosphere so far."
"The meetings that we have, in more than one instance, held together, proved to be beneficial and enabled a better mutual understanding of our respective priorities."
"This partnership between the Council and Parliament on budgetary matters should be developed further."
"I hope that the budget discussions can continue in the same vein so that we can come up with a budget for the financial year 2001 that equips us with the resources to meet the priorities and challenges that await the European Union."
"You are called on today to decide on a budget that has already been amended at first reading by the Council."
"I would therefore like to quickly remind you the broad guidelines that the Council wanted to give to the 2001 budget."
"I would also like to emphasise the Council and Parliament' s common objectives, which will in my opinion enable these two arms of the budgetary authority to arrive at an agreement."
"On 20 July, the Council adopted a draft budget that marked a 2.8% increase in commitment appropriations and a 3.5% increase in payment appropriations compared with the budget for 2000."
"In growing by 3.5% for the year 2001, the draft Community budget is being increased by a far greater margin than the Member States are permitting themselves for their national budgets."
"This increase is also far above the inflation rate forecast by the Commission for 2001 of plus 1.8%, which shows how committed the Council is to financing European Union policies."
"This draft budget constitutes a balanced and realistic compromise."
"The Council did not opt for a tactical first reading, which would have consisted of adopting a hard-line stance on stabilising Community public expenditure and resulted in contentious budget negotiations with Parliament."
"I view this as an outmoded approach."
"The Council voted through, at the first reading, the appropriations that it felt to be justified for 2001, without taking into consideration any tactical concerns would only work against the objective of the sound allocation of appropriations, which is the objective that the Community institutions must pursue."
"The Council' s draft budget enables the financing of all the European Union' s policies and priorities to be reconciled without imposing an excessive burden on the Member States, who I would remind you are currently in the process of bringing their own public expenditure under control."
"In identifying margins for manoeuvre, notably as regards the ceiling set for heading 3 and heading 4, it is also been the Council' s intention to let Parliament, which has the final say on non-compulsory expenditure, set out its priorities without calling into question the Council' s priorities."
"So I would simply like to stress the salient points of the Council' s draft budget."
"First of all, the draft budget provides for priority aid to the Balkans, which will receive 30% more funding than in 2000."
"The EUR 614 million that the Council have voted through will enable us to finance all the foreseeable requirements, and include an initial aid package to Serbia totalling EUR 40 million."
"The Council has shown that the granting of significantly higher amounts to the Balkan region was in fact possible without a revision of the financial perspective."
"Furthermore, the Council shares Parliament' s view that the revision proposed by the Commission cannot be envisaged concerning another issue, namely that of expenditure on agricultural markets."
"The Council has stressed that there can be no tampering with the ceiling on CAP expenditure."
"Secondly, the financing of all the Union' s other public expenditure priorities is accounted for by the common agricultural policy, for which funding has been increased by 6.3 % with a view to financing the reform of the CAP."
"Structural measures have been stabilised at a very high level."
"All the programmes that have been adopted jointly by the Council and Parliament conform to the programming that they decided upon together."
"I am keen to point out that the 'employment' initiative constitutes a priority not only for Parliament but also for the Council, following on from the conclusions of the Feira European Council."
"We must, of course, first wait for the Commission' s assessment, but will do our utmost to reach an agreement with Parliament at second reading within the context of a more general compromise on the budget as a whole."
"I would now like to swiftly describe the way the Council voted on each budget heading."
"Concerning the CAP, or heading 1, the significant 6.3 % increase in appropriations is the result, as I have said, of the Berlin Agreements reforming the CAP."
"The Council brought the appropriations envisaged for 2001 down to below the level provided for by the Commission, which had envisaged a 7.6 % increase, due among other things to the habitual under-implementation recorded every year in the field of agricultural expenditure. There was an under-implementation of EUR 660 million in 1999."
"I would like to point out that the increase in expenditure on the common agricultural policy enables us to offset the fall in the agricultural prices for the benefit of consumers. I am actively involved in agricultural programmes in France and am therefore in a position to appreciate the efforts that you have made in coming to this agreement and honouring the commitments that farmers throughout Europe want to see."
"The reform of the CAP will also enable us to enhance the standing of European agriculture within the scope of WTO rules."
"In the long term, this reform will enable us to contain agricultural costs more effectively."
"Concerning the cutback of EUR 225 million in the field of rural development, the Council' s position is a response to the cumulative lags in national rural development plans."
"The Commission acknowledges these lags and there can be no doubt that they will have major repercussions on the implementation of appropriations in 2001."
"Expenditure under this heading has nevertheless been increased by 4.6 %, reflecting the fact that this second pillar of the CAP constitutes a priority."
"Concerning structural operations, overall, the amount set aside for these in the 2000 budget has been maintained."
"I would remind you that the 2000 budget provided for a very high level of structural funding."
"Within this category of expenditure, however, the Council has adjusted the balance in favour of the Cohesion Fund: giving the Cohesion Fund an extra EUR 360 million over and above the preliminary draft budget, which has been taken away from the Structural Fund, as a result of the implementation estimates submitted by the Member States."
"On the subject of internal policies, the Council has increased the margin set by the Commission for heading 3."
"The Commission proposed a margin of EUR 137 million below the ceiling, but the Council has upped this to EUR 208 million."
"The Council is not trying to vote through additional cutbacks, but rather to allow for a sufficient margin of appropriations with a view to the adoption, between now and the time the budget goes to second reading, of amounts that cover the Council and Parliament' s shared priorities, such as the employment initiative, to which you are firmly committed."
"Concerning large-scale multiannual programmes such as the FRDP, the Framework Research and Development Programme, the Council has respected the appropriation schedules approved by Parliament."
"With reference to external actions, or heading 4, the Council has adopted a budget that conforms to the European Union' s overall priorities, including that of aid for the Western Balkans, which is one of its undisputed priorities."
"The Council nevertheless considers that this awarding of priority should not lead the EU institutions to discard the principles of effective and credible intervention: a requirements analysis, the tailoring of aid levels and arrangements to fit the nature of these requirements, and a fair division of contributions from all the bilateral and multilateral aid donors."
"The Council has not deemed it desirable to take up the programming proposed by the Commission, either in the proposal for a framework regulation or in its preliminary draft budget for 2001."
"The Council considers that an allocation of EUR 614 million, which translates as a very major increase of 30% over 2000 should cover the needs of this priority, particularly since aid arrangements are set to change from emergency aid, which is by definition for rapid use, to more structural forms of aid, the commitment of which is generally more complex."
"This outlay makes the European Union the leading contributor to the reconstruction of the Western Balkans."
"I would point out that this expenditure forms part of the overall body of aid granted by the various other donors and financial institutions."
"The MEDA programme and the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a whole quite clearly also remain a priority for the Union. The EUR 150 million cut in commitment appropriations proposed by the Council in no way casts doubt on this."
"In fact, the level of commitment appropriations for the MEDA programme is not an issue, since the delay in payments under this programme now runs to over eight years, as Commissioner Patten has stated."
"The Council' s main concern, therefore, is to improve the way that this programme is managed."
"An increase in the actual payments made under the MEDA programme and the implementation of projects in the field will depend on just such an improvement."
"An agreement has been reached within the Council and with the Commission concerning the arrangements for managing this programme."
"All that remains to be determined is the multiannual amount."
"However, I am anxious to stress that MEDA is only one facet of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which also comprises other measures and which calls for reciprocal efforts to be made by the partners."
"The improvement and development of this partnership also numbers among the priorities of this Presidency of the Council."
"Concerning heading 5, the rationale adopted by the Council consists of stabilising current expenditure at the level of inflation while also granting supplementary funds for exceptional expenditure by the institutions."
"Regarding the Commission' s letter of amendment which proposes, as has just been mentioned, the creation of 500 new posts in 2001, the Council has voted through the creation of 400 new posts."
"In approving the Commission' s proposal, the Council wanted to make a connection with the internal restructuring that the Commission is carrying out in accordance with the White Paper."
"However, the Council does not intend to issue the Commission with a blank cheque, since the arrangements for early retirement and the creation of posts in the years to come are yet to ratified."
"We must hold further discussions on this subject with Parliament after the first reading is complete."
"Concerning pre-accession, heading 7, the increase in appropriations under this heading is the highest for any of the headings in the draft budget for 2001, at almost 11%."
"This reflects the fact that this category of expenditure constitutes a priority for the Council, as well as for Parliament and the Commission."
"Before you reach your decision on this draft budget, I would like to emphasise that the Council and Parliament share a number of objectives on which agreement could well be reached by our two arms of the budgetary authority."
"I will give you two examples: amounts outstanding and financing of aid for the Balkans."
"These two issues often feature in discussions between Parliament and the Council and if we are not careful could well generate tensions between the two arms of the budgetary authority."
"I am nevertheless convinced that, although Parliament and the Council would seem to take different approaches to these issues, they actually have common objectives and interests which could see agreement being reached."
"First of all, the amounts outstanding. This term is used to describe appropriations that were committed during previous financial years but which have not yet been paid out."
"This means that there is quite a time-lag between the authorisation to commit the expenditure and actual payment, which is quite natural in the case of infrastructure financing and multiannual programmes in particular."
"Amounts outstanding have nevertheless risen to such a high level that the reasons for this have to be sought elsewhere."
"One response, the one that your Committee on Budgets suggests that you adopt, consists of saying that the high level of amounts outstanding can be ascribed to a shortfall in payment appropriations."
"The solution would thus be to significantly increase the level of payment appropriations in order to pay all the commitments outstanding."
"This solution is doubtless well-intentioned, but would be ineffectual."
"The Community Budget does not need any more payment appropriations."
"The Community Budget has never suffered from a payments crisis, as is proved by the fact that the every year the Commission records a high level of unutilised appropriations."
"In 1999, appropriations totalling EUR 2.2 billion were not utilised, and in 1998 this figure stood at almost 3 billion ecus."
"Raising the level of payment appropriations by more than the 3.5% decided by the Council would in no way help to reduce the RAL."
"Such an increase would be meaningless, since you have the appropriations available."
"The solution to the high level of amount outstanding actually lies in adopting a different approach."
"What we in fact need is to more efficiently tailor the sum total of commitment appropriations voted through to real needs and to the capabilities of beneficiaries to absorb and utilise these appropriations, an improvement in programme management, as we have proposed regarding the MEDA programme, and revision of the commitment system within the ambit of the reform of the Financial Regulation."
"I would like this House to take these comments into consideration."
"It would in fact be pointless to vote through a significant increase in payment appropriations. This would also run contrary to the goal of an efficient Community Budget being pursued by the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"What we really need are joint discussions on the causes of the high level of amounts outstanding and on the means of rectifying the situation."
"I now come to aid for the Balkans."
"Due to the recent, very welcome changes in Serbia, this is now one of the Union' s priorities in the field of external relations."
"It is also a priority of the Council and Parliament, which have just reached agreement on an emergency aid package worth EUR 200 million."
"I think I can safely say that the Union was efficient in its financing of all the requirements connected with the Balkans in the year 2000, as the Community Budget enabled us to swiftly respond, among other things, to the acceleration in the timetable for reconstruction in Kosovo."
"Concerning the forthcoming programming of heading 4 of the Budget, the Council wants to see a serious assessment of requirements being performed with a view to validating, or invalidating, the political valuation of the CARDS programme."
"Inasmuch as this is possible, the Council is keen to base the level of multiannual global budgetary funding, including that granted under the 2001 Budget for reconstruction in the Balkans, on a technical needs analysis."
"I will now turn to an important question and the topic of many behind-the-scenes conversations at Parliament and in the Commission. Will we have to revise the financial perspective in order to be able to come to the aid of the Balkans?"
"This question was also asked in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999."
"I sometimes hear it said that the Council is so committed to the Berlin financial perspective that it will not even hear talk of a possible revision."
"That is not the question being asked."
"Others say that the Commission and Parliament see the revision as having a symbolic value in respect of the Balkans and as proving, moreover, that the Berlin financial perspective is inadequate."
"This to me is also taking an extreme view."
"The Council is taking a calm approach to the revision of the financial perspective."
"It is committed to the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement as a whole, which comprise the financial perspective and the possibility of its revision."
"However, I would simply like to say that three steps must be taken before any revision of the financial perspective."
"The first is the assessment of needs, the second an examination of the margins available within the framework of the existing ceilings, and the third the possible use of budgetary tools that can be harnessed prior to any revision, such as that of flexibility."
"At this stage the Council does not see the revision of the financial perspective as being a prerequisite for financing reconstruction in the Balkans."
"In conclusion, I hope that we do not see the financial perspective taking on a symbolic value that it does not have."
"The Council will spare no effort to meet the needs of the Balkans, not least by granting significant funding under the budget."
"The budgetary resources that the European Union allocate to the Western Balkans will have a symbolic value, but not as a result of the financial perspective having been revised or not."
"This matter must not be used for the purposes of a publicity campaign."
"If aid to the Balkans can be provided within the framework of the financial perspective, then the main thing is for it to quite simply be provided."
"Following this brief overview, I would like to state once again that the Council is anxious to continue working in close cooperation with Parliament, as it has done from the very start of the budget procedure."
"The draft budget already incorporates the many results of the consultations between the Council and Parliament."
"Discussions will now continue between your institution and the Council and the Commission."
"I hope that these extensive discussions will enable the 2001 budget to be a sound budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, budgetary policy always requires foresight, and today we are discussing Budget 2001, the budget for next year, and so together we must decide what demands there will be on European policy and the European budget next year, which we will need to fulfil, and what challenges we will face there."
"The European budget will be under considerable pressure next year."
"You only have to think of agricultural policy, where, for the first time, the Berlin Decisions will cost Europe more dearly. I might point out that, fortunately, we will at last be able to approve the programmes for promoting development in rural areas, in other words, this new programme will be fully up and running next year."
"We are in a similar situation as regards structural policy."
"The programmes for the new assistance period 2000-2006 have now been approved for practically all the Member States, and so we can expect, and also hope, that the first projects of the operational programmes can be implemented next year, which will require an appropriate level of funding to be made available in the budget."
"I would draw your attention to the challenge we face in the sphere of research policy for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, in light of the fact that when they met in Lisbon, the Heads of State and Government set themselves the ambitious goal of making Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economic area in the world, which also places demands on the European budget."
"On the enlargement front, there are new programmes for boosting pre-accession aid and reform."
"The deadline for enlargement is hopefully drawing closer, but of course this also means that pressure is building on the candidate states to undertake reforms, which is of course where the pre-accession aid comes in."
"Most importantly of all - and this has been underlined repeatedly - we face new challenges in foreign policy, and, needless to say, also new opportunities to improve our relations with our neighbours, and particularly those in the Balkans, and to promote stability there."
"These are the huge challenges facing European policy, the budget, and the Commission' s administration, whose job it is to execute these tasks, and here too we need to boost resource levels."
"We are also called upon to exercise budgetary discipline in our management of European finances."
"We must practise what we preach to the Member States, and it is bringing all these strands together that makes budgetary policy so exciting, as all those who are involved would testify."
"This entails weighing up the various interests, negotiations between institutions, and we are now at the discussion stage of Budget 2001."
"That is to say, all the institutions - i.e. Parliament, the Council and the Commission with its preliminary draft budget - have put forward their first proposals and decisions on Budget 2001."
"If you look at these three different sets of figures, you will see that there are still considerable discrepancies, in purely quantitative terms but obviously as regards content too."
"I will just give you a brief illustration of this: the Commission has proposed an allocation of EUR 96.9 billion in the way of commitment appropriations, the Council has proposed EUR 95.9 billion, the European Parliament EUR 96.8 billion, and when it comes to payments there is a discrepancy between Parliament' s proposed figure and that of the Council, of almost EUR 2.2 billion."
"But I might also emphasise that the proposals, or rather, decisions of all three institutions in respect of Budget 2001, fall below the threshold set during the financial planning in Berlin."
"It is therefore quite fair to say that all the institutions have endeavoured to keep within these limits, and to maintain budgetary discipline."
"I must point out that the Berlin Decisions would allow for a 6.1% increase in payments as compared with the previous year, and no decision proposes an increase on that scale."
"In other words, there is still plenty of room for negotiation, and anyone who attended the trialogue between Parliament, the Council and the Commission last week, will confirm that real efforts are being made to reach a satisfactory solution, and the atmosphere speaks of a genuine willingness to negotiate, rather than quarrel."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say a special word of thanks to Parliament and to the rapporteurs, Mrs Haug, Mr Ferber, Mrs Rühle and Mr Colom i Naval."
"I would also like to thank the Council, particularly for last Wednesday' s brilliant achievement - Mr Patria - in the trialogue."
"The conciliation process which took place in the summer - Mr Colom i Naval made this point - had a positive outcome too, in that, in future, there will be an increase in the information made available to Parliament, and all new legislative proposals must be accompanied by an estimate of their compatibility with the financial forecasts."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can fully support your proposals, Mr Colom, because Parliament' s Committee on Budgets bears a weighty responsibility, and has the task of keeping an eye on whether the Committee on Budgets is indeed using these new instruments, so as to help ensure that financially viable decisions are taken."
"Nor should we have to contend with things of the kind that have gone on recently in the Council, for example when the agricultural ministers rejected a cost-cutting proposal from the Council, i.e. they voted for higher expenditure and then the Council of Finance Ministers reduced expenditure in the agricultural sector."
"I would therefore point out that the decisions taken must be backed up with adequate funding."
"The reason for this of course, is that rather than add to the backlog, we must endeavour to reduce it, although this entails having the right human resources in place in the Commission."
"That is why the Commission decided to submit a request for 400 new posts with this budget."
"I would again draw your attention to the fact that we did not do so until we had conducted a critical survey of all the departments in order to assess whether there was still scope for redeploying staff, and only then did we reach the conclusion that we must approach the budgetary authority with a request for new posts."
"I would like to thank the Council for their positive vote on this issue."
"Parliament has now placed the posts in reserve, and naturally I fully accept, Mrs Haug, that there are conditions attached to their release. However, I would you to take account of the fact that these must be conditions we can actually fulfil."
"One of the conditions imposed was that the comitology procedure must be changed."
"I would point out at this juncture that following a long debate last year, a new decision was taken on the comitology procedure, in conjunction with the Council, and I hold out little hope of us being able to reopen this debate."
"Exactly the same applies to the condition stipulating that provision must be made for a performance reserve as a matter of priority."
"If we want to improve - and that is our aim where the performance reserve is concerned - then of course we will need those posts."
"We will go to great lengths to explain to you what steps we have taken on the reform front, reform measures we have instigated, what initiatives are well underway, and what other plans we have in the pipeline, so as to demonstrate that the Commission, for its part, is pulling out all the stops."
"But I would also urge Parliament to be prepared to negotiate in these matters."
"The greatest challenge facing those responsible for budgetary policy, in the year to come, or rather, at the present moment, is that financing must be secured for new foreign policy tasks, and this mainly concerns the financing for the necessary stabilisation aid in the Balkans."
"I would remind you that the financial plan for the Balkans agreed last year only made provision for EUR 1.85 billion for the entire period up to 2006."
"This decision was taken under completely different conditions on the European policy front than we are now experiencing, I am glad to say, following the changeover of power in Belgrade."
"I might also point out that last year, for instance, we had a long debate here with the Council, in connection with the reconstruction measures for Kosovo, on whether we stood any chance at all of putting in a good performance out there."
"Fortunately, the reconstruction agency has implemented the Kosovo reconstruction aid to extremely good effect, which means we are now in a position to be able to increase the appropriations for the reconstruction agency this year by EUR 175 million, and I would like to extend sincere thanks to the Committee on Budgets, and particularly the chairman, Mr Wynn, for supporting these measures in this way."
"Above all, by increasing aid for Kosovo in this way, before the end of this year, it will be immediately apparent - and this is a very important political message to my mind - that the European Union does not take the view that because there has now been a changeover of power in Serbia, we should cut back on aid to Kosovo."
"No, we cannot have Kosovo fall victim to this a second time."
"On the contrary, we need to fulfil both tasks."
"The question of financial aid for Serbia next year and for subsequent years, is now on the table of course."
"The question as to whether the necessary measures can be carved from the previous package for the Mediterranean programme, is a political and not a technical issue."
"EUR 8.1 billion were earmarked for the MEDA programme in the Berlin financial planning."
"If this were to be trimmed down to EUR 5 or 6 billion then it would not be possible to continue financing the same policies."
"Of course the question that needs to be answered is: what kind of policy do we want the European Union to pursue in our southerly neighbouring states?"
"The Commission does not believe that all the reconstruction aid required for the Balkans should be carved out of the funds for the MEDA programme."
"We have various instruments at our disposal for budgetary policy, in the event that unforeseen tasks should arise, or even additional requirements."
"They are known as the flexibility reserve."
"I have taken on board the fact that the Council believes there is willingness to negotiate."
"I am aware that Parliament is of the opinion that the flexibility reserve should be employed forthwith, in order to offset the cuts in the MEDA programme."
"To that I would say: the flexibility reserve is an instrument available to us for financing an unforeseen task in a particular year."
"The issue of Balkans aid does not come under this heading because it is a multiannual task."
"We also have the negative reserve instrument available to us in the course of the budgetary procedure."
"Then there is the instrument whereby expenditure is increased in category IV, and there is a corresponding evening out across the whole budget. We also have the revision instrument, or rather the financial planning can be amended."
"Naturally, certain conditions are laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement, but it does not specify that the flexibility reserve has to be the first port of call."
"There is no mention of this, instead provision is made for certain steps to be taken."
"I can assure you that the Commission has taken these steps, and I would remind you that this is supposed to give us a clear idea of the kind of timeframe we are looking at."
"As to the question as to whether it will be possible to reallocate funds from agricultural policy, we will see that you get the latest forecasts on agricultural expenditure in the near future."
"Of course revising the financial perspective is not an end in itself, rather, the Commission proposed this method with a view to financing the necessary expenditure in foreign policy, so as to do justice to the challenges we face."
"I would again urge you - the Commission is leaving your proposal on the table - to examine this proposal without bias and consider it as a possibility."
"The European Union promised Serbia before the elections that in the event of a change in the balance of power, and a return to democracy, it would deliver emergency aid."
"We have given our word and we will all keep our word."
"The Commission submitted a proposal to activate the emergency reserve to this end, and put together an aid package."
"This aid package of EUR 200 million will enable us to take the necessary measures on the energy front, before the end of this year, in order to supply the people with the heating energy they need this winter, relieve the emergency situation that prevails in many areas of health care, and also ensure, for example, that the children do not sit freezing in their classrooms through the winter, by financing any necessary repair work here."
"These are the tasks that the aid package is designed to accomplish, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament and the Council most sincerely for being so quick to support this proposal and for being prepared to take this decision so rapidly."
"I believe that in this way, the European Union has proved beyond all doubt that it is able to take very swift joint action, and that here too, there is evidence of a common will being translated into action, a common will to do our utmost to secure political stability - and that means peace - in Europe."
"Mr President, it was splendid to hear the Commissioner' s criticism of the Council when it comes to foreign policy."
"When we see a dictatorship in the Balkans superseded by the hope of democracy, we cannot lock ourselves into disputes about the Budget. Instead, the budget frameworks, - the so-called financial perspective - must be adjusted."
"We cannot simply take all the money from other areas of foreign policy."
"We have already this year exceeded the foreign policy budget by 400 million."
"Let us now be far-sighted enough to give the Commission the opportunity to plan ahead."
"Circumstances have also revealed the need for the so-called 'rapid reaction facility' , as proposed by the Commission."
"The money must not be placed in the reserves with the risk of the Council' s blocking it, something which would of course lead to the Commission' s not being able to plan ahead."
"Remember Romano Prodi' s major speech in this Chamber a few weeks ago."
"We shall support his and Chris Patten' s attempt to strengthen the Commission' s effectiveness by means of parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary control to which the Council and Mr Solana are not of course subject."
"I should therefore ask both the Council and the Committee on Budgets here in Parliament to think in terms of foreign policy and not only in terms of budget strategy when they concern themselves with foreign policy."
"BudgetaryControl. The Committee on Budgetary Control considered tabling a number of amendments to this year' s budget, looking at the implementation figures of the current and previous years budgets alongside the corresponding analysis contained within the revenue and expenditure account and balance sheet."
"We also looked at the Court of Auditors' special reports."
"Whilst these are drawn up pursuant to Article 248(4) of the Treaty for the purpose of discharge, we actually think there is some value in our committee and the Committee on Budgets looking into them and looking at how the money is being spent in the current year in areas where the Court of Auditors found problems in the past."
"Looking at the evaluation reports, the Commission has produced a lot of documentation concerning the preliminary draft budget, for example for 2001, which included a working document presenting summaries of results of a number of mostly external evaluations."
"Those were carried out at the request of the Commission itself and referred to the financial year 1999, the most recent one for which the final data was available."
"The material was obviously useful for both the preparation of the 2001 budget and for the 1999 discharge."
"So the committee would like to recommend to all the specialised committees concerned to take into account the results of those evaluations."
"In the end we tabled a very short paper to the Committee on Budgets with a number of recommendations which we hope will be taken on board."
"The House will no doubt be aware that I personally have taken an interest in the budget and tabled a number of amendments."
"I look forward in the future to seeing roughly the same sort of exercise and trying to get rid of a number of very small and more insignificant budget lines, as well as making this House and the Commission much more efficient, do less and do it better."
"Mr President, as draftsman for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I have no problem asking this House to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets on the initiative of either our committee or the general rapporteur, Mrs Haug."
"I observe, in particular, that following our requests, the Committee on Budgets has proposed a substantial increase in the credits made available to the European Fund for Refugees, funds which the Council had rather imprudently, not to say rather stupidly, cut."
"I should also like to point out and to endorse the very clear increase in appropriations earmarked for funding measures to combat and prevent discrimination. This has been a priority of the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole since the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Finally, I am delighted to note that, in the field for which my own committee is responsible, no less than four new budget lines have been proposed for our approval."
"The first of these is for the implementation of a pilot project intended to fund an information campaign within the fifteen Member States against the criminal scourge of paedophilia."
"The second is for aid to victims of human rights violations in need of treatment in specialised institutions."
"The third is intended to fund measures in preparation for a programme to combat drugs trafficking, and the fourth sets up the funding for actions to be carried out conjointly with third countries, primarily Morocco, with a view to better controlling the flow of immigration."
"Let me express just one regret, in conclusion."
"The Committee on Budgets did not see fit to adopt my own committee' s proposal to increase the resources to be made available to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia based in Vienna."
"I think this is a mistake which must be set right."
"At a time when racist and xenophobic acts are gaining ground, scandalously, in a number of European Union countries, I think it crucial to boost the financial means needed to set up a technically reliable network for the collation of information throughout the Union."
"I think that, were they to support this amendment, my fellow Members would be setting in place a technically fair and politically timely act."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote in the Committee on Budgets was rather unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"As much as I, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, appreciate the work undertaken by this committee, and as impressed as I am by the labours of the Committee on Budgets' rapporteurs, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it is imperative that I highlight two proposed amendments, which the committee is resubmitting to the plenary, and which are by no means insignificant, despite the small amounts involved."
"Firstly, I understand why people want to give the Commission a grilling on its information policy."
"Many delegates feel that the Commission' s information policy, particularly where PRINCE is concerned, has not brought the success people were expecting."
"In addition, the Commission' s promise to work closely with Parliament on this issue has left a great deal to be desired."
"In many Member States, where the Commission operates information bureaux, it is not possible to reach a broad cross-section of the public through holding conferences for experts."
"However, using the reserve instrument to impose a total blockade, is not the right way to go about things either."
"In view of the fact that euro banknotes and coins are to be introduced in 2002, I cannot accept the decision to place the appropriations from PRINCE in the reserve in financial year 2001."
"When could be a better moment to invest in information campaigns on the euro, given that uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate losses between the dollar and the euro, and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, has never been so high?"
"In view of the shortcomings of previous information campaigns, we could, if need be, accept a 50% reserve by way of compromise, so as to give the Commission the opportunity to lend an innovative approach to its information strategy, or give it fresh impetus."
"Secondly, I see people have been fighting tooth and nail over the mini budgets in the A30 lines."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has requested expert reports on this, with a view to receiving appropriate advice from the European Central Bank on the financial aspect."
"Should a compromise solution be reached on this issue in the time remaining, which supports the important work undertaken by the EMAC Committee, then we can arrange things accordingly, otherwise our committee will keep an open mind on the matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a Community of law, because European law is observed and upheld."
"The European Court of Justice takes care of that."
"In so doing, it has made a considerable contribution to the success of the whole integration project over the last forty years."
"The European courts are currently facing major obstacles in their efforts to uphold European law, because they do not have the necessary funding available to them."
"There are 1600 cases pending before the European Court of Justice, and the backlog in translation work runs to 120 000 pages."
"As such, the European Court of Justice has become a sticking point for legal certainty."
"In fact, back at first reading, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens' right to see their European laws upheld, and to avoid the EU falling into disrepute as a Community of law, on account of delays."
"I am extremely grateful to the Committee on Budgets and the competent rapporteur for endorsing this line of argument and supporting our proposals."
"In particular, we will again recommend, at second reading, that 60 new posts be created at the European Court of Justice, and, in addition, that the necessary funding be made available in the budget."
"We also propose that EUR 3 million be set aside, with immediate effect, in order to enlist the services of freelance translators."
"In implementing these measures, we aim to get legal supervision back into full working order, restore people' s faith in the legal certainty of the EU, and strengthen the European Union as a Community of law."
"Mr President, this is my first year in the European Parliament and I have been struck during the course of this budget debate by the contrast between rhetoric and delivery."
"Last year when we were discussing the budget, we had politicians in the Member State governments who were posturing on the issue of renewable energy, whilst at the same time proposing major cuts to the Save programme in this Parliament."
"I found that to be a curious position."
"But here we are yet again, twelve months later, in a situation in which ministers from Member State governments have come out of summits, preening themselves over their ambitious targets for research, while the draft budget prepared by the Council makes total cuts in payment appropriations in the research subsection of the Fifth Framework Programme of no less than EUR 100 million."
"So there really is a stark difference between delivery on the part of the Council, and the rhetoric that the Council uses."
"My committee has mandated me to make that point and we will certainly, in a sense of discipline, be aiming to see at least one half of that cut in payment appropriations being restored in the plenary vote."
"I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Haug on the work done in the Committee on Budgets, particularly the work done to restore lines in relation to small- and medium-sized enterprises, again cut by the Council."
"That has been a priority of our committee and a priority of this Parliament."
"Again, it is difficult to reconcile the rhetoric of the Council with its proposals in that area."
"The proposals put forward by our committee and supported by the Committee on Budgets are much better."
"It would take more than the one minute I have left if I were to go into all of my committee' s views in relation to the Meda programme."
"We know the difficulties."
"Commissioner Patten has outlined them to us, but there is important work to be undertaken within the area of the Meda programme."
"We only have to look at our television sets to see the difficulties in the Middle East to be reminded of that each and every day."
"I am also the draftsman for my committee on Mrs Rühle' s report on the ECSC budget."
"Let me briefly touch on a number of items there."
"We are of the view that there should be much more emphasis on developing research."
"I saw that strain in her report as well."
"We want to see it increased by 10%."
"The priorities should be clean technology, environmental protection and remediation and safety for the future."
"Mrs Rühle agrees with me on that, so again in that area there is consensus within this Parliament which, I am bound to say, all too sadly is not often shared by the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it makes no sense at all to me."
"They decide, in Lisbon, to do their level best to return to full employment as soon as possible, they lament the fact that there is social exclusion, and they profess to want to tackle all forms of discrimination, yet when it comes to drafting the budget, it all gets swept aside by the Commission and the Council."
"Our citizens, not to mention this House, have had enough of this policy of merely paying lip service."
"We in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs favour a thrifty budget too, but not in this way."
"I am therefore pleased, and would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Budgets, and above all, the general rapporteur, for the fact that we have at last worked out a joint plan on how to rectify the difficulties attending this draft budget, with a view to accommodating Parliament' s clear priorities, and boosting employment and social cohesion, although, naturally the situation still leaves something to be desired from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"It fills me with confidence that together, we have managed to save our employment initiative for local engagement, which was launched last year, because this is the initiative that supports new employment policy measures at local level, whilst involving all players, NGOs included."
"The Commission' s attempt to abolish this initiative showed out-and-out disregard for the political will of Lisbon and the priorities of this House."
"I also welcome the fact that, in future, we will aim to do more for health and safety protection in the workplace again."
"The new initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises will illustrate best practice in this sphere, and lend added value accordingly."
"Naturally we would have liked to see the action programmes for combating social exclusion and discrimination better provided for, so as not to disappoint the expectations that Article 13 has given rise to amongst the public, and also the NGOs."
"But then every committee has simply had to accept compromises on that score."
"However, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs feels there is a more serious problem still to be addressed, namely that the budget makes no provision whatsoever for the observatory for industrial change."
"Therefore I say again to all those who denigrate this project: firstly, no one wants a new, expensive agency."
"Instead, the agency in Dublin should only be entrusted with the relevant tasks."
"Secondly, the observation point' s task would be to collect information, so as to assist the process of industrial change."
"No more and no less."
"Anyone who maintains that part of its job would be to block mergers or halt globalisation, does so for purely polemical reasons."
"And so I hope that when it comes to tomorrow' s vote, we will still achieve the majority required for the observation point in Dublin"
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment on this year' s budget, I want to acknowledge the difficult framework in which it has been constructed and the serious pressures upon all of us."
"I would like to pay tribute to the work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, in trying to resolve some very difficult questions this year because of the immense pressures that have been brought to bear upon the budget at a very late stage."
"We must have the courage of our convictions and insist upon finding the very modest finance needed to fulfil our key objectives."
"In that regard, I would draw the Commission' s and the House' s attention to the following issues."
"The first is the decision by the Committee on Budgets to place into reserve the monies agreed for the Life programme."
"This was an astonishing decision and left many of us feeling that this whole very important programme had simply become a football in a game between the Budgets Committee and the Commission."
"It demonstrated that those bodies did not recognise the importance of this programme to the environment."
"We need to reverse that decision in the vote this week in the House and make those funds immediately available, because there is an enormous demand for their utilisation."
"The treatment by the Budgets Committee of several agencies has been proven to be unfair and unjust this year and in past years, in particular the refusal to increase monies to the Drugs Agency."
"If it is supported by the House this week, it will put a stop to the recently begun programme for the approval of orphan drugs for rare diseases."
"Unless that funding is restored in a vote this week in Parliament, I would anticipate a very serious situation arising and considerable distress to many people in Europe."
"A similar injustice has been done to the Environment Agency, given its increased workload as a result of enlargement."
"In future years a more thoughtful, consistent and sensitive approach to the financial needs of the agencies will be needed and I hope the approach of treating them all the same, which has prevailed in previous years, will now be dropped."
"They are the main objectives of the Environment Committee."
"They can be achieved with an absolutely minuscule amount of finance."
"It is the duty of the House to give those points their support in the vote this week, to demonstrate its continued commitment to protecting the environment and improving public health."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Committee, I would like to make a few observations, starting with rural policy."
"The agriculture committee subscribes to the Berlin Agreement, also with regard to rural policy, but notes at the same time that spending is suffering delays, and we have established that in a number of cases, vis-à-vis the Council and Member States, the limits of what is possible are being tested with regard to the agricultural funds."
"That is a pity; it would be preferable if, in spending the budget, the actual objective were achieved, namely if the switch were made from countryside to multifunctionality and greater market orientation."
"I wanted to share this observation with the Council, in particular."
"The second point I wanted to make relates to the budget for agriculture and horticulture."
"It is reported to have increased by 6%, partly due to the switch-over."
"I have to add, however, that sugar policy, for example, is now again the topic of debate, also within the Commission."
"I should in any event like to urge the Commission to support Commissioner Fischler in this respect, for the best way to stay within the financial limits is not to put the future of sugar policy at risk again, at least not before 2006."
"The third point pertains to European agricultural policy as it is now before us in the budget proposals."
"We have noted that although it may be focused on the social objective, it is, as a result, biased slightly too much in favour of the home market, in contrast to, for example, the power pattern which has unfolded in the United States and Australia, which is mainly aimed at greater market access, and into which a great deal of money is pumped."
"The budget per farm in the United States is currently three times higher than in Europe."
"That means that as far as the course which we are setting for the budget is concerned, the question is whether market orientation should not be given a higher profile."
"Commissioner Fischler has set the tone for this on a number of occasions."
"This could be further developed but requires collaboration from the Council as an absolute necessity."
"This also means that, with regard to the European agricultural budget, namely multifunctionality and rural development, consideration must also be given to landscape and animal welfare, and that close collaboration in those areas is needed."
"In fact, there is room for improvement here too, for example with regard to the tobacco policy."
"In conclusion, the agriculture committee is of the opinion that we should remain within the confines of the Berlin Agreement, and as such, I, as draftsman of the opinion have to advise against Amendment No 206 with regard to the vote in this Parliament."
", draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries."
"(ES) Mr President, I join some of my fellow Members in congratulating Mrs Haug on her report."
"I know that it has not been easy and we therefore thank her even more, if possible, for her work."
"The common fisheries policy, ladies and gentlemen, represents a very small part of the Community budget: we are talking about barely a billion euros."
"This is not enough to meet the challenges of the Common Fisheries Policy, to finance the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, the fisheries agreements and our participation in international organisations, to monitor the implementation of the CFP, the common organisation of the market for fisheries products and aquiculture, research into the fishing environment and the compilation of data which is essential for the implementation of the CFP."
"The Committee on Fisheries, which shares with the Commission the principle of budgetary stringency, has accepted the limits set by the latter in its preliminary draft and has indicated its concerns in certain budget headings."
"We have asked an indicative appropriation of EUR 2 million to be approved for an information campaign on the CFP."
"An information campaign disseminating the principle on which the CFP is based - the sustainable exploitation of marine resources - is essential."
"Quality products must be highlighted, conservation standards, such as the observation of minimum fish sizes, must be circulated and we must explain to consumers the health benefits of eating fish."
"The Committee on Fisheries has approved another amendment increasing the appropriations intended for controlling and observing fishing activities in Community and third-country waters."
"We have criticised the shortcomings and the marginal role of the Commission in the policy of control and observation and we therefore believe that this policy must be supported with an increased budget."
"The primary aim of the Committee on Fisheries' petitions is to improve the CFP' s potential for maintaining and creating employment."
"Whilst employment may be the European Union' s priority policy, fisheries, as another economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines."
"The CFP is tremendously important for maintaining employment in the peripheral regions, which are very dependent on fishing."
"Our priorities are, and must be, to consolidate and increase international fishing agreements and to improve safety and working conditions within the sector and conserve resources."
"The cheapest jobs, ladies and gentlemen, are those that do not need to be created because they have not been lost."
"It is better to support activities that already generate jobs than to have to invest vast amounts later in creating new industries."
"In conclusion, I would particularly like to mention a topic with regard to which Parliament is to issue its assent."
"I am referring to the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"The Committee on Fisheries asks that line B7-8000 should include an entry of EUR 125 million to cover the financing of this agreement for the year 2001."
"All parties must assume their responsibilities and fulfil their obligations."
"The Commission in its executive capacity must negotiate with weighty arguments to achieve a reasonable agreement with Morocco and the Council and the governments concerned should provide a political impetus for this negotiation."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her excellent work in preparing the draft budget."
"She sat in on our committee and, to her credit, took our committee' s proposals into consideration."
"The goal of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is to improve the employment rate particularly by supporting SMEs and exploiting the opportunities offered by the Information Society."
"The committee stresses the importance of good and disciplined financial management, the simplification of administrative procedures, and the successful outcome of projects."
"Our committee supports the Commission' s proposals and rejected the Council' s cuts to payment appropriations saying they were unjustified."
"Our aim is to deal promptly with the arrears and get the new programmes swiftly and effectively under way."
"The focus with regard to traffic is on the development of the trans-European transport network."
"Only symbolic appropriations are earmarked for transport safety, sustainable transport systems and combined goods transport."
"I would hope for an improvement to this situation in the years to come, as the accident rate varies from one Member State to another to a surprising extent, and, for example, there should be more exchange of ideas when it comes to good transport practice."
"The Community should also be investing in developing travel and tourism, particularly by supporting SMEs in this field."
"Our committee believes that the Commission should table a new proposal for a programme to support travel and tourism."
"Support from ISPA, which is designed for preparations for enlargement, should be used to part-finance the launching of projects, so that limited resources can be used effectively."
"Mr President, right at the start I would like to thank Jutta Haug, as budget rapporteur, for the cooperation she demonstrated in dealing with appropriations relating to culture, youth, education and communication in the budget."
"I am especially glad that we have been able to safeguard financing for the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes that were decided at the end of last year."
"The Committee on Budgets has also shown understanding with regard to financing the Media Plus programme, which is still open."
"Hopefully we will rapidly achieve harmony between the Council and Parliament."
"The success of audio-visual production is an important part of the European strategy."
"I am sorry, however, that the Committee on Budgets voted to enter in the reserve Commission appropriations for information activities."
"Hopefully this problem will be put right in plenary."
"Very little has been allocated to culture in the budget."
"In all the EU spends just under two euros for each citizen on training, youth exchange programmes, culture projects, and support and information with regard to audio-visual production."
"On the other hand, almost a billion euros have been set aside for premiums for tobacco production, i.e. nearly three times as much as for the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes put together."
"In its discussion of the budget, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has, as so often at other times, been worried about budget payments management."
"Decisions on applications for support have taken a long time and payments have been delayed."
"We have to find a remedy for this."
"The citizens of the Union must receive a good, efficient service."
"That is vital for the programme aims to succeed but also for the legitimacy of the EU."
"Direct support via Class A policies for national and cultural organisations, which pursue European interests, this time too aroused passion, despite the modest amount of the support."
"We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport tried to remain within the framework of the proposed appropriations, so that we ourselves might set out priorities as befits a special committee."
"We were not entirely successful in this."
"Neither has the Committee on Budgets completely honoured our priorities, but it did, happily, increase appropriations slightly."
"It is important to see that the Committee on Budgets took a positive attitude towards the request of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport to have the Commission give an account of the financing of organisations hitherto, so that we might establish fairer and more open rules for this."
"I wish, furthermore, to turn our attention to the financing of Euronews."
"Both the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and the Committee on Budgets think it important to guarantee that the financing stay at its present level."
"I hope that the will of Parliament will be taken into consideration in talks between the Commission and Euronews."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the budget determines the image of Europe and is the exponent par excellence of the European Union' s priorities."
"It is by means of the budget that the European Parliament can and must realise its ideals."
"Unfortunately, year after year, Member States have passed on most of their responsibilities of providing aid to Bosnia and Kosovo to the European Union."
"Each time, this was at the expense of European aid to the poorest countries."
"Year after year, Parliament has protected the interests of the poorest countries in the European budget, and with moderate success, even though this has not been enough."
"The European Commission struggled to come to terms with the extension of priorities, and this has led to unacceptable gaps in the implementation of commitments which were made under pressure of ever larger budgets for support to foreign aid and cooperation operations."
"Today, we are viewing the 2001 budget with the Serbian population very much at the forefront of our minds."
"There is no doubt that Europe has to make a crucial contribution to the reconstruction of Serbia, and hence to the stabilisation of the Balkans."
"The wish for peace and cooperation stability is of historic importance."
"But Europe itself is responsible for what is required to integrate Serbia in the democratic world."
"We cannot and must not present the bill for this to the poorest countries."
"Europe, operating today as a global player, must also do its bit to reduce poverty."
"This is not a situation in which we can opt for 'either-or' ; it is a 'both-and' situation, i.e. both aid to Serbia and the Balkans, and aid to the poorest countries."
"What does this translate into in terms of the 2001 budget?"
"Even in 1999, as much as EUR 3.2 million was refunded to the Member States because those resources were not spent."
"Even our most generous estimates of what will be required for Kosovo and Serbia in 2001 will not exceed the EUR 3.2 million, far from it."
"So we have the means."
"The issue of the budget can thus be reduced to a purely political issue, and in subsequently weighing up the political options in an honest manner, the effectiveness of aid needs to be explored."
"If we do not want to pursue symbolic policies, we need to think and act in a result-oriented manner."
"In the final analysis, it is not about what we budget for, but rather about whether our money ends up at the right place and with the impact we had envisaged."
"This is where we hit a major problem."
"For years, the Commission has been unable to spend the funds we have budgeted for."
"For example, with regard to our aid to Mediterranean countries, we have a backlog which has accumulated over many years of budgets."
"The Commission is now working on activity-based budgeting, which will enable us to prevent these problems from happening again."
"In essence, activity-based budgeting should mean that for each budget line which is set up, the means are determined which are necessary to actually implement that budget line."
"Once we have assured ourselves that what we budget for can actually be spent, we will subsequently need to ask ourselves whether the aid actually ends up where it is needed the most."
"I am of the opinion that we need to make a mental switch."
"The budget which we determine mutually, must reflect our priorities, must be understandable to the citizen and must also be goal-oriented."
"We have therefore proposed that, where relevant, we should include concrete output targets in our budget lines."
"These will indicate what sectors, in our eyes, must benefit directly from the aid which is budgeted for in certain regions."
"This is why we have ensured that the aid for education and health care is doubled, and that is necessary to ensure that the aid ends up with the people who need it the most."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to ask for Parliament' s support so that the amendments already approved by the Committee on Budgets may be definitively approved."
"They are not exactly what we had asked for, since in some cases the amount we had requested has been reduced but, on the whole, we are satisfied because we believe that there will be continuing concern to facilitate the promotion of women and equal opportunities by the following means:"
"Information initiatives for the common agricultural policy - where women play an extremely important role, without recognition for their work - through the EQUAL programme which is intended to make it easier to employ women within the Community strategy for equal opportunities. This is the report that we examined yesterday and which, sadly, has been referred back to committee today."
"Secondly, the incorporation of women into the information society, which is extremely important for the future; financial assistance for women in Central and Eastern European countries, in the MEDA countries; the fight against sex tourism in third countries, where there is a huge problem which affects women in particular; and the promotion and defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms of women."
"We must also bear in mind that all this is related to the fight against domestic violence, which is taking place under the DAPHNE programme."
"All in all, we would like to see these amendments approved."
"We hope that this will be the case."
"I would like to cite another amendment related to women' s organisations: the committee approved an amount for the European Women' s Lobby."
"A group of MEPs then presented an amendment to the Committee on Budgets - which was approved - with a view to extending this budget heading to other women' s organisations in order to show our pluralist approach and respect for all options and all political affiliations in the European Union."
"We also hope that this heading will be approved."
"For this budget heading we in the committee had asked for a larger amount than was allocated in the end, but all in all, as I said before, we are satisfied and we are hoping for final approval."
"Mr President, in previous years' debates I spoke for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, where we heard from Mrs Iivari this afternoon."
"Very little money indeed is spent."
"I totally support the remarks made by Mrs Iivari which draw attention to that problem."
"I speak this year for the Committee on Petitions, where we spend even less money, indeed hardly any money at all."
"Maybe that is as it should be."
"Certainly as the budget rapporteur I commend the good relations we have had with Mr Ferber."
"In speaking this afternoon I commend to the House those budget lines that are dedicated to the work of the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman."
"A prime responsibility of any elected parliament is to protect the interests of the individual citizens against the executive."
"In our case we have to ensure not only that the Commission respects European policy but that the Member States do so as well and fulfil their Treaty obligations."
"They are not always ready to do so."
"There are no better guardians of the Treaties than the European citizens."
"An important way that the citizens can ensure that their concerns are addressed is by appealing either to the Ombudsman or petitioning Parliament."
"It is a cheap process for us; for the citizen it is free."
"Compare that to redress through the courts of law."
"I urge the House to see that the Ombudsman has adequate staff to do his job properly and the Petitions Committee has adequate tools to do its job properly."
"In particular, this year we have asked - and I believe we will have the support of the House - to ensure that there is adequate money to see that we have a proper interactive database so that Members, staff and citizens can address their concerns and see how they are progressing through Parliament."
"There has already been good progress."
"At the moment it is just the citizens who cannot access the database."
"I hope they will very quickly have that possibility."
"I should like to draw attention to the fact that the issue we are petitioned on is the question of fraud and mismanagement of money in the European Union."
"We need to be aware of that."
"But I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends just 1% of GDP and much of that is administered in the Member States."
"If we are looking for waste and fraud, it is not just found within the European Union."
"Over the last few weeks in Britain alone I have monitored what the press has been saying about cases of fraud, waste and mismanagement in Britain: social security fraud - GBP 4.5 billion; serious fraud offices investigating 81 cases covering GBP 1.4 billion; housing benefit fraud - GBP 185 million; giro cheque fraud - GBP 240 million."
"In just one month I have found those cases."
"Only last weekend we learned that General Abacha of Nigeria laundered GBP 4.5 billion through the banks in London without the proper authorities knowing about it."
"So certainly we must make sure that we have our affairs in order in Europe but anybody reporting these issues should never forget that it is not just the European Union that needs to address those issues seriously."
"Mr President, I would like to start by giving my warmest congratulations to our two rapporteurs who have prepared our debates today on behalf of our committee."
"They have both done an excellent job for us and I know it is not easy to coordinate the position of others, having been a rapporteur myself."
"The context of our debate today is that we must use whatever opportunity we have in our budget to make sure that our European institutions are ready for the next stage of enlargement, both in terms of the institutions' structures as well as improved policy management."
"I turn first to Parliament' s budget."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Ferber, was absolutely right that we should avoid placing posts in reserve in view of enlargement at this stage - the motto should be ""more haste, less speed"" ."
"We in Parliament should coordinate with the other two institutions on what we should be doing in terms of enlargement for translation, interpretation, buildings and personnel and we should work out a joint plan between us."
"Our administration should be very prudent about the linguistic sector. We are after all thinking of enlargement for ten countries and not just five so we need to take a broader view."
"Secondly, I have a specific comment on category 4 and on our external policies."
"We know that our debates on the budget will address this on many occasions."
"But I would like to pick up on the comments of the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, who said that there are a number of instruments, a number of means by which we can come to terms with what is requested for this year, whether it be the flexibility instrument or indeed the negative reserve, where we could perhaps find the credits available for this year despite the problem of how to manage that in practice."
"We must remember that there are other means than necessarily revising the financial perspective."
"But of course my group will be at one in saying we must resolve this problem as soon as possible so as to give a long-term perspective of how the European Union' s aid is going to be used in MEDA and in CARDS."
"Let me turn to the overall strategy."
"This is the first budget debate for a considerable time without a substantive issue of dispute between Parliament and Commission."
"The framework agreement between our two institutions is now in operation even if it is disputed by a few of our Members."
"No discharge is outstanding, the reform process started by the last Commission under the strong urgings of our Parliament has been taken up in earnest by this Commission."
"Some progress has been made but there is a long way to go."
"It is this background which is crucial to my group' s approach to the 2001 budget."
"Having always been in the vanguard for change in the European institutions, for example with our support for never giving discharge for the 1996 budget, we are now absolutely determined that the reform process will not be lost as larger and more political issues begin to dominate our agenda in the run-up to the Nice summit."
"We focussed our efforts on three specific areas: better execution of the budget, more effective management of European policies and successful implementation of the reform package with particular reference to the new posts requested by the Commission."
"Before coming to that, a word on the position of the British Conservatives."
"To the surprise of many in my delegation, we established a core strategy unanimously at the beginning of September and the 400 amendments introduced by some of my colleagues came as somewhat of a surprise to many of us in the Budget Committee."
"While some had a legitimate purpose - to improve financial control of this House over the budget, many more had a destructive intent - not to save money, but to delete very worthy organisations such as the European Union Youth Orchestra."
"As it turns out, the moderate face of conservatism has for the most part prevailed over the more ideological and unacceptable one."
"There are some 30 amendments now retabled over and above those of our core strategy."
"I personally did not put my signature to them because one or two of them still go a little too far."
"Yet a healthy majority of the Conservative delegation wishes to play a constructive role in the European process - unlike one or two Members who can only think of deconstructing what is here."
"This brings me to our group' s strategy, because at the core of our belief is the wish to get value for money for the European citizen."
"We want to be sure that funds set aside for specific purposes in the budget will be spent and not accumulated year after year."
"This is why we have called for a strategy from the Commissioner to deal with the backlog of commitments, in particular in external policies, by the end of 2003."
"It is my hope that the Council will also be able to agree this strategy."
"It includes a limitation on the duration of commitments for which agreement will be required by the Council."
"Mr President of the Council, my group could put more payments on the line if we were certain that policies were being better managed."
"Secondly, we have established reserves in several parts of the budget where we think management of the available funds is weak, in particular setting aside large sums in external policy and for the final amount to be agreed between the two arms of the budgetary authority based on the idea of the performance reserve."
"We think this is a good idea, because if you see things are running well than that is where you put your credits."
"You do not put it on those programmes which are not running so effectively."
"Thirdly, and linked to these items, is the request for more posts."
"We understand that there is a need for more personnel, but what is of most concern to us is that we do not grant this request until the reform process of the institutions is well under way."
"It is difficult to see how more posts will solve the problem of management if there are still antiquated and complex procedures both in the Commission and Council for dealing with the many programmes."
"Mrs Schreyer came forward with an interesting suggestion which we should consider about the idea of a performance reserve in category 5, so that some posts would be available and we could then give more as the process improves."
"This is why we have called for a trialogue as soon as possible once this reading is complete, so that we can get down to the substance of the discussions."
"Greater efficiency within the Commission and more effective policy management over the life of the current financial perspective will give more confidence to the European citizens that their taxes are being put to good use and is the only way to ensure that the EU can achieve the wider goals of consolidation within its boundaries after the Nice summit and the gradual enlargement of the EU to the east."
"We are looking to rebuild people' s confidence in our institutions."
"Europe' s interests will not be served by having a weak Commission and an itinerant Parliament."
"On the contrary, we must work for a Parliament which campaigns for openness, efficiency and effective democratic control of the European institutions."
"Thank you very much, Mr Elles."
"You actually had five minutes."
"Although you may not realise, you generously gave two minutes to Mr Bourlanges."
"In any case, the Presidency wanted to praise not only your eloquence, but also your good faith, because we are sure you thought you had seven minutes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first of all I would like to extend warm thanks to the four rapporteurs who have done the groundwork for today."
"They have really excelled themselves and I feel this merits the recognition of the House."
"We are delighted to have found a basis for negotiations and a mood for negotiation, particularly as regards the Council, given that last year, we had a rather strained atmosphere to contend with, and this produced tension. The present mood allows for objective and focussed work, because instead of drawing up battlelines, we endeavour to actually solve the problems facing us."
"However, of course this also means coming clean with the tax payer and those who listen to us, on a whole range of points, so as to give them a realistic picture of the conditions we work under."
"Parliament has demonstrated repeatedly over the past few years that extreme financial prudence is the bedrock of our work."
"It is pure fiction to maintain that all we have ever been interested in is spending as much money as possible."
"That is not our approach!"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you only have to consider the fact that over the past five years, we have kept within the ceilings by EUR 15 billion, to realise that Parliament is at pains to deploy its funds as efficiently as possible."
"What we are not prepared to do though, is to simply dismiss out of hand, things we believe to be necessary, and which have been recognised as necessities following negotiations with yourself and the Commission, when there are new items on the agenda."
"We cannot have a situation where people who place their trust in us are let down in favour of the next ones in the queue."
"And so we must think about how to solve this problem."
"In the past - and we attach a great deal of importance to this - we have always kept to our mutual decisions under the Interinstitutional Agreement and the financial perspective."
"If the rates of increase seem to be high this year, then this is due primarily to the fact that the sharpest rates of increase are to be found in the sphere where we have the least say, i.e. agriculture."
"It is not that I want to complain about this."
"There has been a corresponding change in policy, and this must be financed accordingly - that is not what I am complaining about - but nor do I expect the President-in-Office to then stand up in this Chamber and say that there has been a huge increase, and comment that the Member States are financially prudent, whilst Parliament wants to push expenditure to the limit."
"That is not true, because you are the one primarily responsible for determining compulsory expenditure, and that is precisely where the figures are so high!"
"When you look at the figures - a 6.3% increase in compulsory expenditure and, by your own admission, a 0.23% increase in our areas - then you will see who is really being financially prudent, so as to be able to pursue their policies, and who is responsible for the increases."
"With all due respect for the fact that the national Finance Ministers have set out to reduce their national debts and actually cancel commitments entered into in the past, so as to safeguard opportunities for future generations, I would point out that Parliament has commitments from the past too!"
"We are not in a position to accumulate debt."
"Perhaps that is just as well."
"But we have made promises in the past, or rather made announcements and formulated common policies that will in fact need to be converted into payments at some stage."
"We cannot have a situation where we talk in a very relaxed manner about commitments over the years, and repeatedly make these promises, but then, when it comes to paying up, say that we are now unable to afford it and will have to cut back a bit in this area!"
"I believe it is very important for the Council members to register the fact that payments are commitments entered into in the past that will actually have to be honoured."
"We can approach this in two ways with these payments."
"Mr Elles made the point that we could of course reduce the commitments and retain the payments, which would enable us to honour the commitments at some stage."
"But that would mean having to scrutinise our policies and cut back on them."
"I make no bones about the fact that the policies we agreed on formed the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the financial perspective."
"They are important to us."
"These things mattered in the past, but they still matter today - now that we have a different political climate within Europe - particularly as there is so much at stake."
"We want to tackle unemployment for example."
"One outstanding achievement to come out of this budget is that we are prepared to join forces to support small and medium-sized enterprises, which create the most jobs, thereby benefiting Europe' s economy."
"We want to do something for them, and provision has been made for this in the budget in terms of actual figures."
"We want to do something to combat social exclusion, and to help the weakest of the weak."
"One of the policies we have opted for in the agricultural sector is to move away from a system of direct subsidies towards enhanced support for rural areas."
"This is a key priority in Parliament' s book, particularly as we have a right to a say in such matters."
"We intend to make sure that this area, more than any other, is given a boost."
"We have made it our business, over the past year, to see that all the funds allocated for this sphere were indeed taken up, because it is vital to frame the necessary policies for rural areas and for the people who live there."
"We are more than happy to work with the Council and all the others, on this."
"I say this as a Social Democrat."
"It is traditionally said of the Social Democrats that as a party, they are not the natural representatives of farmers or rural areas."
"I will tell you now that we most certainly are, because we believe in equal opportunities."
"We have other priorities on the foreign policy front."
"We want to combat poverty, wherever it happens to be in the world."
"We want to drive democratisation processes forward, and we want to strike a balance between the traditional political fields of foreign policy now before us."
"We believe that a constructive approach to eastward enlargement should go hand in hand with a well thought out and properly financed Mediterranean policy."
"These two policy areas must be in harmony with each other."
"Anyone who pursues eastward enlargement, must also be aware that as far as we are concerned, the Mediterranean is also an important part of the geopolitical situation we have to engage ourselves in."
"Something else we have had to deal with latterly, and which has caused us a great deal of problems - thankfully I would say, because they stem from the fact that a democratisation process is underway - is the situation in the Balkans."
"When you, Mr President-in-Office, then say this must be financed from existing budgetary funds, I would ask you to consider just one thing: this year alone we have made 200 000 flexibility instruments available, and supplemented this with EUR 180 million from the emergency reserve."
"Therefore, this year alone we will have included EUR 380 million in fresh funds in the budgetary lines and made it available."
"This problem will occupy us for the next six or seven years, and probably even longer."
"When we see that we have already committed EUR 380 million in fresh funds to this area this year, then I am completely baffled as to how, if we estimate that we are going to need EUR 5.5 billion for Serbia over the next seven years, for example, we are going to be able simply to produce it out of thin air."
"This would be impossible!"
"We are prepared to take a look at our budget and see where we could improve our effectiveness."
"This would go hand in hand with the reform of the Commission, which, as it happens, has already set us thinking about how we can make our policies more effective overall."
"One strategy is to create reserves, and then we must enquire closely, before we make the money available, as to how matters are to be taken forward."
"A second strategy is the one used by the Commission, i.e. the reform process within the Commission is being reinforced by making the appropriate number of staff available, so that the steady stream of additional tasks we have taken upon ourselves in the past, can actually be implemented."
"The worst thing that can befall us is to arouse hopes and then have to disappoint them."
"With your permission, I will again make the point, in the light of a current discussion, that over the past few years, and again this year, Parliament has discussed whether, people who are affected by natural disasters can receive aid from Parliament' s budget."
"Let there be no mistake, I think it is criminal to give people who have been affected by natural disasters the impression that we have the means to solve all the problems they face as a result."
"If we only include a few million in the lines - that is about all we can manage - it is just a stalling tactic, because when the people actually come to need it, we withdraw it again."
"When there have been one or two disasters at the beginning of the year, all we need to tell people at the end of the year is that we are sorry but we do not have anything left for them."
"There are people in northern Italy who need our help at the moment, but if they were to turn to Europe, we would have to tell them we were sorry but we do not have any money left because we spent it back in January, February or March."
"That is completely irresponsible."
"That is not the kind of perception we want people to have of Europe."
"When we announce something, or promise something, when we say we are able, and want, to help, then we must be in a position to follow this up."
"We must organise our political structures accordingly."
"We must go through what we define as being the central aspects of our policies with a fine toothcomb, and we must work together to see that our proposals are properly financed."
"As Socialists, we expressly offer our cooperation."
"I am looking forward to the forthcoming discussions with the Commission and the Council, and hope, in the interests of the citizens of Europe, that we reach some positive conclusions."
"Mr President, Mrs Jutta Haug and Mr Markus Ferber have been involved in an enormous task in drafting next years' EU budget."
"I wish to congratulate them and, at the same time, thank them for their constructive cooperation."
"Similarly, I would like to thank Mrs Rühle and Mr Colom i Naval and, in particular, the Chairman of the Committee, Terence Wynn."
"The budget for 2001 is the second budget during this present programming period."
"It continues the budget policy that was outlined in the Interinstitutional Agreement of over a year ago."
"My own group is satisfied that strict budgetary discipline was adhered to in the drafting of the budget."
"It is right that the committee should have made a special point of focus the reduction in expenditure commitments that are in arrears."
"Structural Funds are one year in arrears and the Media programme, for example, is actually eight years in arrears."
"Administration in the EU has been inexcusably poor, since, for example, last spring around EUR 3 billion of unused funds were returned to Member States."
"Mr President, the focus of the budget has been on education and culture, employment and the promotion of SMEs."
"We are satisfied with this arrangement."
"At present massive unemployment is the scourge of the EU."
"For that reason, it is appropriate to increase significantly the financing of unemployment initiatives."
"Support for SMEs also aims at reducing unemployment, as it is they that create new jobs most effectively."
"The most difficult problems in the new budget concern external action."
"The basic reason is Agenda 2000, in which there are too few funds for the construction of the Balkan region."
"Over the centuries the Balkan region has been Europe' s powder keg and that is the case today too."
"However, just EUR 1 850 million were set aside for the development of this region at Berlin, while EUR 4 500 million were spent during the previous period."
"The Council reduced funds for the Balkans by EUR 200 million, although there is a massive amount of reconstruction work to be done in the wake of the NATO bombing."
"If the EU and the Member States intend to keep their promises regarding the reconstruction of the Balkans, that must be clearly visible in providing finance and not just in proclamations."
"The Balkans war, months of bombing and the tremendous devastation that followed will lead to bitterness and hatred that may even last for generations among the inhabitants of the region unless the EU also takes responsibility for the reconstruction work."
"The Committee on Budgets has taken a constructive stand on financing."
"It wishes to commence talks with the Council in which all the opportunities of the Interinstitutional Agreement would be exploited to solve problems."
"The committee is also aiming at a multiannual financial framework for both the CARDS and the MEDA programmes."
"This would serve to lessen the yearly conflict that has tainted the preparation of the EU budget in the last couple of years."
"Mr President, it is with these remarks that I would like, on behalf of my group, to support the policy of the Committee on Budgets in next year' s budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo the congratulations extended to the rapporteurs."
"Our group will support your proposals for the most part."
"However, we oppose the GUE' s strategy, which submitted a proposal out of the blue in the Committee on Budgets yesterday, to reject the budget."
"In view of the pressing problems we face in Serbia and Kosovo, we do not believe this strategy to have any serious political intention."
"Even though we endorse many of the points of criticism directed at the Council, it is clear that a strategy of this kind would lead to a politically untenable confrontation and undermine the credibility of the European institutions."
"Like the budget before it, Budget 2001 had almost insoluble conflicts to contend with: on the one hand the pressure of consolidation and cost-cutting policy, as agreed under the Interinstitutional Agreement, in order to secure the financing of the enlargement process, and on the other hand, the acute financing needs of the Stability Pact for the Balkans."
"This conflict is heightened further, in our view, by the Council' s policy of casually promising everyone aid, and constantly intensifying internal conflicts by making promises of money without thinking seriously about the financing implications."
"I must say that is how many people on the outside view the Council' s policy."
"Instead, Parliament is expected to honour these promises by repeatedly finding new ways to make cuts."
"In this way, Parliament' s political room for manoeuvre in the budget is being systematically undermined."
"We will end up being nothing more than the Council' s assistants in the implementation process."
"This situation cannot be allowed to continue in our view."
"However, there is no easy solution."
"It is a fact that the forthcoming round of enlargement will put the Community severely to the test."
"Financing is a balancing act between needs - financial requirements in the new Member States and financing opportunities for the donor countries - and there are limited public funds."
"Naturally there is a need to budget carefully, we support this and should not try to get round it."
"We are also aware that many projects and programmes are discredited owing to mismanagement."
"We urgently need a long- and medium-term strategy, so that important areas such as MEDA and the Stability Pact for the Balkans are not played off against each other."
"We fear that Parliament' s present proposal, which we largely endorse, will expose us to this risk."
"We fear that the flexibility reserve is probably not being used to finance MEDA, as it should be, but instead, is being employed, at the end of the day, to offset further financial need in Serbia."
"We hope to be able to develop a common strategy over the next few weeks in order to counteract this."
"We also urgently need a common strategy for improving management."
"This will entail a corresponding increase in staffing levels, and here too we are critical of the committee' s majority decisions."
"We fear that the majority of the committee members have used the wrong tactics."
"Demands for improved performance also imply a need for more staff."
"As far as we are concerned, linking the demand for improved performance with the demand to place staff in the reserve at the same time will not wash with the public."
"We are also critical of the decisions taken with regard to the LIFE programme."
"We are hoping that the majority of MEPs will have second thoughts about this on Thursday and vote accordingly, and that we will succeed in reclaiming LIFE from the reserve."
"And so finally, to recap: all in all we would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Ferber and Mrs Haug, for their valuable work."
"Above all, we call upon the parliamentary majority to again think carefully about whether all the staff - i.e. all 400 posts - should really be placed in the reserve, or whether it would not in fact make sense to come to a different vote on this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, as you know, my Group has unanimously decided to table a motion rejecting the draft budget for the year 2001."
"This is a truly extraordinary initiative, especially at first reading, and one that is bound to be unsuccessful, for in the present circumstances it cannot possible gain a majority of votes in favour."
"We knew as much when we took the decision, so why did we take it?"
"Every man and every woman here needs to realise that unless we challenge the ultra-restrictive strategy that characterises the Council' s draft budget then, come 2001, we are going to find ourselves in a situation where we are not able to honour all our commitments to our partners in the Balkans, the southern Mediterranean and other developing regions of the world."
"We are going to be in some way forced to choose between these three priorities, even though they are identically legitimate and equally urgent, and this is not, in our view, acceptable."
"The Council' s decision to cut a quarter of the appropriations earmarked for the Balkans, even before the change in the situation in Serbia, to cut EUR 150 million of the appropriations intended for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and more generally to cut all appropriations for cooperation with the South is taking us directly down this blind alley."
"How is it possible to formally receive President Kostunica at the European Council in Biarritz, to convene an extraordinary Council in Marseilles devoted to Euro-Mediterranean partnership and to make an urbi et orbi proclamation of the most noble aspirations, raising encouraging hopes among the people of Eastern Europe and the south of Europe, without, at the same time, providing ourselves with the means to fulfil these commitments?"
"The budget is not the be all and end all, of course, but it does reflect the political will of the fifteen Member States."
"For all that, the same approach has been applied to the European Union' s internal policies."
"Jacques Chirac spoke lyrically, in this very Chamber, of the Europe of all citizens, male and female, yet the draft budget of the Fifteen envisages an absolute reduction in appropriations in chapters as important as social action, employment, education, training, youth, culture, audiovisual media and the environment."
"On some of these lines, even the amendments from the Committee on Budgets, although positive, fall short of the 2000 budget."
"This is true for employment, the environment and trans-European networks, and, as we have seen, the problem is even more critical as regards external actions."
"We must not allow ourselves to fall into this trap."
"The only way to get out of it is to demand that the financial perspective be reviewed, particularly Chapter 4."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has done so, and the President of the European Parliament clearly expressed the same views in Biarritz."
"Mrs Haug, the general rapporteur also attempted, last night, to amend her report in this respect in order to reflect the concerns expressed by my Group, and I must thank her for that."
"Had this amendment been adopted in its initial version, it might have started to deal the cards afresh, but the idea was rejected by the majority of the Committee on Budgets."
"So is the European Parliament therefore about to implicitly accept the Council' s position, no matter what it says?"
"This is a blind alley, which my Group is not ready to go down."
"In this connection, I should like to refer to a crucial passage in the speech by the general rapporteur."
"Earlier, Mrs Haug quite rightly pointed out that the Council has refused to discuss a multiannual revision of the financial perspective and to continue like this, as she said, ""is completely unacceptable."""
"So, what conclusions must we logically draw from this situation?"
"Our motion to reject the Council text is specifically aimed at contributing towards highlighting, in good time, this key political problem on which, sooner or later, we shall have to deliver an opinion in order, in the long term, to match European projects with the resources needed to implement them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the French Presidency of the European Union is coming to an end at the time when Parliament is voting on the budget for 2001."
"There is one fact which must be noted, and which we must, as French Members of Parliament, deplore, and that is that the Council has failed with regard to one of the traditional responsibilities of French politics, its responsibility to the farmers of Europe, with a cut of more than half a billion euros in heading 1."
"It is also, unfortunately, true, as a number of people in this Chamber have commented, with regard to the Mediterranean countries, with a swinging cut in funds for the MEDA programme."
"This has got to be the worst possible message to be sending out to our friends and neighbours around the Mediterranean at the time of enlargement."
"We can only, in such circumstances, support Parliament' s attitude and the back the amendment in favour of MEDA, restoring the appropriations of the preliminary draft budget, in the same way that we must be pleased at the significant increase in agricultural expenditure and the special place given to the second pillar of the CAP, promotion of the countryside, while, however, deploring the position of the Committee on Budgets, which rejected almost all the amendments from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development seeking to compensate for the Council' s drastic cuts in the fruit and vegetable sector and also in the pig farming sector."
"In the field of external aid, will we ever be able to realise the hopes of President Kostunica who in recent days has been most forthright in declaring that the fact that France held the Presidency of the European Union at these moments that are so critical for the people of Serbia and the continent as a whole was the work of Providence?"
"The amount of aid allocated to the Balkans might give him to think so, with both the EUR 200 million released from the 2000 budget as emergency aid and the appropriations for 2001 which, even so, represent an increase of 30% over and above the 2000 budget."
"That being the case, the level of funding allocated to Kosovo is not without certain problems."
"In view of the appropriations which could have been committed for the first months of the year 2000, questions can be asked as to Kosovo' s real capacity to absorb the EUR 350 million planned for 2001. Most of all, however, the victory of the Serbian President forces us henceforth to recognise Belgrade as sole discussion partner for all decisions, all intervention, and all routing of aid via the provinces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The European Union no longer has any alibi since the fall of Milosevic."
"The policy of aid for the Balkans must now concentrate massively on Serbia, a region impoverished by our bombing raids last year and by our economic sanctions which hit it so hard."
"The aid we propose to contribute must safeguard rather than threaten the Serbian national identity."
"We should, therefore, remember that both Kosovo and Montenegro form an integral part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Let us therefore put an end to direct aid to these provinces - occasionally without a legal basis, as we saw in this Chamber not so long ago in the case of Montenegro - direct aid that serves primarily to fuel the separatist movements."
"In conclusion, we must clearly remember that, as far as we are concerned, aid for the Balkans in no way justifies requests for revision of the financial perspective."
"The bottom line of every budget year shows a surplus, indicating that the amounts of appropriations we have voted on do not correspond to the real needs of the situation."
"It is possible to make substantial savings, either by saving the monies arising from the under implementation of certain programmes, or by the European Union' s at last taking a decision to stop using budget lines for the purposes of pro-Europe propaganda."
"But in that case, unfortunately, there are many examples: special treatment given to associations with declared federalist aims or to the many NGOs whose roles, philosophies and operations are highly questionable, the funding of European political parties, via the sums swallowed up in the Prince programme, in an attempt to convince the citizens of Member States of the validity of the euro at a time when the European currency is experiencing a loss of confidence widely shared by Europeans, from our Danish friends right up to the managers of the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, as usual, I am speaking on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List, and I would like to start by echoing the congratulations to the two rapporteurs on the work they have done in recent months and, in general, congratulating the Committee on Budgets on its work."
"Mr President, when one hears Mr Wurtz' s ornate, well-argued and well-considered reasoning, it is difficult not to agree with at least the underlying argument, if not the method he recommends."
"Of course, we too are convinced that, if Parliament and the Council do not assume their responsibilities in terms of the need to deal with the budget, first and foremost tackling the use of the flexibility instrument but, also, revising the financial perspective, it will be difficult not to agree with the view that we are going to be running away from our responsibilities with a heavy conscience because we are not able to make good our undertakings, either those made in Biarritz or those which have been made with many other partners over the years."
"We do not agree with the method, which is why, in this first reading, we place our confidence in the rapporteur' s approach, in spite of what happened last night in the Committee on Budgets, in the hope that this will constitute a basis for effective discussion with the Council in-between the first and second readings."
"However, the issue raised by Mr Wurtz is clearly central."
"In my opinion, if we do not revise the financial perspective, we will be being irresponsible towards both ourselves and our partners, especially in the 2001-2006 period."
"Mr President, the EU' s budget is the Union' s choice instrument to define political areas of interest as well as core areas."
"In this process, we as Parliament need to ensure that we serve the interests of all European citizens."
"These may be citizens who would like to see the Union develop into a federation, but also citizens who are sceptical about Europe, as demonstrated recently by the Danish population."
"Unfortunately, Mrs Haug has adopted a political line which only takes account of the supporters of a federal Europe."
"A line in which she, like her predecessor Mr Bourlanges, is attempting to break through the financial ceiling."
"Over the past few months, Commissioner Patten has repeatedly pointed to the Union' s enormous payment backlog."
"Unfortunately, the rapporteur still has not grasped that this is why we must tread water for the time being."
"""Let' s do better with less"" , as Commissioner Patten said, is lost on her."
"Budget policy needs to instil public confidence in European policy."
"The fact that this confidence is lacking is obvious from the drop in the currency value of the Euro, which, since its launch, has lost nearly 30% of its value compared to the Yen and the American Dollar."
"That confidence will not grow by ploughing even more money into the budget, but it will if the budget is implemented efficiently."
"For this to happen, difficult choices have to be made, but unfortunately, it appears that the rapporteur is not prepared to make these choices; instead, she has opted for the easy way out by increasing the budget."
"The refusal to set priorities is most prominent in the area of foreign and security policy."
"Naturally we too are in favour of giving aid to the Balkans and Serbia. But the money for that aid can be freed up by setting priorities within foreign policy."
"What are the core tasks for the Union and what tasks belong to the Member States?"
"A Union which does not dare make choices will create more distance between itself and its citizens, who do need to make choices in their personal budgets."
"Setting priorities is being dodged by abusing the flexibility instrument."
"It is quite justified to deploy this instrument for new, unforeseen expenditure and is therefore the principle par excellence in the case of the sudden revolution in Serbia."
"The rapporteur' s proposal to use this principle for MEDA, however, does not meet the 'new' or 'unforeseen' requirement, and is all the more surprising in the light of the fact that spending levels have not been reached in the MEDA programme."
"Although the rapporteur attended the meeting of the Committee on Budgets yesterday, she failed to draw lessons from the credit transfers which were being discussed."
"It appeared yesterday that 25% of the amount budgeted for 2000 for Latin America was not used and is now being transferred for aid to Kosovo."
"Mr Bourlanges made the cursory note that the 2000 budget for Latin America had probably been somewhat too generous."
"There is therefore leeway in foreign policy, i.e. category 4, and the proposed increases of the appropriations budgeted for for Latin America are not based on fact."
"The Council agrees with the creation of 400 posts which, according to Commissioner Patten, the Commission needs in order to eliminate the backlog of payments."
"In the light of this, it is not justified that the Council should considerably reduce the category 4 payments."
"We must give the Commission the opportunity to eliminate the backlog by increasing its staffing levels."
"Finally, Mr Heaton-Harris was right to refer in his amendments to the onesidedness of many European programmes, in which the citizen is treated to a propaganda-like tale on European integration, and at the expense of the citizens themselves would you believe."
"The Union must realise that certainly not all citizens dream of far-reaching integration."
"Programmes of the Union should therefore adopt a more neutral tone, so as to prevent one specific political hue being put across at the expense of all citizens."
"Democracy cannot be reconciled with a dictatorship of the majority."
"Mr President, one of the principles governing the budgetary process for 2001 is that of saving money."
"It is just as well, given that of the 15 Member States only 7 are likely to be able to present a positive balance sheet for the year 2000."
"There is therefore little prospect of us receiving additional revenue in the form of higher contribution payments from the Member States."
"We have certainly got our priorities right in Budget 2001."
"To that extent, the rapporteurs are to be congratulated."
"It is a fact that the unemployment rate is too high in Europe, particularly as this affects the weak members of society, i.e. young people, women and the long-term unemployed."
"We must therefore support all the measures designed to boost small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We need more entrepreneurs in Europe, who, in their turn, will create more jobs."
"There should be no question of Europe failing to keep the promises it makes."
"The truth though, is that many European politicians promise funds that they, or their committees, then fail to make available at the end of the day."
"I am referring to the absolutely crucial payments required by the Balkan countries, which the Council has now cut back on."
"However, it is also unacceptable that many of Europe' s priorities are financed in such a way that the poor are ultimately the ones to suffer."
"It was therefore both right and important that the Council' s extensive cuts in agriculture, totalling EUR 55 million, were corrected again."
"But at the end of the day, Europe' s priorities will only be financially viable in the long-term if Europe' s economy goes full steam ahead."
"The tax burden must therefore be reduced in percentage terms, and only an economic upturn and accompanying economic growth will secure increased state revenue."
"In addition, our administrative systems must be modernised, and it is our duty to lead by example."
"I therefore hope that the newly created budgetary line - which a few people, myself included, have been critical of - for financing the European parties, is not used to award funds to those who have already squandered away funds made available at national level and are now in fact in debt."
"I also hope that the conditions attached to the establishment of 400 additional service posts within the Commission will actually be fulfilled."
"I hope that in the course of further negotiations with the Council these principles will actually be upheld, and that in this way, we will be able to jointly adopt a budget for 2001 that benefits the citizens."
"Mr President, it is only right that I should begin by commending the work of the various rapporteurs."
"As I was able to observe most closely the way in which Mrs Haug dealt with the issues within her remit, I wish to bear witness to the sensitivity and balance that she demonstrated throughout the process."
"Rather than carrying out a technical analysis of the budget or an interpretation of the amounts provided for in the respective 'revenue' and 'expenditure' columns, Parliament should concern itself with the quality of both expenditure that has been released and expenditure that has been proposed, which specifically requires an assessment of the criteria for the use of appropriations and also an assessment of their impact."
"On the basis of this understanding, the Group of the European People' s Party - European Democrats wishes to highlight the following aspects:"
"the level of budgetary implementation;"
"the degree to which policies that have been laid down are implemented and the results achieved;"
"consistency between the legislative process and the budgetary options;"
"progress in reforming the Commission."
"In the context of these objectives, a raft of measures is proposed for next year, which in our opinion will help to improve the current situation."
"Firstly, with regard to the low levels of budgetary implementation, in particular of expenditure classified as ""non-compulsory"" , a special requirement is introduced for requests to the Commission for explanations."
"It has to be acknowledged that as long as the explanations requested are not forthcoming or are unsatisfactory, the appropriations in question cannot be used."
"Furthermore, unless the budget appropriations are used effectively, how can we talk about improvements, which are so necessary in certain categories?"
"The second point is that there must be greater speed, transparency and efficiency in administration given the systematic increase in the RAL, that is in amounts still to be paid. This results from the increasing disparity between commitments that have been entered into, payments that have been authorised and payments made, particularly under category 4 - ""External Actions"" ."
"The needs are self-evident, we have many commitments, the importance of external cooperation in asserting the European Union' s presence on the world stage is obvious, and there is a very low implementation rate for various programmes."
"The MEDA programme, which focuses on the Mediterranean basin, a geographical area of the utmost strategic importance, is a good example of our inability to implement our programmes."
"We need to make up ground in MEDA and guarantee greater efficiency in Serbia, for example, whilst at the same time effectively implementing the European Union' s traditional policies in this field."
"With a view to resolving current bottlenecks, a general reserve should be created under category 4 - a performance reserve - which will be used in proportion to the extent to which the various items are implemented."
"Furthermore, we hope to see a revision of the Financial Regulation which will set a definite deadline of two years, for example, as the maximum period between the authorisation for payment and payment itself. Failure to comply will result in the sums involved being withdrawn from the budget, as already happens in other categories."
"The third aspect to be emphasised is that if we wish to see greater coordination between the European institutions, we should promote, in theory and in practice, the integration of the Commission' s legislative programme and the budgetary process, as well as informing Parliament in advance of decisions by other institutions that may have an impact on the budget."
"Fourthly, with regard to the reform of the Commission' s procedures and staffing policy, we must distinguish between issues relating to new admissions and the desirable - as far as we are concerned - creation of a permanent and compulsory early retirement system."
"Fifthly, if we value initiative and responsibility, we must promote the creation of a programme aimed at businesses and at business people."
"By preserving this strategic approach in the way we address the budget this year and in years to come, the European Parliament will fully play its role in the budgetary process."
"Parliaments only truly represent their electors, a crucial aspect of democracy, when they refuse to simply rubber stamp other people' s proposals."
"Mr President, I give my thanks to the rapporteurs."
"The four of them deserve congratulations for the work they have put in."
"I welcome Mr Patriat, who is in the Chamber for the first time for this debate."
"I thank him for his clarity What he said was absolutely clear."
"The message he can pass on to Mrs Parly is: do not book a plane for Thursday night."
"It is going to be a long Thursday night and the flight will be some time on Friday."
"For the 2001 budget - that is for conciliation - there is a touch of déja vu in that it is so similar to the 2000 budget because category 4 is overriding everything."
"Nobody seems to be talking about anything except category 4."
"If we could turn the clock back to when we agreed the Interinstitutional Agreement, if we had given EUR 200 million extra to category 4, we would have solved a lot of problems over the last two years."
"The fact that category 4' s ceiling has now been exceeded by EUR 380 million tells us that we really should have done something like that."
"We are trying to safeguard Parliament' s priorities in category 4."
"When people talk about making reductions or finding the money within category 4 to fund certain priorities, do not forget that Parliament has its priorities, We made that clear in the vote in committee."
"But there are three areas which are giving us cause for concern."
"Kosovo, of course - which we had the problem with last year."
"The transfer that we made last night should resolve the funding for Kosovo, and we should have less of a problem next year because of what we voted for last night."
"In fact, we have problem in that we have given too much."
"We now have EUR 25 million over the EUR 814 million, so what we could discuss at the trialogue and conciliation is how to take EUR 25 million away from Kosovo, to give it to - let us say - MEDA."
"With the transfer of EUR 175 million we have estimated EUR 25 million more than we expected."
"We are saying we should use the flexibility instrument for MEDA."
"We will try to get an agreement with the Council and the Commission on that."
"But although we talk about the flexibility instrument, let us not forget it does not exist unless the Council and Parliament agree to it coming into existence."
"Unless it comes into existence we have not just one major problem but several problems."
"As for Serbia, we all remain uncertain as to what the needs are there."
"Therefore we have put the PM on the line."
"I turn now to what Mr Wurtz said before. It had a lot of validity."
"But to reject the budget at this stage, at first reading, is totally wrong."
"The content of the argument is worth considering for support, but to try to reject the budget at first reading is nonsense."
"We have a long way to go before we get to the second reading but at least he has given us something to think about."
"On the western Balkans, President-in-Office, you said that the Council considers EUR 614 million to be enough."
"We do not and the Commission does not."
"We reckon we have more scientific evidence than your guess at a figure."
"So that figure will need to be clarified."
"We base it on what the Commission and the World Bank reported last time."
"My real worry is that, when the Commission and the World Bank come back with their report at the end of November or beginning of December, it will just be written off by the Council."
"You said that if we needed a revision of the Interinstitutional Agreement, then we have to base it on needs and availability, and of course we have to consider the flexibility instrument first."
"But what if the needs are extremely high?"
"What if the availability is extremely low?"
"What if the flexibility instrument is not enough?"
"Then the reality is that we will have to look at an IIA."
"My real concern is that the Council will simply say that they do not agree with this analysis, that we should forget it and that they are sticking to the existing ceilings."
"If that happens we have major problems and Mr Wurtz may be our best friend at the end of the day."
"Let us bear that in mind."
"As regards MEDA, the Council said that the commitments are not a problem owing to the eight years of payment backlogs."
"If we took that argument to its final conclusion, we would not need any commitments."
"We could solve all our problems by taking every commitment away from MEDA and just working on the outstanding payments."
"We believe that the Commission has proposed realistic figures for MEDA."
"We have spoken to Commissioner Patten at length, as well as to Commissioner Schreyer, and if the extra staffing is made available, as proposed in the White Paper, at least there should be the beginnings of some substantial movement on MEDA."
"There is a distinct difference between Parliament and the Council."
"We know that we have representation without taxation."
"We do not have to find the money - the Member States have to do that."
"We have representation without taxation."
"But the Council' s problem is prime ministers and foreign ministers who say one thing and finance ministers who say another."
"That is something like proclamations without appropriations."
"There is a real lack of coordination that leads to deprivation and frustration."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"President-in-Office, there are several issues which we need agreement on: real issues."
"I would like to touch on the White Paper, because you and the Commission have failed to mention what was actually said in the trialogue."
"That concerns the early retirement scheme where, I believe, the Commission gave its approval in principle, but you were awaiting a proposal on the financial regulation."
"That will be one of the issues we have to resolve - it is not just the question of the 400 posts, it is the package that goes with it."
"President-in-Office, I am looking forward to the trialogue and to the conciliation with great anticipation."
"My flight is booked for Friday, so I am ready for a long night on Thursday, but I hope that at the end of all this we can get a budget we are all satisfied with, so we can do justice to the tax-payers of the European Union, to the people we represent, but also to those in need, especially in the MEDA areas, especially in Serbia and especially in the western Balkans."
"Thank you very much, Mr Wynn."
"We would particularly like to thank you for making us smile and even laugh about a subject as serious as the budget."
"That is something for which we should always be thankful."
"The debate is closed. It will resume at 9 p.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0548/2000). We shall examine the questions addressed to the Council."
"Question No 1 by (H-0709/00):"
"Subject: Enhanced cooperation What progress is the Council Presidency making on enhanced cooperation, and could it give examples of areas in which it would apply?"
"I believe that Mr Duff was present this morning when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz."
"What is more, in his capacity as rapporteur, he asked a question just after the group chairmen."
"He has also heard and read Mr Gil-Robles' s report on reinforced cooperation, and my own response to this."
"I therefore think he has understood Biarritz' s findings on the matter, which are rather encouraging, and the Council' s quite positive response to Parliament' s and his own suggestions."
"Thank you for the answer."
"I certainly absorbed the messages of Biarritz and I was encouraged by the things that occurred there."
"I would just ask Minister Moscovici two further questions."
"Firstly, would he agree that it would be more sensible to restrict the use of closer cooperation solely to those issues where unanimity applies within the Council?"
"As he appreciates, this is a growing feeling within Parliament."
"And the second question concerns the reaction of the candidate countries to the debate inside the EU Union concerning closer cooperation."
"Do you find that they welcome the prospect or are they perhaps frightened of it?"
". (FR) Our objective is indeed to safeguard what lies at the heart of Community policy, i.e. the internal market and the cohesion policies, reinforced cooperation."
"Matters are, therefore, perfectly clear."
"We wish to adhere to the acquis communautaire, but at the same time we should not have regulations that are too inflexible."
"It is true that qualified majority voting is the main thing, but we must have some flexibility."
"We shall have to take note of the reactions of the candidate countries."
"Firstly, I think it important that procedures should work properly with 15 Members, which is already a complicated matter."
"It would be a far more complex matter if there were 27 Members, but, as you know, the French Presidency is going to convene the European Conference on two occasions."
"There will be a ministerial meeting, firstly, in Sochaux, on 23 November, and there specifically we shall have a debate on institutional reform in the context of an enlarged Europe, and on the second occasion, on the morning of the 7 December at the European Council in Nice."
"The French Presidency is probably rather keener than others to get these countries involved."
"Having said that, to make matters clear, reinforced cooperation does not mean a two-speed Europe."
"We have specifically stressed that an open and inclusive approach was needed, and no one should be afraid of reinforced cooperation."
"The 'small countries' , for example, to use a quite inappropriate term, should not feel themselves excluded from reinforced cooperation or that reinforced cooperation means some sort of exclusive vanguard, centre of gravity or pioneer group."
"All it means is that there is a certain flexibility to enable specific policies to go ahead, even if some countries cannot, or do not wish to, participate, and what is true for the European Union' s Member States is also true for the candidate countries."
"No one must feel as if they are in a carriage being towed along by a kind of runaway train."
"This is not some sort of Directory."
"Question No 2 by John Cushnahan lapses, as the author is not present."
"Question No 3 by (H-0714/00):"
"Subject: Cost of the activities of the 'Three Wise Men' in Austria Which funds are being used to cover the costs of the activities of the 'Three Wise Men' , who have been deployed by the Portuguese Presidency to assess the situation in Austria?"
"My answer is very simple."
"The Council played no part in this matter and the Community budget was not used in any way."
"The expenditure committed in order to fund the task of assessing the Austrian situation was actually funded in its entirety at national level by Austria' s 14 partners within the European Union."
"The Presidency did, of course, make a contribution to this."
"Mr President, Minister Moscovici, one question the public, and also quite a number of MEPs have been asking themselves, is: what was the role of the embassies in this connection?"
"Given that there is an embassy representing each of the 14 Member States in Vienna, why was it necessary to have the Three Wise Men look into something that the embassies could have monitored themselves on a daily basis?"
"Did the embassies fail in some way?"
"Did they fail to retrieve the reports?"
"Did the relevant governments fail to read the reports?"
"We really cannot avoid this question."
"Perhaps it would have sufficed to read one or other newspaper, but I would be most grateful if you could provide me with a brief analysis of the role of the embassies."
"This question makes me smile a little."
"In my opinion, ambassadors are quite simply there to represent the government of their country."
"They must, of course, pass local information back to their government, but the question here was to find a solution to a situation where fourteen Member States had taken measures with regard to the fifteenth for the political reasons that are familiar to you."
"I therefore think it was quite appropriate, in this context, to ask an external authority, that was not morally implicated, to undertake this task."
"I think Austria has no call for complaint regarding what has been done, quite the contrary."
"I would add that if any individual country had followed up on their ambassador' s report, then perhaps the solutions advocated by the experts' report would not have been applied."
"As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 4 and 5 will be taken together."
"Question No 4 by (H-0715/00):"
"Subject: Colombia Is the Council aware of the most recent massacre, which resulted in eight deaths; on 8 July 2000 in Colombia in a place called La Union, and has it investigated the possibility that the atrocity was committed with the full support of the Colombian Government?"
"Has the Council held discussions on this event?"
"If so, does it propose to make any formal protest?"
"Question No 5 by (H-0776/00):"
"Subject: Violation of human rights and dismantling of paramilitary groups in Colombia Paramilitary groups have stepped up the murders of farmers, journalists, trade unionists, political leaders and human rights activists over the past few months."
"Ramiro Zapata was the latest of 25 human rights activists to be murdered and, recently, the Colombian press condemned the paramilitary groups' ""Plan 100"" to kill one hundred human rights activists."
"The government has recognised the ""accidental"" killing of six children in Puerto Rico on 15 August."
"Furthermore, Colombia has not assembled the units that the European Union asked it to create to fight the paramilitaries."
"What measures is the Council taking or prepared to take to make aid to Colombia conditional on the Colombian government showing significant progress in respect for human rights and in firm action towards dismantling the paramilitary groups?"
"Yes, generally the European Union regularly condemns in the strongest possible terms the serious human rights violations which, unfortunately, are still being committed practically every day in Colombia."
"The matter to which Mr McCartin refers, however, has not been specifically referred to the Council, and the Council has not mentioned the matter as such in its discussions."
"While supporting the efforts made by the Colombian Government to make progress in the peace process, the European Union has stressed, and continues to stress, that government' s necessary commitment to respect for human rights in Colombia."
"The European Union has also appealed for the commitment of all parties to seeking a negotiated solution to the conflict, without which it would be impossible to establish any lasting peace."
"It is up to the Colombian authorities to define the practical means by which the Colombian Government might undertake to dismantle the paramilitary groups."
"Recommendations from regional organisations and the experience of neighbouring countries will doubtless be able to assist in defining these means."
"On several occasions, the European Union has affirmed its willingness to support, to the extent that it can and with the most appropriate means, all efforts to secure a peace agreement."
"Following the international meeting on the Colombian peace process, held in Madrid on 6 and 7 July 2000, attended by Mr Solana, the representative of the 15 Member States and the Commission, the European Union is currently looking into practical opportunities for cooperation with Colombia."
"In this respect, a Joint Declaration should be read by France' s representative, on behalf of the Presidency, on the meetings in support of the peace process scheduled to be held in Bogotá on 24 October 2000, which should, in particular, stress the need to support the rule of law and the fight against the causes of violence, to boost aid for the victims of violence, to defend human rights, protect biodiversity and the environment, and step up consultation and regional cooperation."
"You may rest assured, finally, that respect for human rights, and the promotion of human rights, are, in any case, a key component of the European Union' s cooperation with third countries."
"Mr President, I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply which was very comprehensive."
"I am a bit happier with the attitude of the Council today than I was in July because, as on many occasions in situations of crisis, the European Union seems always to be the last authority to arrive on the international scene and make its voice heard."
"I also appreciate the expertise of Mr Solana in South American affairs and I recognise that we have made some progress."
"Nevertheless, is the Council aware of the amount of money that the European Union provides, something like ten times what the United States provides for development cooperation throughout the world?"
"Yet when a crisis occurs, whether in Africa, South America, the Middle East or the Far East, it is the United States and not the European voice that is heard."
"Does the President-in-Office recognise that we are failing to capitalise on the resources that we provide?"
"I am not unaware of amount of money the Americans are promising in aid for Colombia, for example, the bulk of which is earmarked for activities to combat drugs trafficking."
"This is something I am aware of, even if this plan is occasionally criticised, for instance, by NGOs."
"At the same time, from my own experience, I think you are somewhat mistaken in making such a generalisation."
"As far as Africa, the Middle East or the Mediterranean are concerned, the European Union is in fact the largest donor."
"But in that case we are in a rather peculiar situation given the historical links between the United Sates and the continent of South America. We are, nonetheless, paying a great deal of attention to the way this situation is developing."
"Thank you for the information, Mr President, and thank you for giving me the floor."
"Many of us believe that the problems in Colombia, as in other Latin American countries, stem from the issue of whether or not peasant-farmers own land."
"In 1984, 0.2% of landowners in Colombia owned 32% of the land."
"In 1997, this figure stood at 45%, and today will be even higher."
"This is the problem, in addition, in many cases, to the actions of the paramilitaries, who force the peasant-farmers to move by means of indiscriminate killings."
"Here we have three cases in different parts of the country: In the village of Carmen, 500 people were forced to move by the murder of 14 peasant-farmers."
"In the port of Buenaventura, 20 peasant-farmers were murdered."
"Far away, in another area called Ciénaga, there have been over 200 murders since the paramilitaries moved in a year ago."
"The question, Mr President, and I shall end here, is whether there is a solution that would exert greater pressure than that proposed by the President in his statement and whether the aid we are going to give will be entirely different from that of the United States, in other words, not intended for crop-spraying, but for crop replacement and also for social, rather than military, purposes."
"Let me briefly say that I am taking note of the explanation you have just given, but I should like to specify that the European Union hopes to set up its own programme of socio-economic and institutional aid for the Colombian peace process, and we shall readily return to it when we have made more progress in this area."
"Mr President, I want to address the question of the paramilitaries' involvement in the La Unión massacre."
"Would the minister agree that by and large it is clearly known that the paramilitaries concerned act as proxies for the Colombian Government?"
"Is he not concerned, therefore, that Plan Colombia intends to provide military aid to the Colombian Government, use military resources to spray crops, allegedly drugs crops, and that the European Union is expected to come in and mop up the problem with a social policy programme?"
"This is an inadequate response by the European Union."
"We should not be agreeing to Plan Colombia on that basis."
"I should just like to confirm my previous answer."
"While taking the honourable Member' s comments very seriously, I still think that this aid is useful and should be intensified."
"Mr President, will the President-in-Office join me in expressing regret at the killings on 9 July 2000 of two of the young men of the Atlantis Ecological Group: Tristan James, grandson of the founder of the group, Jenny James, who lives in Colombia, and Javier Nova, the boyfriend of one of Jenny' s young daughters, who were brutally murdered by a renegade group of Farc rebels when they returned to the area they had both lived in for most of their 18 years to visit relatives there."
"When Mr Moscovici answers Mr De Rossa that he is sensitive to what he says, why is it that when the General Affairs Council on 9 October particularly referred to a European plan for Colombia, the European Commission subsequently issued a communication on 18 October which uses the words ""Plan Colombia"" , with its military aid and with its aerial spraying of crops which have been condemned by the Panamanian Interior Minister, Winston Spadafora, the Venezuelan Minister, José Vicente Rangel and governments in Peru, Equator and Brazil?"
"Will he today repeat that the Council will not support Plan Colombia, as Mr De Rossa and I and every civilised Member of this House want?"
"I think I have already answered this question."
"The Council is not here to make comments on every aspect of this extremely sensitive and painful issue."
"With your permission, Mr President, I shall confine myself to the answers I have already given."
"It is the duty of the President of the sitting to guide and interpret the questions and it is then at the discretion of the President-in-Office of the Council how to discuss or respond to them, except where the questions are nonsensical or have nothing to do with the subject."
"Then I will exercise my responsibility."
"Mr De Rossa has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, when you mention the text of the supplementaries and the President-in-Office' s response, could I remind the President-in-Office that the original question specifically related to the massacre in Colombia, whether or not the Council has had discussions on this event and if it plans to make any formal protest or not."
"The questions that I and other Members asked are very specifically related to the situation in Colombia."
"It is not adequate to say that you are not in a position, and it is not your role, to go into this kind of detail."
"The question asks you to go into detail."
"Why accept the question at all if you are not going to go into the detail?"
"Mr De Rossa, I have to tell you that the Rules of Procedure do not allow for responses from Members, but merely their questions."
"Afterwards you may deal bilaterally with the President-in-Office of the Council, either in writing or in person."
"Let me make myself clear."
"A question was asked of me, and I answered that question."
"I specifically stated - and this will have been noted in the Minutes - that the incident you refer to in your question has not been specifically referred to the Council and that the Council has not mentioned the matter as such in this debate."
"I had, therefore, answered your question."
"I should not like you to think that the Council does not answer the questions asked of it."
"At the same time, it is just not possible to undertake an ad hoc debate on matters like this, which are, let me repeat, extremely complex ones."
"I utterly respect what the Members of Parliament are saying."
"It is just that I am trying not to indulge in demagoguery."
"I would ask you all to comply with Questions to the Council in accordance with the rules for this procedure as they are laid down."
"As far as possible, the debate should not be academic and theoretical."
"I would therefore ask that when you put further questions, they are specific questions on the matter in hand."
"As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 will be taken together."
"Question No 6 by (H-0718/00):"
"Subject: International financial transactions At the next annual meeting of the IMF, does the Council plan to propose that the IMF Committee should study possible arrangements for introducing a Tobin-type tax on international financial transactions with a view to combating speculation and stabilising currency markets?"
"Question No 7 by (H-0719/00):"
"Subject: Management of the revenue generated by a Tobin tax Does the Council believe that management of the revenue generated by a Tobin tax on international financial transactions (the value of which is estimated at between USD 50 billion and USD 250 billion per year, depending on the tax rate applied) should be entrusted to the UN, or should the setting up of a specific body responsible for levying and distributing the revenue which such a tax would yield be considered?"
"What should the priorities be for the allocation of such resources (e.g. access to drinking water, protection of the environment, cancelling the debt of the poorest countries, vaccination programmes, access to education)?"
"Question No 8 by (H-0720/00):"
"Subject: Tobin tax How does the Council intend to help future governments deal with the emerging crisis in national taxation because of tax competition and off-shore financial centres, and would it consider new streams of taxable revenue such as currency transactions?"
"Question No 9 by (H-0721/00):"
"Subject: Political and technical obstacles to the introduction of a Tobin-style tax The Council is well aware of the broad support and growing popularity enjoyed by the proposal for a Tobin-style tax."
"With reference to any discussions it may have held with the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs of the EU Member States and of third countries, will the Council Presidency say who is opposed to this measure and what the main political and technical obstacles are to the introduction of a tax of this kind?"
"Question No 10 by (H-0722/00):"
"Subject: Consideration of the merits of taxing international financial transactions Is the Council Presidency willing to open a discussion within the Council of Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) on the merits of imposing a tax on international financial transactions within the exchange market in order to combat speculation and the destabilising effects which the latter has on the economies of entire countries?"
"Would the Council be willing to consider establishing a 'Tobin area' at European Union level, i.e. imposing a Tobin tax on Europe' s financial markets, which account for 50% of world currency-exchange transactions?"
"Question No 11 by (H-0725/00):"
"Subject: Viability of Tobin-type taxes at European level In view of the recent report issued by the French Minister of Finance indicating that Tobin-type taxes would not be viable if introduced by a single Member State, what steps does the French Presidency propose with a view to securing the viability of such taxes at European Union and global level?"
"Question No 12 by (H-0735/00):"
"Subject: Tax on financial transactions In recent months there have been growing calls for a tax on financial speculation, with ATTAC committees (association for a tax on financial transactions and aid for citizens) springing up in France and Europe, as well as the amendments tabled in the French National Assembly and Senate."
"This movement raises fundamental questions, such as the respective roles of man and the world of finance in today' s economy."
"Does the Council not think that a Tobin-style tax would be desirable in the interests of restoring balance in this area?"
"Question No 13 by (H-0815/00):"
"Subject: Tobin tax and the international financial architecture In the Presidency' s view, which European institution would be most appropriate, in the context of international economic and financial relations, to promote the introduction of a Tobin tax and, should the circumstances arise, to administer such a tax?"
"What impact would the introduction of a Tobin tax have in terms of combating worldwide currency speculation?"
"No, I shall try not to give you too academic an answer, but you put me in a difficult position in asking me these questions because we could easily spend more than one evening answering, and in any case we shall no doubt be overrunning the allotted hour with the questions that are coming up."
"This matter raises questions of the objectives to be pursued, and questions of philosophy, of convictions and of analysis."
"Indeed everyone applies their own convictions and their own analysis in expressing their views on this subject."
"I should just like to say, once again, speaking on behalf of the Council, that the Council is perfectly aware of topical events and the importance of these issues."
"The creation of a Tobin tax is an attractive option, one championed by many Members on both the left and right wing, by a variety of political and non-political organisations, non-governmental organisations, university groups."
"I shall therefore beware of giving a definitive answer to this difficult question."
"I should just like to stress some of the practical problems which may give rise to debate, since this is the Council' s position."
"Firstly, I think everyone recognises that this tax, known as Tobin tax could operate properly only if applied at world level."
"It must be noted, however, that while it may be possible to seek a consensus within the European Union, no such consensus exists within G7, especially within the OECD, regarding levying a tax on exchange transactions."
"We are even aware, and this is an economic line of reasoning, that if there were a broad consensus, then a limited number of financial places would have a real interest in adopting an uncooperative attitude and refusing to apply the tax on transactions within their territory."
"The question that I must ask those who advocate the Tobin tax, therefore, is exactly how we can offset that risk that would exist that speculative activities would shift location to tax havens, since this is a phenomenon which must be avoided if such a tax were to be adopted."
"I should also like to have answers to the question of what influence it would have on the volatility of the exchange markets, particularly what would be the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators expecting devaluation in the order of 20 to 50%."
"There would, besides, be a risk of this tax being bypassed due to the high level of innovative performance in the modern financial world."
"The real question I have, then, does not concern the objectives of the Tobin tax, i.e. regulation of the exchange markets, making these markets more ethical by using them to fund development, but rather on our ability to ensure that these mechanisms are effective."
"Once again, this does not indicate my opposition in principle to the idea, as I am not opposed to it, certainly on a personal basis."
"At the recent meetings in Prague, and at the meetings of the G7 and the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), in its capacity as Presidency of the European Union, France proposed focuses for reform intended to provide a response to the concerns behind the, now old, proposal of establishing a Tobin-type tax."
"The communiqués of the G7, the IMFC and the statements of the IMF Director-General, Mr Köhler, moreover reflect the sympathies that exist in relation to the policy guidelines promoted by France, particularly as regards ordered financial liberalisation and combating money laundering."
"This fight, which is one of the priorities of the French Presidency, was expressed at both the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council, and recently in a combined meeting of these two Councils."
"I am aware that I am unable to respond fully right now to the question asked."
"I suppose you expect the Council to simply say yes."
"I think the question is a little bit too complex to give a simple yes or no answer, because while we may approve of the principles, there is still the outstanding matter of the practical arrangements, not to mention the existence of a consensus between the 15 Member States."
"Mr President, I do not refute your own personal convictions."
"It is just that we get the impression, and your answer testifies to this somewhat, that the Council Presidency is not being very proactive in dealing with this issue."
"You mentioned the uncooperative attitude of the tax havens."
"Do you not think, by analogy with what the European Union is proposing to do concerning the tax havens adjacent to it or within it and on which the Commission and also the Council have the means to exert pressure, particularly in order to put an end to money laundering, do you not think that the European Union should, within international fora, be at the forefront of a movement for a code of conduct seeking to eliminate or at least restrict the operations of tax havens at the international level?"
"I think this is within the realms of possibility and we should like to see the Presidency of the European Union adopting a clearer stance on this issue."
"I must act prudently, not in general but in using terms such as 'code of conduct' ."
"Just as much as in the case of the Tobin tax, the debate is ongoing. Just as much as in terms of combating money laundering and tax havens, the Presidency is displaying a great deal of resolve and the Ecofin Council in particular has adopted a draft directive to combat money laundering."
"This is therefore a key policy guideline which, without constituting an alternative to the project for the Tobin tax, is perhaps more realistic in the short term and is one which the current Presidency values extremely highly."
"Indeed we hope that this will prove to be one of the main practical achievements of this Presidency."
"Mr President, just now you mentioned those opposed to the Tobin tax, particularly G7."
"Let me remind you that our allies include fervent supporters of this tax."
"In one of its resolutions, the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, held in Brussels from 9 to 12 October, referred explicitly in recital C and in paragraph 21 to the creation of a Tobin tax."
"In paragraph 26, moreover, it called for the establishment of an international arbitration organisation to cancel the debts of the countries of the South."
"Mr President, could the Council not consider ways to help cancel the debt of the countries of the South, given that the ACP countries are asking for a solution similar to the Tobin tax?"
"Would it not be possible to reinitiate discussions on this, given that we have committed ourselves, under the Cotonou agreements, to helping them to find ways to arrange the cancellation of their debt?"
"I think this is an interesting suggestion too, one that warrants looking into, but at the same time I think you have to understand the ambiguities we are liable to face."
"As James Tobin said himself, the greater the product of this tax, the more it will have missed its target, as this will indicate that short-term speculative amounts have not been eliminated."
"Mr Tobin is himself opposed to the principle of using this tax to fund development other than as a secondary objective, as a tax intended to restrict and even prohibit certain types of transaction cannot at the same time seek to provide ongoing funding of development schemes."
"This is the principle, with which economists are familiar, of focussing an instrument on a single objective."
"We do have to consider a number of questions calling for specific answers, particularly on the subject of funding development, and clearly efforts must focus on the improvement and the quality of state aid for development, the development of trade, strengthening international financial institutions, and the issue of debt must be considered in depth once again."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, there happens to be a section of the Finnish government' s programme which refers to sources of taxation such as these."
"I would now like to ask you whether you have discussed matters in your role as representative of the Council with the Finnish government, so that new sources of taxation may be found and support be gained for this idea, which I understood you looked favourably upon, and whether the Council could summon together those still scattered powers that would enable new sources of taxation to be proposed."
"You mentioned the question of tax havens and money laundering in connection with this."
"Could you compile a new package of reforms from this on behalf of the Council?"
"Not having had the privilege of chairing the Ecofin Council I cannot answer your questions, particularly on the links which may exist between the French Presidency and the Finnish Government."
"I am sorry."
"I am not entirely convinced by all your answers. In the first place I take exception to the argument that any tax tends naturally to reduce the consumption of the factor on which it is levied."
"It is true for all taxes and today there is no tax where the taxable activity has completely ceased."
"People have not stopped working just because there is income tax. They have not stopped polluting just because there are taxes on pollution, and they are not about to stop transferring money from one country to another just because there is a Tobin tax."
"So, clearly, the revenue from this levy will not be zero."
"It will all depend on its level, but there are a number of possible strategies and I agree completely with you that the objective of funding is secondary to the objective of combating speculation."
"The thing that astounds me is your claim that a minor amount cannot have a deterrent effect on speculation."
"The minor amount you mention is precisely in the same order as the daily variations in the euro/dollar exchange rate, and this is something we are attempting to combat by other, infinitely more costly methods."
"I should just like to repeat what I was saying, which is that the influence of a tax of this kind on the volatility of the exchange market has not actually been proven."
"I think that, in spite of everything, fluctuations in the euro/dollar exchange rate are, unfortunately, higher than this sort of value, and it is true that we have to deal, in the long term, with speculators who expect far greater devaluation."
"Indeed this is what has happened in the case of the euro over the year, whether we like it or not."
"Mr Lipietz, for instance, is too fine an economist not to realise that economics is just another form of political science."
"I am not really convinced by your answer for the simple reason that you yourself are aware of the counter-arguments which you have mentioned and yet, on 18 July, in the French daily newspaper, Libération, you put your signature to an opinion column, along with seven other Ministers of the French Government saying, ""We must at European and international level find the means to implement a tax on financial transactions as soon as possible."""
"So what has happened since then?"
"Was it the report by the Minister for the Economy and for Finance, the administration of the Treasury, which so effectively expressed the usual arguments of those opposed to the Tobin tax which thwarted the political will demonstrated in the stance adopted in your newspaper article?"
"Who is going to win the day, Bercy - as we refer to the Minister of the Economy in France - or the determination you expressed back then?"
"Surely the time has come to stop passing the buck?"
"At national level, we are told to refer to Europe. Now, at European level, we are told to refer to the G7 or the OECD."
"Surely the time has come, specifically, to submit a proposal to the Council and the Commission so that we can issue a coordinated position from the various countries of Europe which will support the position of the other G7 members, such as Canada, for instance, which is ready to implement a Tobin tax as long as we ourselves are moving in this direction?"
"Please forgive me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking shop with our internal French business here."
"You have before you not Pierre Moscovici the militant or even Pierre Moscovici, speaking in his capacity as Minister, although I have attempted to introduce a few personal remarks in relation to the position prepared for me."
"I am supposed to be speaking on behalf of the Council, the Council being the body uniting the ministers of the 15 European Union Member States."
"I have indeed, therefore, attempted to include a few comments in my capacity as Minister where these do not contradict what I might have written as a militant politician in a French daily newspaper, but you must understand that I must also play my official part here today."
"I am, moreover, delighted that Mr Harlem Désir, who, if you did not already know, is in the same party as myself, would be willing to sign the same declaration as myself."
"That is not always the case."
"Mr Moscovici, you can see that the eight questions come from the left of the Chamber."
"Therefore, they sometimes cannot distinguish the President-in-Office of the Council from a militant."
"I also excuse them, but we shall apply the Rules of Procedure."
"I have three brief questions for Mr Moscovici."
"Firstly, will he come and speak to us as a militant on a future occasion?"
"Secondly, is he aware that the recent Labour Party Conference passed a document which overwhelmingly said that they would work with its international partners and all stake-holders towards addressing the concerns raised by advocates of the Tobin Tax and introducing new mechanisms for international stability and better global financial regulation?"
"And thirdly, as he says he can neither say yes nor no at the moment, is he willing to argue for the European Union to conduct a study of these matters so that in future we will be able to say yes or no, and be able to make some sensible contribution to the UN Financing for Development Conference that is coming up at the beginning of 2002?"
"There are any number of places where I am willing to express a militant opinion."
"It is no secret that I am a member of a left-wing government, a left-wing coalition, and I belong to a political party, the Socialist Party, and as such, it is true - forgive me, Mr President - I frequently have the opportunity to meet my friends on the left wing in this House. I have noted that these people are ones most ready and, for the moment, the only ones to discuss the Tobin tax."
"In many respects I feel sympathetic to their ideas, but the fact is that in this place, now and every time I address you, I have to represent the Council during Question Time."
"So perhaps we should arrange some other type of meeting."
"As regards the question you addressed to the Council, i.e. the idea of study, please be assured that I shall convey your idea, most sympathetically, to the chairman of the Ecofin council, who incidentally is also a Government Minister, and perhaps this will also answer Mr Harlem Désir' s concerns."
"I shall, of course, continue in the same vein, especially as I feel we must consider that this debate bears witness to the fact that increasing numbers of people, particularly within the European Union, are wondering about applying stricter control to financial speculation and also about the ability of the political authorities to intervene in this economic sphere and the extravagant powers of the multinationals."
"Further to the comment which Danielle Auroi made just now on the subject of the countries of the South, I would add that there are some expert estimates which provide some interesting figures, for instance, a range between USD 50 and 250 billion, which could be recovered by a Tobin-type tax, whereas, at the same time, the UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] amounts to USD 40 billion per annum, which would be sufficient to guarantee minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of deprived people in the countries of the third world."
"So, at a time when people feel that politics does not have the ability to intervene in the economic sphere, and also more generally in the role of European construction in order to alter its conduct of international relations, do you not think that a measure of this kind could contribute to restoring confidence in the political world' s power to act and, hence, could it not serve as a message sent out to the countries and the peoples of the South?"
"Once again, I am anxious to curtail the philosophical, ideological and political elements of my answer."
"I should just like to repeat, once again, the fact that in discussing the Tobin tax, we must also question the conditions for the effectiveness of such a tax."
"I myself pointed out the reservations which Tobin himself expressed, in the final analysis, regarding his own instrument, particularly in terms of revenue."
"Indeed I think it crucial to organise, at some venue or other, debates where the arguments for both sides can be presented."
"I know that there are many people on both sides, both in favour of and against the Tobin tax."
"I think we should perhaps attempt to get outside the too narrow area of preferences in order to also ask economic questions."
"The basic question I would like an answer to, and I am speaking as an all-round figure which includes my militant persona, is what are the conditions necessary for it to work."
"Mr President-in Office, you said at the start of your speech that this matter could be discussed endlessly here in Parliament."
"You are quite right and I would also like to remind you that we have already once discussed this subject in great detail, and these very same colleagues of mine asked the same questions before."
"The reason why we have been quiet here on the right is therefore that we have already examined these matters once and, in our opinion, we do not need to talk about the same issues over and over again in this Chamber and use up our precious time doing so."
"I would like to ask you, however, if I have interpreted things correctly in my understanding that France, in her role as President of the Council, has no intention of proposing new measures to adopt the Tobin tax, or do I take it that in this it is not so much a question of political will but simply that you also there on the left side of the House have come to the conclusion that it is impossible?"
"The adoption of the Tobin tax on a global scale will be impossible."
"Forgive me, I did not quite understand the last part of the question."
"I take note of the fact that, fortunately, moreover, there are proponents of the Tobin tax on all sides of the house. This sets my mind at rest somewhat."
"I should not like people to think that it is a peculiar form of madness affecting only one side of the brain or indeed one side of the House."
"As for the rest, I should just like to add that France has indeed looked into a number of areas of reform with a view to answering the concerns behind the proposal to establish a Tobin-type tax, even if questions of how it is actually going to work remain unanswered."
"I do agree with you, however, we could be discussing this for a long time to come."
"As the author is not present, Question No 14 lapses."
"Question No 15 by (H-0729/00):"
"Subject: Spread of BSE It appears that BSE is more contagious than was generally thought and that several other animal species can carry the disease."
"In recent months the disease has been detected, inter alia, in various areas of France."
"How does the Council intend to prepare for the spread of BSE, and what principle does it think should be adopted for compensating livestock owners in its decisions on budget expenditure?"
"The number of cases of BSE, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, that have been identified in Europe over the last few years is, as we know, a major area of concern."
"The Council is more than ever anxious to take every step possible in order to eradicate this disease."
"I should like to specify briefly that the recent increase in the number of cases identified does not mean that the epidemic is spreading wildly."
"It is, rather, the case that things are coming to light as a result of the increasingly widespread performance of tests on cattle carcasses which proves that the epidemic has, nonetheless, not ceased."
"On 7 January 1999, the Commission put forward a proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation seeking to consolidate the texts previously adopted by the Commission as precautionary measures in order to establish rules for the prevention and supervision of certain forms of BSE."
"This proposal is based on the recommendation of the International Office of Epizootics on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and the various scientific opinions available."
"This was designed to offer consumers a guarantee of a very high level of protection."
"The European Parliament delivered its opinion on the Commission proposal at first reading, during the sittings of 15 and 19 May 2000."
"It adopted 48 amendments, 40 of which were accepted by the Commission."
"The Council is actively involved in examining the Commission proposal and these amendments with a view to managing in the near future to issue a position on this."
"Moreover, in anticipation of adopting this directive on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a decision on the prohibition of the use of material presenting risks as regards these diseases was taken in June 2000, in order to stop any further spreading of the epidemic and in order to guarantee the highest possible health protection standards for the consumer."
"The decision therefore applies to the production and commercialisation of products derived from animals that are made from or contain materials from animals of bovine, ovine or caprine species."
"The specified risk materials for compulsory removal and destruction from now on are the following: ""the skull including the brains and eyes, the tonsils, the spinal cord and the ileum of bovine animals aged over 12 months"" ; ""the skull including the brains and eyes, the tonsils and the spinal cord of ovine and caprine animals aged over 12 months ... and the spleen of ovine and caprine animals of all ages."""
"There are additional restrictions which apply to the United Kingdom and Portugal."
"The Council, of course, is careful to monitor development in scientific findings and in the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests."
"These can then be taken into account in the text of directives on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies which the Council is to submit to the European Parliament."
"The Council has not received any Commission proposal on compensation for farmers."
"For the time being, as you know, applications are to be made to national budgets in procedures for the compensation of livestock farmers."
"Mr President, I thank the minister for his reply to the first part of my question, but his answer to the second part, which concerned compensation, was not entirely relevant."
"New cases have cropped up in France and, as a result, whole herds have been slaughtered."
"Now I would like to ask, while the French representative of the country holding the presidency is here, whether this slaughter of cows will be paid for out of the EU budget or will you be paying for them out of your national budget, and whether, in your opinion, it is indeed appropriate that they should be paid for out of the EU budget."
"And I should like to add another question. According to a press report today mad cow disease has been discovered here in the Vosges region."
"Can France give the Members of the European Parliament assurances that nobody will catch the disease from the meat they eat here?"
"I have not read this morning' s papers yet, but I believe I can make a sincere case to promote French beef in general."
"I am just answering back after your sally."
"On a more serious note, as regards the idea of the possible compensation of farmers, I can only repeat the information available to me, which is to say that the Council has, for the time being, received no proposals from the Commission on this subject."
"To put it quite plainly this means that no Community funding is planned at this stage."
"Thus, for the time being, any procedures for compensation for farmers must be addressed to the national budgets."
"My question follows on from the last point Mr Seppänen made."
"This matter has been reported on recently in the UK and indeed a British Government adviser said that she would not recommend that her children eat French beef because, she alleged, in France older cows are still making their way into the food chain, parts from the nervous system are still being used in products such as sausages in France and there is still contamination of animal feed."
"There is also statistical evidence that there is an increase of BSE in France and Portugal."
"Will the Council ask the Commission to ensure that all necessary public health measures are being enforced in all 15 Member States, to ensure this disease is finally eradicated from the European Union?"
"I should not like to get into this very acrimonious debate or to get involved in bilateral French-British considerations."
"I think this is not the right place and I am not the right person to discuss such matters."
"I would just like to assure Mr Martin that the Council, which I am representing here, does indeed wish to ensure that measures are undertaken in all the countries of the European Union."
"This is something other than a bilateral dispute. Moreover, that dispute - to put on my French hat for a moment - is one that we regret and we would have preferred not to have had to initiate it, even though we thought it necessary for consumer safety."
"In the press recently we have been able to read that a number of European Union documents mentioned an 'accidental share of 0.3% of animal meal' , whether this was acceptable or not."
"I should like to know, specifically, since this question has arisen, if this accidental 0.3% share is becoming an authorised 0.3% share for animal meal. If this were so, it would truly be an underhand way of subverting the precautionary principle which we are attempting to implement here."
"Mrs Isler Béguin will pardon me if I do not wish to go into great detail in response to a debate on BSE which has a justifiable place in this House after entering into a debate on the Tobin tax."
"I do not have any information other than that I have already given you."
"I shall refrain from commenting on press articles concerning Community documents with which I am not familiar at the present time."
"As usual, however, I can assure you that we shall give you a specific answer if you put a specific question to us."
"Mr President, on a point of order would it be possible to reinstate Question No 2?"
"I was at a foreign affairs meeting when this question came up."
"Unfortunately I had no prior notice that it was coming up because I have been in Sri Lanka for the last month heading an EU mission to observe the elections."
"I beg your indulgence to hear the answer please."
"I must tell you, Mr Cushnahan, that the document is distributed to all Members in their pigeonholes and that the secretariat of each political Group receives them on Mondays."
"There is a rule: when you are not in the room at the appropriate time, the agenda continues."
"The final question, therefore, is by Mrs Isler Béguin."
"Question No 16 by (H-0731/00):"
"Subject: Ban on oil tankers in the Strait of Bonifacio The Strait of Bonifacio is an extremely dangerous passage for shipping."
"And yet more than 4 000 vessels sail through it each year."
"The Corsican and Sardinian coastlines on either side are of exceptional ecological and historical value, as acknowledged by the 1993 Franco-Italian agreement, which prohibits French and Italian merchant ships carrying hazardous products from travelling through the strait."
"Far too much use is made of this passage by international shipping, in the hope of gaining no more than four hours, with all the risks it entails for vessels, many of which are in poor condition."
"How many potential Erikas sail through it each year?"
"When can we expect the next disaster?"
"Will the Council undertake to extend the existing ban to all vessels, whatever country they come from, and to introduce binding measures to protect the marine environment?"
"As it stands, Community legislation on the maritime transportation of dangerous or polluting goods concerns the minimum conditions required for vessels bound for, or leaving, Community ports."
"These vessels are therefore bound to provide the Member State authorities with information on their itinerary and their cargo."
"Furthermore, the directive on inspection by the port state requires Member Sates to inspect foreign vessels entering their ports in order to check that they are compliant with Community and international legislation on maritime safety, protection of the marine environment and working and living conditions."
"Regarding international traffic in transit, international law stipulates, subject to certain reservations, that the vessels of all states have the 'right of innocent passage' in territorial waters."
"The coastal states, however, while respecting this 'right of innocent passage' , are authorised to set a number of requirements in order to ensure the safety of shipping and protection of the environment."
"In this context, the Commission has announced that it would present a proposal for improvement of the supervision of maritime navigation off European coasts."
"Already, following proposals by France and Italy, the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, has adopted two resolutions, which have been in force since 1 December 1998, on establishing rules for shipping traffic in the Strait of Bonifacio and making it compulsory for vessels entering the strait to identify themselves."
"It should also be pointed out that, following the wreck of the Erika oil tanker, the European Union has taken the initiative of encouraging, within the IMO, studies about replacing single hulled oil tankers with double hulled oil tankers."
"The Council also recently issued favourable guidelines on the draft directives amending the 1995 directive on the inspection of vessels by the state port, and the draft on vessel inspection bodies."
"These two drafts, which are currently being examined by Parliament under the codecision procedure, are further aspects contributing to reducing the risk of pollution."
"I should, moreover, like to point out, as Commissioner Barnier did this morning, that these maritime safety issues, on the basis of a Commission communication, were dealt with in a totally positive fashion at the informal European Council in Biarritz, after the French Prime Minister simply asked the Commission to bring forward, if at all possible, the cut-off date for authorisation of single hulled vessels from 2015 to 2010, which seems quite a reasonable request, in any case, and a perfectly realistic ambition."
"Thank you for your answer, Mr President, but the question went rather further."
"We monitor, and we are familiar with, the work done by the Commission and the Council on the Erika 1 package, but regarding this strait, which is notorious in the two countries concerned and within the European Union as a particularly tricky passage, one often used by large vessels in order to gain just a few hours at the risk of some old tub' s running aground and causing a disaster, I should like to know, and more especially the inhabitants of Corsica and Sardinia would like to know, if it will be at all possible, and if you have any such plans, to issue a ban, pure and simple, on large vessels, containers, using the Strait of Bonifacio."
"In my answer I mentioned the sensitivity to this issue in France and Italy which led the two countries to propose that the International Maritime Organisation adopt two resolutions on establishing routes for shipping traffic in the Strait of Bonifacio and requiring vessels entering the strait to identify themselves, which we know goes beyond the terms of civil law. These resolutions were adopted and came into force on 1 December 1998."
"I should moreover like to point out, however, that there are other constraints upon us."
"Regarding international traffic in transit, international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, stipulates, subject to certain reservations, that the vessels of all states have the 'right of innocent passage' in territorial waters."
"However, the coastal state may - in accordance with the terms of the Convention and other rules of international law - adopt legislation and regulations on innocent passage in territorial waters that may have a bearing on the following aspects: shipping safety, regulation of shipping traffic, conservation of the coastal state environment, the prevention, reduction and control of pollution."
"This is what we wanted to do in this context."
"However, and this is a complete response to your question, any ban on all ships passing through the Strait of Bonifacio would have to be agreed at the international level and be subject to an international convention."
"Any action by the two governments concerned is therefore limited by this international law."
"Mr President, I have just one additional question."
"What constitutes 'innocent passage' by a passenger boat through a strait like this?"
"Excellent question."
"Thank you for asking."
"As the time allotted to Questions to the Council has run out, Question Nos 17 to 46 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"2001 budget procedure (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the 2001 budget procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur."
"Along with other speakers, I have the impression that this year' s budget is particularly complex."
"Some sections of the budget are difficult to implement."
"I therefore believe that, in principle, we ought to support the Commission proposals for revising their staffing policy."
"I, however, will vote in favour of the so-called performance reserve, for I believe that it is necessary that, at this stage, we obtain some more information, and in my view, that information should detail the conditions of early retirement and the consequences for staffing levels if some time in 2004, or maybe earlier in 2003, we will be recruiting officials from Central and Eastern European countries."
"Finally, I also endorse the observation made in the Haug resolution that we need to pay bills on time as soon as possible, because the Commission will not come out smelling of roses if this situation continues for much longer."
"I would also like to say a few things about agriculture."
"In my opinion, the Commission has put up a poor show and the Council has compounded the situation by beating the Commission down on its agricultural expenditure schedule right at the start of this year in the Council meeting of July of this year."
"We agreed on an ad-hoc procedure a few years ago which stipulated that we would determine agricultural expenditure more or less at the end of October in the lettre rectificative and yes, that is the long and short of it. It escapes me how the Commission can give this estimate as early as February and the Council in July."
"It amounts to no more than a stab in the dark and I believe that, if we agree on a set amount and if there is an added amount in Berlin, we should also try to fulfil that agreement."
"The main point of discussion is category 4."
"How can we finance emergency aid for the Balkans?"
"I am in favour of it. I believe we ought to do something in Serbia and the western Balkans as a matter of urgency."
"The key question is, of course, how to finance this?"
"I am not a fan of artificially increasing certain budget lines so that we subsequently have to say that we need to exceed the financial perspective."
"I would prefer us to first of all try to find the funds within the financial perspective."
"If necessary, we could always look further afield, but at this stage, I have no reason to assume this."
"I would like to say a few words about the budget implementation. I wanted to make two points, in particular."
"I have just received a letter today from the Commissioner on the implementation of the SOS helpline, which, sadly, is desperately needed in Europe."
"The Commission does not label this as information policy, but social policy."
"Seen in this light, it does not belong in a line as voted by Parliament."
"I would question that, for I think that it is just as much information policy as it is social policy, and I therefore hope to return to this topic within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development shortly."
"The second point I wanted to make concerns quality policy for agricultural products, for which Parliament earmarked 50 million of the budget last year."
"This has never been more topical."
"The Commission made very little effort to implement this policy, which is deplorable."
"Mr President, the European Union' s budget for next year has been prepared in difficult circumstances."
"That is the fault of the Council."
"The problems are the same as last year."
"The previous European Parliament made this Interinstitutional Agreement, which was binding on this Parliament, a couple of months prior to the commencement of this parliamentary term, and it specified too low a ceiling for category 4 expenditure."
"Then it was not known that the Council and the Commission would be promising aid for the reconstruction of Serbia and Kosovo, to come out of this money."
"The political commitments made to the forces of opposition in the area of the former Yugoslavia must now be redeemed."
"In this particular case that means revising the ceiling for category 4."
"If the Council does not agree to that, Parliament will have to terminate the Interinstitutional Agreement on so-called budgetary discipline."
"New money is needed in the budget for Serbia and Kosovo."
"It is not right that the assistance to the poor in the area of Yugoslavia should be paid for by the poor in the area of the Mediterranean, Russia or other poor countries, although the Council would have it that that is precisely how we should go about matters."
"I would like to focus attention on the fact that there seem to be sufficient amounts of European Union money for financing political parties at European level, but not, for example, for the prevention of unemployment."
"I am astonished at the proposal that Europarty support should be paid for out of the Commission' s article in category 3."
"That would mean that the Europarties would be getting support twice over."
"If they have not hesitated before to misappropriate the European Parliament' s resources to finance their own work, we can only imagine that they are continuing to do so, although they might be receiving subsidies from the Commission."
"Or does someone believe that the Europarties are being made to pay rent to Parliament or pay for their own communications costs here?"
"Our group takes a mainly dim view of Europarty support and its abuse in the future."
"Mr President, this year' s budget is, in my opinion, neither very negative nor very positive."
"Why is this?"
"Clearly, although, on the one hand, a constructive relationship has been maintained with the Commission, thanks to Commissioner Schreyer and to Mr Wynn who chaired the Committee with the patience of a saint, on the other hand, the Council tried to monopolise our budget completely. It may have arrived at the same result but, in political terms, it certainly did not acknowledge the results achieved by our Committee on Budgets."
"Going so far as to hold back on the decision on the operations in Kosovo and Serbia at a time of such pressing urgency while advancing mere formal issues is certainly not a good image for the Community to be presenting to the rest of the world in political terms."
"I would nevertheless emphasise, in particular, that, six months ago, one of the political priorities was stressed in this Chamber."
"I quote the exact words of Parliament' s resolution: 'The European Parliament requests the Commission to pay special attention to structural problems of an economic or social character caused by natural disasters and to look favourably on measures to help solve these problems;"
"Well, none of this has been achieved."
"Quite the contrary. At a time in which, with the approach of enlargement and the euro crisis, we need to reinforce the bridges created over the last 50 years between the peoples of the European Union and the Union itself, a Community intervention to assist the peoples who are victims of natural disasters is, at the very least, politically appropriate, and is morally urgent."
"The same Mr Casaca, who tabled an amendment similar to mine which has my full support, pointed out in a letter - which you have all received - that paradoxical situations have arisen in the past and are in danger of arising in the future, in which urgent operations to assist disaster-stricken areas within our Union are carried out by American marines rather than by Europe itself."
"This is just one of the potential situations."
"Another scenario is that the Member States are left to do entirely as they please."
"By acting in this way in the name of subsidiarity, the Union is, in actual fact, shirking one of its responsibilities, as it has in recent weeks both in northern Italy and in Spain."
"My observations are frequently criticised for lacking a legal basis."
"Well, I am going to give you a few references."
"How many entire families are at death' s door?"
"Is one of the Union' s objectives not to protect health and safety?"
"This is part of Title 13 of the Treaty."
"How many entire road and other transport networks are becoming unusable?"
"Is one of the Union' s objectives not to make them usable once more?"
"That is what Title 5 of the Treaty says."
"We could also cite Title 7 and Title 8 of the Treaty on industries and firms which are forced to close down."
"Are we not going to jeopardise the common economic and employment policy?"
"I refer you to Title 2 of the Treaty."
"As for harvests which are wiped out in the space of a few days, does this not come under one of the pillars of the Union?"
"So let us stop trying to hide behind a pointing finger and do something instead!"
"Where is the problem?"
"Does this House really feel that a Community intervention in this sector would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity?"
"I do not think so, and I feel that it is morally right to support the amendment upon which we are going to vote on Thursday."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our budget for 2001, with its EUR 92.5 billion in payment appropriations adds two new items to the traditional features."
"As far as new features are concerned, in the first place, it is the first time the budget has been presented in functional terms, classed by programme and not just according to administrative divisions, with 19 policies covering 200 activities, which is the system currently used in most countries."
"France is currently carrying out reforms to this end."
"The second new feature is the shift in the battleground the budget war is waged on."
"What we have had so far is a war over compulsory or non-compulsory expenditure or over the maximum rate of increase."
"Now the war between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the two budgetary authorities, is tending to shift towards the revision of the financial perspective, which has, in fact, been revised 38 times since the Delors package, and towards a battle over category 4, i.e. external action."
"As regards the traditional features, apart from the problems of ensuring that the projections are honest ones, we have, first of all, the problem of budgetary cuts for European farmers, with EUR 300 million of agricultural aid and EUR 225 million of appropriations for rural development cut."
"There is nothing for beekeepers, who were asking for a mere EUR 15 million, even though it is possible to increase expenditure for the Balkans by 30%."
"The second traditional feature is the way ideological allies are fêted."
"We have the whole kit and caboodle of subsidies for associations working with drugs, xenophobia, immigrants, the Jean Monnet House, the exile council, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, even the PRINCE campaign."
"EUR 38 million are being cast away on the campaign on the euro."
"Finally, the third traditional feature is the budgetary funds poured into foreign preferences."
"There are poor people in Europe too, even if only retired farm workers."
"It is shocking to see Mr Wurtz and Mr Fodé proposing amendments to give appropriations to Chile, Australia, South Africa."
"Charity begins everywhere except at home."
"We are even throwing EUR 250 000 away for the WTO 'world parliament' ."
"I hope, Mr President, and this is my concluding remark, that we are at least going to cut the EUR 50 million budget lines financing the Israel-PLO peace agreement."
"I hope that not one single euro will go to the Israeli army so that they can buy bullets to kill Palestinian youths on their own soil."
"Mr President, in the Haug report the sentiment is expressed that the Commission, in close cooperation with Parliament, is responsible for providing information to the European citizen about the policies of the European Union."
"But Parliament has another responsibility: it is to represent the concerns of the citizens of Member States to the European Union, something which appears to be discouraged here."
"It will be not unknown to some Members here that my party, the UKIP, seeks the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union."
"What Members will not be aware of, though, is that according to recent opinion polls, that is now the majority view of United Kingdom subjects."
"As an MEP who cares about that majority, how can I endorse the spending of GBP 11.5 billion of UK taxpayers' money - that is our current annual contribution - when it does not have broad public approval?"
"In the UK at least, the Commission is synonymous with fraud and waste."
"The Court of Auditors has refused to sign off the accounts for five years running, and OLAF has indicated that financial controls have not yet significantly improved, and that the Commission reforms are stalled."
"Therefore, what assurances are there that controls are now going to be in place to make sure that Member States taxpayers' money is well spent?"
"What assurance can the Commission give, when the Court of Auditors comes to look at the expenditure for 2001, that this budgetary allocation will have been spent wisely and correctly?"
"When other Members are also expressing their concerns about the way monies are to be spent - for example the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has just decided unanimously to lodge a motion to reject this budget - can anyone at all give me a reason why I should change my mind and give my vote to this budget?"
"Mr President, the problem with the 2001 budgetary year is more one of quality than of quantity."
"We all know that there was no category relating to external action in the financial perspective adopted in Berlin."
"The military action against Serbia, aid for reconstruction, the foreseeable fall of Milosevic."
"A lot of need and little money."
"However, the financial perspective was a success because it was, at the time, the only possible agreement between 15 Member States."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement that resulted from the Summit was good news for the powers of this Parliament."
"External needs reveal the shortages in category 4."
"However, what emerges most clearly now is the huge problem of the under-utilisation of all categories of spending: in rural development, in the Structural Funds, in the major external aid programmes."
"What is happening in the European Union budget?"
"With what was not implemented in previous years we could fund another year without fresh resources."
"In any national, regional or local administration, such under-utilisation would put the heads of some of those responsible on the block."
"In the European Union, we do not even know who is responsible."
"Therefore, in the European Parliament, we will propose new measures, not so much aimed at seeking new funding - which we already know cannot be implemented under current conditions - but at establishing new institutional commitments that will improve the quality of spending and ensure that not a single euro is wasted."
"And you, Commissioner, will have to revise the commitology agreement, even if it seems impossible."
"The efforts of the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, to incorporate the suggestions of our Group on that subject deserve a great deal of gratitude."
"We should recognise that she is being a very reasonable rapporteur and that she is seeking consensus."
"In the medium term we will see the importance of the decisions that Parliament is beginning to take today."
"It is true that, if the Council took an intransigent position, it would make things difficult in such important areas as the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for MEDA, the management committees, increases in payments in order to absorb the remainder that needs to be paid or the extension of the N + 2 planning procedure to external actions."
"If the Council took a flexible position, we could reach an agreement at second reading in order to close the budget."
"Let us remember that the European Parliament has accepted a very low category 4, it has accepted a revision of the financial perspective being a possibility rather than a political priority, it has accepted a considerable cut in the European Union' s external aid. In short, it has agreed to play on a field that extends the Council' s budgetary prerogatives to the detriment of our own."
"But they cannot be extended ad infinitum."
"Today we are also debating the Colom i Naval report on the Interinstitutional Agreement, in which the Commission undertakes to present Parliament with all the necessary information for initiatives that have financial implications."
"Now, in 2000, after more than 15 years of parliamentary history, is when this initiative comes to Parliament."
"Well we hope that there will be a similar undertaking from the Council."
"The European Parliament is the other branch of the budgetary authority and, despite this, it is the press that often informs us of the Union' s new financial commitments made in the European Councils."
"Then, when the commitment has already been announced and made, they just have to ask the Commission and its Commissioners to make a gap in the budget and Parliament to accept it."
"This cannot continue either, it is not good for anyone, not for the Member States, not for the institutions, not for the European Union."
"What credibility can a European Union that operates in this manner have?"
"How can our policy have credibility?"
"Members of the Council, wherever you are, I consider myself to be a very moderate Member, who always defends the path of interinstitutional cooperation, both with regard to the budget and to any other matter."
"We are now at first reading and you have enough time to seek full agreement with Parliament."
"Consider the fact that, in European policy, as in any other field, sometimes the moderate options cease to be the majority options."
"My congratulations to all the rapporteurs and also to Mr Ferber, the rapporteur for the other institutions with which we are most concerned. There are three major issues which we should be concerned about in relation to the budget for other institutions."
"Firstly, how far does this budget improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the institutions?"
"Secondly, how far does it increase transparency and accountability to the European citizen?"
"Thirdly, how far does it plan and prepare for the future of the enlarged Union?"
"On the first point, I believe that this budget continues to apply the principles of budgetary rigour, budgetary prudence, improving efficiency, more effective budget control, better use of resources and a general tightening up, which are all vital to increase the confidence of the EU citizen in the institutions."
"There are obviously in this budget exceptions for the Court of Justice, which are clearly justified."
"Here the circumstances are exceptional, with an increased number of court cases and a huge backlog of translation, but in all the other institutions, rigour is applied."
"Having said that, the principle of budgetary rigour can be developed further in every area."
"In the case of Parliament, how can we talk about budgetary rigour and still base ourselves in three different cities, in three different Member States?"
"We need to be seen to be practising what we are preaching."
"Without wishing to give offence to our host city here in Strasbourg, our monthly part-sessions in this city are a manifest waste of time, money and Parliament' s ability to be effective and efficient."
"This equally applies to the separation of Parliament' s administration between Luxembourg and Brussels."
"If anyone needs convincing, just look at the evidence."
"This resolution clearly shows that discontinuing the Friday morning Strasbourg sittings will lead to savings of some EUR 1 million."
"Just imagine the savings that could be made if Strasbourg part-sessions were stopped altogether and Parliament was based solely in Brussels!"
"But it is not just the Treaties that need to be reformed."
"The parliamentarians need to put their own house in order, especially in relation to the daily allowance paid to MEPs during constituency weeks."
"I believe strict guidelines are necessary."
"My group believes that Parliament' s Bureau needs to review its decision and also to draw up a full list, with clear criteria, for those exceptional cases where Members can draw a daily allowance for their presence in Brussels during constituency weeks."
"Furthermore, we parliamentarians also need to address the issue of the statute for assistants."
"This is long overdue and now urgently needed."
"Too many people in this House have been prevaricating on this question for far too long."
"If Parliament is ever to establish a reputation for transparency, a statute for our own assistants is indispensable."
"All the institutions need to embrace reform whole-heartedly."
"What we need is action and not just empty words in this area."
"This is not just true of the issue of Parliament' s seat; reform of the European institutions needs to be brought about as quickly as possible."
"The Commission is starting to get its own house in order and it is crucial that the other institutions are seen to follow suit. In particular, the other institutions should follow the Commission as quickly as possible in implementing activity-based budgeting."
"We can only be transparent and accountable if all the decision-makers are clear about the budget and what lies behind the budget."
"One of my greatest frustrations over the last year is that it is so difficult to get behind the bureaucratic presentation of budget lines."
"The system is anything but transparent."
"It is designed to obscure rather than enlighten and I have been disappointed by the attitude adopted today with respect to activity-based budgeting."
"But of course it is not enough to encourage reform in each institution separately."
"Real savings can only be made if the institutions work together."
"I fully support the emphasis in this resolution on improving interinstitutional cooperation, like the proposal for an interinstitutional recruitment office, which will provide real gains in efficiency and cost-effectiveness."
"There needs to be greater vigour and determination for the Parliament, Council and Commission to cooperate as closely as possible on issues such as translation, interpretation, libraries and buildings."
"Nowhere is it more important than for us to demonstrate value for money in the buildings policy."
"This is one area that has come under considerable spotlight both from the media and from the general public."
"We really need to develop a strategy to ensure there are no cost over-runs in the future and that they are suitable for the main users, including full accessibility for people with disabilities."
"This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom i Naval, the Vice-President for buildings."
"What we need to do now is turn this into a comprehensive blueprint design brief, so that we do not have any future problems."
"Finally, what I find disappointing about this report is that it does not focus strongly on the need to plan and prepare for the future, especially in relation to the enlarged Union."
"I think we will regret that we have not made even greater preparation for enlargement in this budget."
"To conclude, whilst we are making significant inroads with this report on the first issues I highlighted - efficiency and effectiveness - on the second and third - transparency and accountability and planning for the future - we could have been even more ambitious."
"Mr President, in submitting the Budget for the coming year, the Commission has this time chosen a new method of presenting the figures."
"Instead of simply showing expenses distributed among accounts, the new-format Budget shows more clearly what we are getting for our money."
"We have the expenses distributed among policy areas and according to activities."
"It is a good innovation whose aim is more than purely educational."
"The educational aspect lies in the fact that we shall all be better able to see what we are getting for our money."
"As elected representatives, we are of course delighted with any move to make the Budget more easily understandable."
"When, however, expenses are allocated according to activity, this also paves the way for the Budget' s being seen more in terms of a political tool, in which the distribution of expenditure reflects clear political priorities."
"This spring, Commissioner Chris Patten illustrated this by asking why the EU was appropriating more money to cleaning up after Hurricane Mitch in Latin America than it had appropriated to developing the Russian economy."
"That is the sort of question we must ask ourselves when we study the Budget, for it is of course questions of this kind that our voters will quite rightly be asking."
"With the new format, it has therefore become easier to understand and take in the whole picture, but the new activity-based budgeting must also mirror the reform process whereby the Commission establishes a simplified form of administration involving delegation and a clearer allocation of responsibility, and this is of course something more difficult to achieve."
"There are major organisational changes under way, and there is a need for a new culture involving both a genuine desire to accept responsibility for implementing the individual parts of the Budget and acceptance of the fact that there are consequences if the responsibility is not fulfilled."
"I wish the Commission every possible success in these endeavours."
"As Commissioner Schreyer has already mentioned, there are many political announcements coming out of this year' s Budget: the reorganisation of agricultural policy, new structural programmes, measures to ensure better implementation of the structural policy, and steps designed to follow up the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit for creating a stronger and more competitive EU and for combating social exclusion."
"These are important topics, but the topic which deserves most attention of all is, of course, foreign policy."
"There is a great need for EU aid in both the applicant countries in the Third World and in the Balkans."
"In the middle of the Budget procedure, the happy day arrived and Milosevic had to step aside, and the many promises of economic aid to Serbia must now be fulfilled."
"All of us - the Council, Parliament and the Commission - agree that we must be thrifty, and we have all kept dutifully below the established ceiling for expenditure."
"So the discussion about how we are to obtain the money for Serbia does not have to do with any unwillingness to remain within a financial framework."
"I do not think our electorate will appreciate technical justifications in terms of the Budget for the fact that we cannot in harmony find the money for Serbia and the Balkans without reducing our efforts in other countries."
"There is no popular demand to the effect that there must be no revision of the financial perspective."
"There is, however, a popular demand that we solve the problem of how best to provide aid to Serbia."
"So let us therefore find a solution which will last for several years so that, next year and the year after that too, we do not have to go through this discussion as to how we are to find money for reconstruction in the Balkans."
"Mr President, may I first of all express my admiration for the rapporteur."
"It is astonishing how, in the course of the many sittings we have had, you have juggled the various aspects of this difficult material."
"I feel quite dizzy sometimes, and I have to make sure I am keeping up. I should really like, however, to set another priority."
"I recall that during the last legislative period - when, if I remember rightly, you were a budgetary expert in the Berlin regional parliament, Commissioner Schreyer - we discussed whether we could manage with the 1.27 limit, given the problems and tasks facing us."
"Enlargement was the issue at stake."
"At that time, the efforts on behalf of Kosovo and Serbia were still not even in the pipeline."
"We discussed whether we should call for this framework to be expanded."
"With the budget and also with the draft budget for 2001, we are now a good EUR 20 billion below this 1.27 margin, and I should like to make it clear to my fellow MEPs that it does not make sense to engage in useless expenditure."
"Nor, however, does it make sense for a Parliament to restrict itself in the Budget and yet always to meet countries' demands and to make proposals as to how everything might be achieved at a time when policy is being extended and the Budget trimmed."
"Another area I wanted to address is that of agricultural policy, where most of the savings have been made."
"I am adamant that it is not that too much money has gone on agriculture and the countryside. Instead, it has gone into the wrong channels in recent years."
"Those of us in Parliament have a strong vested interest in what is, or is not, politically apposite."
"In this connection, I should like to call attention to the fact that - specifically through the law relating to budget discipline which I would describe as a law designed to safeguard the budget - compulsory funds for agriculture are changed into non-compulsory funds in cases in which, on the one hand, the funds are insufficient and countries have had to grant additional appropriations but in which, on the other hand, the Commission is required, whenever this framework is in danger of being too restrictive, to make proposals to ensure that these appropriations are to no degree exceeded."
"I think there are dangers in our continuing always to exploit agriculture for more resources, in our cutting back on it little by little and in our basing the next allocation on what has now of necessity been saved. In this way, we slowly embark upon a slippery slope whereby the money we urgently need for rural development is lost."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, budget debates ought really to be highlights of parliamentary life."
"I think that is still a long way from being the case, however."
"The Berlin Council has proceeded on the basis of an upper limit for the Budget of 1.135%."
"The Commission is now quoting a figure of 1.07, and the Council wants a figure of 1.05."
"1.27 is really the Agenda figure."
"This is happening at a time when, as is well known, expenditure on the Balkans is increasing."
"The total quoted so far of EUR 200 million for Serbia hardly even begins to meet the real needs."
"Almost the same sum has already been donated to the election campaign."
"The NATO war destroyed too much and left too much suffering in its wake."
"The new political forces, which meet with this Chamber' s approval, have the task of engaging not only in political work but also in construction work and of removing the debris from the NATO war in the form of ruined factories, schools, hospitals, bridges and other structures."
"I would particularly emphasise that we must accept responsibility for the fate of everyone in the country, including more than 500 000 refugees in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"No other country has accepted so many refugees."
"Parliament is now being called upon to ensure that restraint is exercised in areas of social policy and to restrict funds for development policy at a time of increasing world poverty."
"This already shows that the European Union' s ability to acquire the States of Central and Eastern Europe as new members not only depends upon reforming the institutions but also - and, I think, to a very much greater extent - challenges the European Union' s ability to deliver."
"Unless a different budget policy is pursued, the very accession of these States will cause the poverty line to run still more deeply in Europe."
"What is needed are neither speeches nor explanations, but practical and social action on the part of a European Union now acting as a single unit and in which Parliament is required to make its own contribution."
"I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate and to dwell on the importance of the agricultural budget and its relevance not just to farmers but to society in general."
"Those with an interest in developing a sustainable agricultural sector will be aware that the central thrust of recent reform as agreed in Berlin is a continuing move from commodity support to direct income support for farmers."
"So it is both a social and an economic measure and it is designed to bring prices into line with world trade, while at the same time attempting to retain the European model based on family farming."
"A point not always made is that this sizeable budget provision is not just confined to support for farmers but is also a factor in the provision of cheap food for European citizens."
"In some areas of agricultural activity, such as bee production, EU support represents the profit margin which in effect means consumers enjoy a quality food product at production costs and regretfully, as demonstrated in recent years, sometimes below the cost of production."
"In Berlin last year it was agreed that the budgetary provision for agriculture for the period 2000-2006 will be over £506 billion, that the 15 Member States of the European Union will continue to contribute 1.3% of gross national product to the overall annual budget - which of course includes measures to finance the proposed enlargement of the European Union, a proposal which I and my other colleagues fully support."
"We fully support the concept of enlargement and the provision of sufficient resources to make the applicant states' transition to membership meaningful."
"Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder if it is possible to achieve this objective within existing budget constraints without undermining the agricultural budget necessary for a sustainable rural sector in existing Member States."
"In this regard I believe that we have to act as politicians; we cannot expect to be magicians in a situation where there may not be sufficient funds to develop the economies of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe along the lines that the existing Member States would want to see them developed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you see before you a frustrated Member of the European Parliament."
"Frustrated because, after lengthy debates within the Committee on Budgets and after the commendable efforts of the general rapporteur, to whom I must pay tribute, I cannot see exactly what Parliament' s intentions are regarding the key problem of the revision of the financial perspective."
"By and large, we have two standpoints, that of the Council which persists in wishing to fund the new requirements of Kosovo and Serbia from the budget total established in Berlin without revision, and that of the Commission which is proposing to revise the financial perspective in order to finance these new requirements without seriously affecting the other policies, particularly the MEDA programme."
"To date, Parliament has always been in favour of avoiding redistributing funds within category 4 in order to finance the new requirements. It therefore declared itself in favour of revising the financial perspective."
"Today we feel that it is continuing to fight on this line, but not down to the last bullet."
"In spite of the rapporteur' s bolder proposal, we have voted in a text which does not mention the word ""revision"" , as if it was too vulgar a term, the r word rather than the f word, nor does it mention amounts, as if it were possible to reach any negotiated solution without specifying the amounts involved."
"I am concerned, and since I belong to a group that occasionally remembers that it was once Christian Democrat, I should like us to be faithful to the word of the Gospels and let your yea be yea and your nay, nay."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would, of course, like to thank all rapporteurs."
"I believe they have worked very hard."
"Every time, it is a feat of strength if the budget can be brought to a good close and I believe congratulations are in order here."
"A budget is always more than a mere juggling with figures."
"Behind each figure, behind each budget line, behind each allocation, there is a policy to be adopted, there are political goals, huge expectations and, more than anything, people."
"I was able to experience this first-hand over the past two weeks when, during a trip in the Western Balkans, I visited Kosovo and Bosnia."
"And I happened to be in Pristina when President Kostunica was welcomed in Biarritz with the necessary pomp and circumstance and was handed EUR 200 million in the form of winter aid there and then, no strings attached."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that was a political act which was not particularly received well by the Albanian Kosovars."
"I was asked why the Union does not seize the change of power in Serbia to put permanent pressure on the new regime, even if it was to set those 914 people free who are imprisoned in Serbian gaols forthwith?"
"And I am telling you loud and clear: Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months, but meanwhile, I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, to be accompanied by political conditions, both from a political and budgetary perspective."
"As far as I am concerned, Serbia should not receive any funding without giving us the guarantee of more stability and absolute respect for the rights of the Kosovars, the Montenegrins and for respect of the Dayton Agreement of November 1995."
"For it is true that my visit to Bosnia taught me that the situation there is very problematic indeed."
"All the people I talked to over there applauded the switch of power in Serbia, but they all feared a reduction in the financial resources at the same time."
"A euro can only be spent once and may this serve as a caution to both you, ladies and gentlemen, as well as the absent Council."
"There is a great deal to be done in Bosnia."
"Just think of the return of the refugees and the clearing of mines."
"I have visited the project."
"Those people need funds urgently for if the mines are not cleared, the houses cannot be rebuilt and the economy of this very fragile state cannot be made viable."
"A reduction in the financial resources translates in less stability in the Western Balkans."
"I therefore back all efforts, together with Mr Lagendijk, to inject maximum funds in the Western Balkans."
"If necessary, category four should be broken down in our view and the financial perspective should be reviewed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to see Europe remain a political dwarf and I certainly do not want another war in the Western Balkans, at less than 1 500 km from here."
"Let us therefore, in the capacity of budget authority, assume our political responsibility."
"Mr President, the Council really has surpassed itself in its proposed draft budget 2001."
"Demands are increasing, whether we like it not, and yet the Council, year on year, has reduced the overall size of the budget."
"As a percentage of European GDP, it has fallen from 1.27% to below 1.05%."
"This has dramatic repercussions on funding for agricultural policy, social policy, employment, research and a whole host of other areas of economic, social and development policy, at the expense of the regions in the Union lagging behind and at the expense of the broader social classes."
"In the final analysis, it is immoral to cut spending on agricultural policy, on the MEDA programme and on the socially excluded, in order to find the resources to finance the European Union' s commitments in Kosovo and Yugoslavia."
"It was not the farmers and the poor in the Mediterranean who decided and went ahead with the NATO bombings, but it is they who are paying for the damage."
"The damage in the Balkans needs to be restored, but it should be paid by for those who were responsible for it."
"This budget is unacceptable."
"The European Parliament has just one way of showing that it has self-respect and respect for the people in the Member States and that is to accept the amendment tabled by our group and reject the entire budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I only want to express an opinion on a part of this Budget, namely that relating to Serbia."
"The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: that the people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and that they have confidence in Professor Kostunica."
"The challenge faced by the new President is, at the same time, a challenge to us Europeans."
"The process of democratisation has only just begun."
"The retreat of the old Serbian government and the formation of a transitional cabinet of experts, as well as the election of the new Serbian parliament on 23 December of this year, are important prerequisites for replacing the old socialist-communist nomenclature in the Republic of Serbia, just as it has already been replaced in Montenegro, and for opening the door to democratic changes."
"Important institutional decisions have already been made in the last ten days."
"The independence of the Yugoslav national bank has been secured."
"The customs administration has finally ceased to be an instrument of corruption."
"It is now also important that the trade sanctions should be lifted by the EU as quickly as possible."
"Commissioner Patten, who is in Belgrade today, ought to endorse the proposal made by those who exercise responsibility in that country, to the effect that all trade sanctions should be lifted and that firms associated with war criminals should be blacklisted."
"In order to safeguard the success of the democratic forces in the elections, as well as Kostunica' s initial successes, we must do something."
"The Yugoslav economy is completely ruined."
"Our fellow MEP, Mr Modrow is no longer here, but he should be listening."
"The economy has, in the very first place, been ruined because of incredible mismanagement on the part of Milosevic and his wife Markovic, who was, and is, also chairman of the Communist Party and to all intents and purposes the head of a large mafia."
"In the second place, it has been ruined by the sanctions imposed upon the country because of Milosevic and, to a small degree, by the NATO bombings."
"It is incredible that a country which formerly exported food can now no longer feed its people."
"Winter is coming, and there is a shortage of gas, oil and heating equipment."
"The fact that, following Kostunica' s election, the Serbian parliament immediately lifted the restrictions upon prices which had until then been frozen, led to a price explosion, which might cause people to misunderstand the policy pursued by Kostunica who, however, had no influence at all upon this decision."
"Political stability depends upon the improvement of living conditions."
"To put it simply: the people of Serbia ought neither to freeze nor to go hungry this winter."
"That is why I most particularly welcome the fact that our fellow MEPs from the Committee on Budgets have made every effort to provide the emergency aid of EUR 200 million for this year, Mr Modrow, and not for next year, there still being two and a half months of this year left."
"With these funds, we could show that Europe is the real partner in this region."
"The latest elections contributed a further 80 municipalities to our democratic contacts at local level, so that we have a sufficient number of intermediaries at this level too."
"Those responsible for politics and the economy in Serbia emphasise again and again that they do not wish to become dependent upon our help, but that they need our help now in order to alleviate need in the short term and that they will then need help to help themselves introduce a social market economy in the medium and long term and in order also to make necessary foreign investment possible."
"I was very pleased today to hear Professor Kostunica officially acknowledge as crimes his predecessor' s actions against the Albanians and accept responsibility for these."
"I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released soon."
"Professor Kostunica deserves our support."
"I am also sure that this Parliament will concur with this judgement of mine when he has spoken before us in this Chamber on 15 November."
"The fact that it has today, at the same time, been decided to give EUR 175 million to poverty-stricken Kosovo shows that we do not forget the old challenges when new ones arise."
"I very much hope that in the debate on the CARDS programme, which of course covers our financial commitment to all these countries, we show the same level of commitment and give each country its due."
"If south-eastern Europe is to be a stable region, then individual States need to be stable, too."
"Mr President, just two final touches to add to the 2001 budget, which are totally unconnected."
"Firstly, I would like to say something about the backlog of payments which each year causes headaches as a result of the Council' s eagerness to cut payment appropriations, with the aim of obtaining this absurd and false saving, which looks very good on the national balance sheet, but which in reality only produces what we call a burden for the future, because it is clear that what has been committed to - commitments entered into - in previous financial years has to be fulfilled."
"And what we have heard today from the Council, according to which there have not been any problems with payments, is not true."
"It is not true, and I would have liked to have been able to remind Mr Patriat in person that in 1998 payments were even suspended for the Social Fund because EUR 1 million were lacking for the Structural Funds."
"This is something that has been repeated."
"There have always been a great deal of problems with payments."
"Having said this, and also taking into account that the Commission itself has admitted that for 2001 applications from Member States for payments for the Structural Funds exceed the predictions of the PDB by EUR 8 000 million, I think that it is now time for the Council to start considering very seriously that we should do something about payments and not increase the backlog of payments."
"I would also like to express my concern about the fact that the various Youth Parliaments have been included in the Socrates programme."
"I am in no doubt about the reason for the existence of these parliaments, but there is no harm in pointing out that the Socrates programme derives from a legislative codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council, and that decisions such as this set a serious precedent which will, in the future, allow the inclusion of comments on programmes of any type of action that do not fit in elsewhere."
"I think that this distorts the legislative procedure for adopting programmes and, above all, the content of those programmes."
"Mr President, the current financial perspective clearly does not reflect our existing priorities and commitments."
"The mainstay of Parliament' s strategy should be to force the Council to guarantee that new resources will be allocated to new objectives, in order to prevent these new objectives from being implemented using resources earmarked for existing priorities."
"The European Parliament is fully entitled to call for the financial perspective to be revised, all the more so in the light of the draft budget proposed by the Council, which has shamelessly given us, in relative terms, the lowest budget in the last ten years."
"If the financial perspective is not revised, we will inevitably be caught up in ""financial engineering"" , in redeploying resources and in cuts, either in general expenditure, social and environmental spending or in cooperation."
"It is also true that in spite of this, appropriations for the Balkans will still be inadequate, not to mention the horizontal reserve, which will result in unacceptable constraints on cooperation policy, on the Cohesion Fund, or even on the issue of Timor, where the European Union has given firm international commitments."
"We clearly appreciate certain aspects, specifically the fact that the year 2000 amounts for development policies have been retained. This is not enough, however, to change our negative overall view of the draft budget, because it is inadequate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about a Budget with some EUR 96.8 billion in commitments and EUR 94.7 billion in payments from Parliament' s point of view."
"Far below the ceiling for own resources, therefore."
"I believe that what matters is to use the 2001 Budget for a budgetary and administrative consolidation of the European Union while fulfilling the commitments which have been entered into, including those relating to the common agricultural policy."
"The basis for doing so is to be found in the decisions made in connection with Agenda 2000."
"I would also state very clearly in this Chamber that anyone who goes beyond this fails to understand the processes of adjustment and the structural changes at present under way in agriculture and in rural areas and will provoke a debate which might lead some day to Brussels' being told: we are sorry, the Commission is no doubt responsible for foreign trade and for competition law in the area of agricultural policy, but responsibility for everything else must again lie with ourselves because we are no longer going to allow the structures concerned to go downhill."
"We have had to resort to the reserves in the different areas."
"We do so not for the fun of it but because we want to make an impression and to see to it that responsible use is made of Parliament' s priorities."
"We would not need to use these reserves if, for example, following an amendment to budget law or to the budget regulations - of the kind which certainly takes place at national level - the Committee on Budgets were to have the opportunity in future to block and freeze funds in the current budget year, if this were necessary and if Parliament' s views had not been taken sufficiently into account."
"I want to say very clearly that, with regard to category 4, we on the one hand stand by the international political commitments which have been entered into and accept the new challenges."
"For us, however, it is crucial that, on 15 November, the Commission should submit - as we shall demand that it do - a clear, detailed and intelligible report on how we are dealing with the commitments entered into so far and with the total arrears in payments."
"I strongly advise the Commission to produce a thorough report so that we do not have to return to this problem area over the next few years."
"Until these figures are available, there will be problems in releasing the general implementation reserve of some EUR 650 million."
"Until this point has been clarified and discussed in detail, I flatly refuse to speak about any revision of the Financial Perspective."
"It must also, of course, be made clear to the Council that it also has its share of responsibility for the deficiencies in the way that many external programmes have been handled."
"I would state very clearly that we want to finance the programme for the Balkan region on the basis of the assessment to date, that is to say, however, not exclusively under heading 1 and not exclusively by revising the Financial Perspective, but by means of thoroughly sound multiannual financial planning."
"I want to mention one final point which is also part and parcel of this issue."
"In view of past experience, we want to help create a new culture of responsibility and administration at European level."
"We say yes to 400 new jobs in 2001."
"However, we would say just as clearly to the Commission that, before we are prepared to negotiate at all concerning the second tranche for 2002, we need a careful discussion and analysis of how, while respecting the substance of the acquis communautaire, Community law can be simplified, something which may save jobs both at Community level and within the Member States."
"In the same way, we need a careful analysis on the part of the Commission of how, in the course of the enlargement process, European administration is to be developed."
"So that we do not have to discuss these problems again in the next budget year, we should call for this right now so that the Commission is given a clear signal regarding the homework it has to do in the course of the next six months."
"Mr President, it is a promising development that, this year, we are close to sharing the Council' s views where most of the important points are concerned and that we can show budgetary discipline but still uphold most of Parliament' s priorities."
"As a Europhile Social Democrat from a Eurosceptic country, I think it is necessary to show that the EU is making efforts which are important to citizens."
"In this connection, efforts are required to solve the major social problems, for example unemployment."
"The development of technology in small companies is also a key issue."
"It looks as though we are going to succeed this year."
"The most significant task still to be accomplished relates to the Balkans, of course."
"It is unfortunate that the Council wants to cut back on aid to the Balkans, with the exception of Serbia, by almost a quarter compared with the Commission' s proposal."
"There are no objective grounds for this proposal."
"With the decisions to transfer EUR 175 million to Kosovo and EUR 200 million to Serbia, we have hopefully managed to finance the most acute needs in those countries, but we must not run the risk of people in, for example, Bosnia or Macedonia feeling that we are failing to keep our promises to them in order to be able to provide aid to Serbia."
"That is particularly important, bearing in mind that there is money for efforts in all these areas."
"The finance ministers did, of course, receive significantly larger sums of money back from last year' s Budget."
"A stable solution is now required when it comes to these contributions and, to a still greater degree, to the long-term planning for the whole of the Western Balkans which is now necessary."
"If we cannot find any other ways, we must be prepared to revise the Financial Perspective on the understanding that this is being done for the express purpose of finding resources for the current areas within category 4 and not for any other purposes."
"For ourselves as Swedish Social Democrats, it is also important to point out that we must now emphasise Budget discipline in order gradually to create space for enlargement of the EU, which is perhaps the most important political task for our generation."
"We therefore also believe that, in future, we must further reform agricultural policy in the direction of lower costs and that we must definitely remove expenditure such as aid for tobacco cultivation, which makes no sense at all."
"Mr President, unlike Mr Bourlanges, I am not frustrated by this procedure but I must say that this must be the most mind-numbing budget I have known in the Committee on Budgets for years."
"Whilst there are so many underlying problems, there is relatively little evidence of this in this House, which might be unfortunate."
"It is perhaps a kind of transitional year, a year wedged between last year' s nerve-racking events and those which may lie ahead next year."
"In any case, not a great deal has happened."
"There is, of course, one crucial event, namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it, but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this, partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes. The guiding principle has always been Berlin, Berlin, Berlin, but listening to the Minister, it appears that Berlin is out of the frame."
"In fact, it is not in the picture ... or even in the credits."
"It is as if Berlin never happened at all."
"In addition, as Mrs Dührkop already pointed out, there is the fact that there are indeed problems with payment credits."
"The Minister simply had his facts wrong."
"We in the Social Fund have had problems with payment appropriations."
"We should not forget that we are still in the initial stages and that a problem with payments will always occur later on."
"Agricultural policy is also working out in our favour, because the euro is so low, which always leads to certain benefits."
"It could well be the case that next year or the year after, we will all of a sudden have an enormous need for payment appropriations."
"And then I will be interested to see if the Council is prepared to make the necessary credits available or if they will come up with a different excuse why it cannot be done."
"This is the risk, in my view."
"The system assumes that the payment appropriations more or less simply follow the spending patterns, but the Council adds its own mechanism, and it is that mechanism which threatens to undermine Berlin, despite the fact that Berlin is under way in real terms."
"I would like to add one more thing."
"I do believe that the Committee on Budgets should be careful not to intervene too often or too horizontally in proposals put forward by the expert committees."
"In my view, things have got somewhat out of hand this year and serious deliberation is what is now needed."
"Mr President, we are to make decisions about the EU' s Budget at first reading."
"This means, however, that we are only at the beginning of the Budget process."
"That is important to note because we are at present at a stage entailing an unduly large increase in the EU' s Budget."
"If the increase were to be carried out, this would mean further increased costs for all households within the EU."
"For Sweden, this would involve approximately EUR 65 million."
"I believe that most people are prepared to accept this, on the understanding that the money is used in the right way."
"Where the present proposal is concerned, I am not however certain that people think it will be."
"It is therefore a question of using the time well."
"This applies, of course, to the Committee on Budgets and to the European Parliament, which have to do the necessary prioritising, but it is above all the Council of Ministers which has a clear responsibility."
"The increase is inexplicably high in category 1, that is to say the EU' s comprehensive agricultural policy about which the Council of Ministers has the last word."
"We are talking about an increase of more than six per cent, both for payments and commitments."
"At the Council meeting (Budget), which takes place at the end of November, initiatives ought, in my opinion, to be taken to produce a significantly lower rate of increase for category 1."
"If the Council does this, it will also be more credible in coming back to Parliament with a demand for corresponding measures to be taken."
"Prioritising is important in all Budget work."
"This applies to enlargement in accordance with the decision at last year' s Berlin Summit, as well as to our efforts to meet our commitments in Serbia."
"By adopting the necessary priorities in the Budget, we shall tackle both of these historic commitments successfully."
"As I see it, we shall be able to do this within the framework of the Financial Perspective backed by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I join in congratulating all the rapporteurs."
"It is only right to highlight the efforts that the general rapporteur, Mrs Haug, has made in seeking an intelligent consensus, which I hope will not be frustrated."
"But I would like to focus my comments on the ECSC operating budget, which needs to be examined in the light of the fact that we are on the threshold of the expiry of the Treaty."
"Its final amount is modest and correct."
"Our group relates the strategy for the general budget to the quality of spending and efficient management, and this also extends to the ECSC budget."
"I share the concerns and opinions that the rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, mentioned this afternoon regarding the sections on research and social measures."
"But what is also important is to insist that the allocations are used correctly."
"A sector such as steel, thanks to technological research and development, has ceased to be an industry that only generates basic products and has become one that puts semi-processed products on the market with added value."
"Therefore, sustaining and increasing research programmes in that sector is a key issue today, with the ECSC instruments, and in the future, when they disappear."
"On the other hand, it is important for the peace of mind of thousands of workers, and compatible with the overall amount planned, that the level of aid planned for this financial year for the social chapter for coal should be maintained."
"The ECSC operative budget for 2001 does not move away substantially from the line taken in recent years."
"It therefore takes on the same faults."
"You only have to look at the amount entered coming from commitments that have not been implemented."
"This is not very serious with the expiry of the Treaty very close on the horizon, but it would be worrying if the post-ECSC legal framework maintained the possibility of prolonging such practices."
"We are therefore paying close attention to the proposal for a decision on the financial consequences of the expiry of the Treaty."
"The Commission will have to look at a transparent mechanism so that the European financial institutions can, at the correct time, evaluate what is remaining from the ECSC and be protected from any possible failures to pay by debtors and so that, through a system of public competition, maximum profitability can be achieved."
"Mr President, one of the great privileges of parliamentarians is to talk about the budget."
"As an old House of Commons man I am delighted that we have this opportunity here today."
"There is an old saying: ""No taxation without representation"" ."
"However, when we look at the development budget there are all sorts of peculiarities which we should concentrate on."
"We accept that there is waste and inefficiency in the development budget."
"I know that the Committee on Development and Cooperation is looking very hard at it."
"So is the Committee on Budgets."
"There was a reference earlier to Hurricane Mitch and money going to the people in those little islands."
"In fact no money has gone to the people in the little islands because we could not get our act together and help the people who needed the money."
"But my main point is about the ACP."
"Two weeks ago we had the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"It is no longer a joint assembly. It is now a Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"And that brings me back to my original point about representation and taxation."
"Now 35 Members of Parliament from 35 different countries come together twice a year as Members of Parliament to discuss development and mutual cooperation."
"Yet when you look at this joint assembly, it does not actually control a budget."
"Yes, it is a parliamentary assembly but it has no budget to control, because the EDF budget which we use for the ACP is apparently controlled by the Member States."
"During my time in the House of Commons not once do I recall any debate about the EDF budget and I doubt whether there is any debate in the Member States about the EDF budget."
"So who does debate, as elected representatives, the EDF budget?"
"I suspect no-one."
"The Commission proposes and disposes."
"We have a parliamentary assembly which does not have a budget."
"We should look at this again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a remark to what Mr Deva has just said."
"It is one of the real scandals of Europe that sums amounting to billions from the Member States have still not been placed under the control of the European Parliament and made subject to this Chamber' s budget law."
"No-one controls this money, and this is entirely the responsibility of the Member States and of the Council and, Mrs Rühle, also of the red-green government in Germany which, despite having previously stated otherwise, is also not now prepared to take this step."
"Secondly, reservations were expressed a few weeks ago in terms of what would happen if a movement really were to arise in Serbia."
"Would the European Union be in a position to act in this matter at all?"
"We had, it was said, not set aside any of the money we had generously promised."
"I believe that, in the last few days, the European Union has shown, faster than the United States and faster than the Member States, that it is in a position to respond appropriately to such a situation. Moreover, Parliament has this week, and before the Council too, reached important decisions to enable the developments which Doris Pack discussed actually to occur, namely the arrival of the initial sums before Christmas of this year and a situation in which people sense that the efforts on behalf of democracy are worthwhile."
"That leads to my third remark on what now faces us."
"I am concerned that, while our common foreign and security policy progresses ever further, becomes ever more skilful and even acquires a 'Mr CFSP' , and while we are also further developing the European security and defence policy and coming up with practical measures, we are, in the long term, spending less and less on foreign policy measures."
"Special attention has again been given in this Chamber to the fact that we are beating a retreat from Latin America, Asia and Africa, and particularly from Latin America."
"In the long term, it is therefore just not on to talk more about foreign policy and less about international solidarity."
"We need to bring about changes in this area."
"It is not right that the Budget should penalise other regions of the world, and it is also necessary for the Commission to bring about a situation in 2001 in which Commissioner Patten' s declared view prevails, to the effect that the money should flow more rapidly."
"Mr President, I should like to join with Mr Pronk in asking you to look critically at the preliminary decisions of the Committee on Budgets regarding the deliberations of the specialist committees, in my own case the preliminary decisions on health and environmental policies."
"For example, subsidising tobacco cultivation in the EU is simply no longer justifiable."
"As you all know, this special form of cultivation is subsidised each year to the tune of EUR 1 billion, despite the fact that there is no market at all for European tobacco within the EU and it has to be exported."
"What is more, we are working right now on the new directive on tobacco cultivation, the main objective of which is of course to explain to the consumer the harmful effects of smoking upon health."
"This is supposed considerably to reduce tobacco consumption within the EU."
"To go on subsidising tobacco cultivation at the same time is a downright contradiction in terms."
"Instead, these subsidies must be removed step by step, though on condition that the farmers concerned are given structural aid for the purpose of switching production to other goods."
"At the same time, budget funds from the Research and Information Fund ought to be made available for the purpose of researching into alternative forms of production for farmers who at present cultivate tobacco, and this is something we want to see happen."
"I think these measures are at present the most sensible solution where the tobacco issue is concerned."
"I am no dreamer."
"I know that this proposal is not at present capable of winning a majority, but I should like to call upon as many fellow MEPs as possible to vote in favour of this package of measures in order simply to set an example so that we might finally make some headway on this issue."
"Another important point relates to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London."
"This definitely requires an increase in its budget, for we ourselves have of course given it a new additional task."
"This agency is to promote the development of medicinal products - so-called orphan drugs - for rare diseases."
"This has already been reported on today."
"We ourselves have therefore arranged for corresponding legislation which did not come into force until April of this year."
"It is merely being consistent now also to ensure that our decisions can be put into effect and that this agency' s funds are increased."
"On the other hand, it would not be in our interests to support agencies whose work we cannot see as being of any discernible consequence and which do not produce any visible results."
"In our view, that is the case with the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen."
"The Committee on Budgets has also recognised this."
"It is not a question of regularly increasing the funds of any old agencies but of promoting work of proven value."
"This is what I am asking you to do, and I am asking you to vote accordingly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I come from Spanish Algeciras, opposite Gibraltar and not far from Morocco."
"I have seen the fishing boats tossing in the harbour, a picture which spoke volumes, vividly illustrating the enforced inactivity of the fishermen. Or was it, or is it, an illustration of our own incapability?"
"The fishermen are inactive, tired and disappointed."
"For eleven months, there has no longer been an agreement with Morocco."
"Mr Fischler is negotiating hard, but unfortunately without success so far."
"Inhabiting, as they do, a region in any case lacking in infrastructure, the Andalusians are alarmed."
"Four thousand ships lie at anchor."
"The Committee on Fisheries is alarmed, too."
"Who is responsible for alternative jobs in the EU?"
"Under which Budget heading can we pay for possible forms of restructuring?"
"The new Finance Agreement is of no use, and I see that mistrust of EU politicians is growing."
"A serious, robust and optimistic Budget is therefore all the more necessary."
"The combination of need, scope of action and flexibility is a whole new chapter."
"The Committee on Fisheries takes a lot of flack."
"It is very often a target of multiple attacks for financial and political reasons."
"Unjustly so."
"We are open to justified criticism from our own ranks, too."
"However, we also want to be listened to and, in the field of employment alone, we speak for as many as 41 000 jobs, for which there are no alternatives."
"Of course we are dependent upon a significant amount of imports."
"It is true that the market is increasingly looking for private sales channels, but we ought not to evade our socio-economic duty."
"We therefore at least need adequately worded fisheries agreements, provided that they have been assessed convincingly."
"We therefore agree with the division into compulsory expenditure without reserves and into the token entry with reserves which take effect whenever we want to sign new agreements, namely those which do not come into effect until next year."
"I am confident of a positive vote in this area, that is to say in the fisheries area as a whole, for I believe that only this will constitute an expression of our common political will."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate tonight."
"It is probably the most important Parliamentary debate in a twelve-month period, when we debate the budget."
"It is rather ridiculous that we have to fight to put forward the points of view of the regions we represent."
"Those who are in charge of the future of this Parliament would do well to recognise it is a one-day debate they require, not a two-day debate on the budget in future."
"I say without apology that I am going to address the effects that the European Union has had in my region."
"I want to make it very clear that the European Union, insofar as Northern Ireland is concerned, has had the most direct and positive influence imaginable."
"It has been good for Northern Ireland."
"It has been positive for Northern Ireland and has delivered for Northern Ireland."
"The peace and reconciliation programme which was brought about by three Members of this Parliament in conjunction with the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, has been very positive for Northern Ireland."
"The partnership boards have been a success in that area."
"They have been innovative and have introduced new ideas."
"They have also brought about a bottom-up philosophy that had never been appreciated before."
"I also have to make it very clear that we now have a fledgling new regional government in Northern Ireland of which my party leader, David Trimble, is the First Minister."
"It is trying to build a new future."
"You have to understand that Northern Ireland, throughout the last 30 years, through the terrorism, has suffered tremendously."
"We are trying to find new ways forward."
"We are trying to find ways in which we can work together."
"We are trying to find ways in which we can put things together to support each other."
"I would ask that we be given the flexibility to achieve that possibility, to achieve the jobs, to achieve the employment and to be able to put the people of Northern Ireland back to work again, back to work in real politics rather than looking into other reasons as to why they may want to disagree with each other."
"That is the objective."
"It is something we all have to look forward to."
"I want firstly to thank Parliament, secondly to thank the Committee on Budgets for their continued support and understanding for my region."
"I pay tribute to them for that."
"Thank you very much, Mr Nicholson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m."
"Protection of personal data"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0279/2000) by Mrs Paciotti, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the institutions and bodies of the Community and on the free movement of such data (COM(1999) 337 - C5-0149/1999 - 1999/0153(COD))"
"Mr President, in countries with a high level of technological development, the protection of privacy is always more at risk, and therefore appropriate safeguards must be established."
"The countries of the European Union are at the vanguard in the protection of privacy compared to systems adopted in other parts of the world, especially those countries which have implemented the two directives, Directive 95/46 and Directive 97/66 - on the protection of individuals with regard to the protection of personal data."
"The European model considers the protection of personal data to be a fundamental right guaranteed by legally binding rules, based on the principle of peoples' self-determination of data, that is the principle whereby everyone must be able to decide whether and how personal data concerning him can be collected and used."
"In this model, respect for standards and procedures is guaranteed by an independent authority and final jurisdiction lies with the judges."
"Since a great deal of personal data is also collected and processed by the institutions and the Union' s bodies, the system of guarantees contained in the European model must apply to them as well."
"Therefore, a rule laying down the right of everyone to the protection of personal data concerning him, which must be processed fairly for specific purposes on the basis of the consent of the person concerned and subject to control by an independent authority, has been included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Moreover, Article 286 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, lays down that Community acts on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of data - that is the two above-mentioned directives - apply to the institutions and Community bodies and that an independent supervisory body responsible for monitoring the application of such Community acts must be established."
"The proposal for a regulation which is being examined by Parliament today implements these provisions, transposes the Community legislation and establishes the office of European Data Protection Supervisor, thereby providing appropriate, tangible guarantees of this fundamental right."
"Over months of work and with the constant assistance of the Commission, we have attempted - and we can inform you that we have been successful - to produce a detailed regulation responding to the concerns voiced by the Council and by the Parliamentary committees responsible for assessing the regulation and formulating opinions."
"The willingness of all the institutions concerned to discuss the matter resulted in exemplary cooperation which, it is my fervent hope, will make it possible for us to reach a consensus at the first reading."
"The many joint amendments reproduce the majority of the solutions identified by the Council, and these already take into account the proposals made during the Parliamentary debate."
"Acceptable solutions have therefore been reached, for example regarding the appointment of the European Supervisor and the Assistant Supervisor, which is to be agreed by Parliament and the Council from lists of names drawn up by the Commission following a call for candidates."
"With the unanimous support of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, your rapporteur nevertheless insists upon certain amendments which, for example offer a novel solution to the much-debated subject of the scope of the regulation."
"It is restricted to the Community context but a form of protection is provided for in respect of the activities of the institutions outside the first pillar; this solution is obtained by referring to the rules for the protection of privacy relating to the right of access to documents, governed by Article 225 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities."
"In fact, Article 225, unlike Article 286, is also referred to in the Treaty on European Union."
"Provision is also made for cooperation with the national supervisory authorities and with the authorities established in the third pillar, with a view to coordinating and gradually harmonising the entire regulation of this sensitive area."
"Moreover, provision has been made for an autonomous budget heading, in accordance with the prevailing system for the European Ombudsman, in order to provide a greater guarantee of the independence of the Data Protection Supervisor."
"I am confident that our untiring work will win the full approval of the European Parliament and the Council."
"Thus, for the first time, codecision will apply at the first reading to an extremely complex text which is full of technical difficulties on the particularly sensitive sector of the protection of civil liberties."
"The very technical complexity of the text suggests that it would be a good idea to postpone the vote until the next part-session in order to allow an accurate check to be carried out on all the different language versions, for this has not yet been carried out."
"If this result is, as I hope, achieved, this will be due to the mediating capacities of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, the positive contribution of the Commission and the sensitivity to public interest and the rights of the citizens displayed by the Members of Parliament of all the political groups which contributed to the adoption of the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. I would like to thank them all publicly."
"Mr President, the protection of personal privacy is a fundamental human right."
"Every day, a host of personal data, for example in connection with telephone conversations and payments on the Internet, is recorded and put into circulation."
"Personal data circulates within the EU in particular."
"This proposal for a Regulation lays down sound bases for the protection of privacy."
"Freedom of movement requires effective crime prevention, which is less successful without effective protection of privacy."
"According to the proposal, the EU must not handle data concerning ethnic origin, political views, religion, health and sexuality at all."
"Data concerning criminal backgrounds and security measures may only be dealt with if special conditions are fulfilled."
"Such data may only be handled for legitimate reasons and if the individuals concerned are informed about the data."
"I have been calling for a long time for independent European supervision of the protection of privacy, without new bureaucratic structures."
"I think that Mrs Paciotti has come up with a successful proposal for a European supervisor able to guarantee the rights of individuals in relation to the institutions, to carry out supervision and to provide the institutions with advice."
"At the same time, we must of course maintain and develop the cooperation that exists between the Member States' own data authorities."
"It is important to establish a system that works and to merit people' s confidence."
"The protection of privacy must therefore be developed."
"The protection of personal privacy is included in the new EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In the future, we may perhaps be able to go to court for further protection in this area."
"Those of us who stand for European values in a Eurosceptic country are now being given further arguments in favour of the EU, namely more effective protection of privacy, which is important for the citizens of a modern society."
"Even if this matter has been rather difficult to deal with, I nonetheless want to congratulate Mrs Paciotti on a very good report."
"I hope, however, that the model which we have used in this Chamber and which has somewhat hindered MEPs from participating on a broad basis will not act as a guide to the way in which we are to deal with these issues in the future."
"Mrs Paciotti has been very successful in uniting all the institutions."
"I therefore want to congratulate her, and I hope that the Chamber will support the report."
"Mr President, our group considers that this is on the whole a good result and especially welcomes the fact that the area of application is extended to include the whole of Community law."
"These rules are to apply, in particular, within the second and third pillars."
"We welcome the wealth of initiative and invention which has characterised this work."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur."
"We think that the institutional solutions are very good."
"We are not talking about some form of collegiate body but about a supervisor and assistant supervisor."
"It is important to ensure that, important as data protection is, this must not mean limited access to documents within the EU' s institutions."
"The European ombudsman has unfortunately been compelled to point out that the Commission has used data secrecy as a reason for limiting access to information about who had taken part in a meeting intended to sway the Commission."
"This is an example of the misuse of data protection, which must not occur."
"I really do hope it is ensured that the regulations will not be applied in that way."
"We must also be aware of the fact that the European ombudsman and the data protection supervisor will be on opposite sides of the fence."
"We must not be surprised if they sometimes end up in public discussion with each other."
"The fact that their tasks have not been combined is extremely positive."
"To some extent, this is an automatic transfer from the old Directive 95/46/EC."
"In this connection, I want to take the opportunity to ask the Commissioner when revision of the general directive on data protection is to begin."
"There is, of course, an obvious need to revise this directive with a view to modernising it, so that it meets those needs mentioned by Mrs Cederschiöld."
"Data protection on the telecommunications network ought also to be reviewed."
"Finally, I want to point out that, as a Finnish citizen, I have realised that the European Parliament is the only institution - the only elected body - to supervise the Commission' s decisions when it comes to the level of data secrecy in third countries."
"We are aware of the famous case in which such supervision was applied."
"The European Parliament is the only body which can democratically supervise decisions by means of the committee procedure which exists."
"I now see that my own country is to alter the law relating to personal data which deprives elected representatives of any influence at all over the Commission' s decisions."
"I therefore welcome the constructive dialogue we have established with the Commission, together with the appropriate committee procedure which will guarantee citizens' security."
"Ladies and gentlemen, fifty years after the start of the construction of Europe, it is high time for the European Union to at last endow itself with a supervisory authority designed to protect the people of Europe from the potential abuses related to the multiplication of computer-based files containing personal data."
"The exponential growth of the European Union' s tasks and jurisdiction, and the proliferation of Community bodies, mean that we must have a precise legal definition of the citizens' rights, and these should cover the transfer of information between European Union institutions and bodies."
"Under the codecision procedure, the Council submitted a proposal for a regulation to the European Parliament on the basis of Article 286 of the EC Treaty."
"This article specifies that data protection should be effective within the European Union by 1 January 1999."
"Nigh on two years later, we have not yet brought matter to a conclusion. This means we should not get embroiled in a lengthy codecision procedure which would delay the implementation of this instrument even longer."
"This is what Mrs Paciotti has done, and I really think our rapporteur has done a truly remarkable job."
"Let us get to the heart of the matter."
"The main bone of contention between the European Parliament and the Council is to do with the jurisdiction of this future supervisory authority. Should it confine itself to the first pillar, i.e. the purely Community bodies, institutions and legal standards, or should it cover all Union-related provisions, i.e. the second and third pillars, such as Schengen or Europol?"
"We think it obvious that the risks related to the private lives of citizens and the misuse of citizens' personal data are far greater in the context of the third pillar, which at present is subject to little or no judicial and parliamentary control, than in the context of the first pillar, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice."
"In my opinion, it is clear that we would be closing our eyes to the problem if we set up an authority of this type to cover just the Community area, while the main problems arise and will, in future, arise due to third pillar bodies too."
"Are you aware, for instance, that the Schengen system has amassed over ten million files on almost one and a half million citizens, and that Europol, whose sphere of competence is being incessantly expanded, has a central database of information from the various police forces of the fifteen Member States, all this supervised only by an authority with neither the powers nor the resources available to it to enable it to carry out another task properly."
"The report which we are to adopt does not reflect this ambition."
"The scope of the regulation adopted on the basis of the report is limited to the first pillar, i.e. to Article 286."
"The second and third pillars will not be covered by this regulation and will therefore remain impenetrable, to the detriment of citizens' basic fundamental rights."
"In addition to the restrictive reading of Article 286, however, it would have been possible to take Article 255 of the Treaty as a further legal basis in order to expand the scope of this regulation."
"Indeed Mrs Paciotti attempted to do so by including a reference to this article in Article 12 of the regulation, but the Council refused to entertain this possibility."
"There are many other problem areas which require some pragmatic evaluation if they are to be practicable."
"In the end, though, our rapporteur is well aware of these problems and is anxious not to add another two years to the existing backlog."
"We shall therefore offer her our support, in spite of everything, in the hope that the Council and, in particular, the Commission will be careful not to take advantage of the weaknesses of the text in order to attempt to make nonsense of it."
"They must, furthermore, seek to implement means for the protection of personal data in the second and third pillars too at the earliest possible opportunity."
"It is dangerous, in any case, to allow bodies such as Europol or the Schengen system to develop without parliamentary or judicial control."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"Effectively, the problem arises from the exclusions and exceptions in the protection of personal data with regard to the second and, in particular, third, pillars, but also from the exceptions already laid down by the directives as regards police activities and activities related to national security."
"Like Mrs Boudemiene-Thiery, I feel that these activities give the greatest cause for concern in terms of citizens' privacy."
"In my opinion, the rapporteur has done everything feasible to extend the possibility, at least of cooperating and probably of exerting influence on this matter, and so we fully support her report."
"Having said that, I would like to take advantage of the fact that the Commissioner is here to say that it would appear appropriate to concern ourselves not only with protecting citizens in respect of new technologies but also with the use of these technologies to increase the European citizens' means of intervening and interacting with the European institutions."
"I feel that other directives should be applied, in a similar way to the directives on privacy in the context of the Community institutions, such as the Directive on electronic signatures, in order to allow the citizen to interact telematically with the institutions as well, by means of petitions, appeals to the Ombudsman, competitions and appeals to the Court of Justice."
"This would increase the channels for protecting the citizens - an extremely important element - but also make it easier for them to act, to be active and to interact with the institutions."
"This point is not, of course, made in the Paciotti report, but I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to raise the issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while I congratulate Mrs Paciotti on her excellent work, I would also emphasise the need to move quickly in this field, which was, in fact, the purpose of completing this dossier at first reading."
"In today' s modern society, a huge volume of personal data is collected, recorded and processed every day."
"The European public' s concern about whether its privacy is being protected or not is therefore quite legitimate, as are its hopes that a balanced solution will be found to safeguard and guarantee their rights and freedoms."
"Neither of the two directives currently in force in the European Union to guarantee protection against the improper use of personal data applies to the Community institutions. It is therefore a matter of urgent necessity for us to put into practice what was agreed in Amsterdam and to approve a regulation that gives individuals rights protected by law."
"This regulation must also set out the obligations in the field of data processing incumbent on those responsible for such activities within the Community institutions and bodies. Finally, we must have a regulation that creates an independent supervisory body responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data undertaken by Community institutions and bodies."
"We must move ahead with the creation of this supervisory body - the European Data Protection Authority - in the hope that in the medium term, it will be given new powers including those currently exercised by other supervisory authorities. We also hope that it will create a single secretariat that will ensure that all cases submitted for monitoring are treated in the same way."
"The Commission would first and foremost like to highlight the commitment we made to the citizens of Europe to ensure protection of the personal data processed by the institutions of Europe."
"We are approximately two years behind schedule in relation to the date set in Article 286 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, hence the urgent need to reach agreement on this matter."
"The Council, with the crucial encouragement of the Presidency, succeeded in overcoming the problems raised by a number of delegations, to ensure that the proposal for a regulation will most probably enjoy the unanimous approval of the Council."
"The European Parliament, in turn, demonstrated great determination in order to enable a decision to be made at first reading, and I should like to express my appreciation and my thanks to your rapporteur, Mrs Paciotti, who has spared no effort, with the support of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to ease the path of this agreement."
"By taking the Council proposal as a starting point and encouraging that a solution acceptable to all three institutions regarding the scope of the regulation be adopted, Mrs Paciotti has to a great extent made the way clear for agreement at first reading."
"The Commission has, in turn, also played a part in initiating and mediating between the Council and Parliament."
"The Commission also decided not to hold up the adoption of an instrument that is significant for the protection of citizens' personal data."
"Even though it considers that the outcome is not completely satisfactory as far as it is concerned, the Commission in turn decided to adopt the text produced as a result of the discussions in the Council and Parliament as reflected in the Paciotti report, and will therefore reject any other amendments to its original proposal."
"More specifically, the Commission' s position on the amendments contained in the Paciotti report is as follows."
"Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4 to 10, 12 to 40, 42 to 54, 57, 58 and 60 to 64 reflect the Council text on the points to which the Commission can give its assent."
"These amendments are therefore acceptable."
"Amendment Nos 55, 56 and 59 differ from the Council text, but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the Council Presidency."
"Since the Commission has decided not to obstruct the adoption of the regulation at first reading on the basis of this compromise text, it will accept these amendments."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 11 differ from the Council text, but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the Council Presidency."
"The Commission has decided not to obstruct the adoption of the regulation at first reading on the basis of this compromise text, on condition that a statement be included in the Minutes recording its legal position at such time as the Council approves the regulation."
"If this statement is made, the Commission will accept the scope of the regulation being limited exclusively to first pillar activities."
"It will also highlight the need to subject personal data processing under the second and third pillars to clear legal regulations."
"In the view of the Commission, it will be possible to adopt such regulations on the basis of Article 286."
"It therefore reserves the right to propose legislative initiatives to this effect."
"The Commission further reserves the right to subject the processing of personal data carried out under the second and third pillars to the principles contained in the regulation until such time as the regulations applicable to said data processing be implemented."
"The Commission considers that the wording of Amendment No 41 is not compatible with its right of initiative, and therefore rejects this amendment."
"Amendment No 69 is a correction to Amendment No 41, presented by the rapporteur, Mrs Paciotti, in consultation with the Commission and the Council Presidency, with a view to safeguarding the Commission' s right of initiative."
"The Commission supports this amendment, and I should like to thank Mrs Paciotti for tabling it."
"The European Data Protection Supervisor will in fact play a leading role in Community institutions' respecting the provisions protecting citizens' personal data."
"It goes without saying, then, that his opinion on the legislative proposals to do with the protection of personal data will be very valuable insofar as it will be a major contribution to the legislative debate between institutions."
"It goes without saying, moreover, that the Commission, in framing such legislative proposals, must be free to make the appropriate proposal at the time it thinks right."
"Amendment No 69 would seem to be acceptable to the Commission inasmuch as the wording does not entail a challenge to its right of initiative."
"The Commission, therefore, understands this amendment as obliging it to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor after adopting its proposal."
"The text would be improved if it were amended to make that clear, perhaps this can be done when it is proof-read."
"In any case, the Commission will make a statement to this effect when the regulation is adopted in the Council."
"In order to honour the political agreement made with the Council and the rapporteur to enable the regulation to be adopted at first reading, the Commission rejects all other amendments which were not part of the Paciotti report adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, except for Amendment No 69 which is a correction to Amendment No 41."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Outermost regions of the EU"
"The next item is the report (A5­0285/2000) by Mrs Sudre, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission' s report on the measures to implement Article 299(2): the outermost regions of the European Union (COM(2000) 147 - C5-0247/2000 - 2000/2135(COS))"
". (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism whose comments and amendments have contributed towards enhancing the report which I am presenting this evening."
"The present and future fate of the seven European regions most remote from the continent has given our committee the opportunity to unanimously adopt a constructive and balanced document, the product of lengthy consultation."
"The Azores, the Canaries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Madeira, Martinique and Réunion form a separate category whose uniqueness has now been recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam on the basis of an innovative concept: they are defined as 'outermost regions' ."
"The Treaty recognises that the outermost regions have a difficult economic and social situation, aggravated by special handicaps which, because they are continual and combined, are extremely prejudicial to development in these regions."
"This is the reason why it is essential to ensure the widest possible application of the current rules and to use the most appropriate instruments to solve the practical problems faced by these regions and, where necessary, derogations adapted to the regional situation, without this posing any serious threat to Community interests."
"The report published by the European Commission on 14 March 2000 is not, strictly speaking, a response to the demands of national and regional authorities in the outermost regions."
"The Commission specifies that it is unable to provide answers to all the questions; it often confines itself to proposing guidelines intended to continue and consolidate certain established instruments and further reserves the option of looking into the problems on a case by case basis."
"Article 299(2) primarily expresses a political will, supported on repeated occasions by the European Council and, today, by the European Parliament."
"The chief objective of my report was to remind the European Commission of this political will in order to put an end to the unfortunate impression of reluctance or inertia that we are currently getting from the Commission."
"As a matter of urgency, therefore, the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied, when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299(2), by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact."
"My report urges the Commission to prepare a genuine multiannual work programme, accompanied by a detailed timetable, giving the most comprehensive details possible of the measures planned, and providing all the essential guarantees concerning the provision of the resources required to ensure the viability of the measures and to ensure that the measures concerned are taken on a long-term basis where they are intended to deal with intrinsic handicaps."
"In order to rule out any misunderstanding concerning the Commission' s reluctance to make full use of the scope afforded by Article 299(2), I propose that an enlarged forum for dialogue should meet annually and an annual report should be drawn up."
"In response to the Commission, my report specifically investigates a number of areas falling within the scope of activities of the European Union. I shall give just a brief overview of these this evening."
"The Commission has acknowledged that the agricultural and fisheries measures need to be revised or upgraded."
"However, this second revision of the POSEI regulations will take place in a very difficult budgetary climate which may have a major bearing on the substance of the programmes, particularly the level of aid granted."
"By way of example, in its draft budget for 2001, the Commission has proposed an outrageous cut in the budget for implementation of POSEI, giving rise to an acute sense of disquiet among the many agricultural producers in the outermost regions, on whose behalf I am speaking before you today."
"In addition, we need optimum coordination and use of all the instruments available at Community level, in particular the Structural Funds, state aid schemes and tax and customs policies."
"The success of the new Community policy to assist the outermost regions calls for action geared to the strategic areas of the world economy: transport, energy, the environment, the information society, research and technological development."
"In this way it will contribute to promoting economic and social progress thanks to an increased level of employment."
"The geographical situation and island status of the outermost regions must enable them to become active frontiers of the European Union."
"Moreover, there is an urgent need to initiate an analysis of the impact of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, signed in June 2000 in Cotonou, and other international trade agreements with a view to assessing their repercussions for the outermost regions and drawing up measures to compensate producers in those regions liable to face additional competition which they are unable to withstand."
"To conclude, finally, with a subject that has a bearing on our immediate future, the process of enlargement is unquestionably an essential element in the construction of Europe, but an evaluation of its implications must be undertaken as a matter of urgency as of right now in order to prevent the aid duly allotted to the outermost regions and the projects resulting from the implementation of Article 299(2) being brought into question."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Sudre, has done a good job on her report on the outermost regions."
"On behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I would like to thank her for the way that she took on board our amendments and points of view, both in the spirit and in the actual text of the report."
"From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, what I would like to point out is that, in actual fact, we can only treat equally what is equal."
"It is an attempt to establish an entirely uniform legal order for these outermost regions, which are separated from the rest of Community territory, from mainland Europe, by thousands of kilometres, and which are divided into small island regions with very difficult conditions for raising capital and for transport, which prevent the general rules for competition in the regions from being applied."
"I would therefore like to draw attention to paragraph 21 of Mrs Sudre' s report, which indicates that, with regard to state aid, the application of the third paragraph of section a) of Article 87 should be automatic, because the reason behind the differences in that section stems from the aim of achieving equality in the competition system."
"Only through a general derogation in favour of the outermost regions will companies located in those regions be on an equal footing with companies located on mainland Europe."
"I must also point out how Mrs Sudre' s report refers to the need for specific tax and customs provisions for the same reasons."
"When regions are so distanced from the continental nucleus, trying to automatically apply the tax and customs rules that are applied in the continental nucleus would mean putting those outermost regions at a disadvantage."
"For example, on the subject of transport, in paragraph 26, the application of the rules on state aid to the ports and airports in a system of free competition would mean depriving those regions of the essential public service of ports and airports, which in outermost regions would never be a normal private activity, but an essential public service activity."
"The Commission has sent a communication, which is a programme, a sort of timetable for what is going to be done."
"We hope that the Commission will carry out this timetable or programme and, above all, we hope that the great institution that the Commission currently has, the interdepartmental group, will remain in contact with the outermost regions, informing the central authorities of our needs and our specific problems."
"I therefore congratulate Mrs Sudre, and we wait with great interest for the Commission' s proposals to be developed into rules, so that the specific characteristics can soon be taken into account, as established in paragraph 2 of Article 299 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have a genuine admiration for the report by Mrs Sudre so what follows is in no way critical of it or of her."
"Nonetheless, it illustrates what I believe is a much more widespread problem about the relationship between reports and opinions, particularly those of a non-legislative kind."
"For example, in this report only 25 words survive of the conclusions unanimously adopted by the Committee on Fisheries."
"The bulk of the section dealing with fisheries actually consists of an amendment to the motion for a resolution tabled in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"There is nothing the Committee on Fisheries would object to in the paragraph concerned."
"Indeed, it covers certain issues more explicitly than the opinion does."
"On the other hand, some significant points in the opinion do not figure in the final version of the resolution."
"Given the importance of fisheries to the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this."
"I appreciate that differences of perspective mean that it will not always be possible to reconcile views expressed in the lead committee and other committees."
"My concern is rather that we do not currently have any standardised mechanism for making an attempt to do so."
"I am asking, therefore, whether the President of Parliament would be prepared to look at ways in which improvements could be made, for example, by consultations prior to voting or by adjusting the order in which votes are taken."
"Without such improvements, we risk losing the benefits of a great deal of expertise, not just to our own detriment, but also to the detriment of those we seek to serve."
"In the meantime, and on this particular report, I would respectfully request both the Council and the Commission to look at the conclusions that are not contained in the motion for a resolution, as well as the ones that are."
"Mr President, for the European Union this is simply one more debate of the many that we hold."
"For the outermost regions this is the most important debate that the European Parliament can hold concerning them."
"In fact, what we say here today and how we vote tomorrow will be front-page news in the seven outermost regions, and the news reports on the regional television channels will report extensively on what we say and decide here."
"For many Europeans, some outermost regions are nothing more than a holiday destination on the map."
"This may even be the view of some of our fellow MEPs of the outermost regions."
"For those of us who are speaking here tonight on behalf of our native regions, this is a very negative view, and, of course, a deeply mistaken one."
"Behind this idea, beyond our landscape and an exceptional climate, is the social and economic reality of regions that are among the least developed in the European Union, with the highest levels of unemployment and with huge structural problems that impede our development."
"For more than a decade the European Commission has been aware of our problems and our particular characteristics."
"This is the first debate that the plenary session of the European Parliament has held about our regions since the Treaty of Amsterdam included a new article on them."
"So far, since an interdepartmental group was set up for the outermost regions under the presidency of Mr Delors, we have travelled a long and fruitful road, and I must express the deepest gratitude of the Europeans from the outermost regions to those who have presided over that group."
"The Commission document for implementing paragraph 2 of Article 299 of the EC Treaty is a good document, and our rapporteur, Mrs Sudre, has done well today by offering us an excellent report."
"With this Article and with the measures taken in order to implement it, we have a legal basis that until now we were lacking, and a good tool for our development."
"Mrs Sudre has succeeded in putting together a balanced report that includes many of the amendments - more than 100 of them - which were tabled for the initial draft report."
"One of these amendments proposes the implementation and application of the policies of the financial instrument for fisheries."
"What I wish to highlight here today, Commissioner Barnier, is that, for the outermost regions, while Community law fully applies, it is essential that those rules be modulated and adapted in order to stimulate rather than impede their economic and social cohesion with the rest of the European citizens."
"The internal market and the rules that govern it do not benefit the outermost regions to the same extent that they benefit Europeans on the continent."
"The natural limitations of our island markets, thousands of kilometres away, mean that our businesses have difficulty being competitive: problems with transport, communications, supplies, running costs."
"This is why we have so many problems generating wealth and creating employment."
"Our unemployment levels are among the highest in the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary to implement a series of measures which Margie Sudre' s report covers in detail."
"In our view these measures need to go beyond regional development policies, because our shortfalls and handicaps are structural, not temporary."
"We will always be far away and we will always have difficulties because of the fact that we are islands and because of our landscape, which is beautiful but also harsh and difficult to overcome."
"We are not asking for subsidies."
"We want to have tools that will enable us to develop."
"The outermost regions bring Atlantic, American and African dimensions to Europe, which enrich our cultural, political and economic diversity, of which we are all rightly proud."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Sudre, we must bear in mind that the opportunity for us to debate here in this House today on the subject of the outermost regions is the result of a process of slow maturation."
"The fact is, even though, as early as the Treaty of Rome, reference was made to the French overseas departments, we had to wait until 1989 and the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of these regions, the notorious POSEI programmes, for the European Union to at long last acknowledge that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps affecting the outermost regions justified special treatment in comparison with the other regions of the Community."
"Eight years later, the Treaty of Amsterdam with its Article 299(2), the subject of our discussion today, gave rise to the hope that one day the terms 'growth' and 'employment' would mean the same thing throughout all European territory."
"So, it has been a long wait, and the hopes expressed by our peoples have built up throughout this long wait."
"I therefore feel entitled to confess that I felt rather disappointed when I read the Commission communication."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the time for stating good intentions is behind us, what we need is practical action and we need it now."
"We need a specific timetable, one that will be respected."
"We need real financial commitments, not, as we have in the 2001 budget, POSEI appropriations that, at the moment, have been cut by 25%."
"Most especially we need guarantees that this action will continue in the long term, because the handicaps of these regions, as listed in Article 299(2) - remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult climate - are not about to disappear."
"I am therefore pleased that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted a bold and ambitious stance on state aid, tax schemes and the implications of enlargement."
"I am pleased to see that the committee has adopted the bulk of the amendment I tabled."
"I should, moreover, like to pay tribute, at this point, to the rapporteur, Mrs Sudre, for her open-mindedness and her consultative approach, which made it possible, with everyone joining forces, to successfully complete a report which offers our regions real hope."
"Indeed I am convinced that the young people of our regions can actually glimpse a way out of the tragic unemployment which so drives them to despair, if we do manage to shift from a basically financial strategy, necessary, admittedly, but inadequate, to a more comprehensive strategy based on real recognition of our unique characteristics."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the outermost regions are already the very emblem of the diversity, and hence the wealth of the European Union."
"Tomorrow they may become a laboratory providing the finest illustration of the effectiveness of the experiment of the European social model."
"We need audacity, intelligence and compassion."
"I have no doubt but that the proposals which the Commission will submit to the Council will be characterised by these qualities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Sudre for her excellent and very successful report."
"At the same time I bring greetings from Mr Sánchez, who would have liked to be here at this debate, but has not been able to attend yet, owing to illness."
"He has always stressed the importance of this report and worked hard in its favour."
"The European Union must see to it that the outermost regions are involved in the Union' s development."
"Adapted action, which is meant to support the outermost regions, is justified as a result of the unfavourable conditions that prevail in these areas."
"This is especially the case when the regions in question are very dependent on just a few or even just one source of livelihood."
"In talks between the European Union and external countries and international organisations attention must also be given to the special sensitivity associated with certain products in remote regions."
"Neither may EU enlargement be allowed to cause these regions to fall outside the sphere of influence of regional and structural policy."
"Our group is also in favour of broadening the scope of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which will strengthen the positive achievements of the POSEI programmes in remote areas."
"Owing to permanent unfavourable factors the special status accorded remote regions and the special assistance they should receive are justified, although differences should not be evened out by means of permanently defined versions of Internal Market rules and permanent entitlement to structural funding."
"In my opinion, it is very important that the outermost regions are integrated into the trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks."
"It is also necessary to look into the possibilities of new measures targeted at remote areas that would complement the policies and actions at present being implemented within the European Union' s own area."
"The economic development of the regions must be supported through, for example, various direct and indirect taxation solutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as Mrs Sudre rightly emphasises in her very commendable and extensive report, it is indisputable that the outermost regions have five characteristics which put them at a permanent or very long-lasting disadvantage."
"Firstly, their geographical proximity to non-EU States and simultaneous membership of the European Union. Secondly, their relative isolation because of their great distance from Europe."
"This inevitably leads to a situation in which these objective handicaps can, also in the longer term, only be offset, with a view to achieving cohesion, when the necessary financial resources are made available on the basis of Article 299, paragraph 2."
"Through this article, the outermost regions should be so placed as not to be subject to permanent reductions in their budgets as a result of the Budget debate."
"Just as you, Mrs Sudre, as the representative of the outermost regions, rightly call for solidarity, I would also request solidarity on your part where the interests of the Objective 1 regions are concerned, in the sense that no reductions in funds should be implemented for as long as the regions concerned are still handicapped in comparison with the developed regions of Europe."
"The proof of the pudding is whether, in contrast to the agreement on how best to proceed expressed by most of the groups today in the Budget debate, we want to meet new political necessities not with new money but at the expense of policies which have still not been implemented."
"This question will become that much more relevant the closer EU enlargement towards the East becomes."
"I am convinced that it is now already clear that, without a change to the Financial Perspective, it will not be possible to solve this problem."
"Allow us simply to act according to the proverb, 'Do not put off till tomorrow what you can do today.'"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament is helping by means of this report to relaunch a policy for the outermost regions, as laid down in Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"The hesitations and the occasional contradiction we have seen in the Commission' s action in this field recently would therefore be at odds with this."
"All of the Treaty' s articles must be complied with and all of them must be guaranteed effective implementation. Article 299(2) can be no exception."
"There are therefore grounds for commending the position adopted by the European Parliament and to praise the balance, competence and experience demonstrated by the rapporteur, Mrs Sudre, and the contribution made by all those who worked together with her, particularly the other seven Members from the outermost regions."
"Because I am under pressure of time, I will try to highlight the fundamental aspects of the report."
"I feel that as well as promoting the fairness that underpins changes in policy, systems of derogation and specific measures, in other words dealing in the same way with things that are the same and differently with things that are different, the important thing is that in my region, as in the other outermost regions, people should be able to live in dignity. This requires involvement in productive activities that guarantee a growing degree of self-sufficiency."
"Since the economy of the outermost regions is classed in Article 299(2) of the Treaty itself as being dependent on a single product or on a limited range of products, we must provide incentives for potential diversification and, at the same time, create better conditions for producing what people actually have the means and the ability to produce."
"What cannot, under any circumstances, be allowed to happen is that we help to eradicate the few comparative advantages that we have."
"In the Azores, our main product is milk."
"If we are to take Article 299(2) of the Treaty seriously, I can only hope for an improvement in our framework for producing what we actually have the means and the ability to produce."
"Mr President, Parliament, and in particular its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has been the driving force for approving specific policies and programmes for the outermost regions."
"The unanimous approval by the members of the Committee on Regional Policy of the report presented by Mrs Sudre demonstrates the European Parliament' s adherence to one of its most important commitments."
"I should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy on their excellent work."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the legal basis of these specific policies was established and their scope was increased."
"One of the areas in which this approach has had the greatest impact is agricultural policy."
"By means of various partial derogations from the principles of the CAP, and through the implementation of specific programmes for agricultural development, we have been able to see an end to the desertification of archipelagos such as the Azores. Those living in rural communities on the islands have also seen an improvement in their living conditions."
"The experience of almost a decade and the new challenges created by developments in the common agricultural policy suggest that these programmes should be revised in order to sustain the ability of these regions to survive in the new climate of competition."
"The Treaty specifically stipulates that economic dependence on a small number of products is one of the factors on which the European institutions are bound to adopt specific measures for the implementation of common policies."
"The dependence of agriculture and the whole economy of the Azores on milk production is unparalleled anywhere else in the Union."
"All of us in the Azores therefore hope that the Commission, in view of the Treaty and in view of Parliament' s position, will rapidly propose the necessary changes to the way the CAP is implemented in the Azores."
"Mr President, Commissioner, had the Treaty of Amsterdam not included Article 299(2), we would not be here today, debating this excellent report by Mrs Sudre, whom I wish to congratulate on her outstanding work."
"This legislation really is of considerable importance."
"Under this article, the outermost regions obtained recognition by the European Union of a genuine right to be different, a right to be dealt with on a specific and special basis reflecting their unique situation, a situation that is completely different to that of the rest of the European Union."
"This is now recognised legally and constitutionally and no longer, as was the case until Amsterdam, simply through declarations annexed to the Treaties, which had merely political status."
"It should be noted that this right to be different is nothing more than a demonstration of the principle of equality, which also requires different treatment for anything that is different."
"I reject reactionary and populist interpretations of the principle of equality, which seek equal treatment for things that are not the same."
"Article 299(2) is therefore a crucial instrument in various way: firstly, in helping to promote equal opportunities for European citizens who are resident in the outermost regions."
"Thirdly, this article is crucial to enabling the outermost regions to respond better to the challenges posed by globalisation and by the enlargement of the European Union, to which they are particularly vulnerable. This is the only reason we want Article 299(2), not in order to secure any privileged status for ourselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the qualitative leap represented by Article 299(2) must be matched by an identical qualitative step forward in the special treatment that the European Union must give to the outermost regions. Furthermore, this must go beyond POSEI, the Programme of Options Specific to Remoteness and Insularity."
"This qualitative leap must be reflected in the definition and implementation of a global and coherent strategy by the European Union, which is what Mrs Sudre' s report has rightly proposed."
"The outermost regions and the citizens who live there have high hopes for the European institutions' action in implementing Article 299(2)."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Sudre."
"I think that she has done a magnificent job and also that she has shown imagination, calm and a capacity to reach agreements and compromises in order to present a document to this Parliament and to the Commission which I think can be useful and effective."
"Commissioner, I think that you are perfectly aware of, and sensitive to, these issues, due to the fact that you come from a region with specific problems."
"There are three regions in Europe whose citizens face specific problems: mountain, island and the outermost regions."
"These citizens enjoy a positive and enriching diversity, and they demand to be given the right to enjoy the same opportunities as other citizens from continental regions."
"For this they need specific treatment, which is expressed through a will for durability in the series of measures."
"We cannot debate a whole series of circumstances and imagine that, once that ideal and idyllic point, let us call it, has been reached, it will no longer be necessary to adopt more measures for the treatment of these three areas and particularly of the outermost regions that we are discussing today."
"We want different treatment to be maintained."
"We want to continue to be an area - or areas, in this case - that requires specific treatment."
"The European Union and you, Commissioner, need to be aware that this treatment is worth sustaining."
"This is the message that I wanted to put across, as well as once again congratulating Mrs Sudre and all the members of the various committees, which have enabled us to get as far as this report today."
"Thank you, Mr President, and thank you to each and everyone of you, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, for the contribution you have made to this debate, although it is so late in the day."
"I think it extremely important for the European Union as a whole, quite apart from the obvious interest it has for every man and every woman resident in our seven outermost regions."
"I should like to thank you, Minister Sudre, for the quality of your report and its candour."
"It is a document which my team and I feel is full of ideas and proposals, which goes to the heart of the issues and does not dodge any of the areas of concern of the peoples of the outermost communities."
"In some way, here in Strasbourg you have managed to express the concerns of these remote regions - which does not happen all that often - which of course suffer from the handicaps related to their remote position and distance, compounded, for most of them, by their island nature, and other often difficult geographical or economic conditions, but these are factors which may also prove to be assets."
"For I have always thought and continue to think, as you yourself have said, Mrs Sudre, that these regions can, and indeed wish to, play the role of the active frontier of the European Union at the centre of the Atlantic, next to the Americas or in the middle of the Indian Ocean."
"I should next like to make one comment on your report, to say that its underlying political line is, broadly speaking, that currently adopted by the Commission."
"Let me firstly outline our overall approach to the subject of the outermost regions and then discuss the work currently being undertaken by the Commission to put this approach into practice."
"Regarding the Commission' s approach, as Mr Fruteau put it earlier, speaking of a process of slow maturation, if I have noted your own words correctly, the Commission was behind the policy for the outermost regions and also the various programmes - Poseidom, Poseica, Poseima (Programmes of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the French overseas departments, of the Canary Islands, and of Madeira and the Azores) - which launched this."
"In this undertaking, the Commission has always been, and continues to be, supported by Parliament, both in the legislative process - ladies and gentlemen, there are at least 700 legislative acts on these regions - and in the lengthy task of grass-roots implementation."
"Mr Fernández Martín, whom I must thank, quite rightly stated the results obtained thereby in practical terms."
"The report we issued in March sums the situation up."
"Yet, Parliament, just like the Commission, has realised that, as the Community was developing, the Community approach had to be consolidated as far as these regions were concerned."
"Consequently, on the occasion of the preparations for the previous Intergovernmental Conference, they backed the negotiations which - I remember this clearly as I was the French negotiator for the Treaty of Amsterdam at the time - led to Article 299(2) being adopted."
"This article, ladies and gentlemen, although it does not enable us to do everything, at least allows us to step up or action, and I believe it is necessary to expand and improve our schemes."
"Let us not, however, forget that Article 299(2) also states that the coherence of the Community legal order and the unity of the internal market must not be undermined."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, means that we, that is, you and I, must find a balance between complying with general regulation and adapting policy to the specific needs of the outermost regions."
"We must somehow find a way to ensuring, as Mr Marques has just mentioned, equal opportunities for all citizens, but do so by finding the middle ground between the two requirements I have just mentioned, i.e. adapting policy to the regions which need it and compliance with the common rules mentioned in Article 299."
"This balance, ladies and gentlemen, must be sought initially on a case-by-case basis."
"Let me give one example of this."
"Your report, Mrs Sudre, quite rightly stresses the need to take long-term action."
"Just now Mr Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya also stressed the importance of the long-term nature or the continuation of measure undertaken, precisely because of the long-term nature of the handicaps."
"What is the situation in this respect?"
"A number of measures, such as the POSEI agricultural regulations have no fixed time limit."
"However, in many areas, such as taxation or customs, for instance, the coherence of Community legislation and the unity of the internal market dictate that there are time limits, even if they are reasonably long, preferably with a mid-term assessment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report we issued on 14 March 2000 outlines a strategy which will, I believe, enable the European Union to make a more effective contribution to sustainable development in these outermost regions and thereby to implement Article 299(2) in practical terms."
"This coherent overall strategy should, we feel, enable the qualitative leap forward, which your report, Minster, demands."
"This strategy is based on three major aspects."
"Support for traditional areas of production, agriculture and fisheries."
"That is the first point. Support for revival, modernisation, and the diversification of economic activities by the better coordinated and better targeted use of the Community instruments available to us."
"That is the second aspect. And finally, reinforcing cooperation with the countries located around these outermost regions, in their own geographical and political environment."
"That is the third point. But what should lead to real progress is the combination and coordination of each of these aspects, the coherence of this overall strategy."
"Earlier Mrs Sudre mentioned, in a moment of concern, as it were, what she described as some kind of reluctance or hesitation on the part of the Commission."
"I should like to tell her, and we know each other quite well now that I have been a Commissioner for just a little more than a year, that I have fully understood that in order to make progress and to proceed successfully - and you can count on me to support this movement - we must take things one step at a time."
"Our report of 14 March was one such necessary step."
"I was, moreover, given to understand that even though it did not necessarily provide immediate answers to all the problems, it did still meet with a relatively positive and constructive response in each of the outermost regions. We needed to have this report."
"I personally needed to have this report within the College of Commissioners in order to build on it and develop the next stages successfully."
"I do, however, understand your comments, Mrs Sudre, as a sort of message intended to reinforce the political will of the Commission."
"Indeed, when the time comes, it will be necessary, moreover, to offer the Council the same support and the same message."
"Just how, ladies and gentlemen, is the Commission to implement this approach?"
"Generally speaking, I can inform you that work is proceeding normally."
"In terms of drawing up the necessary proposals, the Commission is, obviously, working in collaboration with the Member States and regions concerned."
"Although this approach and this collaborative work are constructive, we have nonetheless occasionally had to wait, and in some instances we are still waiting, for the detailed requests, and indeed the additional information required in order to adopt a position and draw up our own proposals."
"In Feira, we reported back on the progress of work and we shall, of course, do the same at the European Council in Nice."
"Mrs Sudre' s report mentions several of these files, and I would like to give you the actual details of the current state of progress."
"In the field of agriculture, we are preparing the reform of the implementing regulations for measures under the POSEI programmes."
"Our objective is, as you advocate, to improve Community support for production as well as for supply."
"This is the follow-up to extensive consultation with the States and regions concerned."
"We are working to ensure that these proposals can be presented this autumn."
"On the subject of agriculture, permit me to address the two Members of Parliament who represent in this House a region which I have learnt to know and love, the Azores, as that is where I made my first official visit as a Commissioner."
"Mr Costa Neves and Mr Casaca, you mentioned the traditional area of production in your region, milk production."
"I have understood the special issue of milk quotas in the Azores."
"I would like to tell you frankly that when we received notification of this current problem it was already too late to serve any useful purpose."
"It was not therefore included in the programme presented by the Commission in March."
"The Commission is nonetheless aware of this problem for the Azores, and I can confirm, having seen it myself, that milk is virtually the only form of production there."
"It is not, however, possible to increase the quote or to exempt the Azores from paying additional levies for exceeding these quotas."
"Your country, Portugal, has asked the Commission to look into this matter in the light of Article 299(2)."
"The inquiry by our departments has not, as yet, been concluded."
"That is all I had to say on this topical problem which you both, quite legitimately, pointed out."
"In the field of the common fisheries policy, as Mrs Attwooll mentioned, the main initiatives will instead come during the next year. I wish to point out, nonetheless, that there is currently an extensive discussion project in progress."
"As for the revival of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in a number of key areas."
"In July, the Commission adopted an important decision on the modification of the guidelines on state aid for regional purposes, it is now possible to authorise aid to compensate the costs due to the conditions of the outermost regions."
"This is a significant point, and a positive one, even if this aid is not degressive or time-limited."
"I feel that this is a proper response to a demand often expressed by all these regions."
"Please allow me now to say a word or two as the Commissioner in charge of a significant part of the Structural Funds through regional policy."
"They play a key role."
"The amount allocated under Objective 1 for the outermost regions is, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, being increased for this new period, 2000-2006, to EUR 8.077 billion."
"This is an increase of 70% over the previous period and, quite frankly, Mr Fruteau, since you were the one hoping and praying for practical action, here is one such. I know it is not the only one you were expecting, the only one you need, but here is at least one action, and one which we shall, moreover, have to justify to the European Parliament and to everyone with an interest in regional development."
"After a 70% increase, with EUR 8 billion, we shall have to ensure that we use the money well, and that is a challenge which is not as easy as it sounds, use it effectively for the benefit, and in the service, the people, local projects, the citizens, economic, social and human development, local democracy, use it taking into account the new regulation of the Structural Funds, i.e. in a disciplined and transparent way, ensuring genuine partnership with all those that can take part in this good management, and, naturally, respecting time limits."
"This regulation on time limits, which is very strict since the general regulation following Berlin, is, of course, as applicable here as it is everywhere."
"Mr Markov, in all sincerity, when I quote figures, it is quite clear that we are a long way from the reduction you seemed to fear earlier. I fully understand that when you referred to the future prospects related to enlargement - and I shall come to this later - you were referring not only to the situation for the outermost regions but also for the Objective 1 regions."
"In all sincerity, right now and for the seven-year period which is just beginning, 2000-2006, we are a long way from any sort of reduction."
"This significant and sizeable but necessary amount, which is justified on the grounds of the state of economic development and the unemployment-related problems in these regions, will furthermore be padded out with appropriations from the four Community initiatives, Urban, Leader, Interreg and Equal."
"These considerable amounts, ladies and gentlemen, are not just the expression of our solidarity with these regions, out of fairness - I would reiterate this as it is something I believe - but are also the recognition of the key role they can and must play as outposts on - to use your own expression, Minister - the active frontiers of the European Union in the regions where they are located."
"Moreover, in the next few days, I shall have the opportunity to sign, on behalf of the Commission, several regional programmes which are, or are going to be, definitively approved in the coming days: the Single Programming Document for Réunion, in the form of written procedures which have been all but completed, the SPDs for three other French overseas departments - Martinique, Guadeloupe and French Guiana."
"As you know, the SPDs for Madeira and the Azores, were signed on 28 July."
"The only one remaining is the SPD for the Canaries which is currently being negotiated. That is what I have to report concerning the practical implementation of regional policy programming and the considerable funds associated to these."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is moreover preparing initiatives to amend some of the terms regulating the Structural Funds with a view to making them yet more effective with regard to the outermost regions by making it easier to harness Community aid for the economic operators."
"I know that these are long awaited initiatives. In your speeches you mentioned your fears that the Commission was being too reluctant or too hesitant."
"We feel absolutely no reluctance or hesitation."
"Please believe me when I say that, in my position, I adopt an extremely constructive and open-minded approach to working with my colleagues."
"It is not always an easy matter to make the practical progress in these initiatives that you expect to see."
"I needed the document issued on 14 March as a basis to work on and also, ladies and gentlemen, in order to progress, and indeed make rapid progress, I now need to ensure that there is proper legal certainty."
"This is not a completely obvious point which can be disregarded, even in the interpretation of Article 299(2)."
"This discussion will moreover continue beyond the initiatives we are going to take in the weeks to come, in the second cohesion report which, as you ask, will assess the impact of enlargement on regional disparities."
"This report, which I shall be coming to present to you personally next spring will be the starting point for a major debate on future regional policy and future cohesion policy for the period 2006-2013."
"In this debate, I should like to see special attention continuing to be given to the development of the outermost regions."
"I have a lasting commitment to aid and support for these regions, and therefore understand, ladies and gentlemen, the concern expressed, here and there, in your regions and also in the Objective 1 regions, which I visit regularly, regarding the challenge of enlargement."
"Earlier, Mr Pohjamo, you yourself mentioned this anxiety, echoing the work and the commitment of Mr Sanchez, and let me at this point ask you to convey our wishes for a speedy recovery to him, given his current health problems."
"Mr Markov also raised this issue."
"Enlargement is not something to be afraid of."
"Overall, it is a challenge we must accept in the interests of the European Union, and its stability for the continent of Europe, peace and democracy, and even to ensure the smooth running of the internal market, giving it new opportunities."
"Of course, enlargement is not something that can be achieved just any old how at any old time. There are rules."
"We are working and making our own preparations, but, ladies and gentlemen, just because we are going to integrate some very poor regions in Eastern Europe into the European Union as of 2003 - and you know full well just how very impoverished they are - does not mean that, suddenly, because of enlargement, we shall think that poor regions in the West or the South, or impoverished outermost regions, have no more problems."
"In these regions, as we know, there are long-term problems and I therefore believe that, objectively, in accordance with their actual level of development, they need long-term support from regional policy and special measures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, now to an issue which was highlighted in particular by Mr Medina Ortega, a number of tax and customs matters are also currently being examined."
"Let me refer to those concerning the Canaries, the Azores and Madeira."
"I should also like to mention the French system of tax on rum in the French overseas departments."
"Let me assure you that the Commission is paying these issues great attention."
"In all these areas, let me reiterate, I consider that a great many initiatives can be taken very quickly and tabled before the Council prior to the meeting in Nice. This is in keeping, Mrs Sudre, with the wish expressed very recently by the President of the French Republic, the President-in-Office of the European Council and the Prime Minister of France."
"The Commission is also paying great attention to a number of other issues."
"I am thinking, Mr Medina Ortega, of a point you raised, the issue of transport, a point which has long been of interest to me, the matter of energy, renewable energies, energy sufficiency, and access to the various Community programmes."
"Most of all, however, I would like at this point to mention one point that is particularly important to the future of these regions."
"There is also the matter of the information society. These new technologies and this information society are, ladies and gentlemen, not just a luxury for the richest regions of Europe."
"Quite the opposite, I think that these new technologies, Internet access, and all the employment opportunities related to these are a great opportunity for the remote or outermost regions."
"That is why I personally strove to ensure that a significant part of the Structural Funds was dedicated to the information society, and access to this information society for farmers, small- and medium-sized businesses, and young people."
"The important thing now is that a good number of projects are presented under the SPDs, but also, alongside this grass-roots action, we must consider in depth the specific needs of each of the outermost regions in relation to access to the information society."
"What impact could this information society have on the development of your regions, particularly in the field of e-commerce, administration, distance education, telemedicine, whose very positive and very tangible effects I saw in the Azores?"
"The Commission has commissioned a report on this, which we shall receive by mid 2001."
"These results will be used towards a consultation debate, in partnership with national and regional authorities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the third aspect concerns the role of the regions in their own geographical areas."
"We have two concerns in this respect."
"The first is that their interests should, of course, be taken into account in negotiating the various trade agreements which we are called upon to sign."
"We are therefore going to initiate a study of the potential impact on the outermost regions of implementing the new ACP agreement."
"Then, as you yourselves advocate, we wish to stimulate cooperation between the outermost regions themselves and also between these regions and their geographical neighbours."
"Let me stress the fact that the Interreg III programme, which lies within my remit, provides the necessary resources for that, since I made it my business to ensure that strand B gives real priority, and also a great deal of money, to this type of regional cooperation."
"Finally, I should like to hark back to three major points raised in your report, Mrs Sudre."
"The first of these questioned what our future plans were, and asked for a multiannual programme."
"I should just like to explain the way the Commission sees matters."
"Our March report, as I have just said, laid down the broad lines of our strategy."
"We have undertaken, on this basis, to present annual action programmes, with timetables enabling us to gradually modulate our approach."
"We have already commissioned the Interdepartmental Group responsible for the outermost regions, to which a number of you have already paid tribute, to draw up the first programme for the year 2001."
"This group has also been assigned the task, and this is a response to another point in your report, of undertaking an ongoing examination of the various initiatives - according to one of your own recommendations - prepared by the Commission, in order to ensure that the legitimate interests of the outermost regions are taken into account across the board in all community policies."
"What is more, I check that this group is doing this properly on a monthly basis."
"The third point is to do with partnership between Europe, the States and the Regions."
"This partnership is a valued component in the policy for the outermost regions."
"It applies to practical examples, but should also enable a periodic exchange of overviews on all subjects of concern to these regions."
"A partnership day was held on 23 November 1999, in which many of us participated."
"It would again be possible to organise a meeting of this kind in 2001, by which time we shall have made more progress in carrying out the programme presented in March."
"In conclusion - with apologies if I have spoken too long, which I probably have, but these are important issues which I feel very strongly about - I should like to reiterate the last paragraph of the conclusions of our March report in order to stress the fact that, in our opinion, the future of these regions will be determined to a great extent by the success of the strategy which we have proposed in this report, but this success will also be extremely significant for the European Union as a whole, as it will have proven its capacity to successfully take on one of the most complex challenges that exist in Europe."
"That is all, ladies and gentlemen, except for one last word."
"I am actively working, together with my fellow Commissioners, for the initiatives which I mentioned on the basis of the March report."
"As a priority, I shall ensure that these initiatives are given shape very soon and that they, or the majority of them, can be presented in Nice."
"I shall then, with your participation, if you are willing, devote my attention to conducting the dialogue on European issues - and the future and the place of the outermost regions form part of these issues."
"At grass-roots level, as I started to do in the Azores, it is my intention in the coming months, as soon as the Intergovernmental Conference is over, to visit each of these regions in order to meet you, work with you, meet the civic, social, professional and political groupings and, also, as I regularly do, to discuss matters with the people of your regions."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Barnier."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like my name to be added to yesterday's attendance register."
"I can prove that I was also here for the roll-call vote, but I had not entered my name."
"Your name will be included, Mrs Rothe."
"Mr President, I wonder if this might be an appropriate time to mention an issue that arose yesterday during voting time."
"It will be recalled that there was one particular vote in the plenary session on my report that was resolved by a majority of one vote."
"I do not want to reopen that issue."
"The Presidency declared that closed and I fully accept that."
"But following that decision a whole range of Members in this House began to indicate that machines had not worked and so on."
"It has occurred to me overnight that if the result of a vote is declared and there is within the Rules no provision for the issue to be reopened at all, given the alarming frequency with which a whole range of machines do not work, this could create serious difficulties."
"If there were a technical difficulty and a whole block of votes in one part of this House were not counted, the outcome of the votes would call into question the whole efficacy of the decisions that we make."
"I wonder whether in fact there should be some provision in the Rules for that."
"I hope that you will feel that is a genuine point of order."
"I remember the situation perfectly, Mr Evans. We will put the matter to the Bureau."
"I will, of course, inform the President of what you have said."
"Mr President, parallel to that point of order could it be also borne in mind that the interpreters are very kind to us and sometimes they do not translate ""my machine failed to work"" as ""I failed to work""."
"Mr President, I rise on a matter concerning the meeting today of the College of Commissioners, under Rule 38 or 64."
"I would like to request that Commissioner Lamy makes an emergency statement to this House as to why he is avoiding parliamentary scrutiny on a paper known as ""everything but arms""."
"This has profound implications for this House, for ACP countries and for Europe as a whole."
"I say profound implications because this House wants more and more democratic accountability."
"This particular issue will not only affect this House, but most of the European Member States, particularly those that have such products as bananas - which are very topical - rice and sugar."
"Mr Lamy should make this statement today to make sure that we do have democratic accountability."
"It appears that he has no wish to discuss this issue with Parliament."
"It is of great importance."
"Mr President, Mr Evans has just referred to yesterday morning' s vote, specifically to the vote at which certain amendments were adopted by a majority of one."
"I believe it is as well for Parliament to keep to the current Rules because, as another Member rightly said, very often it is not the machines that did not work but the Members that forgot to vote; if we were able to correct a vote after the event, we would never see the end of it."
"We had a good example in the final vote on Mr Evans' report."
"If I had known that the total number of abstentions and votes against was going to be greater than the number of votes in favour of Mr Evans' report, I would have asked my Group to vote against that report and it would not have been adopted."
"So you can see how absurd the situation would become if a vote could be reconsidered, and I think we would be well advised to go on abiding by our Rules as they stand."
"In any case, ladies and gentlemen, we will discuss the matter at the next Bureau meeting."
"Mr President, I just wanted to clarify, for Mr Goebbels' benefit, that I am not raising an issue about individual Members pointing out problems in relation to just their machine or whatever."
"I am concerned about the possibility of a general failure of numerous machines and rules which would then call the decisions of the House into question."
"Let me also assure Mr Goebbels that I do not object to matters being decided by a majority of one."
"The British Labour Government was defeated by a majority of one in 1979 and I never objected to that."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Food safety"
"The next item is the report (A5-0272/2000) by Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the Commission White Paper on food safety [COM(1999) 719 - C5-0136/2000 - 2000/2082(COS)]."
"Mr President, I beg to move the adoption of the report in my name on the White Paper on food safety."
"It gives me great pleasure to do so. I should also like to refer to the 19 amendments we have before us on this report."
"I accept 16 of them."
"The three that I do not accept are Amendments Nos 14, 16 and 17, and I prefer 15 to 5 and 10 to 6."
"As Feuerbach said: ""der Mensch ist, was er isst"", man is what he eats."
"We are what we eat - and sadly that is true in my case."
"I am clearly what I eat."
"More seriously, as a result of eating badly some people suffer long-term illness and indeed some people die of food poisoning their bodies."
"Over recent decades we have seen many scandals: olive oil, contaminated wine, mineral water, beef, dioxins and sludge."
"We have learned the new vocabulary of e-coli, salmonella and listeria and so on."
"We have had scare and scandal leading to fear, panic and public enquiry."
"Our constituents around Europe look to us to reassure them that the food they eat is safe and the water they drink is drinkable."
"They have lost faith in the current machinery and mechanisms to control and remove risk from ""farm to table"", in the phrase that is so often used."
"The truth is that you cannot eliminate risk."
"That is not within our grasp."
"Risk will always occur from animal feed and crop sprays of agriculture to the processing of food, transport, refrigeration, storage and retailing."
"And then the risk goes on to our own home, our kitchens, our larders and to our cooking skills and habits in those kitchens."
"If we cannot eliminate risk, we can at least take action to identify it and manage it."
"New action is needed."
"We must put into place a framework of legislation, guidance and good practice on food, feed, pesticides, dioxins, labelling, additives, novel foods and so on."
"Alongside that framework we need a new body to restore public confidence and the respect of Member States."
"My report proposes the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency which should be authoritative, independent, objective, accountable, transparent and intelligible."
"Its focus must be on safety and its method must be science. Its task is risk assessment and then giving advice on that risk management."
"The Commission's task is risk management and control."
"Parliament's task will be the scrutiny and monitoring of both."
"We have a rapid alert system."
"That needs to be improved but it can only be swiftly accountable to Parliament if it continues to be run by the Commission."
"Nevertheless it should be physically and operationally close to the EFSA."
"Its remit should be extended to cover feedstuffs as well as foodstuffs."
"The director of the ESFA is key."
"His appointment must be by the Commission, but after a hearing by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, probably involving other committees such as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"There needs to be an annual report and presentation to Parliament and risk reports coming to the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"The board needs to reflect the range of relevant experience in production, processing, retailing, consumption, law and so on."
"Scientists need to give a report on assessment to the board who then makes sure that it is in terms the consumers understand, add any recommendations on risk management and submit it to the Commission and to us."
"We need close working with national food safety authorities and with international bodies."
"We need to see the work of the current five scientific committees and the Steering Committee subsumed within this."
"It will be within a small headquarters, professionally run, accessible to the Commission and Parliament, although the site is not for now."
"I thank my colleagues of all parties and all Member States."
"I thank them for the constructive dialogue we have had."
"I thank the Commission and its staff."
"I thank the Council and the French Presidency for their messages of support."
"I thank Parliament's secretariat."
"We have here a proposal which can work to improve the safety of our foods, to restore the confidence of the public in our respective nations."
"I hope that Parliament will endorse it."
"(Applause)"
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, it is difficult not to agree with this document presented to us by the Commission, as it is full of good ideas and good intentions."
"The rapporteur, Mr Bowis, has drawn up a superb report, which highlights the importance of an excellent, independent food authority, which would have responsibility for risk assessment, but not for risk management or crisis management, which must be the competence of the Commission, as must legislative proposals."
"Both this food authority and the legislative proposals being proposed, which aim to guarantee food safety, will receive the support of this House, Commissioner."
"But I would like to draw attention to a fundamental issue: the best possible legislation and an excellent, scientifically unimpeachable food authority are not enough."
"We may have other food crises and, each time this happens, consumer safety will be endangered, as will the credibility of the institutions and the interests of the agricultural sector and the agri-foodstuffs industry."
"And, what is more, if crisis management is inadequate, the problem uncontrollably spreads and worsens."
"Food safety is not an ancillary issue: it affects public health and the stability of the food market."
"I therefore ask the Commission what it plans to do in order to make the objectives of the White Paper reality."
"Recent experience has shown that the series of crises is not due to a lack of scientific knowledge nor to a lack of ad hoc legislation."
"The problem has been that somebody has been dishonest and has continued to be so due to inadequate controls."
"Such was the case with the company that manufactured polio vaccines in the United Kingdom using bovine foetal serum, prohibited since 1999, and with the distribution via a French agri-foodstuffs distribution chain of one thousand kilos of meat from herds contaminated with BSE."
"All in all, Commissioner, along with the authority, the relevant Commission services must, in collaboration and coordination with the Member States, establish a system of efficient, standardised controls throughout the food chain, and the network of food laboratories in the European Union must be improved and their work coordinated with the Commission."
"I assure you that this is the best method, as it is preventative."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal and the report by Mr Bowis deserve our unqualified support. Food must be safe and must be pure."
"We must be certain that the carcasses of BSE cows do not end up in the food chain."
"We must be able to rely on the fact that salmonella is being tackled."
"But that confidence is being shattered time after time."
"The more than eighty measures from the White Paper are therefore indispensable."
"Setting up the European Food Safety Agency is a major step in the right direction."
"Its key task is providing scientific advice, for the discussion on food safety must be pure too."
"Emotions run high where food is concerned: against globalisation, large-scale production and genetic modification, and in favour of local produce, tradition and diversity."
"Those emotions are often justified, but we must ensure that they do not become a cover for protectionism."
"Whilst acknowledging the boom in ready-made food, we must also adopt a pro-active approach."
"The new food must be of quality, the ingredients traceable, and labels must offer honest information."
"Consumers deserve a choice."
"The food authority must provide objective information to both consumers and decision makers."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would like to highlight a few points."
"Decision-making must be clear and transparent."
"As duplication of the work and of scientific research must be avoided, we need to collaborate with national research institutes and the joint research centres."
"In addition, food safety is a matter for the entire food sector, from the farmer right down to the consumer."
"Sound communication between consumers, producers, the retail trade, workers and transporters is crucial."
"So is attention to diversity in the SMEs."
"Strict requirements and effective control are indispensable, but competition should be kept clean in the process."
"Finally, my Committee argues in favour of a strategy for third countries and candidate countries."
"Food safety is a global task; we should not cut ourselves off from produce from the United States or developing countries."
"We must work towards a joint agenda."
"I would just like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his willingness to take on board the recommendations from other Committees."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has carefully considered the White Paper on food safety."
"It reached conclusions similar to those of the committee responsible."
"We also agree with the Commission's acknowledgement that in the interest of the public, food safety should be given particularly high priority."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights accordingly made a raft of proposals which are also included in the Bowis report before us."
"In view of the limited time available, I propose to cover just two key points."
"First, there is no doubt that legal provisions in the field of food safety and animal feed safety need to be simplified."
"We are therefore looking to the European Commission to put forward a basic legal framework."
"Within this framework, the corresponding legal instruments need to be systematically put in place in such a way that health protection stands out as the most important objective."
"Second, the European public are right to demand that their health be given top priority."
"Furthermore, they are right to demand that they have an important say, through their Parliament, when food and animal feed safety with a view to protecting their health is at stake."
"That is why the envisaged European Food Safety Agency can only have Articles 95 and 152 of the EC Treaty as its legal basis, with special attention being paid to its powers."
"Mr President, let me begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, and let me also inform the Commissioner, David Byrne, that we appreciate the proposals he has put before us in this White Paper and the relations he has established with Parliament with a view to preparing the best possible legislation in the field of food safety for the future."
"Today we are discussing a White Paper and it is useful to define a few first principles."
"I think we have to be very specific about the role of the future European Food Safety Agency, which is to assess and identify risks in coordination with the existing national agencies."
"We must make it clear, however, that the rapid alert system and the implementation of the measures must fall within the field of political responsibility."
"That is where the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament come into play."
"The second principle is that it is important for this Agency to be highly independent and we must guarantee that independence."
"It is therefore vital to allow the EFSA to act on its own initiative."
"It must be independent with regard to the Member States, the European institutions and the agro-food industry."
"I have tabled an amendment on levels of risk. I have also had an opportunity to discuss this with Commissioner David Byrne."
"In some cases we find that the public perceives or imagines risks where these are simply rumours, and it is our duty and responsibility to communicate with the public in order to lay these rumours to rest and restore consumer confidence."
"When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle."
"Lastly, in the event of a real risk, we must take urgent preventative measures."
"To conclude, the brief of the European Food Safety Agency must be confined to food safety."
"There is no question of extending it to cover product quality or labelling."
"We must not confuse food risk assessment with questions of product quality."
"At all events, the European Parliament and the European Commission are firmly resolved to restore consumer confidence."
"Mr President, quite often a parliamentary colleague is given a report and you envy him or her."
"By the time the report is presented you envy them no more."
"That is not the case with Mr Bowis."
"He has carried this whole debate through with considerable elegance, charm and willingness to compromise, which is why the committee was able to adopt 12 compromise amendments, supported by almost all the political groups."
"We have a stark reminder this week of why we are all here and why this legislation is going through in the report in my own country - the Phillips Committee of Inquiry into the disaster, indeed scandal, of BSE."
"That came about in our national herd because of negligence and the indictment against those responsible, civil servants as well as ministers, will be set out for the world to see tomorrow."
"It will not be a day when we look with any particular pride at the procedures we then had."
"Those procedures have now been amended and changed and we have our own Food Standards Agency."
"To have such a body introduced in the European Parliament as part of a raft of similar measures, which will increase our concern and care for food safety in the European Union, is a good outcome to what has been a sad tale."
"I will mention briefly the key amendments which I commend to the House and the Commissioner and which I hope we can see voted through today."
"Obviously the title is important and Mr Bowis has accepted that."
"This has to be called an ""authority"" because in English and most other languages, that conveys a body which has the power and ability from time to time in the process of risk assessment to use its best judgment and not merely to be the agent of what others would wish it to do."
"One of the amendments that was passed allowed it to issue own-initiative reports."
"On the still vexed question of how far we should go in allowing it to look at nutrition, and indeed to offer advice and to be consulted by those whose primary concern is risk management, we have also said that where the issue of safety is involved, these issues also should at least be within the remit of the opinion and the advice of this food standards authority."
"We have also said that the national food safety agencies and the consumer bodies in the Member States of the European Union should be fully consulted in the processes we are now embarked upon."
"That is because we need to carry right across the European Union the full support and weight of the public, the stakeholders and indeed, of course, the Member States for this authority."
"That means that they have to accept that the rapid alert system must be improved immediately and extended to animal feed."
"Yet again this week we have had another example, with infected beef in France finding its way on to the shelves of Carrefour, of how hard it is to catch those who have scant regard for food safety issues."
"We want the EFSA to have a board which has a balanced representation of people in consumer affairs, public health and all possible areas of scientific and agricultural knowledge."
"We want them to be people whom we can respect and who can declare their interest."
"Of course many of them will have had links with the food industry, links with science elsewhere."
"That is understandable and natural, but we need to know how and who and where and we should be able to do so."
"We want an annual report to this House and we want the director, when he or she is appointed, to be available to the Committee on the Environment and indeed the Agriculture Committee and to this House in general to report back."
"When that has happened I would say there is one last thing we must do."
"We must wait patiently for the Commission to come forward with legislation on other matters in the food safety area - PCB standards, food labelling, allergy labelling, action on nutrition policy and the amending legislation we need for processed baby foods and infant formulae."
"These things are inextricably linked with what the food authority will be doing."
"Finally, we will also be supporting a number of the new amendments, certainly Amendments Nos 11-13, 7-9 and we wish to have a free vote on Amendment No 14."
"We consider some of the others superfluous, but generally speaking the broad consensus there has been throughout in this House on this report should be carried through into the vote."
"Mr President, Mr Bowis has done an extraordinary job as rapporteur on this major and complicated issue."
"In fact, there are a whole lot of important and, on the face of it, conflicting objectives to be achieved in this matter of food safety, including that of safety itself."
"In this connection, I should like to speak up for cheap food of the kind which families with children buy and which children and young people eat."
"We are also concerned with the freedom to develop food and the food sector and also with the conservation of Europe' s cultural heritage."
"A central aspect of this is to ensure that the rich heritage of traditions can be preserved."
"I therefore want to give my support to Amendment No 15."
"I nonetheless believe that one issue has not been properly discussed, namely the need for uniform regulations to be followed up by uniform and thorough supervision."
"It should not be forgotten that, viewed as a whole, the food sector is the biggest workplace in the European Union."
"We must ensure that the regulations are complied with in the same way throughout the European Union."
"Otherwise, we interfere both with safety and free competition in the internal market."
"I should like to repeat this: ensure that the regulations are properly complied with, the length and breadth of the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ""der Mensch ist, was er isst"" , you are what you eat."
"Those, ladies and gentlemen, were indeed the first words I spoke in my maiden speech last year with reference to the Belgian dioxin crisis."
"Those are also the words with which Mr Bowis began his explanatory statement and speech in this Chamber."
"This is an immediate sign that Mr Bowis and myself, along with the Environmental Committee, are largely on the same wavelength, and I thank Mr Bowis for the very constructive collaboration of the past few months."
"I would like to make four observations."
"The report is right to draw a distinction between risk analysis on the one hand and risk management on the other."
"It is against this background that I would first of all like to say that food safety guarantees hinge on strict inspections organised by the state, and those inspections are only as strong as the weakest link."
"If the weakest link breaks, the inspection process will collapse like a house of cards."
"This means that all inspectorates must work together well and, often, insufficient attention is paid to the inspectorates which inspect animal medicines; this is the pharmaceutical inspectorate in my country."
"I also regret, therefore, that that inspectorate will hardly be involved - if at all - in the future operation of the European Food Safety Agency."
"After all, experience has taught us that ineffective inspection of animal medicines and ineffective inspection of the prescribing behaviour of vets can lead to scandals."
"So I would like to flag this up as an issue."
"Secondly, the Bowis report clearly states that the European Food Safety Agency is responsible for risk analysis."
"We should be very aware that this agency will only be a strong partner in the Food Safety Agency safety debate once it has acquired respectability in the course of the years."
"This respectability will be gained, not through laws or legislation, but through integrity, academic brilliance, neutrality, duty to be accountable, transparency and comprehensibility."
"I therefore urge that, when scientific opinions are being weighed up, minority viewpoints also be published each time."
"After all, science is not something static, it is ever fluid, and the debate on the six American hormones has been sufficient evidence of this."
"I also welcome the farm to fork approach."
"I would even go one step further and argue in favour of the seed to spoon approach."
"That means that when Food Safety Agency safety is examined, all products are taken into consideration, and I would refer to Paragraph 11 of the resolution in this connection."
"Fourthly, Parliament is right to highlight in Paragraph 17 that the rapid alert system must be extended to cover all food safety aspects, including animal feed. It is only right that we should call for the swift introduction of a positive list, Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is only the beginning; we have a long way to go yet."
"We must realise that consumers must regain their confidence in food and that is a fundamental human right."
"I hope that in the coming months and years, we will be closely monitoring the Commission during the implementation of the White Paper."
"Mr President, first of all, we too naturally support all the compromise and composite amendments jointly decided in the Committee on the Environment which, I trust, will be adopted by plenary."
"However, Mr President, I should like to highlight two points here."
"The subject which we are debating clearly illustrates just how superficial and empty our debate on the political unification of Europe is."
"This is no paradox."
"A real food safety agency will never get off the ground, unless of course it has strong political backing."
"Mr President, we are talking about legislation, initially about application, we are talking about responding to danger, about measures, policy changes and comparing imports - i.e. controlling the safety of products coming in from outside."
"My question is: who is going to do all this?"
"The national authorities?"
"But the crises which occurred in the past were generally covered up by the authorities in the Member State."
"Need I remind you of the United Kingdom's policy on BSE?"
"What agency is going to be able to exercise controls, carry out investigations and propose measures on behalf of the whole of the European Union?"
"I, to give a minor example, would love to know what the agency now being proposed would have done about the mad cow crisis in Britain, about the dioxin crisis in Belgium and about the genetically-modified cotton and foodstuffs, such as cotton seed oil, in Greece."
"Not much, I think."
"Unless this agency comes up to the standards which will give it political teeth, I do not think it will achieve much."
"The best case scenario is that it will work alongside the Environmental Agency, which does an excellent information job, but which freely admits that the environmental situation in Europe has not improved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is afflicted by serious public health crises at regular intervals."
"These crises, such as BSE and dioxin, have become a real problem for society and lead to a loss of consumer confidence in the food they eat."
"The latest events have brought that home to us again."
"The Member States have risen to the situation, like France, which has set up a national food safety agency."
"Today the European Commission is proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Agency, responsible for analysing all public health risks."
"Sound scientific knowledge is certainly essential to help assess the risks linked to the food chain, from the farm to the table."
"Any initiative to help identify these risks is therefore a move in the right direction."
"But is that not approaching the problem the wrong way round?"
"As it often does, the Commission is proposing regulatory measures to remedy or alleviate the adverse effects of a policy for which it is frequently jointly responsible, without in any way questioning its own basic approach."
"Thus, European requirements relating to traceability, which are good measures, have been made all the more necessary now that we have abandoned checks at our internal or Community borders."
"Similarly, the European Union is seeking to protect biodiversity and to safeguard ecosystems with its Directives on habitat and on birds, but without questioning the emphasis on high agricultural productivity, which, after all, we know to be the main cause, together with urbanisation, of imbalances in ecosystems."
"In fact it is precisely this emphasis on high productivity that exacerbates food safety risks: the specialisation of farms, most of which practice intensive farming, the need to fall in line with American market prices, and therefore to seek the lowest costs wherever possible, especially for animal feed, the transportation of animals, frequently across great distances, and the various components of the food chain from the farm to the table are all risk factors for public health, yet we prefer to cure the disease rather than prevent it occurring."
"That is a serious state of affairs."
"Nonetheless, under these circumstances, the European Food Safety Agency has an important part to play in conducting scientific risk analysis."
"But let us make sure we leave it to the Member States to manage these risks and to apply the precautionary principle in a reasonable and proportionate manner."
"That will be a guarantee of effectiveness."
"Indeed, who better than the Member States to carry out adequate local checks?"
"Who better than the Member States to distinguish genuinely dangerous products from those deriving from our different food cultures, even when they pose no health risk at all?"
"Anyway, there is no such thing as a zero risk, nor is it even desirable, given that completely aseptic conditions are no guarantee of food safety."
"Finally, who better than the Member States to inform the public of the risks linked to this or that product?"
"So let us entrust the European Food Safety Agency only with conducting scientific risk analysis, in liaison with our national agencies."
"Let us require excellence and independence of it."
"Let us ask it to make recommendations to the political authorities responsible for risk management."
"And let us not, therefore, give it responsibility for running the rapid alert system and for communication with the public."
"Lastly, we must beware of standardising our food cultures."
"Each of our countries, and especially France, is proud of its gastronomic culture and local products."
"That is one of the areas of diversity that makes up the richness of Europe and its quality of life."
"Let us guard it jealously."
"Mr President, it is clear that there is considerable enthusiasm for the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it."
"In the UK, as in many other countries, we have now set up our own agency amidst similar enthusiasm."
"It started work this year and many had high expectations of it."
"However, with the advent of Mr Byrne's ambitious proposals, it would seem that this national initiative is to be absorbed into the EU structures."
"In this, we are obliged to Mr Bowis."
"In his report he confirms the subordinate nature of the British agency when he remarks that ""It is essential that the Commission coordinates its various departments including . . . national food agencies."""
"As an aside, I must express my puzzlement about how a Conservative MEP can apparently embrace so easily the absorption of yet another British institution when his party stands on a platform of being opposed to further integration."
"This notwithstanding, it may come as a surprise to Members that I support the concept of a pan-European approach to food safety, which is embodied in the concept of the EFSA."
"Despite so often being branded as a ""little Englander"" by my British colleagues, I have no difficulty in acknowledging that germs know no boundaries."
"However, if germs fail to respect national boundaries, they will, and of course do, fail to respect EU borders."
"Thus, despite the enthusiasm for yet another EU agency, any effective control programme must look beyond the limited vision of a mere 15 states."
"It must take a wider perspective."
"In this we are fortunate."
"Since 1984 we have had the highly effective World Health Organisation's surveillance programme for the control of food-borne infections and intoxications in Europe, based in Berlin at the Von Ostertag-Institut."
"Interestingly, unlike the little Europeans who are so often behind this EU project, the WHO's concept of Europe originally embraced 32 countries, which included the former Soviet Union and has since expanded to include all countries from the Urals to the Atlantic, from Iceland to Israel."
"Not only does the WHO cover Europe it also has a wider remit across the whole planet and this is important."
"If one charts the progress of the main food-borne diseases which currently affect Europe, most actually made their first appearance in the Americas."
"For instance, to name but one, the recent threat of E. coli O157 probably emerged in South America."
"It then spread to the USA, then to Canada, thence to Australia and Japan, before significant outbreaks occurred in mainland Europe - the first one being in Germany."
"As a result, many of the control initiatives which have subsequently been adopted in Europe, have originated in other countries, particularly the USA."
"Risk assessment must start where the problems starts."
"Therefore, if one acknowledges the need for a transnational agency to bolster the efforts of individual agencies - and indeed I do - then any such agency should not only deal with Europe: it must have a global reach taking in global information."
"That is precisely what the WHO does for us: working with its regional organisations in a wholly integrated manner."
"This cannot be achieved by an EU organisation."
"Given that the WHO programme remains properly funded and supported, there would appear to be no need whatsoever for yet another agency, especially one with such a limited reach as the 15 Member States of the European Union."
"Food safety is far too important for it to become yet another excuse for EU integration."
"It displays the very worst of the European Union, because the perception is one of control freakery."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on food safety is a long overdue response to incidents like the BSE and dioxin crises, which deeply undermined consumers' sense of security and destroyed their confidence."
"I particularly want to comment on two points."
"First, the creation of a network amongst Europe's research institutions is absolutely essential if we are to achieve our objective."
"But we need to avoid a situation in which the future European Food Safety Agency and, for example, the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin have overlapping responsibilities and powers."
"Not only the Commission, but also every Member State must be legally able to call upon this agency."
"This makes sense if the European Food Safety Agency is also to be able to operate independently of the Commission and if, whenever necessary, it is to take prompt crisis management action."
"However, the conditions for appealing to the Agency must be drawn up so that efficient and swift action is guaranteed."
"Second, a universal system for tracing the original ingredients of all food must be created."
"This principle must be consistently adhered to when the planned review of EU legislation on food labelling is carried out."
"That is the only way to regain consumers' confidence in food production, which has been destroyed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur, Mr Bowis has produced an excellent report, and in many areas I would like to reinforce what he has said."
"Establishing an efficient and independent European Food Safety Agency is very much to be welcomed, not least because of the various food scandals to date."
"Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because they want to eat healthily, and we have to ensure that this is possible."
"The Agency's central tasks will therefore be risk assessment and risk communication, an early warning system with the assistance of the five food committees all working together, excellent public relations work with consumers on food and food safety issues, and optimum networking with scientific institutions and control agencies in the Member States, so as to guarantee controls on the ground from producer to consumer."
"In order to rebuild and strengthen consumer confidence, food safety and regulations need to be taken into account in legislation governing fertilisers, plant health products, medicines, the environment and waste."
"Reliable risk assessment requires comprehensive analyses and reference measurements."
"To make scientific results comparable across Europe, the measurement techniques applied need to be standardised and harmonised."
"An appropriate infrastructure is required for testing food and in particular toxic substances in animal feed."
"The Joint Research Centre's Health and Consumer Protection Institute is currently also carrying out pan-European quality and safety checks on food, and is amongst other things testing food for contamination and carrying out reference measurements for agricultural products and foodstuffs."
"Substantial financial means are needed for all these measures."
"It is therefore advisable also to involve and take advantage of the European Union's existing institutions, and if appropriate extend them. The funding necessary for this needs to be made available by 2002."
"I have tabled an amendment on this subject, and I hope you will support it."
"Mr President, the fact that only 19 amendments have been tabled in this Chamber on a subject as complex as this one, which very quickly stirs up feelings and leads to heated emotions, is a sign that excellent preparatory work has been done with the rapporteur on a basis of trust, and also involving all the other groups in the committee."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur for that."
"The White Paper is by no means an answer to any of the crises."
"It was high time that the Commission produced the White Paper to follow the Green Paper published many years ago now."
"It should also be said, as some of the previous speakers have done, and in particular Mr Whitehead and Mrs Gebhardt, that the White Paper is more than just another set of EU rules and regulations."
"For example, the White Paper must ensure that conditions are created in which safe food is possible at all."
"If we do not manage to modernise the early warning system and make it work, then there is little point in worrying about much else."
"If we cannot manage to get the early warning system to emphasise the Member States' responsibility, then we will have a problem."
"We need to apply stricter legislation, stricter guidelines and stricter criteria to animal feed."
"Hygiene regulations governing animal feed production, and also regarding checks, need to be much tougher."
"Without a new framework directive we will be helpless in many areas of food safety."
"With this in mind, the Commission has presented some 80 proposals - either totally new or proposals for amendments - a very ambitious programme indeed."
"I can see that in some areas the Commission is already active."
"I believe that this programme is a step in the right direction."
"Of course we are all talking mainly about this new Food Safety Agency."
"We agreed in committee what this new authority can and cannot do, but I would also like to remind you that food safety is important."
"We already have scientific bodies in the EU which look after this."
"However, if we cannot succeed in getting the Member States to actually carry out checks on the spot on the basis of the legislation, if we cannot manage to oblige them to provide information on who checks what, when and how often, then even if we created 20 new authorities in the European Union, not a jot would change as regards food safety."
"We should not lose sight of that, because in that case, a new authority, whatever it was called, would just be a smokescreen and a token gesture."
"Some country somewhere would then be happy to provide a home for this new authority, but otherwise nothing would happen. The expressions that then come to mind are ""everyone turns a blind eye"" or ""the dog barks, but the caravan moves on""."
"Hygiene regulations and on-the-spot checks should be the slogan of the hour."
"And the ones who need to do something about this are not so much the Commission and ourselves, but rather the Member States, who so far have not done their homework."
"Mr President, I feel very pleased today and grateful both towards the Commission, for having embarked upon the work on better food safety, and towards Mr Bowis and the whole of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I am grateful for the constructive cooperation we have had and for the willingness to compromise that has been shown for the purpose of producing a good report."
"We are now hoping for Parliament' s support, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will accept our proposals."
"Together with the bureau responsible for food and veterinary issues, other scientific bodies and national authorities, the food authority must create a comprehensive system."
"Just as Mrs Paulsen said, all Member States and all companies, many of which are multinational, must comply with the legislation."
"If they do not, there must be a system of sanctions at EU level."
"I therefore want to discuss Amendment No 16."
"When food safety is threatened, both public health and the common market are placed in jeopardy."
"We must consequently make such changes to the EU Treaty as to ensure that the Commission is given the option of imposing sanctions in the area of food, just as it has at present in the area of competition."
"The food authority ought to be able to propose suitable measures to the Commission in this connection."
"Mr President, I too have the pleasure first of all of commending the Commission for its White Paper on food safety, which is a good proposal, and Mr Bowis too for having done an excellent job of improving and fine tuning this proposal."
"What is more, he has published a document containing a practical resolution, the justification for which is both humorous and easy to read."
"It is not often that we read documents such as these here in Parliament."
"My group shares the Commission' s and the rapporteur' s view of how the independent Food Safety Agency' s responsibilities are to be apportioned."
"We believe that its main task must be that of assessing food safety risks and that its core activity must be that of providing scientific advice."
"Naturally, the legislation must also be strengthened, and caution and responsibility must be the watchwords of everyone without exception, permeating the whole approach to food and enabling the entire food chain to be covered."
"Food must also, as far as possible, be produced in accordance with ecological principles."
"What we really need is a comprehensive strategy for dealing with food at every stage of its production."
"We are concerned with issues such as GMOs, additives, labelling and so on. I hope that the Commission will really provide for such a strategy."
"My group supports most of the amendments."
"I think that Amendment No 17 is particularly important, stating that the consumer organisations must be consulted."
"Since recital J states that industry and food producers must be consulted, I believe that a balance is needed in this area."
"Mr President, the sheer number of food scandals and the debate about using genetic engineering in food production have undermined the present food safety system."
"Optimum food safety standards and falling consumer protection standards cannot be reconciled."
"So something else is needed here, and I believe that too."
"But I am in favour of most responsibility remaining with the Member States."
"The Community is the world's largest importer and exporter of food."
"This sector has an annual turnover of EUR 600 billion and employs 10 million people."
"I support everyone involved, be it in a political, administrative or other capacity, who is working on a ""food for all"" strategy."
"The developed industrialised nations are also best placed to make the greatest contribution here, through sustainable and varied food production."
"The White Paper is a political paper for those in positions of responsibility in food production."
"A zero-risk policy is not really practical."
"That is why the preventive measures in the White Paper constitute the real action plans."
"What is more, there is no European flavour here."
"National peculiarities should not only be respected, but actually encouraged."
"This is where the only weak points in the White Paper on food safety lie."
"Certain questions remain unanswered, such as: what will the relationship be between the Food Safety Agency and consumers?"
"How is it to be financed and how will it cooperate with the Member States?"
"What about liability?"
"Up to now, of course, it has been the innocent parties who have paid."
"The Commission will have to provide more concrete answers to these questions in its continued work."
"Mr President, we value the work carried out by Mr Bowis because, in addition to placing the subject in the right context, it raises important questions to which solutions must be found in the course of time."
"The usefulness of the authority to be established is undeniable, both in terms of monitoring and in terms of prevention, for which, in any case, the precautionary principle does not provide adequate practical guidance."
"A reliable legislative framework, the definition of acceptable risk and the practical safeguarding of local food and production diversities are aspects which still require attention, together with those of small and medium-sized businesses and the training of their employees."
"A further aspect is the organic revision of the labelling rules for both wholesale and retail selling, which will at last provide the consumer with correct information regarding products' traceability and make it possible to identify where responsibility lies in the event of risk or crises."
"Moreover, it has been said, and rightly so, that the authority will not be a political body and that, particularly in the event of a problem arising, it will report to the Commission and the Member States."
"How this works in practice will become clear when the authority has to act."
"Its legal status, authority and interaction at European level with other technical and scientific bodies whose responsibilities currently partly overlap with the authority being established also need to be defined."
"In short, it will be important to see how its independence and transparency are reconciled with the fact that no current resources have been allocated to it, with its subordination to the Commission, on the one hand, and with its authority to act autonomously and the membership of its board of directors on the other."
"Lastly, the intention to identify priority actions and class them in order of importance is certainly positive."
"However, while such actions are so long awaiting definition, they do not make up for the need to define a comprehensive European line on food policy and food safety, which will give the many European diversities another opportunity to display their unity."
"Mr President, rapporteur Bowis started his explanatory statement on his report with a quotation from Ludwig Feuerbach, which he also repeated this morning: ""der Mensch ist was er isst"" (You are what you eat)."
"I do not share this viewpoint, for we know that a human being is more than just a body."
"The fact that food safety rules have been around for a long time is evident from the Bible, as God prescribed these to His people of Israel."
"However, it is appropriate to qualify the concern which people have with regard to food safety."
"I would like to counterbalance the quotation from Feuerbach with one from the Lord Jesus himself: ""What goes into the mouth does not make anyone unclean; it is what comes out of the mouth that makes someone unclean"" , namely what we all say."
"In modern society, the choice of food is enormously varied."
"We mainly eat tasty food, even if we know it is unhealthy."
"Strangely enough, however, there is huge panic amongst the public if something goes wrong with food production."
"In order to win back their confidence, extremely drastic measures are taken, the necessity of which in terms of safety might be questioned."
"Could a European Food Safety Agency have prevented a dioxin crisis and a BSE crisis?"
"In my view, drafting new legislation is not the right response to non-compliance with existing legislation."
"The setting up of independent inspectorates in the Member States which can enforce the law on the spot should therefore be given priority."
"The same applies to the rapid alert system. Member States need to ensure that this system works well and they need to inform the European Commission in good time."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, I would like to start by thanking our friend, John Bowis, for his excellent work on the White Paper on food safety and, in particular, for including the various amendments tabled by different political groups."
"In my opinion, they enhance the original report of the Committee considerably."
"The establishment of an independent, high profile European Food Safety Agency is a substantial step which satisfies the need of all the citizens for guarantees on the quality and safety of food products."
"The neurodegenerative damage to man's central nervous system caused by the consumption of beef or veal - as has been mentioned this morning - from animals suffering from mad cow disease, the recent dioxins alert in Belgium, the high levels of pesticides and herbicides in the environment and the presence of other microbiological and chemical pollutants with potentially cancerous effects arouse in the public a strong sense of alarm and sometimes anxiety."
"The establishment of a European Food Safety Agency will contribute greatly to achieving a high level of protection of citizens' health."
"I would like to end by thanking all the political groups - the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - for accepting a joint amendment initially tabled by Mr Fiori and myself which gives greater meaning to the very existence of the European authority."
"It must genuinely be a centre for coordinating the network of national agencies which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions."
"The purpose of this network of laboratories will be to monitor on a continual, daily basis, the quality and safety of food products - exactly as Mrs Roth-Behrendt said just now - and I agree with this approach."
"The network must be as close to the citizens as possible and, in this way, their faith will be restored in the European national institutions."
"Mr President, Parliament's vote marks the end of this first stage of consultation on food safety issues."
"I just hope that it will not also mark the end of the will to intervene rapidly and effectively in a sector which affects the daily lives of the citizens so closely and which is one of the principle benchmarks of our capacity to restore their faith in politics and in the institutions."
"The impetus will be all the more necessary considering that the great expectations aroused by the White Paper are not, in my opinion, truly reflected in the report tabled by Mr Bowis, despite the considerable amount of work he has put in."
"Indeed, despite the fact that the creation of the European Food Safety Agency and the definition of its competencies are a fundamental point of the strategy proposed by the Commission, they are not the only point."
"A European food strategy cannot be reduced merely to the creation of a monitoring authority and the application of a few - albeit necessary - health and hygiene rules."
"There is an indissoluble relationship between eating healthily and eating well, a relationship of which consumers must be made more aware in order to promote quality and support the typical local products which are one of the great assets of the peoples of Europe."
"With the vote in the Committee on the Environment, we have succeeded in re-establishing a certain balance, including in the scope of the resolution nutrition issues and certain significant references to the role of small and medium-sized businesses in safeguarding diverse dietary habits."
"That is why I will vote for the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Bowis report forms a solid basis for further work and I believe, Commissioner, that there is now not one single reason why you, so to speak, could not produce the legislative proposal tomorrow, for the large majority of Parliament is now agreed on the way forward. Mr Bowis, the fact that it is such a large majority, is partly and mainly thanks to you."
"I will not dwell on the heart of the matter, since we are all agreed on that."
"I would like to bring a few minor aspects to the fore."
"I have tabled an amendment which is not unimportant, in my view, although Mr Whitehead suggested it was redundant."
"The authority must be independent and that is why I think that 'close ties' , as stated in Paragraph 12, should actually not be allowed, not with anybody - not with consumer associations or anybody else."
"I therefore believe that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly reconcilable."
"Secondly, in addition to the authority, there are a number of important things which need to happen."
"I would single out two of these: we urgently need PCB standards at European level, as well as a positive list of ingredients of animal feed."
"Commissioner, I would say that there is no time to lose and, ladies and gentlemen, our role in the European Parliament is also vital for, by studying the annual report and interviewing the director of the authority, we will need to ensure that the authority works, because if it does not, if it does not do its work properly, we will end up footing the bill politically speaking."
"I believe that is something which we will need to keep an eye on in the years ahead."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for assembling the amendments of all the groups - as other members have said - in the compromise amendments."
"I think he is pursuing an obvious objective which is - as he says in his document - that of guaranteeing the high levels of food safety that should exist, and a second objective that derives from the first, which is to say that of restoring credibility in the eyes of the consumer, which has been somewhat dented by scandals."
"I would like to remind you of one that occurred in Spain, the rape seed oil scandal - the consequences of which are still apparent now, after more than 20 years - but also the BSE scandal, the dioxin scandal and the latest worrying scandal in the United States regarding the release, for use in food products, of transgenic sweetcorn that would seem to be unsuitable for consumption."
"I believe the rapporteur's proposal to act on three levels is very important."
"The first level is to create a food authority or agency, founded on the principles of integrity, transparency and independence - independence, amongst other principles, is essential. The second is to introduce clear, accessible priority legislation, and the third is to cooperate with agencies in the other Member States, non-governmental organisations, consumer organisations and international bodies."
"Therefore, as Mihail Papayannakis said, we too are going to approve and support the report."
"Mr President, I would like to join with other colleagues in complimenting the rapporteur, Mr Bowis for his very constructive and very logical approach to this particular problem."
"May I say, by way of a light note, that when I listened to Mr Blokland introducing some biblical quotes I felt he had elevated the status of this debate to a new plane because there were times when we thought that nothing short of divine intervention would help us resolve the matter."
"However, having said that, I believe it is to the credit of this Parliament and Commissioner Byrne that food safety now dominates the European agenda."
"Our citizens expect and are entitled to a vigilant and positive response."
"In my view, nothing less will restore consumer confidence in an important policy area both for producers and consumers."
"We have all learned our lessons from the food crisis of the 1990s."
"I am confident that by putting in place a systematic set of uniform rules we are laying the groundwork for filling the gaps in the existing legislation."
"This would clearly enhance food safety through the food chain."
"The reform of European Union food laws would be carried out at the level of the European Union."
"We want to avoid a situation where there may be a renationalisation of food purchasing within the European Union."
"One of the central elements of the reform of the common agricultural policy is to avoid the renationalisation of the CAP in any shape or form."
"That is why it is so important that food safety laws are enforced at European Union level."
"For this reason also I welcome one of the core elements in the White Paper on food safety which would lead to the setting up of a new European Food Safety Agency."
"This authority would have responsibility for scientific evidence and the communication and management of all risks relating to food safety."
"Another issue which will confront us over the coming months is that of GMOs in food production and we must be open to the potential of biotechnology."
"In this respect it could be a serious mistake to assume that biotechnology means poor quality or unsafe food."
"For example, GMO foods offer the opportunity to reduce the levels of pesticide residues and improve nutritional quality, it would be negligent to ignore these advantages."
"However, I fully support the introduction of clear, non-technical and standardised labelling in the context of GMO food products."
"Moreover, no food products which are genetically modified or contain genetically modified ingredients should be allowed into the food chain until they are fully tested, and only then with clear labelling specifications."
"Mr President, the fact that the White Paper on food safety has no intrinsic legislative value does not in any way detract from the dual purpose which it undoubtedly serves."
"First of all, it embodies the commitment to completely and comprehensively overhaul legislation, to set up an independent Food Safety Agency and to organise inspection better."
"It also has symbolic meaning."
"It can and must signal the start of a new beginning."
"From now on, the policy will be tackled in a coordinated and integrated manner and will embrace the entire food chain."
"I welcome the fact that rapporteur Bowis, who has done sterling work, has opted for a positive approach to the White Paper."
"His report does not so much propose amendments as establish emphases."
"For example, it is right to stress that the food authority should first and foremost concentrate on food safety."
"Nevertheless, I hope that there will also be room for collating knowledge in the field of linking food patterns to health."
"After all, policy should not only focus on preventing damage to health, but also on obtaining health benefits."
"A second justified emphasis is the request for consideration to be given to regional and cultural differences in the food supply and to the role of the SME and the traditional trades in question."
"I would in this light urge you to recognise the specific value of the SME and traditional trades in the extensive package of legislation."
"A third emphasis is required which is as yet missing from the report but which we can introduce via Amendment No 12."
"Both the White Paper and the Bowis report mention communication on the one hand and procedures in emergency situations on the other, but there is no attention to the internal and external crisis communication which is so desperately needed."
"It can nevertheless - and we have first-hand experience of this in Belgium - be a determining factor in managing the extent of a crisis and in whether consumer confidence in the institutions survives or not."
"To conclude, let us hope that the Member States might join in the vision shared by Parliament and the Commission, and that, above all, they will assume their responsibility, not only as constituent parts of the Council, but also as a body which must ensure that inspection in the field is carried out efficiently once the European measures have been transposed in national legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on food safety has laid a firm basis for better food in future and I am also hopeful of more environmentally-friendly and people-friendly production of food."
"The rapporteur, along with many MEPs in the Committee, including myself, have placed the focus on the food authority and this is regrettable to some extent."
"Regrettable, because good food, safe food particularly benefits from clear legislation."
"But I also understand that the many crises in Europe, and I also refer to my own country, have shown that we mainly need something to hold on to."
"The policy needs an anchor so that clear choices can be made and the consumer needs to have confidence."
"This is why we need this food authority and this is why we are right to set the necessary store by it."
"It is important for this food authority to be able to function independently."
"We have spelled this out very clearly in the report, and I am absolutely delighted about it."
"It is also important for the food authority to be able to prioritise, to work pro-actively and to make recommendations to those who are responsible for risk management."
"I rather regret that the title only refers to food safety."
"I can understand if food safety has to be the point of departure, but surely links must be established with other areas, such as the environment, health and such like. I hope that an energetic, future authority can get this dynamic going."
"Finally, I believe that, at this moment in time, during this political discussion, we should not focus on the place of establishment."
"I am quite convinced that this leaves the population completely cold."
"Mr President, as the representative of the European Liberal Democrats, I would like to thank the Commission sincerely for its White Paper, with its ambitious objectives."
"It is necessary to move forward swiftly and with flexibility in these matters."
"This is in the interests of consumers, but also, at the same time, the food chain in Europe."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has now come to adopt a reasonable policy, as there is now the desire to create a scientific, authoritative body from the Food Safety Agency, which would have responsibility for risk assessment and keeping the public informed."
"It is important that risk management itself will continue to be the responsibility of the Member States and the Commission and thus the object of political supervision also."
"For us to be able to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food and maintain it, the Food Safety Agency must start its work with adequate public resources."
"Self-sufficiency and the independence of the unit will serve the interests of European consumers best."
"For that reason it would be best if the agency did not function under the auspices of the Commission but independently and as a body that is physically separate from the Commission."
"The agency must be located somewhere well-connected in terms of transport and information technology, and the area in question should have a good reputation in the area of food safety."
"Support from the surrounding scientific community will also be an important factor when choosing a location."
"For that reason, I support Amendment Nos 14 and 19, which express a desire for principled guidance in deciding a future location."
"The White Paper, which Mr Bowis' report broadly endorses, does not define an imperative policy, which is a great pity."
"Yet, the creation of a European Food Safety Agency is a very positive step."
"However, as some Members have said, we must guarantee its independence. That means providing it with adequate financial and human resources."
"For our part, we believe that a tax on agro-business profits would be a way of releasing these resources."
"In order to respect the principle of transparency, we must also authorise the referral of cases to the agency by the unions and the various professional associations, in relation to both consumption and ecology."
"Sound scientific risk assessment, coupled with an effective strategy of communication with the public, cannot by themselves stamp out the food crises."
"That is something of a technocratic view, which makes the mistake of overlooking the cultural, social and economic dimensions of food."
"We need a stronger political will to resolve certain crises."
"Take the current mad cow disease crisis."
"We should be able to ban the incorporation of animal meal in feed and withdraw the licence of food manufacturers who do not respect these rules."
"Mr President, I congratulate John Bowis on his excellent work."
"I have on many an occasion throughout this process thought that we were lucky when we chose him to draw up the report."
"He has withstood the pressures he has come up against in this emotional issue extremely well."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Byrne for his cooperation."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy followed Mr Bowis' s advice and decided not to adopt a position on the location of the Food Safety Agency."
"In my opinion, that was a wise policy."
"It is, however, important to define what we expect from the Food Safety Agency and what sort of criteria should apply in selecting its location."
"In the interests of the citizens of the Union as a whole, it is to be hoped that these criteria will be implemented."
"They include good reputation in the field of food safety, independence, and good scientific infrastructure incorporating the best available technology and good transport and telecommunications links."
"Amendment No 19, which I together with Mr Nisticò and Mr Fiori, as well as many others, tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, states these criteria clearly without taking a stand on any particular location."
"These criteria will all be essential tools in realising the common aim to restore consumer confidence in European food safety as soon as possible."
"In talks, there has been a call for the agency to be located in a city in which one of our Institutions is located, as, otherwise, it could not be supervised."
"This sort of argument is puzzling and worrying and in fact removes the foundations on which the idea of integration is built."
"I do not think we can in all seriousness say that only an authorised body that is located in the midst of the Community can reliably carry out the task it is entrusted with."
"There must be other reasons for the euro' s low value than the fact that the European Central Bank is situated in Frankfurt."
"I myself do not think this way and trust in the strength and basic principles of European integration throughout the EU."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on the huge effort which he made in his report to take account of everyone's view and for agreeing that we should also refer to the more general concept of food."
"The White Paper on food safety is a proposal which aspires to restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain."
"Consumers are quite right to demand food which poses absolutely no threat to their health and the quality of which meets certain criteria and specifications."
"Consequently, legislation on food issues should cover the entire spectrum and extend horizontally."
"Allow me to highlight a number of points."
"The early warning system has proven to be less than efficient and the Member States bear a great deal of the responsibility for this."
"I think there should be specific deadlines by which the European Commission must be notified if there is any cause for concern."
"Stricter, more efficient controls are needed in the Member States."
"As far as the European Food Safety Agency is concerned, the fact that it is independent should be highlighted; then it will be able to assess any imminent risk and propose measures for managing the risk and helping to shape final political decisions."
"Similarly, the Agency should ensure that there is transparency by giving all interested parties access to information."
"I think that transparency and independence are the sine qua non for proper, safe food, which is what we are all aiming for."
"Mr President, recent incidents which involved meat from sick cows ending up in the food chain in the Netherlands and France, as well as the debate which has flared up again in Great Britain, underline once again the need for tighter monitoring and inspection of food production."
"Winning back the public' s confidence in food safety is more important than for food safety alone."
"After all, this is about the confidence of the citizen in the government."
"This is why the new European Food Safety Agency must become a powerful and independent body which does not only inform the public but is also given specific powers to propose effective measures in good time and to investigate problems in the event of a crisis."
"We therefore have an organisation in mind which is as slim as possible, and not a large bureaucracy."
"In addition, part of the body' s efficiency will consist of transparent decision-making and the swift publication on the Internet of its studies and recommendations, as happens with, for example, the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin, which is running extremely smoothly."
"The public is entitled to this."
"It is also important to build on the work of existing organisations, such as EMEA and FAO, because duplication must be avoided."
"Finally, the European Government should not escape its responsibility."
"In the final analysis, decisions must be taken by the European Commission, and Parliament must, for example by means of a discussion on the annual report, remain involved in the work of the agency."
"On a final note, President Prodi created huge expectations in the run-up to his presidency, and Commissioner Byrne and rapporteur Bowis were asked to flesh these out in their White Paper."
"I believe they succeeded in this extremely well, and we shall now welcome legislation in this field as soon as possible."
"Mr President, while the European food chain is one of the safest in the world, poor practice, and indeed recent scandals, have set an agenda to which our Commissioner, Mr Byrne, has responded admirably."
"My compliments to him and indeed to our rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for a very logical and rational approach to the problem before us today."
"The EU must have the highest possible standards of food safety for its citizens."
"Food safety and public health are key political priorities."
"We must be able to trust those who set out to advise us - farmers, food manufacturers, processors, retailers, government, consumer advisory groups, scientists, an endless list."
"It is essential that we have a body of science as a reference point, whether we are consumers or policy-makers or even contributors to the food chain, and that we know what is an acceptable balance between risk prevention and informed consumer choice - it is all about balance."
"Safety and security does not mean sacrificing choice, or indeed cultural diversity, and one of the most interesting amendments of the Committee on the Environment, which supplements and strengthens the report, is on the preservation of the European cultural heritage with regard to local food specialities."
"Risks therefore need to be identified early, assessed scientifically and nipped in the bud."
"European action is appropriate because in a single market risk does not stop at national borders."
"The EFSA should play an important role in the existing Rapid Alert System, which should be improved and extended to cover all areas of food safety, including animal feed."
"I welcome the fact that there is broad agreement on the main principles: that a new scientific body responsible for food safety risk assessment should be established, that it should be independent, accountable, transparent and subject to the needs of objective research and of commercial confidentiality and that it should provide the public with accessible and comprehensible information."
"Most important of all, it should gain the respect of its peers, the confidence of the public and the willingness of Member State governments to accept its conclusions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on food safety is the Commission's response to the public's increased sensitivity in this area."
"The limited quantity of food we still allow ourselves must first and foremost be healthy, taste good and be produced in an environmentally sound way in consumers' eyes."
"There are many aspects that need to be addressed in talking about food safety and if we want to guarantee it."
"There are already very many organisations and institutions, not to mention associations and initiatives, concerned with food safety."
"In the European single market, which implies free trade and movement of goods, we are increasingly faced with the issue of legislative jurisdiction and responsibility for controls in this area, which is so important for the European public."
"The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Agency."
"I welcome this proposal, but at the same time I have certain questions about the powers, remit and influence of a European authority."
"These are the same questions that we considered in committee."
"I would therefore like to compliment Mr Bowis on his excellent and well-balanced report, in which he has brought together a wide variety of ideas."
"The Agency's responsibility should be for risk assessment."
"It should carry out assessments and work with bodies in the Member States."
"Transparency is particularly important, and is required by the public."
"They want to be kept informed."
"That is why the Agency has to ensure that the public has easily accessible and understandable information."
"The Agency is intended to work closely with existing institutions, but that also means that information, statistics and data should also be mutually accessible."
"Other people's experience and findings can be pooled with our own, and findings can be assessed at pan-European level."
"We do not want everyone reinventing the wheel."
"But we can also learn from each other's experience here."
"That is how I see the future role of a Food Safety Agency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mr Bowis as rapporteur."
"We have heard various fine phrases quoted about diet."
"Let me offer one more: variety in moderation."
"The selection found on overflowing shelves has long since made this a genuine option."
"But the creation of a new authority or agency cannot change the eating habits of many members of the public, or the way we prepare and store food, or people's inadequate knowledge about preparing a balanced diet."
"Making food safer does not remove the need for consumers to act responsibly."
"Commissioner Byrne, it sounds to me as if we will have fewer and fewer producers but more and more inspectors."
"I am worried that Europe is again in danger of creating an overblown bureaucracy that is incapable of taking action."
"How exactly will the Agency's powers be divided with national inspection authorities?"
"I am concerned that this will be another millstone round our necks."
"This new authority will not strike a blow for freedom in terms of consumer policy."
"Who will be suing whom in future food scandals?"
"We are always discussing the division of powers in the context of enlargement of the European Union."
"But this concept also plays a key role in food safety."
"Strict application of the ""polluter pays"" principle will remain essential in repairing economic damage in future. The consistency of the White Paper on food safety leaves something to be desired in places."
"The timetable for achieving its objectives varies greatly according to the wishes of many stakeholders."
"So we will not stand in the way of establishing this body any more with today's debate."
"However, I do believe that we should not raise our hopes too high by imagining that this body will be a cure for all ills in future."
"Mr President, my colleague Mr Bowis has played a fine hand with the cards which he has been dealt. But I intend to ask whether those cards should have been dealt at all."
"Over and over in this House we discuss the details of proposals which have been put before us but we fail to ask whether those proposals should be there at all."
"We already have food safety agencies in most Member States."
"We have scientific committees advising the Commission."
"We have the World Health Organisation in Geneva."
"What will a European Food Safety Agency add?"
"It will largely duplicate the activities of existing agencies."
"Its main function is public relations. It is driven by the desperate need to persuade a sceptical public that the European institutions are delivering something - anything - of value."
"Would the new agency have prevented the British BSE crisis or the Belgian dioxin crisis?"
"As Mr Blokland rightly says, almost certainly not."
"We need to recognise the law of diminishing returns."
"As we create new levels of bureaucracy and spend ever more money we get less and less in return."
"We are told we cannot question the value of money spent on human health."
"Yet, as politicians allocating finite resources, we must ask these questions."
"Would the vast cost of this new agency be better spent on cancer research or smoking prevention or road safety?"
"Almost certainly these areas would deliver better value in terms of lives saved, yet no one is prepared to ask the question."
"I turn to the question of location for the agency."
"In my view its main task should be to coordinate better the work of existing agencies."
"The heads of national agencies should constitute its board."
"These people should continue to sit at their own desks, in front of their own computers."
"The location of the agency should therefore be not in Barcelona, Helsinki or Italy, but on the Internet, in cyberspace."
"It would be efficient, transparent and accessible."
"This would be a truly twenty-first century solution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to say in the clearest terms that the White Paper on food safety before us today provides a springboard for action by the institutions of the European Union, for achieving the highest standards in food safety and for regaining consumer confidence."
"After all, there are good reasons why we asked for this paper."
"Of course, there have been very different approaches, as the discussions in recent months have demonstrated."
"That is why the rapporteur deserves great praise, because he has managed to pull together very different approaches and ideas into a clear report."
"There have even been widely conflicting views about the main point of the White Paper, the creation of a Food Safety Agency."
"I will not deny that when the White Paper was published, I spoke out against the Agency."
"If when it comes to the vote I - and I expect a substantial majority - argue in favour of this Agency, I would nevertheless advise the Commissioner not to be deceived."
"There are many doubts and critical voices."
"You should take Parliament's proposals seriously and concentrate the Agency's work on scientific tasks and risk analysis."
"I particularly wish to stress that the Agency and the present system of advisory committees cannot exist side by side."
"There must be clear arrangements governing the Agency's cooperation with the Joint Research Centre in Ispra and the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin."
"You must prevent several institutions carrying out similar work in parallel."
"As regards the actual structure of the Agency, it must be clear how it is to be financed."
"We in Parliament welcome and wish to encourage a financing plan."
"What staff numbers are required?"
"What is an appropriate timetable for setting up an authority of this kind?"
"You should also use the White Paper to enforce strict rules in the Member States."
"If the proposals for over 80 legislative measures are much the same as the hygiene rules I have now received as rapporteur, then I am very optimistic."
"However, Commissioner, when it comes to the provisions on labelling, please think again about your ideas ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his excellent work."
"I must say, among other things, that we have recouped an extremely important aspect, the concept of a European Food Safety Agency as a network that should complement rather than replace the food safety bodies of the individual Member States."
"However, it is also necessary to call for a balanced approach to the issue because Articles 152 and 153 of the Treaty on European Union provide, as a general rule, for a high level of protection of human health and of consumers."
"The priority of absolute concern for humans is based on these principles."
"We must therefore ensure that the European Union has the highest possible food safety standards, but in taking this approach - which we unanimously uphold - we must also analyse the economic implications for the sectors involved in production."
"Article 2 of the Treaty states that the Union is committed to promoting the harmonious, balanced, sustainable development of economic activities."
"Therefore, any legislative measure concerning a sector such as the food sector, which is one of the driving forces of European industry - accounting for 15% of the total output of the manufacturing sector and employing 2.5 million workers - must be evaluated on the basis of this twin consideration, since both principles are intended to guarantee the general well-being of the Community."
"Any consumer protection operation only becomes feasible in terms of profit when it avoids unduly damaging the general economic well-being of the Community through placing disproportionate barriers in the way of the sector's production processes and therefore hampering economic growth and growth in employment."
"I therefore call upon the Commissioner to avoid excessive legislation and bureaucratic burdens as far as possible, particularly where small and medium-sized businesses are concerned."
"Mr President, developing an independent European Food Safety Agency is a major objective which must be achieved in conjunction with the national structures responsible for monitoring."
"We must, however, ensure that in the wake of the debate on the White Paper, the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which concerns itself with the quality of products without doing anything effective to combat fraud that threatens the health of the consumer is not reinforced in the mind of the public."
"I, too, congratulate Mr Bowis on his report and I would just like to highlight one point."
"A strategy which covers the entire food chain, from farming to production and distribution, could facilitate further economic concentration to the detriment of smaller companies and companies producing typical products, without creating any real advantage for the consumers."
"Small companies producing typical products are the jewel of many European regions."
"The objective of food safety can and must fit in with this grass-roots situation which, as a large number of Members have stressed, is of cultural as well as economic value."
"Mr President, I would like to extend my genuine congratulations to Mr Bowis on his sound report on the White Paper for food safety."
"It is a very loaded topic which, after the European food crisis, has led to heated debates, and Mr Bowis managed very well to incorporate this debate in his report."
"In the Netherlands, the debate has focused on a European Food Safety Agency, which could be seen as Europe' s answer to the American FDA."
"In fact, that is how it was launched by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, when he took up office."
"The White Paper which is now before us and the Bowis report both take an agency as their only starting point, an agency attended by an extensive package of tasks in the form of accompanying legislative measures designed to restore confidence."
"Upon careful examination of the White Paper in the Member States and here in Parliament, it will then be given legislative status in the form of a new draft directive."
"The tasks will then involve independent scientific research, advice, independent inspections and a rapid alert system, but definitely coordination too, in order to restore confidence."
"I have concerns regarding those independent inspections."
"Why?"
"In my view, there should be better guarantees for coordination with Dublin, and it should also be possible to carry out inspections in the Member States without prior permission."
"Amendments have been tabled to that effect."
"Legislation, standards and laying down rules remain within the remit of those institutions authorised for those purposes in Europe. Those are the Commission, as initiator, and the Council and Parliament as legislator."
"That does not take away the fact that I am left with one huge wish."
"I would have liked so very much to have drawn a comparison with the EMEA, and I also wanted to include notification and product approval as part of an agency' s remit."
"I hope that this will be given due consideration in the new proposal."
"First of all I would like to express my thanks to the many Members who have contributed to this report."
"As you are aware, the Commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety."
"I must give special thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and its rapporteur, John Bowis, for producing this opinion with such a degree of consensus and pay particular tribute to him and to the other Members of this House who have taken the time to discuss these issues with me and with my officials."
"The consequence is that we have achieved this excellent measure of consensus which is yet another notable example of the cooperation that can exist between our two great institutions."
"The Commission's White Paper on food safety sets out a major and ambitious programme of legislative reforms to complete the EU's farm to table policy."
"Taken together with our proposals to establish a European Food Safety Agency, the programme will make a major contribution to the health protection of our citizens as well as to the restoration and maintenance of consumer confidence in food safety."
"European consumers have every right to expect the highest achievable food safety standards and our ambition is to develop systems that deliver this."
"A food safety chain from farm to fork, correctly regulated and effectively controlled, is the road to building high levels of confidence in the European food supply."
"In this respect the Commission is already hard at work on its programme of legislative reform set out in the White Paper."
"Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament: for example, the package of proposals recasting and updating the hygiene legislation."
"As an aside, I can say of the speakers who referred to the need for sensitivity in relation to the promotion of local food specialities and traditional foods that this issue is addressed in the hygiene legislation."
"We are also working on a number of major reforms in the systems of control implemented by the competent authorities in the Member States and at Community level."
"In this regard, the Commission will adopt proposals for a revised control regime in the period ahead."
"The White Paper reiterates the Commission's commitment to basing its proposals for consumer health protection measures on sound science."
"Indeed, the food authority is conceived as a point of scientific excellence at the service of the Community in its broadest sense: consumers, the institutions and Member States alike."
"The food authority will also need to be visible to the general public and be the authoritative voice in matters relating to the scientific aspects of food safety in Europe."
"The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the overarching principles and objectives of food law, which will provide the framework for future health protection measures relating to food."
"This proposal will put forward the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency which will provide the Community with advice on scientific and technical issues and thereby enable the Commission to give effect to the general principles of food law."
"Our intention is to adopt this proposal in the Commission on 8 November 2000."
"This schedule continues to reflect the importance the Commission attaches to the matter and is broadly in line with the timescale set out in the White Paper which envisages that the establishing legislation will be enacted in 2001, leading to the establishment of the food authority in 2002."
"I only wish we could do better in terms of time."
"I know, Mr President, that you share my views in this regard."
"I look forward to the fullest support from Parliament in dealing with this most important piece of legislation in the shortest possible timeframe."
"I have followed Parliament's debate on the White Paper with great interest."
"I am encouraged to note the high degree of agreement between Parliament's views as expressed in the draft report that you have debated, and the White Paper itself."
"This will facilitate the Commission's task in bringing forward a balanced proposal that takes maximum account of the views of Parliament and the many stakeholders in the area of food safety."
"You will appreciate that I cannot promise to take on board all your views, but my record before this Parliament will demonstrate that I will do my utmost."
"I have previously acknowledged in Parliament and other forums what I regard as an important issue for the fullest acceptance of our ideas for a food authority: the role and involvement of Parliament itself in enacting the legislation establishing the food authority."
"I would like to put it on the record today that I remain committed to Parliament having a full codecision role in the enactment of this legislation."
"It is right and proper and I support Parliament's desire to see Articles 95 and 152 of the Treaty employed to this effect."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation to you, Mr President, your rapporteur, Mr Bowis, the shadow rapporteurs, the Committee on the Environment and the other committees who have contributed, and the House as a whole for bringing to a close this chapter in our collective endeavours towards improving Europe's food safety regime."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Anti-personnel mines"
"The next item is the joint debate of the report by Mrs Bonino (A5-0286/2000) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on Action against Anti-Personnel Landmines (COM(2000) 111 - C5-0158/2000 - 2000/0062(COD));"
"and the following oral questions:"
"B5-0544/2000 by Mr Miranda on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Commission, on landmines;"
"B5-0545/2000 by Mr Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Commission, on landmines."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that Parliament has tackled the issue of anti-personnel landmines."
"Far from it. In recent years, this issue was one of the driving forces which led to the signing of the Ottawa Convention."
"A campaign was initiated by certain non-governmental organisations and then taken up by the Red Cross, Europe and the Union as such, and it turned into something approaching a model international campaign."
"This was one of the most rapid agreements to be signed in the history of international agreements: it is the only agreement to have been ratified within a year by forty parliaments, thus becoming operative."
"The most recent meeting in Geneva noted considerable progress in the area of de-mining as well as awareness of the issue."
"Certainly, much remains to be done, and this is why we must all welcome the Commission's proposal as a positive step."
"Moreover, I hope that this capacity to exert pressure and the speed with which the Union tackled the issue of anti-personnel landmines might serve as an example for the ratification of other agreements which have always been extremely important to Parliament, such as the establishment of the International Tribunal for Crimes Against Humanity, not to mention the moratorium on the use of the death penalty."
"Turning to our report, I welcome the Commission's proposal as positive, and I have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have worked extremely hard in order to improve it - if this was possible - on certain points in particular."
"I would just like to mention a few of these points which, with regard to Parliament's proposal, seem important and, in any case, represent a tangible step forward in this matter."
"Firstly - and we hope that Parliament will support us in this - we stress the need to destroy the stockpiles of anti-personnel landmines still held by many countries, including signatory countries, because we feel that Parliament often talks about stockpile destruction as preventative action without really knowing what it is referring to."
"The second point has to do with a whole series of elements - which I hope Parliament will approve - regarding budget lines."
"Commissioner, in addition to further simplifying your proposal - thereby arriving at three budget lines: one general, one relating to research and one relating to humanitarian landmine clearance - we have further simplified the proposed comitology, and we hope that Parliament will approve this, considering that an advisory committee will suffice instead of a management committee, for the very reason that, in the interests of coherent interpretation, we feel that the Commission is responsible for implementing the budget and must account for it with total transparency."
"Another important element is that Parliament is not asking for anything general but requests EUR 200 million over the period 2000-2006, plus the funds to be allocated to research, plus the humanitarian heading, for we are indeed - we hope - talking about action and not just a resolution."
"Experience has taught me, Commissioner, that without funds it is difficult to achieve anything tangible from any point of view."
"Moreover, precisely because the sum is so large - EUR 200 million - a considerable increase on past provision - we would like the Commission to establish an internal unit for anti-personnel landmine action, precisely in order to increase the transparency and cohesion of this activity."
"From this perspective, these seem to me to be the characteristic elements facilitating responsible management and transparency."
"We will come to the political side of the report later."
"The final point concerns the amendments."
"I restate my position opposing Amendments Nos 10 and 19, in the interests of budgetary cohesion and, with regard to Amendment No 29, I call for split voting in order to improve the formulation throughout the text, for I feel that it has suffered from some misinterpretation."
"I would like to thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, and the hope that all these innovative proposals will not only be adopted by Parliament but also taken into consideration by the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, even in common parlance the word 'mine' indicates danger, and if an Italian describes someone as 'una mina' they are calling that person a loose canon."
"The European Union must be united in its action and ensure that the production of landmines is stopped, that all stockpiles are destroyed and that the ground is cleared of mines, and that assistance and means of social and economic inclusion is provided for their victims, who include many children, while safeguarding the development of the community affected."
"In this sense, there must be a sharp focus on the issue and actions must be undertaken to further raise awareness in order to prevent the matter fading into obscurity."
"Both the report and the opinions of the Committees, which we are presenting today, stress the driving role played by Parliament and the European Union in the abolition of landmines and in the provision of financial aid to the UN."
"As Mrs Bonino said, very clearly and explicitly, the Commission's proposal for a regulation is a further step forward."
"We have tabled several amendments intended to achieve greater clarity and transparency and to consolidate and rationalise the budget lines and our endeavours in the areas of mine clearance and stockpile destruction."
"These endeavours are carried out in conjunction with many NGOs, to whom all credit is due for convincing people that it is impossible to defer the issue any more."
"The Union does, however, have a weak point - a number of weak points - namely that we need to put pressure on Finland, which has not yet signed the Ottawa Convention, and on Greece, which has not ratified it, or Europe will lack credibility when it promotes the adherence of all countries to the Convention and raises the question - which we have also raised in the oral question which we are going to put to the Commission - of whether the candidate countries have to sign the Ottawa Convention before they become Members of the Union."
"The Unmine Monitor report for 2000 clearly shows the progress achieved through the Ottawa Convention."
"There has certainly been a reduction on a world-wide scale in terms of production and trade and stockpiles etc., with a fall in the number of victims, although the figures are still too high."
"A great many issues remain unresolved, especially since countries such as the United States have not yet signed the Convention and countries such as China and Russia hold enormous stockpiles."
"Europe must find a way to ensure that these stockpiles are eliminated from history but linger in our memories as a reminder that we must stop killing people with our lethal products."
"Mr President, we are all aware - in fact this has just been mentioned by Mrs Bonino and Mrs Morgantini - of how tragic the results of the use of anti-personnel landmines are and how serious the problem is given the large number of landmines that remain in place and primed on the ground."
"Some say there are 70 to 100 million of them."
"Hence the importance and timeliness of the Ottawa Convention, under which the international community is to take concerted action to put an end to this tragedy, which affects the poorest countries most of all."
"Difficulties do remain, because certain major countries - which have already been mentioned - have not yet signed the Convention."
"In this respect we can only regret the fact that one Member State, Finland, has not yet signed and another, Greece, has not yet proceeded to ratification, as Mrs Morgantini has just pointed out."
"This raises the first question: the need for the European Union, especially the Commission, to do everything possible to encourage non-signatory countries to sign the Ottawa Convention."
"It would be desirable if the Commission could tell us what it intends to do in this area, particularly with regard to the countries applying to join the European Union."
"But of course its authority in this field will be greater if the Council and the Member States explicitly state that the European Union will under no circumstances in its external relations use anti-personnel landmines or help in their use."
"It is, however, essential to ensure the greatest coherence and coordination between the actions taken by the European Union and those taken by the Member States."
"In this field, too, the Commission can and should play an invaluable role, and it should tell us what it proposes to do in future in this context."
"The Community actions to be taken in this field must also benefit from adequate budgetary support if they are to be as effective as possible."
"The Commission' s draft regulation seems too vague."
"We are firmly in favour of setting up a single budget line for action against landmines, except for research and food aid, and I believe it would be beneficial at the same time to set up a central unit coordinating all actions in this field, as mentioned by Mrs Bonino."
"As for the actions to take, it is essential to guarantee that existing landmines - the enormous landmine stockpiles - will be destroyed so as to prevent them from finding their way onto the black market."
"It is equally essential to put an end to their production."
"Other mine-clearance or victim-support actions will be of little use if we continue to produce and trade in landmines."
"We must act first in the area of prevention."
"Afterwards we must invest more in research, especially research into the detection of mines placed in the ground."
"Lastly, it is crucial that we reinforce mine-clearance action by ensuring the effectiveness of the actions taken and by giving priority to the countries that respect the Convention, just as it is also essential that we guarantee victim rehabilitation measures."
"I would also like the Commission to explain in greater detail what it intends to do in these fields, bearing in mind past experience and the important role that the European Union has taken on in this area."
"The field of action is, of course, vast and requires funding and great political will."
"The challenge is enormous, but the extent of this tragedy demands that we make an enormous effort and commitment to put an end to this situation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know what the consequences of anti-personnel mines are, even if there may often be important military justifications for them in individual cases."
"They result in immeasurable suffering, especially among civilians and children."
"But they also often destroy countries' long-term development potential by contaminating entire regions."
"For this reason it is extremely positive that the Commission and the European Union are tackling this subject as a whole and wish to ensure that a coordinated policy is adopted in this area."
"Our question to the Commission is intended to encourage it to continue down this path and to strengthen this initiative still further."
"I say this because we do indeed need coordination between the efforts of Europe and other international players, areas benefiting from development funds or actions directly administered by the Commission."
"Proper mine-clearance equipment therefore needs to be arranged and we need to finance research work on detection and clearance, and on equipment that is simple to use on the ground, which is particularly helpful for developing countries."
"There is also great potential for coordination in relation to personnel deployment, by which I mean both military personnel and civilians."
"My committee also suggests that you should consider seeking special deployment arrangements in cooperation with Eurocorps, making it possible for Europe to take the lead here."
"We also certainly need to designate priority areas for mine clearance so as to create special focal points."
"Not all countries have yet signed the international conventions, nor have they been ratified by all countries, for a wide variety of reasons."
"I believe that we therefore need to wage a campaign to make those in positions of political responsibility weigh up what the military benefit of mines is and what the consequences are for the people and the region."
"By weighing things up in this way they will realise that arms of this kind should no longer be used and that we should help these countries to find political alternatives to using such mines."
"I also believe that there must be a proper political framework in these regions so as to give such governments the political power to escape from this vicious circle, which means that, ostensibly, in trying to provide protection for themselves they ultimately harm their own population in the long term."
"I must therefore encourage the Commission to regard this not just as a technical starting point for providing some kind of financial support, but also as an important opportunity to create a political framework with a view to securing an improvement here."
"I should like to express my appreciation for the ambitious and constructive attitude of Parliament which is clearly reflected in the report by Mrs Bonino on the draft regulation, reinforcing the European Union's contribution to the fight against anti-personnel landmines."
"It is no surprise that a report by Mrs Bonino is such a powerful and important document."
"I am grateful but not surprised by the tone of the report."
"After all, the European Parliament took the lead in the Union in the fight against landmines."
"It was Parliament which first raised, in 1996, the issue of a horizontal budget line and of a proper legal base to provide a single platform for the wide range of actions that we undertake in this important field."
"Parliament was instrumental in galvanising the Union into taking a proactive role at the Ottawa Conference in 1997, which led to the conclusion of the Convention to ban and eradicate landmines."
"It is the challenge of implementing that Convention to the full which led the Commission to reflect on how to reinforce the contribution of the European Union to the battle against landmines."
"The result of that reflection is before you in the form of a proposal for a regulation."
"I should also like to mention the key role played by civil society, by highly motivated non-governmental organisations and, in particular, by the international campaign to ban landmines."
"Their efforts are essential for the successful implementation of the Convention and their pressure on governments around the world has contributed tremendously to the encouraging record of ratification and accession."
"Over the last eight years we have contributed over EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against landmines."
"In 1999 alone the Union spent more than EUR 100 million of which EUR 30 million was for Community projects, far more than any other international player."
"Some Members of the House may have seen the brochure that we prepared for the Ottawa Convention review conference last month, which shows the breadth of the interventions that we are making, covering every corner of the world and every aspect of mine action."
"I particularly commend the work of the Joint Research Centre."
"Being the largest contributor to this cause is not enough."
"The objective of the draft regulation is to allow us to define a strategic, overall approach and to measure our efforts against well-defined targets on the road to our common final objective of a world free of landmines."
"Before I comment on the excellent report before us on the draft regulation I should like to make a few general remarks in reply to the interesting and valuable speeches made by Mr Miranda and Mr Brok."
"Of course we share the objective of universalisation of the Ottawa Convention."
"The European Union has a clear position, set out in the 1997 joint action on extending signature and ratification of the Ottawa Convention to as many countries as possible."
"But I cannot hide this fact: the Union's powers of persuasion in seeking to achieve this goal are obviously somewhat limited by the remaining difficulties of some Member States in signing and ratifying the Convention."
"This is, to follow the speech of the honourable Member, a point which we put with some regularity to those Member States."
"Clearly, the granting of European Union mine-action support can work as an important lever to get potential beneficiary countries to sign up to the Convention."
"The communication and the draft regulation provide for a degree of conditionality in this respect, but we should not be too dogmatic."
"We have to acknowledge the specific situation in certain countries."
"We should not penalise people who need our help, even if their governments are not yet sufficiently committed to the implementation of the Convention."
"It is the usual dilemma that we face."
"It is a dilemma which the honourable Member has expressed with considerable eloquence in the past: the challenge we have again and again of providing humanitarian assistance is people where the humanitarian assistance is very often needed as a result of the actions of their governments."
"But we cannot penalise people when they have a lousy government."
"As for the applicant countries, we would expect them to support the joint action which I have just referred to."
"This is not Community acquis in the strict legal sense of that term, but we will obviously encourage them to do away with mines in their defence, to stop manufacturing mines or trading in them, and to sign and ratify the Mine Ban Treaty."
"If I may again follow a point Mr Miranda made earlier, I am particularly keen that we should also look at projects to destroy the existing stockpiles of landmines."
"It can be difficult environmentally and it is expensive but we should give that some priority in the future."
"I should like to draw Parliament's attention to the Slovenia International Trust Fund which, in only two years of operation, has set up a regional mine-action programme with support from the European Union, the United States and a number of other countries, with projects throughout the Balkans."
"After the events earlier this year in Zaghreb and the more recent events in Belgrade, we must hope that the future of south-east Europe is free of the setting of landmines."
"Enhancing coherence between Community and Member States' action, to which the honourable Member referred, is at the very heart of the communication which accompanies the draft regulation."
"We have adopted a flexible, coordinating approach rather than a rigid, centralising one."
"Mine action is most effective when it is tailored to the conditions which are specific to each situation."
"That is why we do not propose to pool all mine action, even within the Community framework, in a single programme and a single budget line."
"Instead, we are proposing to set up an expert group with participation from Member States, from non-governmental organisations and from the other relevant players."
"The intention is that this group should assist the Commission in drawing up an overall strategy for mine actions."
"Turning now specifically to the Bonino report, I would like to comment briefly on the very few amendments by Parliament which the Commission has some difficulty in taking on board in their current form."
"Some of them I have already touched on in my reply to the honourable Member."
"Firstly, as I have already mentioned, I think it would be a mistake, well-intentioned but nevertheless counter-productive, to make accession to the Ottawa Convention a hard and fast condition for European mine-action assistance."
"It goes without saying that we will only rarely agree to give assistance to countries which have not signed up to the Convention."
"But there are bound to be cases where, for political or humanitarian reasons, we wish to assist populations, despite their governments."
"So I would argue against Amendment No 18."
"While I understand and respect the ambition behind the proposal to concentrate all funds for mine action under the horizontal budget line, with the exception of ECHO and research lines, I am not convinced that this gives us the necessary flexibility to maximise the effectiveness of European Union interventions."
"It may be that over time the horizontal line will attract more attention and more appreciation, but we also need to maintain the link to broader national or regional programming through the geographic budget lines and regulations."
"I myself would say no to proposed Amendments Nos 3, 16 and 21."
"For the same reason I am confident that the human and administrative resources requested for the central mine action policy team are sufficient to guarantee the proper implementation of the regulation."
"We do not want to add new layers to our bureaucracy; a small team and proper networking can achieve the same results."
"I would propose to say no to Amendment No 17."
"Similarly, we do not want to create another committee, be it management or advisory."
"Parliament knows that there are far too many of them already and as the House knows, under our proposals for the reform of EC external assistance, we hope to move away from the heavy handed scrutiny of individual projects and instead focus our discussion with Member States on overall strategies and programming."
"It is what we are agreeing to do on MEDA, for example."
"This will be done in the various existing geographic committees."
"Instead of adding another one to the list, we propose the creation of an expert group which will give us a forum going beyond government experts where we can discuss and where we can define overall mine-action strategy to be applied horizontally and to be reviewed every year."
"Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 8, 22, 23, 25 and 29."
"Finally, on the contracting of mine-action projects, I would caution against the introduction of stricter limitations to the participation in our tenders."
"As well as pursuing local capacity-building and ownership, we must be able to draw on the best existing expertise and material wherever it is available."
"In most cases that will be within the European Union, but we may exceptionally have to turn elsewhere."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 19."
"I will not go through all the many amendments proposed by the honourable Member, which the Commission can readily accept and which will in my judgment significantly improve the draft regulation."
"These only confirm the sense of purpose and ambition which we all share."
"We have a lot of work still to do if we are to achieve the objectives of the Ottawa Convention to eradicate these mines within the next decade."
"The adoption of this regulation constitutes a small, but in my judgment an important step along that road."
"I hope that we can rely on the continued support of Parliament for the successful outcome of the legislative process."
"Mr President, some of us have been involved for many years in trying to overcome the scourge of anti-personnel landmines."
"It is an issue that has caught the public imagination in many of our countries."
"Governments have expressed their commitment and pledged large sums of money."
"NGOs have sprouted up in response to the need and yet, some four years after the first United Nation's landmine conference in Geneva and over a year after the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention, we must recognise that many countries and thousands of people, usually in the poorest regions of the world, are still terribly afflicted by anti-personnel landmines and unexploded munitions."
"Why is progress so slow?"
"It seems to me that the problems are threefold."
"Firstly, we need to be focused in our aims."
"The anti-personnel landmine campaign should not be used as an opportunity to attack western governments, particularly the United States, western military establishments, or western industry."
"For the most part, western governments are not the problem but part of the solution."
"We should concentrate our political attention on the real culprits: warring factions and irresponsible governments who have shown no concern about civil populations and who use anti-personnel landmines as indiscriminate weapons of terror."
"More importantly, practical mine action should focus on the priorities: making areas safe where the suspected presence of mines is a bar to resumption of normal life and economic development, and assistance to mine victims."
"Secondly, the international community needs to improve the coordination of its efforts both at the global level and particularly within the afflicted countries."
"The fact is we still do not know the true extent of landmine infestation and we do not know how effective efforts to clear mines have been."
"A rapid stocktaking exercise needs to be conducted in each of the most afflicted countries so that we can see more clearly what needs to be done."
"Thirdly, we need to ensure that money is spent well."
"I take some pride in the fact that the European Commission is the world's largest supporter of mine action."
"This is an area where, in view of the European Union's capacity for coordination of efforts by many countries, an application of large resources to the problem should be more effective."
"There are many reasons why the rhetoric has not been matched by reality."
"In a way, the landmine case characterises the wider failure of the Commission to make effective use of the resources at its disposal."
"The Commissioner for external relations has previously recognised that the Commission's external aid programmes have been an embarrassment."
"The Commission needs to improve both the quality of its programmes and their speed of implementation."
"Things are beginning to move in the right direction under Mr Patten's leadership."
"The Commission communication and the regulation on anti-personnel landmines are very useful documents, but they omit two key elements, which Parliament's amendments seek to correct."
"Multiannual funding for mine action must be concentrated on a single budget line and there must be a properly resourced unit within the Commission, specifically responsible not just for the policy framework but also for the planning and implementation of mine action, including contracts."
"Top-level commitment, proper direction and management with responsibility are the keys to the effective use of resources."
"Let us have no more gestures but real action and tangible results."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists shares the pride which Mr van Orden expressed a moment ago in the role of the European Union."
"A number of years ago, I visited a school class in Kabul, Afghanistan, and witnessed how children were told about the different types of landmines."
"And when I saw one of those landmines in the shape of a butterfly, I realised that landmines are designed so that children will play with them and get hurt, and it also gave me an insight into the moral value of those who manufacture this kind of product."
"I also saw then that the awareness campaigns in schools as well as amongst the population are the most effective tool to prevent victims."
"A substantial proportion of money should be earmarked for this. On behalf of my group, I welcome the relevant amendments with open arms."
"Secondly, it is obvious that we are often fighting a running battle, for while these mines were being cleared in Afghanistan by all kinds of associations, others were being re-laid elsewhere."
"And I am also casting my mind back to northern Mozambique, where I worked alongside organisations of handicapped people, injured by landmines, who got involved in the clearance and removal activities."
"This taught me two things."
"First, you have to involve the local population."
"People, even if they are injured, can manage a variety of things themselves."
"Second, I understood that the main aim of landmines is not to kill but to maim, and this makes this moral issue so loaded."
"When I arrived in Angola, I saw the Norwegian People' s Aid, and they used a method by which, together with the local population, they traced where the mines were and cleared certain areas very strategically."
"I took two things away from that experience: you need the experts, in this case the old soldiers of the Norwegian People's Aid and the local population - a crucial component - and you then need to clear the mines strategically."
"It is better to clear strategic regions, so that new life can be breathed into the local economy, etc. This got me onto the idea of not working with the national Angolan authority or via complex structures in the first instance, but of simply working with the authorities through strong NGOs among the local population in a well-organised manner, as is being attempted in Angola."
"At the same time, one realises that new landmines are being laid in Angola, and this brings me to the point which Mr Patten highlighted."
"Commissioner, you said that you were against a number of amendments."
"I believe, however, that if you were to study them again with more care, you would find that there are a few amendments you quoted which, in my view, concern the awareness campaigns, transparency, access for NGOs, as well as things which are going well at the moment but which could run more efficiently."
"I believe that you need not be afraid of the amendments tabled by Parliament in this respect."
"We do not want more bureaucracy or comitology; instead we want to create more room for you, we want things to be done efficiently, and I believe that our priorities in this respect are not a million miles apart."
"You may want to re-read a few paragraphs to see if all these points are really ripe for the bin, which is not so easy to admit for an English person."
"I believe that, as far as that is concerned, you and Parliament are on the same side."
"The Socialist Group feels part of this massive international anti-landmine campaign and we, together with other MEPs here, are proud of this."
"Mr President, anti-personnel mines are abominable beyond belief. Their purpose is not to kill but to disable and cause the worst possible pain and distress for the victims, their families and their countries."
"Think of the Soviet 'toy' bombs in Afghanistan."
"They are, unfortunately, incredibly cheap to produce and wildly expensive to find and destroy."
"It will take a hundred years to have them removed, and more and more of them are being scattered."
"It was the Liberal, Jan Willem Bertens who raised the matter five years ago in Parliament, and I think this Parliament can really pride itself on having set the ball in motion so that we are now on the way towards a ban on mines."
"We can also point to the very major and effective contribution the European Union is making on this issue."
"More still can be done, however."
"There are machines which can clear large areas of mines in a short period of time."
"I have seen such a machine in Kosovo, but it was idle and not in use."
"Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are right in saying that it makes obvious sense to destroy the stockpiles, because the cost of destroying a stockpiled mine is only a hundredth of that of destroying one which has been transported to a place where it is difficult to find."
"Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are also right to say that Parliament and the Council should not interfere with the administration, and I listened carefully to Mr Patten' s remarks on this point for he obviously thinks we should interfere still less."
"I agree in principle."
"We should refrain from getting involved in the administration."
"We should instead criticise the Commission if it does not engage in proper administration."
"We should not, however, be controlling the Commission from a distance."
"That is a mistake this Parliament is constantly making."
"The Commission must have the freedom to exercise its powers, and we for our part should be free to slam the Commission - if I may use that expression - if it does not do the work well."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mrs Bonino."
"It is refreshing to have such an experienced rapporteur."
"Thank you for a good report."
"Mr President, very rarely from within the established power structures does anything new emerge."
"The ban on anti-personnel mines has led to a process that is an excellent example of how NGOs and the European Parliament have been able to define and pursue with determination aims the statesmen either shun or consider unrealistic."
"In the wake of the breakthrough at Ottawa we now have to ensure that the Union and its Member States attend to the continued action that is vital both in bilateral relations and internal legislation and maintain a leading role, as political will is being strengthened and sustained, so that the agreement is signed and ratified comprehensively, and by my own country, Finland, also."
"It must also be made a precondition of EU membership for the candidate countries, i.e. become incorporated in the acquis communautaire."
"The report under discussion and, in particular, the splendidly expressed opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation create the prerequisites for continued action, with the emphasis on actual mine clearance and attendant operations and not on seeking exotic and extremely costly technological solutions."
"Biosensors are proving to be very promising in this regard."
"The Brok resolution, for its part, offers a political dimension to this work and the questions for oral answer put to the Commission by Mr Brok and Mr Miranda offer guidelines that are of major importance."
"All the institutions of the EU must work on their own initiative and in a way that the poor countries that suffer worst from the mines problem are effectively included in the programme."
"The main responsibility for monitoring will naturally fall to the Commission, but we must all play a part in ensuring that joint voluntary work to remove this scourge worldwide is concluded as quickly as possible."
"We can leave behind us a world without mines."
"Mr President, our group has a history of calling for the entire spectrum of measures and action needed, from suspending production to destroying stocks, stopping trading, clearing mine fields, rehabilitating victims and raising public awareness."
"However, I should like to make the following comment: the number of mines placed increases in direct proportion to the international community's inability to find political solutions to major problems."
"When, for example, a country feels insecure along its border with another country, its government will take recourse, wrongly of course, to the easy option of a minefield."
"When the international community cannot deal with the poison of nationalism and confrontation or help find political solutions, those involved will be more willing to take recourse to minefields."
"We must bear this in mind because it seems to me, as far as the Balkans are concerned, that the West and the European Union must take their share of the responsibility, as the result of their political interventions, for the fact that half the Balkans are a total minefield."
"I would like to end by saying that special action is needed in the Balkans and I should like to use this platform to say that the Greek Government should ratify the Ottowa Convention at once."
"Mr President, the Cambodians call mines 'everlasting sentinels' ."
"These death traps, set off by chance by the victims themselves, sometimes many years after a conflict is over, are real time bombs that hinder the social and economic recovery of whole regions and the rehabilitation of the victims themselves."
"As a signatory to the appeal for a world without mines, I fervently support Emma Bonino's report, because it is heading in the right direction."
"Two years after the signing of the Ottawa Convention, the stockpile of mines remains, alas, an impressive one, at least as far as those that have been recorded is concerned."
"For those that have still not been recorded, it is time to invent new methods of detection and identification."
"It is essential for the European Union's financial input to complement national schemes."
"Moreover, the European Union as a whole and the candidate countries must sign the Ottawa Convention and, more importantly, ratify it."
"A very great deal is at stake here, for while war may have its rules, common law for some and codified law for others, the use of anti-personnel mines is not covered by them."
"Eliminating them is no longer a military problem but a humanitarian issue."
"Europe cannot confine itself to acting as provider of funds."
"It is up to Europe to take the lead in considering the most appropriate mechanism, prior to deploying any new weapon."
"Then it is up to the States to support the process in international fora."
"To conclude, Europe must support and deepen the Ottawa process to ensure that we do not have another weapon creating dozens of victims every 20 minutes, as is happening now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly support the Community's initiative against anti-personnel mines."
"I only have to picture children mutilated by mines to reach the very personal conclusion that every euro spent on opposing this madness is money well spent."
"One point that NGO representatives have criticised in conversation with me is the combination of military activity with NGO work found in points 11 and 15 of the resolution."
"In the course of many years' work, the NGOs have won people's confidence and respect, and I fear that such a combination could compromise the independence of the NGOs and permanently damage their relationship of trust with people in need."
"People have a justified mistrust of uniformed personnel, born of many years of war."
"We should therefore do everything we can to provide continuing support for the work of NGOs."
"Mr President, I will speak very briefly during my allotted minute, just to express regret that the Council is not represented at such an important debate, although it is quite obviously the institution with the greatest scope for action in the field our Members are discussing at this moment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Bonino personally for all her work."
"The Ottawa Convention represents an important step in the international campaign to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines."
"I therefore very much welcome the fact that this new regulation is to implement that convention with an EU strategy for improving the coordination, coherence, transparency and control of these actions on mines."
"The European Union also has to live up to its claim to play a leading role in this area."
"The Austrian Federal Government has always given this subject the highest priority."
"As we have already heard today, Parliament has been dealing with this subject for many years."
"Parliament is the driving force behind all these efforts, and I believe that we should step up these efforts still further."
"At this point I wish to specifically stress that we need to call upon further States to sign or promptly ratify the Ottawa Convention, so as to assist international coordination and rehabilitation of mine victims."
"First and foremost, the EU Member States should sign the Convention."
"I regard this as a duty of solidarity within the European Community."
"Mines are of course a great obstacle to reconstruction in these countries and to the return of refugees."
"As long as this danger exists, it will be very difficult to persuade people who have fled their homes to return."
"The European Union is often the most important contributor to financing de-mining actions, and international actions are carried out in the relevant countries."
"The problem of anti-personnel mines is too big for the regions directly affected, and also for the refugees in the areas involved, so that without international cooperation it is not possible to provide effective support here."
"The international community must adopt a coherent and coordinated approach."
"Further progress needs to be made with support for de-mining programmes, assistance for mine victims, and research and technological development."
"It is imperative for a ban to be imposed on producing mines in the EU and on exporting mines from the EU."
"This objective should be an absolute priority for us all."
"Mr President, I am pleased that we finally have European legislation, in the form of a regulation, on anti-personnel landmines and that today we have a good report on the subject by Mrs Bonino."
"In the previous term of office - as we have heard - the European Parliament approved the commitment by the European Union to fight against one of the cruellest, most lethal, most cowardly weapons in existence."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation - as Mr Patten has said - introduced a budget line in 1996 dedicated to de-mining."
"However, this heading line nonetheless unfortunately decreasing in inverse proportion to the emphasis we are placing on this matter here."
"Given that we are now approving the budget, I will linger a moment over the figures that worry me."
"This year the figure was EUR 8,100,000."
"For the coming year, the Council and the Commission have agreed to reduce the total to EUR 7,400,000 and Parliament proposes an increase of EUR 3 million compared with the year 2000."
"These figures are not much to solve a problem that affects 110 million people in 64 countries, 26,000 victims of mutilations every year and, vitally, the many children who are described in countries such as El Salvador as the broken children, as these children are maimed, missing their hands, arms or legs."
"I therefore ask that the importance of increasing this amount be conveyed to the Council, which is not represented here, and to the Commission, given that unfortunately, for each mine that is cleared, between 20 and 50 others are laid."
"At the current de-mining rate it would - as was mentioned earlier - take well over 100 years to clear the planet of anti-personnel landmines."
"I therefore ask that, although it is not enough, account be taken of the amount proposed by Parliament and that it should contribute to respecting the Ottawa Convention and I ask those countries that have not signed it or ratified it to do so."
"Since various comments have been made, I would like to specify that although the Minister is not present, the Council is represented by senior civil servants, who will of course pass our words on to him."
"Mrs Bonino, one minute in which to talk about a report which really speaks volumes about your commitment is very little, but I am happily in agreement with most of the conclusions of the report, including the implied criticism of those countries which have still not ratified the Ottowa Convention."
"My own country took all too long to do so, unfortunately."
"There is a problem in the report."
"In my opinion, there is a tendency to try to relieve the CFSP of civil assignments."
"I believe it is healthy to strengthen the civil obligations of any organisation which has military activities."
"What I mean in actual fact is that, in addition to carrying out their normal developmental and humanitarian activities, the Council, the CFSP and the Member States should be required to match any amount spent on military activities with at least a corresponding amount for civil activities, for example mine clearance in the relevant areas."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a very sad subject today."
"I am sure we are all at least in agreement that anti-personnel mines should be outlawed worldwide."
"I would like to subdivide this topic into three major areas."
"The first area is that of prevention."
"I am sure we in this Chamber agree that existing mines, and especially anti-personnel mines, must be destroyed."
"When I think of the problems and the events in developing countries, such as those in the ACP area or in Central America, it is evident that things cannot continue like this."
"Another point I regard as vital is that we need to tackle the black market, especially in Africa."
"The second important area for me is follow-up action."
"In this area we have to pay special attention to de-mining programmes and humanitarian actions."
"In particular, research initiatives in this area need to be supported, especially those concerned with technology for detecting and clearing mines."
"However, nor should we ignore the fact that the European Union, and in particular the European Parliament, is increasingly in a position to check more effectively where the money we intend for this purpose is actually going."
"The third area I have in mind concerns specific measures that ought to be proposed, examined and implemented."
"I believe that we should pay special attention to the victims of mines."
"These are, for the most part, private individuals, civilians, children and child soldiers - another topic that we have already discussed. With regard to children who have been mutilated in this way and therefore need long-term care, there is now the possibility of providing ""growing"" prostheses, which in Europe ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, what we are basically doing in today's debate on the Bonino report, an excellent report, is codifying measures to deal with an extremely serious international problem."
"The Titley report, which we voted on a few days ago, basically represents a second step forward on questions of common foreign, defence and security policy which will, I believe, slowly but surely build up into a global policy for the European Union with flesh on its bones in the form of uniform terms and uniform rules."
"I think that time will prove that those who took the initiative were right and we will stop seeing charity workers alongside children with their legs blown off, given that the policy should work as a policy of prevention rather than repression."
"It is no coincidence that most mines are to be found in crisis areas, i.e. in areas where a different sort of initiative could have been taken in order to resolve the crisis."
"Now to a question which was touched on in connection with my country, Greece."
"I am certain that the Greek Government will not delay in ratifying the convention in question, given that it has already signed it as a country."
"However, we must bear in mind that it will do so despite the fact that 'neighbouring Turkey' does not have the best of intentions vis-à-vis Greece."
"This is, unfortunately, a fact of life and was brought home to us again recently, last week in fact, during NATO exercises, which were seen as an opportunity for a different kind of policy in the form of a show of intransigence."
"But let us hope that the future will bring a solution to these problems."
"Be that as it may, I believe that the majority vote which this report will receive here in Parliament will strengthen it to the point at which even those who do not have eyes to see or ears to listen will see and will listen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Mrs Bonino's report, which provides for greater efficiency and transparency, and on which the Committee on Development and Cooperation has given its opinion."
"I would like to thank her for her outstanding work."
"I witnessed the suffering of mine victims with my own eyes during and after the war in Bosnia, in 1992, 1995 and 1999."
"Many victims are small children, who suffer terrible trauma and appalling mutilation, and whose lives are destroyed before they have even started properly."
"Every child that we can protect from death or terrible injuries because of mines, be it in Bosnia, Africa or elsewhere, makes all our efforts worthwhile."
"I would also like to sincerely thank the non-governmental organisations for their commitment."
"I would briefly like to comment on one point, and this concerns our amendment to the motion for a resolution."
"There is no worldwide consensus in favour of banning anti-vehicle mines."
"They are still regarded as essential protection against armoured vehicles throughout the world and within NATO."
"No one should seek to belittle the achievements of Ottawa by saying that anti-vehicle mines should have been included."
"In that case the Convention would certainly have been doomed to failure from the outset."
"With regard to the enlargement of the EU, the candidate countries absolutely must sign the Ottawa Convention."
"The USA, Russia and China should be urged to sign the Convention."
"Greece and Finland should ratify the Convention as soon as possible."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that I would dearly like to see all mines banned throughout the world, as they are some of the most diabolical and repulsive arms that exist."
"Unfortunately, however, we are not in that utopian world."
"Mr President, one day in December 1992, a young shepherd in Mozambique forgot the risk: he thought it had gone with the coming of peace."
"That over-confidence cost him his left leg."
"Two kilometres away from a hamlet in Bosnia, in 1999, a sign indicated the presence of mines in a field, but this did not stop a little boy going there."
"For him it was a place to play, like any other."
"Indeed, every time a war ends, people leave the refugee camps to return to their villages, hoping to lick their wounds and attempt gradually to rebuild a normal life."
"But a mine is impervious to peace agreements and continues, inexorably, to do its job."
"Even though 139 states have now signed the Ottawa Convention, mines are still doing their job of destruction."
"Every 20 minutes somewhere in the world a mine will explode, bringing death or mutilation."
"Of course, the Geneva Conference has brought some progress and we must stress that positive trend, for it really is the result of the determined battle the NGOs have long been waging."
"However, the progress made should not blind us to the reality, and that reality is a total of 27 people killed and another 41 mutilated every single day."
"The reality is 250 million mines in the arsenals of 105 countries."
"Even last year, mines were used in 20 conflicts, mainly in Europe."
"So I welcome the work done by my fellow Members, Emma Bonino and Luisa Morgantini, who have once again brought the political debate into the heart of this Parliament."
"They make it clear how much we still need to do."
"For my part, I want to highlight the need to adopt the convention universally so that it may become a total success, firstly by ensuring the compliance of the laws of the various states, so as not to have yet another example of an international agreement that fails to be applied."
"We must indeed put pressure on those European Union countries that have not signed it, like Finland, or not ratified it, like Greece."
"Why not consider sanctions, Commissioner, against those who do not respect the agreements?"
"Why not include a clause on accession to this convention in the enlargement conditions?"
"You replied to all that a moment ago."
"I know there are still differences of opinion on this or that amendment."
"Yet I would ask you to look at them more carefully, because some of them are acceptable to the Commission."
"Whatever the outcome, we will all of us together show that we are determined to fight against what has to be called 'a cowards' war' ."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, war is a cruel way of solving people' s differences."
"It is tragic when the civil population suffers as a result of its leaders' lack of skills and experience."
"The Ottawa Convention, which restricts the use of mines, is a very worthwhile endeavour."
"Too many children have lost their lives or become crippled while playing in a danger zone."
"The EU' s aid programme is necessary and I fully back it."
"It is our duty to help nations that are suffering as a result of political mistakes made long ago."
"In some countries there are more mines than there are truffles in France, and both are as hard to find."
"Although I am in favour of ending the misuse of mines, I do wish to raise the issue of the problems that Finland has in this connection."
"Finland has not signed the Ottawa Convention, and reference has been made to that quite often here, as in the case of the previous speaker also."
"The criticisms, however, are sanctimonious and based on ignorance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, just look at Finland."
"The country is sparsely populated and it has a land border with Russia that is more than a thousand kilometres long."
"The history we share with our neighbour has often been full of anguish."
"We must fall back on the old Roman truth: the best way to keep the peace is to prepare for war."
"The mines are an essential part of Finland' s defences. They cannot be used to conquer other countries, but are only used for purposes of defence."
"All the mines in Finland are safely stored and are not exported to other countries. Their use is subject to stringent discipline."
"I would like to stress this. Furthermore, all the mines are easy to remove in the wake of any conflict."
"Finland cannot be put in the same category as many less developed countries, where the use of mines is very random and the inevitable consequences of that are evident."
"It must be realised that Finland spends large sums of money on mine clearance in other countries."
"In practice, this means removing mines with Finnish equipment, providing assistance for victims, and the destruction of mine stores."
"This work supports the EU' s efforts."
"Finland has already, for its own part, taken responsibility for the world' s mine problem."
"This must, nonetheless, come about in such a way that one' s own country' s security is not compromised as a result of political pressures."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that today we have the honour of welcoming to the official gallery a delegation of Moroccan MPs, led by Mr Ibrahim Rachidi, Vice-President of the Chamber of Representatives of the Kingdom of Morocco."
"Allow me to welcome you on behalf of our institution, with which your country maintains privileged relations within the context of our joint project to construct an area of prosperity, safety and peace in the Mediterranean basin."
"In the run-up to the 4th Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference which will take place on 15 and 16 November in Marseilles, I am sure that your work with our Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, led by Mr Obiols, will enable our project for dialogue and peace to progress."
"Anti-personnel mines (continuation)"
"Mr President, years ago when the international campaigns for landmine-clearance began, it used to be said that landmines were the poor countries' atomic bomb."
"Despite the time that has passed, this apparent exaggeration may still unfortunately serve to describe the situation."
"There can be no development without safe roads, without suitable land for cultivation and without places where children can play freely."
"That is why the European Union joined and has come to play a leading role in the international campaign started by the United Nations, as has already been mentioned by the previous speakers."
"We can now clearly see the merit of the proposal put before us, upon which Mrs Bonino has based her report."
"I support this report and any other initiative to restate the role of the European Union in this objective."
"I must stress that for this to occur the effort of the European Union must be more cohesive, bringing in Finland and Greece; the European Union must coordinate all its power to exert international pressure on those countries that have not yet accepted the Ottawa Convention; and the European effort must become more effective, for example through an increase in funding, taking into account the need for safe mine clearance, the systematic destruction of existing stockpiles and the further development of advanced mine detection and clearance technologies."
"This effort must also be made more effective through coordination and monitoring of the processes, giving NGOs a more extensive role to play."
"Lastly, I hope that among the future tasks of the European common military force will be the training of technicians, particularly of people with a local interest in the eradication of landmines."
"Mr President, the Finnish Government last debated the question of anti-personnel mines on 14 June 1999."
"At the time it was decided to look into how Finland might be a party to the Ottawa Convention in 2006 and replace anti-personnel mines with other defence methods by the end of 2010."
"The Finns are involved in international cooperation with regard to mine clearance."
"Experts from Finland and Finnish clearance vehicles have taken part in clearance programmes in Cambodia for two and a half years, and in Mozambique and Kosovo for one year."
"As party to the convention, Finland complies with the regulations in the amended Mine Protocol in the Convention on Conventional Weapons 1996, which came into force in December 1998."
"Finland does not feel it is militarily threatened."
"However, we are the only EU country to have a land border with an external superpower that is more than a thousand kilometres long."
"Finland herself is responsible for her credible defence arrangement."
"Until a replacement military arrangement, which costs approximately half of Finland' s defence budget for one year, is in place, anti-personnel mines will remain a part of the defence arrangement."
"In Finland, there is not one anti-personnel mine that has been placed in the ground."
"Finland has never engaged in the export of anti-personnel mines and none have been manufactured in the country since 1981."
"All the mines are in storage."
"In Finland, no harm has come to civilians or Finnish soldiers from Finnish anti-personnel mines since the period of clearance that came in the wake of the Second World War that ended in the 1940s."
"Finland is one of the unfortunately few countries in the world that sign and ratify international agreements only when they can meet the conditions they contain to the last letter."
"And that is how it will also happen with regard to anti-personnel mines."
"Mr President, as I agree with almost everything my colleagues have said, I do not want to repeat it, so I shall give up my speaking time."
"That is the best thing we can do now so that we move on to the vote."
"To close the debate, I have received one proposal for a resolution, pursuant to Article 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Vote"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolutions consecutively)"
"Report without debate (A5-0085/2000) by Mr Mastorakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning the distribution of authorisations among Member States received through the Agreements establishing certain conditions for the carriage of goods by road and the promotion of combined transport between the European Community and the Republic of Bulgaria and the European Community and the Republic of Hungary [COM(1999) 667 - C5-0335/1999 - 1999/0264(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0286/2000) by Mrs Bonino, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on action against anti-personnel mines [COM(2000) 111 - C5-0158/2000 - 2000/0062(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission Communication on the New Social Agenda [COM(2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219(COS)]"
"Van Lancker (PSE), rapporteur."
"(NL) Mr President, before we commence with the voting, I would like to ask you if you could ask the services to revise the language versions in the final version with due care."
"Problems have arisen with the translation of the words ""aanpassing van de werktijd"" [adaptation of working time] and the words ""gecombineerd werken"" [multi-salary employment]."
"I would ask you to ask your services to refer to the original French version."
"Mrs Van Lancker, your request is one that our services must respond to."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0812/2000) on the Informal European Council in Biarritz"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0813/2000) on the Informal European Council in Biarritz"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Motion for a joint resolution (B5-0814/2000) on the Informal European Council in Biarritz"
"(Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution)"
"Report (A5-0289/2000) by Mr Duhamel, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the constitutionalisation of the Treaties [2000/2160(INI)]"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to embark on a historic vote on a highly symbolic document, namely the European Constitution."
"Yet it really would be a pity if we voted on a report littered with legal implausibility, with formal trash."
"That cannot be our legacy to history."
"I therefore propose, Mr President, that we refer this report back to committee, for cleaning up, so that this historic vote is not polluted by formal inconsistencies."
"A request has been made, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, to refer the report back to Committee."
"Could I now hear one speaker for the request and one against, if there are any. Otherwise I will put Mr Martinez's request to the vote."
"Mr President, I think that as far as trash is concerned we have had an example of this in Mr Martinez' s statement."
"I do believe that today the far right is indeed talking trash in regard to the establishment of European democracy and that the Constitution will be a step towards building that democracy."
"(Parliament rejected the request to refer the report back to Committee)"
"Following the vote on Amendment No 33:"
"Mr President, we have a slight problem with the wording."
"We have just improved Paragraph 19."
"But as a result of this little textual substitution we have let fall by the wayside an important principle that the European Parliament has always called for."
"The fact is that, whatever our opinion on either side, whether we are for or against a constitution, we all agree that our Parliament should give its assent."
"Thanks to this substitution, the term found in the original paragraph has been left out."
"So, with the agreement of Olivier Duhamel, the rapporteur, I suggest incorporating this principle in the last line of Paragraph 20, which would therefore read as follows: ""from the moment the process is initiated up to the approval (after receiving the assent of the European Parliament) of the final version of the Constitution"" ."
"We would add these eight words. That addition would bring Parliament into line with all its debates and all its votes."
"Are there any objections to the inclusion of these eight words read out by Mr Onesta?"
"There are no objections?"
"Good, then let us proceed to the vote on this amendment."
"Mr President, this is not an oral amendment to Amendment No 8."
"It is an oral amendment to the original text."
"You have just said to Amendment No 8 (or so I understood from the interpretation)."
"That is not the case. It is a direct oral amendment to the text."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to inform you that I voted for Mrs Bonino's report, which very commendably aims to contribute to averting the injuries sustained in peace time from these means of destruction."
"I would, however, like to add that it would be appropriate for Parliament to concern itself with the real causes of the damage caused not only by anti-personnel mines but by all the weapons used by the human race."
"The responsibility for these actions lies above all in the insanity of the Heads of State and Government of many of the world's states, and in the insanity of too many citizens who believe they can resolve their problems through war."
"This must end."
"Mr President, our group voted in favour of this report."
"It is extremely important and we commend the European Parliament which played a very important role in the campaign to ban anti-personnel mines."
"The NGOs have played a fundamental role."
"They have pushed for a long time to get this through while some governments were very reluctant, saying it was unrealistic."
"But if the will is there a lot can be achieved."
"Governments must take a leading role and be forced to sign the Convention."
"They must insist upon the new applicant countries signing the Convention as well."
"When you look at what is happening around the world, it is intolerable that long after wars have ended people continue to suffer as a result of landmines."
"Innocent civilians, women and men, and particularly children have been maimed and killed as a result of a weapon that was in place long after the war ended."
"The idea that industries make money out of such inhumane materials is quite unacceptable."
"Someone mentioned earlier the other weapons that are produced."
"We must look at the production of all weapons, not just landmines, especially in the European Union since we must look outside our own front door first."
"It is not acceptable or ethical that we are providing jobs or making money with things that kill, maim and injure people."
"We should seek alternatives."
"The idea that technology, know-how and money is spent on creating weapons that destroy people and the environment is unacceptable."
"The move on landmines shows that progress can be made towards a humane society which does not profit from death and destruction."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the report on action to be taken against anti-personnel mines."
"The Commission' s communication sets out what actions the Community has already participated in to combat the use of anti-personnel mines."
"Denmark has participated in humanitarian mine clearance on a number of occasions when the intervention concerned has been civil rather than military."
"There has therefore been no conflict with the Danish opt-out in the field of defence."
"The actions were financed with resources from many different budget lines."
"The Commission therefore proposes that initiatives be taken to set up a horizontal budget line."
"Parliament supports this solution because the present structure, with many different budget lines, is not transparent and does not contribute to coherent intervention."
"It is still uncertain what legal base the Commission wants to propose for this initiative."
"It is therefore also difficult right now to predict whether the initiative will clash with the Danish opt-out."
"It will, however, be annoying if Denmark cannot participate in a project whose purpose is completely to do away with the feared and inhumane anti-personnel mines in the course of the next ten to fifteen years."
"I strongly support the EP's decision to take positive action against anti-personnel landmines."
"There is a an obligation on the part of the EU to take a stance against weapons which are aimed at non-combatants, the victims of which are largely non-combatants."
"Also, the blanketing of large areas of territory makes it impossible for the growing of food many years after conflict has ended."
"Even if we support the main intention of the report, we do not in any event agree with the ways described for achieving its aim."
"We perceive a problem in the CFSPs being 'relieved' of responsibility for civil actions."
"What is more, a serious policy for peace and security could better be achieved if CFSP resources and the Member States' resources for military action were to be supplied in a ratio of one to one, with increased appropriations for humanitarian actions."
"Finland is aiming to become party to the Ottawa Convention in 2006 and replace anti-personnel mines with other military systems by the end of 2010."
"At no stage has Finland exported anti-personnel mines to other countries."
"Finland has produced and stored anti-personnel mines exclusively for its own defence needs."
"Defence expenditure in Finland has traditionally been amongst the lowest in Europe."
"The decision to give up anti-personnel mines presents an enormous challenge to Finnish national defence."
"Anti-personnel mines are a weapon of defence."
"Or can someone tell me how anti-personnel mines could be used in an attack?"
"They play a major role in the Finnish defence strategy."
"Replacement programme solutions are being planned for discussion, in connection with a new investigation into defence, to take place by the year 2005."
"Still to be examined are questions of financing, replacement systems and methods, and the effects of solutions on the development of defence doctrine."
"Finland will continue with its participation in international cooperation relating to both the aim on a total ban and mine clearance."
"As a small country, we too have headed the fight against the use of landmines."
"Europe is in the vanguard of the mine-clearing and destruction programmes."
"This is also why I endorsed the Bonino report."
"I would like to draw particular attention to a technology for tracing mines which has been tailored to this field."
"After all, one in a hundred mine-clearers will sooner or later fall victim to this activity, as a result of inaccurate detection methods."
"The use of bio-sensors, such as trained dogs and rats, appears to yield particularly good results in practice."
"Yet, the financial resources are mainly earmarked for developing high-tech military detection techniques."
"Van Lancker report (A5-0291/2000)"
"Mr President, as a member of the European People's Party and, more importantly, as a member of the Pensioners' Party, and although none of the amendments I tabled in Committee were accepted, I can only vote for Mrs Van Lancker's report, particularly since point g thereof calls upon the Commission to establish a minimum pension for all the citizens of the European Union."
"We in this Parliament discuss tyre pressures and the length of vehicles, but we have not yet succeeded in grasping how important it is for there to be a common regulation throughout the 15 Member States establishing a decent minimum pension."
"This is why I voted for the report."
"The Van Lancker report outlines a few general principles, such as the right to a pension or a minimum salary and the right to strike, something the EU Council' s text, the only one with the value of a decision, does not even mention."
"For the rest, the rapporteur calls on Parliament to approve the supposed social policy the Commission has proposed to the Council, in other words, to approve a total vacuum, for there is not a single practical measure likely to improve the situation of the workers."
"There is nothing to force big firms to create jobs and they can even carry on shedding jobs when they make big profits."
"The leaders of the European Union are asking the two sides of industry to play a greater part in the areas of employment that come within their remit, but that is pure cynicism."
"As if employers and employees were actually on an equal footing when it came to hiring."
"It is like accusing the jobless of being at least partially to blame for their own unemployment."
"So, while we voted to endorse the elementary social rights, in abstaining, we have rejected the general policy of complicity with the brutal practices of big business, which, throughout Europe, is making workers redundant, holding wages in check, creating more widespread job insecurity and weakening social protection."
"I want to welcome the work done on the social agenda by the French Presidency and by Martine Aubry, in terms of both form and content, and I therefore offer warm congratulations to Mrs Van Lancker."
"This agenda, which goes back to an initiative by the French Presidency, is a genuine programme of work for the next five years."
"It is in keeping with the decisions of the Lisbon European Council, whose main conclusions relate to establishing a more competitive knowledge-based economy and achieving full employment."
"It was drawn up in consultation with the European institutions and the NGOs, which were kept fully involved."
"The Van Lancker report takes account of some of the proposals made by civil society and experts at the joint conference on the subject between the European Commission and the European Parliament on 21 and 22 September 2000."
"So this agenda sends out a strong political message to European citizens, who all too often perceive Europe as merely the creation of a large market."
"It highlights the existence and reality of the European social model, but also the need to bring it up to date."
"We do not have the right to disappoint our citizens."
"The social agenda must therefore be very ambitious in order to confirm that social, economic and employment policies are closely interlinked and interacting, and that they must have equal status in the Community policy triangle, with the aim of improving the social quality of life for all."
"Indeed, social policy must be a policy in its own right, with its own objectives."
"It cannot be seen solely as an adjunct of economic and employment policy or as a by-product of creating a large single market, and even less as mere ""dross"" ."
"In the five years to come, we will have to create quality jobs, anticipate and manage the adjustments to the new social environment, draw on the opportunities offered by a knowledge-based economy, modernise and improve social protection, promote social inclusion, encourage gender equality, reinforce fundamental rights and combat discrimination."
"I welcome the adoption at Nice of this social agenda, which, together with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, shows that we have reached a turning point in European integration, which, at present, seeks to strengthen the social and civil fabric of the Union."
"The European Union as a political and economic entity is growing from strength to strength."
"However, economic achievement is not the sole criteria to judge European Union legislators."
"It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that key social problems within our community are solved and tackled head-on."
"In this regard, I welcome the acceptance by the European Commission of the Irish Government' s Human Resources Operational Programme for the seven-year period 2000-2006."
"This is a very fair and balanced social programme and is one of the very central planks of the Irish Government' s National Development Plan for the seven-year period post-1999."
"It will ensure that opportunities will be given to those who are unskilled and uneducated."
"Particular emphasis will be placed on putting in place schemes to help the long-term unemployed as well as to help those who are early school leavers."
"There is also a recognition in this plan, which is reflected in the EU Social Policy Agenda 2000-2005, of the need to ensure that re-training opportunities are given to people in the existing workforce."
"The EU Social Policy Agenda recognises that re-training opportunities must be given in the field of technology and Internet activities for the existing workforce."
"Technology is changing so rapidly that if the European Union is to keep a competitive edge then our European Union workforce must be equipped with the necessary computer skills."
"Adaptability of the workforce and the encouragement of entrepreneur skills are also central planks of the Irish Government' s plans for the next seven years."
"For this policy to be a success at home and for it to succeed within the broader European Union context then it is an imperative that second-level and third-level institutions put in place policies to implement entrepreneurship in Europe."
"This report represents a major step forward on the road to building a social and employment Europe."
"It draws on the Lisbon Summit conclusions, with a view to achieving an agreement at Nice on establishing a European Social Agenda, as a foundation of European social policy for the next five years (2000-2005)."
"It offers a global and coherent vision of what a genuine social policy could look like, by linking economic, social and employment aspects."
"It uses all the instruments that now exist at European Union level - the Social Charter, the employment chapter, the legal base of Article 13 - to combat all forms of discrimination, etc."
"Our rapporteur endorses the European Commission's proposals, while supplementing them with a call for stronger European social legislation."
"He calls for the role of the social partners concerned, and dialogue with them, to be reinforced in the framing of legislation."
"However, in the event of dispute, our committee urges the executive Commission to make use of its right of initiative and to propose adequate legislation."
"It is important to achieve a more social Europe, therefore to have more European social legislation."
"Furthermore, the rapporteur asks us to support the Member States in their endeavours to establish a minimum wage and the right to a minimum pension so that every individual can live in dignity."
"I can only urge you to support this report, which, like the Charter of Fundamental Rights, embodies the values we share and that ensure that our Union is not just reduced to a market."
"The report concerns the socio-political agenda for the next five years."
"It contains a series of proposals we wholeheartedly support for improving social conditions and workers' conditions."
"We appreciate the rapporteur' s words on the open coordination method which respects the Member States' independence on socio-political issues and is founded upon voluntary harmonisation and coordination."
"We are, nonetheless, concerned that the report at the same time contains proposals to the effect that the Commission must be the engine for developing social policy in Europe, meaning growing supranationalism in this area too."
"If the legislation concerning labour market and social policy is to operate well, it must be the end result of a process of change that develops from below and reflects the variety of conditions and experiences in Europe."
"I wish to state that I voted against Mrs Van Lancker' s report."
"Rarely do such conservatively socialistic reports find their way into the European Parliament plenary sitting as this report of Mrs Van Lancker' s on the EU' s socio-political programme that we voted for."
"In her programme declaration, Mrs Van Lancker says she would like to implement all those measures whose very implementation people sought to prevent by voting in a non-socialist majority in the European Parliament in the last elections. I repeat, 'prevent' ."
"I shall be quite appalled if the Commission really intends to support these totally unrealistic, almost absurd demands, which have just been approved."
"Parliament' s proposals could not be more at odds with the aims of Lisbon."
"At Lisbon the mainly socialist leaders of the EU governments declared aloud their aim to make Europe the world' s most dynamic and competitive economy."
"If Mrs Van Lancker' s proposals are adopted we shall definitely be stepping back light years in terms of our ability to achieve the important, ambitious and indispensable aims of Lisbon."
"What then does the good lady propose? According to Mrs Van Lancker, working hours in Europe must be shortened significantly, the body of EU socio-political legislation must be increased substantially, the levels of social protection in Europe must be raised massively, the power of the Trade Union movement increased and supranational labour market negotiations made possible, labour organisations must be given greater rights to be heard, and socio-political influence must be a priority in all sectors of the economy, in competition policy and in public procurements."
"I might just remind my colleagues of the wise words of the Chairperson of the CDU, Angela Merkel, who said that in politics we need more sociability, but sociability is not the same thing as socialism."
"I cannot resist the pleasure of indulging in terms, or rather coining phrases, worthy of those used in the report in order to condemn your repeated e-pocrisy regarding employment and social protection."
"So you can rave on forever about the information society, which will resolve every last problem once everyone, from babes in arms to grey-beards, not forgetting illiterates, will have an email address even if they cannot afford to pay for the computer equipment to consult it."
"In fact, in your e-Europe efforts will be made to provide everyone with this equipment once the computers start looking at the users more than the users look at the computers and once they start drawing up reports."
"Your endless ravings are not quite so funny once we realise that their purpose is not the welfare of European citizens but ever more and more laws, directives and regulations from Brussels."
"Your concept of open cooperation is a reversion to an institutional system dominated by Commission officials."
"The only thing that is truly open, wide open, is the possibility of extending the powers of Brussels to infinity, without ever referring back to square one and the Treaties."
"You are proposing to give Brussels powers to manage and define minimum social protection, flexible work, which means exploiting the worker, imposing cuts on working hours, which freezes wages and handicaps enterprises, and an absolute stranglehold on social dialogue, like Aubry in France."
"That is why we will abstain on this report: for even if we welcome its display of concern, however spurious or even belated, for employment, we cannot in all decency approve its practical proposals."
"We have voted against Mrs Van Lancker' s report on the social policy agenda."
"The Commission' s proposal for a new social policy agenda is a good document."
"The Commission' s work defines a number of areas within which cooperation and coordination between the European Union' s Member States is important."
"The Commission' s new political agenda proposes a framework in which all important actors can play a role and in which the differences between the national systems are respected."
"The Commission will use its right of initiative and support the Member States in bringing necessary changes about."
"Mrs Van Lancker wants Parliament to decide whether to alter the Commission' s proposal, mainly through, firstly, adding a number of areas to which legislation is applicable and, secondly, through establishing a number of rights at European level."
"Mrs Van Lancker believes that significantly more use should be made of compulsory instruments."
"The Commission must not be prevented from using its right of initiative in those areas in which it has the power to act and to propose compulsory instruments."
"Our basic attitude towards the European Union is a very positive one."
"In our capacity as Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as a possible way of achieving solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across the borders, human rights and conflict management."
"In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity."
"We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions must be made as close as possible to those they affect."
"That is why we are actively pushing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone."
"It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU must only deal with those issues it is best placed to deal with, namely the cross-border issues."
"All other issues must be dealt with at local, regional or national levels."
"We think that the Commission' s proposal for a social policy agenda ties in well with our view of how the EU needs to operate."
"A form of European cooperation which leads to coordination and more prosperity is the right course of action."
"The European social systems differ from each other to such an extent that compulsory legislation will not lead to an appropriate result."
"We wish therefore to support the Commission' s proposal and are consequently voting against Mrs Van Lancker' s report on the social policy agenda."
"Workers often have problems in identifying with Europe."
"Whilst in view of global trends the European single market is developing in a dynamic way, and there is ever closer economic and monetary union, social union is generally treated like a ghost at the feast."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam was agreed in 1997, the Union has had new instruments for enhancing social policy."
"And since the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, it has been the Council's intention, in addition to high growth and more skilled jobs, also to aim for greater social cohesion."
"With the third social action programme, the Commission is underscoring the recognition that economic policy, employment policy and social policy need to be more closely interlinked."
"Employability is providing evidence of this interlinking."
"In order to make the transition from the industrial society to the knowledge society, people - and not just young people - need better knowledge and skills."
"This means that the Member States have to invest more in education and training, multilingualism, mobility and communication."
"Many of the demands made in the Van Lancker report are not acceptable."
"For example, the Luxembourg process which applies to employment policy is to be extended to social protection and social exclusion."
"This method of determining Community objectives and implementing national action programmes which are assessed annually - including by the European Parliament - is so successful precisely because new qualitative and quantitative objectives are formulated whilst simultaneously strictly adhering to the principle of subsidiarity."
"It cannot arbitrarily be transferred to other areas, as specific procedures are needed."
"The Christian Social Party does not support the right to a minimum income or a standard pension."
"Nor do we accept the renewed demands for a reduction in legal working hours at European level."
"It is far inferior to flexible working arrangements, as the experience of many European companies has demonstrated."
"Furthermore, the request that there should be a legal basis for NGOs to regulate a ""civil dialogue"" is not acceptable."
"The rapporteur has departed from the principle of subsidiarity out of a sheer desire to adopt centralist solutions."
"However, as the Group of the European People's Party's key amendments have just obtained a substantial majority, I have voted for the report."
"The EPLP has voted for the Van Lancker report on the social agenda because there are many positive aspects to this report on the European social agenda and this text will inform the Nice summit and the Commission work programme, but is not legislative."
"However, there are several areas of concern where new legislative measures are being proposed."
"In some, these relate to tasks which are best tackled at Member State level, or are premature in that legislation recently passed has not yet had time to bed down and be evaluated."
"In a number of places - Paragraphs 14a, 14b and 14c - the EPLP could not support the call for ""tax and legislative measures"" and ""directives"" for the reasons stated above."
"On the right to strike, the EPLP has abstained. The EPLP feels that this is already dealt with by Member State legislation and is also covered in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The EPLP could not support the call for a legislative arrangement for worker participation in the framework of the European Company Statute as the industrial relations dimension is dealt with in other legislation."
"Finally, the EPLP feels that the new directives in the field of combating discrimination under Article 13 have not yet had a chance to be implemented or bed down."
"Therefore the EPLP has voted against the proposals for new vertical directives, as further legislation would be premature."
"Biarritz informal European Council"
"Mr President, during yesterday' s debate the Council pointed out that in Biarritz the governments' positions had begun to converge on the principle of extending qualified majority voting."
"We find that statement rather disturbing and at this point I would like to refer, among other things, to two matters that cause us serious concern."
"Firstly, the Commission has proposed communitising - i.e. introducing by means of qualified majority voting in the Council without ratification by the national parliaments - international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property, a possibility indeed already opened by Article 132(5) of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"But we regard this transfer as very dangerous, for it would deprive the national parliaments of any right of inspection in regard to future WTO negotiations on these areas that are vital to the life of our societies."
"But there is worse to come. The Commission added negotiations on investments to the list of subjects to be communitised."
"If that proposal were accepted, we may be sure that in the coming six months the Commission would impose another version of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment on us, the infamous MAI which it was possible to reject, two years ago, only because it came under strictly intergovernmental procedures."
"So, once again, the Commission is behaving shamefully in trying to strip the national democracies of their powers, without at the same time making us stronger, contrary to what it says."
"The second category of decisions that would cause us concern if they were to be decided by qualified majority voting relates to immigration and the international movement of persons, which, under Article 67 of the EC Treaty, require unanimity for at least five years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam but can then be decided by a majority."
"The Commission is calling for this changeover as of now."
"We energetically reject it."
"In this field, we have learned from experience that any transfer of power to the Commission encourages a lax attitude, while any maintenance of Member State power encourages attitudes that promote security, relatively speaking."
"We opt for security."
"Over and above the legal quibbling on all sides, the Biarritz Summit has confirmed that the process of European enlargement is a matter of laborious haggling."
"The major powers, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and, to some extent, Italy, are all agreed in their desire to dominate the small countries of Eastern or Southern Europe that are applying for accession to the European Union."
"At the same time, each country is seeking to ensure its own supremacy and to guarantee the interests of its own industrial or financial groups."
"The way is being prepared not just for a two-speed Europe, but for the introduction of less developed countries into the arena dominated by the large predators of the European economy."
"On the outside, these countries are already preyed on, and they will continue to be so on the inside."
"As for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the only reason the meeting of Heads of State and Government signed it was in order to be seen to make a statement."
"The signed document remains vague on elementary human rights, social protection and the freedom of movement of third country nationals."
"The only area in which it is precise is on the right of ownership and entrepreneurial freedom, which only concerns owners of capital."
"We have no intention whatsoever of accepting either the Biarritz Summit decisions or what will be decided at the coming summit in Nice."
"Mr President, I abstained from voting on the resolution on the results of the informal Biarritz European Council for two reasons: firstly, because I had the opportunity to vote in person on Paragraphs 2 and 5 separately, which allowed me to express my total opposition to both."
"In fact, I do not agree with the inclusion in the Treaty of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, since that would be the first step on the way to its constitutionalisation, a federalist pathway that I will not go down."
"Secondly, nor do I agree with the indiscriminate generalisation of qualified majority voting, a measure which if divorced from the others on the table may conflict with important national interests, and which even contradicts the request expressed in Paragraph 7 of the resolution."
"It was precisely this Paragraph 7 that enabled me to abstain."
"By not voting against the resolution I am trying to support any initiative that will put an end to the antagonistic atmosphere between large and small countries in which the debate on institutional reform has taken place, and which unfortunately has to a great extent been instigated by the French Presidency."
"As Paragraph 7 says, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that solutions are valid and acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their size or economic weight."
"We are Europeans and want to remain Europeans, but there must be respect for the founding principle of a Union of free and sovereign states."
"We are voting in favour of the resolution, but we wish to comment on the following points:"
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights ought to be in the nature of a political declaration made at the Nice Summit."
"Unanimity in decision-making should not only apply to issues of a constitutional nature but also to issues of fundamental importance to the Member States."
"We in the Austrian Freedom Party have from the outset declared ourselves in favour of a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"However, for legal reasons we think that it is wrong to refer to it at this early stage in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, because it was not possible to reach formal agreement on it within the convention, reflecting its structure, and it therefore has no legal status."
"The demand that the Charter be incorporated into the Treaties is therefore all the more premature."
"This is also true because in contrast to the European Human Rights Convention, which was ratified by the Member States, the process of formulating political demands and objectives in this respect has not taken place in national parliaments."
"It is for these reasons alone that we have not voted for both parts of point 2 of the resolution."
"I voted for this resolution because in it Parliament wisely does not opt for the 'imperialist' theses of the large, populous European countries against the self-affirmation of the others."
"The resolution limits itself to a responsible vote so that a sensible balance can be found based on the history of the Community."
"Thus those who would like to see Parliament become an 'echo chamber' for the more populous countries' revisionist intentions will be defeated."
"Leaving aside the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which, in an ageing Europe, where we will see more than 50 million people aged over 75 in two decades' time, has made no provision for strengthening the right to economic, social and human protection, Biarritz was concerned mainly with axing the number of issues requiring unanimity, the only procedure that can respect the interests of the people, and with the curious invention of closer cooperation, also known as the Europe of circles, the Europe of pioneers, the à la carte Europe, vanguard Europe, 'variable geometry' or two-speed Europe."
"From 1951 in Paris, to 1997 in Amsterdam, via 1957 in Rome, what has been going on?"
"Europe was created by Treaties concluded, obviously, between equal states."
"Moreover, over and above the legal aspect, Europe is a great family of civilisations in emotional terms."
"We all have the same home."
"Now, the idea of closer cooperation means that in crucial areas, such as money, defence and taxation, some members of the European family would have more rights and obligations than others."
"In other words, among those sitting round the table of the common European home, some would eat à la carte while others would get the dish of the day."
"Some would have a say about money while others, like Denmark or Sweden, would have to hold their tongue."
"As we saw before the existence of total, universal suffrage, there would be active ""peoples"" and observer ""peoples"" ."
"There would, in a sense, be ""males"" with the right to talk war, taxes and money and, as in pre-1945 France, ""females"" sitting round the table with no right to decide."
"Moreover, in this 'variable-geometry' Europe, the number of guests with the right to eat à la carte would vary depending on the subject under discussion in the European Council of Ministers and this state of affairs would create further complexity in a Europe whose way of operating is already quite obscure."
"In other words, the philosopher's stone of closer cooperation, which would allow the rule of unanimity and the right of veto, which protects national interests, to be circumvented on the sly, would achieve the amazing feat of violating the principle of equality between states, excluding minority nations from key issues, thus opening up cracks in the democratic foundations of European integration, making the European institutions even less transparent and spreading confusion, if not disarray, within the Council and the Commission."
"Once again, the technocratic smokescreen and verbal fog are conceal machinations intended to foist on the peoples a military and fiscal Europe that they do not want and to deprive them of their right to say no to the loss of their national freedoms."
"The voting on this report reflects the EPLP's opposition to incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty and the section of the report restricting unanimity in the Council to constitutional issues."
"The EPLP has consistently not supported incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as rights are covered by national legislation and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Inclusion of new text into the Treaties is likely to create legal confusion."
"The restriction of unanimity in the Council to constitutional issues would exclude key issues such as taxation and social security which, we believe, should remain the responsibility of Member States."
"The resolution contains good sections on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Middle East and the EPLP supports the resolution overall."
"Summit meetings of Heads of State and Government always raise great expectations."
"The Biarritz Summit was heralded as the decisive Summit which would affirm fundamental rights, all rights, even rights never conceived of previously, as if the European Communities and their constituent States had hitherto lived in total chaos."
"And yet our countries do not appear to be the least attentive countries in the world to human rights."
"There is always room for improvement, of course, and democratic control must not be found wanting in this respect, but we did not feel that cataloguing these rights and including them in the Treaties should be the European Union's top priority."
"Moreover, even the Heads of State and Government have not been able to reach agreement on this issue, and it is to be carried over to the forthcoming Nice Summit."
"And yet there are so many urgent issues to be dealt with: 1) the need to define an economic policy which will rescue the euro from the stagnant depths to which it has plunged and boost employment; 2) the need to attract investment to the Union in order to break out of the economic slump; 3) the need to revise employment regulations to make the market more dynamic and more responsive; or 4) the need to define a common line for a coherent diplomatic action to safeguard peace in the Middle East, etc."
"However, as is often the case with these summits, the celebratory final declarations conceal a reality which is much more banal: the Fifteen have not succeeded in establishing a common policy and the progress made with the unveiling of rights does not take away from the need to tackle the practical problems encountered by millions of families and entire categories of producers and workers."
"A summit which tackles these issues would show the validity of such an institution once and for all, and would send a signal of confidence and hope to the citizens of the Union."
"Duhamel report (A5-0289/2000)"
"Mr President, we voted against the Duhamel report on the European Constitution because, following the well-established Monnet recipe, seeking to make a fundamental political about-turn under cover of technical considerations, without ever clearly telling people that the main intention is to put an end to a concept of Europe under which each nation primarily obeys its national constitution."
"In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur says a little more about this and maintains that the Treaty is already broadly supranational, largely as a result of the Court of Justice' s case-law interpretations."
"In our view, however, the interpretations of 15 judges, which go beyond the Treaties as ratified, are clearly improper and we are still waiting for them to be submitted for the approval of the peoples of the Member States."
"Elsewhere, the rapporteur repeats the new theory in vogue in Brussels of the supposed dual legitimacy of the European Union: that of the citizens represented by the European Parliament and that of the States represented by the Council."
"That is not the theory as set out in the Treaty, which recognises only one form of legitimacy, namely, and I quote, that of: ""the peoples of the States brought together in the Community"" , according to the wording of Articles 189 and 190 of the EC Treaty."
"This wording means that the Community brings together only the States, each of which depends on the support of its people."
"In no case do the MEPs represent the European citizens in general."
"They represent their respective peoples and, by that token, cooperate in the European scrutiny of the States, but that scrutiny remains complementary, because the main power of scrutiny falls within the remit of the national parliaments."
"In other words, the fact that MEPs represent their respective peoples in no way modifies the nature of the Community."
"It in no way has the effect of placing some phantom European citizen above the national citizens, even less of placing an artificial European democracy above the national democracies or even on the same footing with them."
"Mr President, I fully support the Duhamel report."
"I am sure that pensioners and elderly people feel that Europe represents a future of peace, and we therefore support any step, however small, in that direction."
"How could the Pensioners' Party not be pro-Europe, since it is the only party which is represented solely at the European Parliament and not in the national States?"
"I am entitled to say that I am the only representative of a party which is only present at the European Parliament."
"Is there anybody more Europeanist than Carlo Fatuzzo?"
"In these very general terms, I conclude that this report enhances the very essence of what we pensioners want: a genuinely united Europe."
"Mr President, I voted against the Duhamel report because I do not believe that we are taking the right approach."
"I agree with what Mr Berthu has said, that the idea of a single state with a single constitution completely undermines the national sovereignty of the Member States."
"This project has been sold on the idea of a constitution for the people, which is all well and good, but if you have a single constituency you are diluting the power of the individuals in the Member States."
"There has been talk about referenda and the amendments that were made to this report in relation to referenda."
"Referenda are very important, but in the case of a single constituency, where you ignore almost 50% in a Member State who may vote against it, this is not democratic."
"It is interesting to see people putting forward the idea of a referendum in this way because if you consider the changes that have taken place in the treaties over the years, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam, very few citizens in the individual Member States have had a say and, as a result, we are not sure what the citizens in the Member States want."
"The recent referendum in Denmark on the euro shows there are very many people who, given the opportunity, would make different statements to those made in this House, but they do not have that opportunity."
"Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the request to refer back the Duhamel report, by way of protest."
"I am of course a fierce opponent of the extreme right here in Parliament."
"But I am deeply disturbed, Mr President, that it is possible here in this Chamber for a Member of the left - I have forgotten now who it was - to call elected Members of this House ""polluters"" of this Chamber, without you calling that Member to order."
"We should not accept language like that, because it is exactly the kind of language used by the extreme right in power in my home country when I was not yet born or was just a small child."
"We should not accept this, whoever uses such language, whether it comes from the extreme right or the extreme left."
"The Swedish and Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Oliver Duhamel' s report on incorporating the Treaties into a constitution."
"The report is based upon an assumption that the Treaties are to contain a fundamental element, that the common policies are to be included as protocols to the framework treaty and that there are to be different procedures for adapting the different texts."
"We believe that the basis for cooperation in the EU should continue to be unanimity on the basic questions concerning the legal base on which the EU is founded."
"We cannot therefore vote in favour of the report."
"We nonetheless agree with the report when it points out that, in their present wording, the Treaties leave a lot to be desired in terms of simplicity and transparency."
"We should therefore like to see the texts reworked in such a way as to permit more rational and intelligible access to the objectives in developing the EU and to the resources for doing so."
", in writing. (SV) Unfortunately, the European Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs has not taken on board anything of what has happened in the European Union in recent years."
"Only 40 per cent of people voted in the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, if countries with voting duties are discounted, as well as those which had national elections at the same time as elections to the European Parliament."
"This just goes to show how little enthusiasm there was for the EU federalist project in 1999."
"Now, in September 2000, the Danes have voted against membership of EMU, and people in a number of other Member States would certainly have voted against the EMU project, given the opportunity."
"It is interesting to note that, on the night of the EMU referendum last month, the Danish Social Democrats were exultant when the votes from the upper class areas had been counted and disappointed when they saw how people in working-class areas had voted."
"This ought to act as a wake-up call to the fact that something is going wrong in the development of the EU."
"In spite of these setbacks for the idea of a federal EU State, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has now produced a further report designed to produce a constitution for the EU, in spite of the fact that this is not in any way something which people are demanding."
"What is needed instead is a clearer definition of the 'proximity principle' in the European Union."
"At present, this principle is merely a tool for the EU itself, for it is at present at EU level that it is decided where the political decisions are to be made, with the result that the EU is claiming policy area after policy area for itself."
"What is more, there is a need to simplify the flexibility rules so that they do more to facilitate European cooperation in accordance with the wishes of the people of Europe."
"Moreover, those areas which do not concern the European Union and in which the Member States have the sovereign right to make decisions ought to be carefully demarcated."
"The Portuguese socialist MEPs voted for the Duhamel report on the constitutionalisation of the Treaties essentially because they agree with the need for the European Union to simplify and organise the fundamental texts that govern it, which today have become virtually unreadable on account of the complexity introduced by the successive accumulation of Treaties."
"To this end, it is essential that the European Union should move towards a Constitution that incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The experience of a full democracy in the European Union has everything to gain from the approval of a Constitution that is clear, simple, readable and a source of reference for all citizens."
"The Portuguese socialist MEPs do not, however, agree that ratification of this 'Constitution' should necessarily be carried out by means of a referendum."
"One must not infer from this position that we are against the use of the referendum as an institution or that the achievement of greater political depth in the European Union should occur without the Portuguese people being consulted."
"This choice should be made independently and freely and should not have to depend on an imposed measure that might clash with the constitutional practice of an individual country."
"That is why the Portuguese socialist MEPs voted against the proposal of their own political group, which indicated a uniform referendum model for all the Member States of the European Union."
"To achieve the desirable objective of a European Constitution it is inadvisable to impose rigid patterns and methods, which would inevitably lead to failure."
"In such a sensitive matter, boldness and prudence should go hand in hand."
"In terms of both form and substance, I support Olivier Duhamel' s stance and also his report."
"As a European from the very outset, an activist and President of the Northern European Movement and of the 'Citizens of Europe' association, I am a European federalist because I believe in a political, social and citizens' Europe that is both democratic and effective."
"At a time when our European Union is becoming bogged down in rampant nationalism and threatened by more or less cleverly camouflaged fascistic attitudes, we needed and we need a breath of fresh air."
"Olivier Duhamel and his report together achieve this very ably."
"So I have voted for his report with determination and a degree of enthusiasm."
"While appreciating what Olivier Duhamel has achieved, I abstained from the final vote because I think the debate on a European Constitution is premature."
"While desirable in itself, a constitution of this kind could only be adopted as the crowning touch to far-reaching institutional reform."
"A constitution would be meaningful only if it formed the democratic framework for a genuine European federation, a United States of Europe."
"So long as the EU remains no more than a sum of nation states that practise only a limited form of solidarity, limited in budgetary terms to a ceiling of 1.27% of Europe' s gross domestic product, any attempt to ""constitutionalise"" the existing Treaties is nothing more than a headlong rush into politically dodgy territory."
"In the name of the democratic Europe we want to build, we reject the report."
"By resorting again to the means and objectives used for the Charter of Fundamental Rights in order now to draft a constitution, the Union is persisting in constructing a Europe that is made neither by the people nor for them, be they citizens of the Member States or the candidate countries."
"It is not built for the people, for there is not a single word on the social content of Europe."
"Like a charter that gives precedence to entrepreneurial freedom and ownership, without protecting Europe' s 62 million poor and 18 million unemployed, we are now talking about political reinforcement of the liberal Europe of Maastricht."
"A genuine social constitution ought to bring together, from the top down, the best acquired rights for work, women, immigrants and citizens."
"Nor is it built by the people, despite a few hypocritical allusions to possible future referenda, because, once again, a few institutional delegations are to decide the fate of 385 million individuals."
"European general assemblies of the social movement would have allowed us to make progress towards a genuine charter of the rights of peoples and workers."
"Everything has been done to stage a sanitised debate between supporters of federalism and supporters of sovereignty."
"That is all the easier when social issues are not addressed."
"We reject this choice as the wrong one and, like the social movement, call for a different charter for a different Europe."
"The vote on this report in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, adopted by 18 votes in favour, 2 against and 6 abstentions, reflects the gulf dividing the Members of the European Parliament on this subject."
"This own-initiative report by Mr Duhamel can be classed as one that were better not written, especially at this point in time."
"For as things stand in the various Member States, it risks being rather counterproductive at a time when the top priority is not a very broad debate on a constitution but rather the drafting of a treaty that will allow the European Union to digest enlargement without endangering the Community method, which is the key to the success of European integration."
"In this 'constitution versus treaty' debate, I tend to place more trust in Jacques Delors than in Mr Duhamel and those who supported him in submitting this report."
"As Jacques Delors rightly pointed out at a meeting of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs scarcely a month ago, the term 'constitution' is extremely ambiguous."
"He told us that he, like the majority of politicians, had been given to believe that we would prefer our relations with other countries to be governed by international treaty."
"In a framework of that kind - and I am still referring to Jacques Delors' s words - we would agree to exercise joint sovereignty in certain fields."
"But a constitution is something else entirely."
"It refers to a single state."
"A constitution would commit the Member States to venturing onto very dangerous ground, which could lead a constitutional court to gradually deprive the nations of the prerogatives the states intend to continue exercising."
"A good treaty is worth more than a treaty that can be dubbed a constitution."
"That is the last of Jacques Delors' s observations."
"In complete agreement with the common sense of Jacques Delors' s words, I did not vote in favour of Mr Duhamel' s report."
"Although I do not reject the praiseworthy intention of strengthening, clarifying and deepening the European Union and of simplifying the texts so as to bring its workings closer to the citizens, I did not vote in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"The resolution is essentially like a 'Pandora' s Box' , as the text does not make it formally clear what purpose it serves or where the real need or urgency for a European Constitution lies."
"By its very nature a Constitution may, in the form in which it is sometimes contradictorily put forward for Europe, both serve as a way to 'civilise' the Union, on the basis of democracy and citizenship, and also be the instrument for a 'clarification' of competences, a chalk circle which formally and definitively constrains the Union and its bodies to very particular and specific competences."
"The constitutionalisation of the Treaties may either bring about the development of the Union and uphold its political competences, or in contrast it may be no more than an enshrined formalisation of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Strangely, many MEPs and even Prime Minister Blair support a European Constitution."
"Despite the clarity of Mário Soares' s speech, in which he interpreted this report in its deep European sense, without concessions to easy solutions through highly risky referendums, for which there is no tradition in many Member States, it remains simply an unsullied interpretation by a European of conviction who has made his mark on history."
"Unfortunately, the text does not match the idea and desire of Portugal' s leading European."
"This discrepancy, the blame for which lies entirely with the report' s author for not being clear and precise, is at the root of my unease with the text and why I find it politically impossible to vote for it."
"I would even have voted against it, but this would have been an over-radical way of judging a text as important as this."
"I welcome Mr Duhamel' s report as an interesting and constructive contribution to the idea of constitutionalisation of the Treaties."
"While it could be argued that the existing Treaties are in essence the European Constitution they are difficult to read and their articles are not always in a logical order."
"A future Constitution could set out in a clear and (relatively) concise way"
"the fundamental rights of European citizens"
"the principle of the separation of powers and the rule of law"
"the composition, role and functioning of the institutions of the Union"
"the allocation of powers and responsibilities"
"the subsidiarity principle"
"the role of European political parties"
"the objective of European integration."
"There is both a positive and a negative side to this report."
"It has been noted - rightly so - that over the years, there has been a useless build-up of long and complex treaties, and it would be good if these were to be re-written as one brief and readable framework treaty, which makes it clear to everyone what has been agreed so far."
"At the same time, a case has been made in favour of a European Constitution, comprising this framework treaty as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and laying down the role of the European political groups."
"Despite the recognition that the national identity of the Member States must be respected and that national citizenship need not be abolished, this report has a strong leaning towards a centralised European superstate according to the US model."
"I gladly support an extension of the social fundamental rights and a structure of political decision-making which is understandable and accessible to all European citizens."
"For this purpose, all we need is for the existing treaties to be rewritten and for the EU to sign the Council of Europe Convention on the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being which has been in existence for a long time."
"The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome this report without endorsing all of its detail."
"We think a re-organising of the Treaties and their simplification would make it easier for citizens to see clearly the field of EU responsibilities - and their limits - as well as the procedures for exercising these responsibilities."
"We welcome the idea that future changes, after Nice, could be prepared by a convention involving national parliaments, the European Parliament and government representatives, as recently tried, successfully, with the convention that prepared the Charter of Rights."
"Ratification, however, must be up to each Member State in accordance with its own procedures and traditions."
"We also do not wish to pre-empt this work by deciding now what should be in the new constitution, such as whether the Charter should be included."
"We have a constitution already in the form of the Treaties, in so far as they lay down the competences of the Union, its procedures and the composition and powers of its institutions."
"However they are not codified, they are unclear and they are insufficient as regards efficiency and democracy."
"We welcome attempts to improve them."
"I abstained from voting in the final vote."
"I believe it is absolutely crucial that the EU' s Charter of Fundamental Rights should involve subscribing to the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights."
"The word 'constitution' is intellectually and politically misleading."
"Instead, the proper concept should instead be the 'recapitulation and simplification of the EU Treaties' ."
"The Swedish Christian Democrats do not believe that the Convention has proved to be a democratic or effective method of working when it comes to producing a Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That is true in terms of the understanding shown both of the national parliaments and their constitutional committees and of the European Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"In practice, the Convention' s presidency has produced its own summary of the views which the various participants are taken to have arrived at."
"In the event of the Convention method being used in future, its task should be limited to that of acting as a focus group."
"I voted enthusiastically for the report by our fellow Member, Olivier Duhamel, because it sounds the same note as the great voices and great expressions of resolve that have, step by step, advanced the course of European integration since the war."
"But this particular voice, and this is significant, is a parliamentary voice, the voice of an institution that attests a little more each day to the authority of the peoples within the Union and its triangle of institutions."
"Step by step, treaty by treaty, and we hope the Treaty of Nice will not belie this, the old nationalist attitudes within Europe are expanding out of these narrow confines leading to the creation of a world power in a world of giants."
"Everyone here knows that Europe, its currency, its diplomacy, its security, its civilisation, its culture and its social model can only truly survive the splendid history of its peoples, but also the fruitless dissension between them, by becoming a federation of nation states with strong, coherent and respected institutions, enshrined in a European Constitution, towards which Mr Duhamel has paved the way."
"Until the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, Europe was an intergovernmental super-syndicate."
"With the Treaty of Amsterdam and the extension of the codecision procedure, the European Parliament has effectively set Europe on the road to political integration and supranationality."
"If, tomorrow, the Union wishes to embrace Europe in its entirety, the geographical Europe, extending even beyond the next wave of enlargement, it will need institutions that are fully mature in political and democratic terms."
"What history will remember of this year 2000, which some people find too dull, is that it saw the advancement and affirmation of the idea of a European Constitution, backed by the majority of Members of this Parliament, which led, today, to the adoption of the Duhamel report."
"That is why we must fervently hope that the Nice Summit and the Intergovernmental Conference prove a success, so as to enable us, quite simply, to make further progress very rapidly."
"Gil-Robles report (A5-0288/2000)"
"Mr President, ever since I have been a Member of the European Parliament, I have had sleepless nights worrying about whether I will succeed in contributing to a European law on pensions before my term expires."
"So far it has not been possible because pensions do not come under the European Parliament's mandate!"
"However, Mr Gil-Robles' report is a help in this respect because it proposes that, for certain issues and sectors, some of the Member States of the European Union reach agreement upon joint actions."
"I therefore hope that we will opt in the near future for closer cooperation between certain States - including Italy - so that we can adopt common rules for the management of pensions and workers' pension contributions."
"Then I will be able to sleep peacefully once more."
"Mr Fatuzzo, that is what we all hope!"
"The Swedish and Danish Social Democrats have today voted against José Maria Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado' s report on closer cooperation."
"We agree with the general principles laid down by the report, to the effect that closer cooperation should be developed within the European Union' s institutional frameworks and that the political and legal conditions established by the Treaty of Amsterdam for introducing closer cooperation are aimed at limiting the risk of a breach of the ties of solidarity between the Member States and the risk of a disintegration in the common legal area."
"We recognise that, where the pace and scope of European integration are concerned, a certain degree of differentiation within the process may be useful in so far as the common objectives are preserved and the differentiation is perceived as a tool used on an exceptional basis, in a transitional period and with due respect for the fact that it is entirely up to those countries which are not a part of the enhanced cooperation process to decide whether - and, in certain cases, when - they wish to accede to those areas covered by closer cooperation."
"If we cannot vote in favour of the report, it is because we cannot support the proposed changes to the political and legal conditions required for closer cooperation."
"Removing the conditions which state that closer cooperation must remain within the framework of the Treaty and removing the right of veto and the opportunity for bringing the issue up in the European Council would constitute a breach of the quite fundamental principles according to which European cooperation in the EU operates."
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is voting against Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado' s report on enhanced cooperation."
"The report proposes abolishing the right of veto, which would in reality mean that countries which are very keen on further integration could forge ahead without having broad democratic support."
"The ulterior motive is to be able to continue the development towards 'ever closer union' without being hampered by the enlargement to which the EU countries have committed themselves."
"Enhanced cooperation would cause most policies, including the most sensitive ones, to be centralised to a still greater degree than they are already."
"In this way, Mr Gil-Robles proposes discontinuing the common foreign and security policy."
"We consider, however, that future development will increase the need for far more varied and flexible cooperation in Europe."
"To allow decisions on ever more important topics to be made on the basis of qualified majority voting would be in conflict with basic democratic standards."
"Countries with a tradition of holding referendums before surrendering sovereignty may in future be in danger of finding themselves in a situation in which a proposal that is rejected nationally is adopted at EU level."
"Those countries which are not so keen on integration are left with a poor alternative, namely that of copying the legislation without having any real say in it."
"What they cannot do, however, is avoid the pioneer countries' legislation."
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities wants a freer and more flexible Europe in which there is no pressure to be involved in everything."
"We want to see a Europe of democracies and diversity."
"We are therefore voting against the report."
"I voted against the Gil-Robles report on reinforced cooperation, i.e. cooperation that does not involve all but only some EU Member States."
"In fact, although this report tends to introduce a little more flexibility into the highly inflexible system laid down by Title VII of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is welcome, the final result is still far from adequate."
"It reflects far too monolithic a concept of the Union, under which all forms of cooperation would have to operate within a 'single institutional framework' and would necessarily be directed towards the objective creating a super-state."
"The Gil-Robles report even proposes bringing the common foreign and security policy and the common defence policy within the purview of reinforced cooperation, thus centralising those policies even more than they are at present (Paragraph 4)."
"These proposals are not acceptable; the need for cooperation within Europe is genuine, but also diverse and multiform, and it can no longer be locked into a uniform Community framework based on majority voting."
"Furthermore, the report, and this is a significant omission, contains no explanation as to how cooperation procedures involving one third of Member States could actually be made to work within the existing institutions without reforming those institutions."
"In reality, the European Parliament is practising delay tactics."
"Parliament wished earlier to prevent the emergence of differentiated forms of cooperation in the Treaty of Amsterdam, but was finally forced to give way and accept 'reinforced cooperation' ."
"It is now attempting to prevent reinforced cooperation being made more flexible, but here too it will eventually lose."
"We believe that what ought to be termed 'differentiated' cooperation procedures should not have to follow predetermined lines in their objectives; nor should there be limits on their creation or constraints on their operation."
"Some procedures could use the Community framework should this be found desirable, others could create their own ad hoc institutions, linked to the Union only by a liaison secretariat."
"Finally, differentiated cooperation should preferably operate on the basis of the unanimity principle, thus avoiding any relapse into the disadvantages of the Community method."
"We should remember that the mechanism now known as reinforced cooperation already existed well before the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Indeed, some Member States that wanted to deepen their cooperation and go beyond the integration provided for in the Treaties developed various instruments, such as the Social Chapter, the Schengen Agreements, Economic and Monetary Union, etc. This enabled them to advance at different rates and/or with different objectives."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the use of these instruments was formalised by the introduction of the concept of 'closer cooperation' into the Treaty on European Union (Title VII) and the Treaty establishing the European Community (Article 11)."
"The objective of this form of cooperation is to allow a limited number of Member States that are able and willing to move forward to deepen European integration, provided they respect the European Union' s single institutional framework."
"In fact, Europe is finding it more and more difficult to move forward at the same pace."
"So we must avoid slowing down the general pace and therefore allow some Member States to move forward by developing the mechanism of reinforced cooperation."
"Resorting to this instrument is tied to conditions designed to avoid turning the European Union into an à la carte or multi-speed Europe, a legitimate anxiety which lies at the heart of debates on this issue."
"We must point out that reinforced cooperation, as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, must in particular concern an area that does not come within the Community' s exclusive purview, must be aimed at furthering the objectives of the Union, must respect the principles of the Treaties and must be used only as a last resort while concerning a majority of Member States."
"Reinforced cooperation could have an important role to play in the framework of an enlarged Europe."
"However, as these provisions now stand, this mechanism cannot function correctly."
"That is why the reform of this instrument has been entered on the agenda of the IGC with a view to making it easier to use."
"The report before us tends to consolidate Parliament' s position in this respect (resolution of 13 April 2000)."
"In particular, that means abolishing the right of veto and making it possible to resort to cooperation when it concerns at least one third of Member States and also extending reinforced cooperation to the common foreign and security policy."
"The rapporteur rightly stresses that the Commission' s power of initiative, the full participation of the European Parliament and legal control by the Court of Justice must be the rule for all forms of reinforced cooperation."
"If used intelligently, this instrument can be a way out of the current deadlock affecting the European Union."
"There has been much debate within the European Union in recent times concerning what is known as the principle of enhanced cooperation."
"In its simplest terms, what this means is that larger Member States can integrate more closely and over a shorter time-frame than smaller Member States of the EU."
"In essence, the proponents of such a policy want to put in place a two-tier Europe."
"They want the European Union to be built at two different paces: one for countries that wish to integrate more closely and one for countries that want to tread more carefully on the issue of economic integration."
"I do not think it will be a necessarily healthy move forward for the European Union if EU leaders were to accept and implement the principle of enhanced cooperation to its fullest."
"I believe that this would fly in the face of both the founding objectives and spirit of the Treaty of Rome and of all subsequent Treaties thereafter."
"One should recall that the Single European Act in 1987 laid the groundwork for the implementation of an internal market."
"Large scale EU Structural Funds were put aside to help Objective 1 countries within the European Union so as to guarantee that these countries could become more competitive over time."
"EU leaders stated that they did not want an internal market of only a few countries."
"They wanted all participating countries within the European Union to actively engage in a competitive manner within the environment of a new single market."
"That is why the large allocation of EU Structural Funds was made."
"The operating structures of the internal market have been a success ever since the early 1990s."
"This principle of equality between poorer and richer nations was transcended into policies that were implemented to put in place a new European single currency regime."
"Once again, if poorer and smaller countries of the European Union could not reform their economic structures they would not be able to meet the economic convergence criterion as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty."
"EU leaders financed large-scale EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund programmes for smaller and poorer countries so that as many countries as possible could participate in the European single currency structure."
"There is a need for institutional equality in the context of the negotiations on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"The influence of smaller Member States cannot be dissipated by a set of larger countries within the EU that seek to implement, as I have said, the principle of enhanced cooperation."
"This would not be healthy for the European Union now and into the future."
"It certainly would not be healthy in the context of the impending enlargement of the European Union itself."
"We are broadly in favour of so-called flexible integration."
"By allowing a group of countries to go ahead and deepen cooperation within a particular area and, at the same time, preventing one or more Member States from curbing flexible integration, then integration throughout the European Union can go forwards."
"As long as the European Union' s common objectives are promoted within the framework of flexible integration and as long as no Member State is excluded from participating, we believe that this is a positive solution and ought to be developed."
"If, in a future EU with 25 to 30 Member States, the situation is to be avoided of a Europe à la carte in which the unity of the Member States is in danger of disintegrating, we nonetheless believe that at least half of all Member States must participate in flexible integration."
"We are also opposed to creating duplicate defence structures within the EU and consequently to flexible integration within the EU' s foreign and security policy."
"Following the EU' s failure in the Balkans, it is incredibly important that the EU as a whole should have the ability to act in its own immediate vicinity and be able to make personnel and resources available in time for conflict management and peace-keeping measures."
"The WEU' s institutional and operational structures ought to be fully integrated into the common security policy."
"The EU must acquire a credible foreign policy."
"We cannot rely upon the United States forever more."
"At the same time, it is important to retain the United States' s continued commitment, and we do not want the EU to develop a parallel mini NATO."
"Still less do we wish to see a limited number of Member States go further within the framework of flexible integration in this area."
"It is therefore important to retain the transatlantic link, even if there might, of course, be better coordination and a better distribution of labour."
"We believe that, in the future too, a credible common European foreign policy must be developed within the rules that apply at present."
"Decisions ought to be taken by majority vote, but the option of a constructive veto, whereby a country may choose to remain outside a particular process but not prevent others from pressing ahead, ought to remain."
"I welcome Mr Gil-Robles' report on reinforced cooperation."
"While reluctantly accepting that in an enlarged European Union there will be a need for an 'avant-garde' I agree with Mr Gil-Robles that there are some essential conditions that must be fulfilled:"
"Reinforced cooperation must be developed within the institutional framework of the Union."
"It must preserve the single institutional framework within which all MEPs and all Commissioners participate fully in the exercise of the functions of each institution."
"The procedure for activating reinforced cooperation should be the same for all pillars and should be based on the existing procedure for the first pillar, with the few modifications set out in Mr Gil-Robles' report."
"If reinforced cooperation proves necessary I am convinced that only the Community system offers the necessary guarantees in terms of democratic control, legal controls and solidarity."
"European cooperation can be useful in solving cross-border problems."
"What could be more natural, therefore, than cooperation between neighbouring states, such as the cooperation which existed before the founding of the European Union in the form of the Benelux counties and the cooperation between the Nordic states?"
"Such cooperation between neighbours is often preferential to expensive, impenetrable EU structures which are also difficult for the electorate to influence."
"Not one single EU rule should stand in the way of far-reaching cooperation, subject this to conditions or require that others join in."
"That is why I am in favour of a minimum number of rules and limitations affecting reinforced cooperation between neighbours, as long as such cooperation is not intended to disadvantage third parties."
"In practice, we can already see Euro countries and non-Euro countries emerging within the EU."
"They are not leader groups but reflect a diversity which, with 30 Member States, will only increase."
"That is why it is better to take inter-parliamentary cooperation and the right to diversity as a guiding principle throughout the EU: the Commission submits proposals, Parliament makes the final decision and national parliaments decide whether the Member States endorse that decision."
"The UK Labour members of the PES Group welcome the adoption of their contribution to the ongoing work of the IGC on reinforced cooperation, without endorsing every single detail."
"Clearly the triggering of reinforced cooperation must be made easier in an enlarged Union."
"It must be used sparingly and must remain open to those who do not initially participate."
"It must not undermine the existing core of common policies and commitments."
"It must take place within the existing institutional structure."
"On these key principles we are in agreement with the report even if the details will require further refinement in the IGC."
"Mr President, Mrs Sudre' s report is indeed of great importance, and even capital importance for the outermost regions, but my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, abstained and I should like to explain why."
"The problems raised by the report have been identified; there is no further need to go into the details."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is disappointed, however, disappointed that the report did not seize the opportunity to bring about environmentally, socially and culturally sustainable development in these regions and that the amendments adopted during the vote are not such as to improve the text in that respect."
"We regret that the positions Parliament has adopted in the vote are the European Union' s positions concerning these regions."
"In particular, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regrets the report' s rather defensive attitude to the ACP and candidate countries."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is also opposed to granting permanent derogations."
"We are in favour of applying the principle of derogation to the common policies applied in the outermost regions on a case-by-case basis."
"I am thinking here of state aid and fiscal policies."
"We regret the fact that the call to moderate the 'polluter pays' principle was endorsed, for that could open the door to misuse in the application of this specific prerogative."
"We also regret the lack of any reference to, or even mention of, the need to protect biodiversity, which is one of the most important assets of the outermost regions."
"These regions could act as a wonderful laboratory in terms of sustainable development."
"That is another missed opportunity."
"On the other hand, we welcome the paragraphs in the report on promoting renewable energies and monitoring industrial activities which cause pollution."
"You sit next to me when we vote. I was very happy to vote for this report, which I am sure that you will have supported, as you always support all the measures concerning the Canary Islands."
"The Pensioners' Party and the pensioners who support it are very familiar with these islands for they are a key tourist destination."
"It is my opinion that the European Union should be more attentive and more active than it has been up till now with regard to the Azores, the Canary Islands, Guyana, Martinique, Madeira and Reunion."
"These islands must be able to feel that they are an active part of the European Union, and I hope that the Union will turn them into a paradise both for tourists and for their inhabitants."
"The European Parliament and especially the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats has always helped push the outermost region concept to the forefront."
"This was the case in the Gutiérrez Díaz report, the Fernández Martín report, which promoted the inclusion of the concept in the Treaty, and now in the Sudre report, which restates European policy for the outermost regions."
"In the face of the Commission' s hesitancy and contradictions, due to which REGIS has disappeared, the review of POSEI has been postponed and the corresponding funding has been reduced, the Sudre report comes at a highly appropriate moment."
"The European Parliament is reasserting itself by adopting measures in various fields - from agriculture to fisheries, from the environment to transport and energy via the information society - with the necessary budgetary support."
"At the same time, production sectors stand out, which in the case of the Azores means that the dairy and sugar disputes must be resolved."
"In this context I quote Paragraph 7 of the Sudre report: ""[The European Parliament] believes that specific adaptations of the common policies must be developed where the outermost regions are heavily dependent on a limited number of economic activities or even on a single economic activity, in conformity with Article 299(2) of the Treaty."""
"We now look forward to initiatives from the Commission and from the national and regional authorities."
"(FR) The rather bureaucratic term 'outermost regions' encompasses women and men from New Caledonia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Reunion, Mayotte, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and all our territories in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic, which form a bridge of intelligence, solidarity and beauty between Europe and other continents and other civilisations."
"The Europe of Brussels, with its mania for levelling out and standardising, has acted unfairly and even stupidly towards our compatriots who live according to European values thousands of kilometres away from Paris, Madrid or Lisbon."
"The technocrats, the European judges, wanted to abolish the 'dock dues' , which provide resources for our municipalities in the French overseas departments and, in particular, protect our traditional workforce."
"From this distance, Brussels has put our Martinique rums, our rice and our tropical fruits at risk."
"Most especially, this has resulted in the planned destruction of our banana industry, in Guadeloupe, Martinique, Madeira and the Canaries."
"The European Commission has kow-towed to the banana multinationals. Every year, EUR 2 billion in customs duties are given away to Chiquita and Del Monte."
"How then can we refuse to give our remote departments and territories the funding they need to make up for the costs involved in transportation, dealing with cyclones and investing in universities or hospitals?"
"When our regions, in the West Indies for example, or the Pacific, are tax havens used by the American multinationals, from Kodak to Microsoft, Boeing or Cargill, for massive tax-fraud exports, then the right to geographically equal competition, together with the right of all Europeans to equality, requires that we devote part of the European budget, in which taxes make up 17% of revenue, to developing the economic, social and cultural life of our compatriots who live in regions that may well be outermost in terms of geography but are central in terms of civilisation."
"The fact that the outermost regions exist is tied up to a large degree with colonial history."
"In the Middle Ages, those regions and their people did not belong to Europe, and even today, they are not really considered to be European."
"Even before the nineteenth century, Spain, Portugal, France, England and the Netherlands had already conquered substantial colonial empires and Belgium, Germany, Denmark and Italy tried to follow in their footsteps for a short while."
"This colonial era has now passed."
"The suppressed peoples have fought for their freedom, or were given their independence as a preventive measure, because the former rulers had no appetite for a war of liberation which they would end up losing."
"All that the EU Member States have left outside Europe in terms of territory are small or sparsely populated sections of their former colonial empire."
"The EU Member States deal with their outermost regions in very different ways."
"Spain and Portugal consider their islands in the Atlantic as remote regions."
"Those islands can, given their present composition of population and their relative proximity, be considered normal parts of their countries."
"Similarly, the Netherlands and Denmark each have two regions in, or on the other side of, the Atlantic, but those areas are expressly not included in the European Union."
"France, on the other hand, owns overseas departments in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean."
"This proposal has confronted my group with a difficult choice."
"On the one hand, we want to support disadvantaged areas in and outside of Europe so that they achieve the same standard of living and level of amenities that is now current in the EU."
"That is a question of solidarity."
"On the other hand, we have serious doubts as to whether or not former colonies should be declared outermost regions."
"A case can be made for the Spanish and Portuguese islands, but not really for the more remote regions."
"These should ideally be given the same status as the current ACP states which, after the same kind of history, have ended up in a different type of relationship with Europe."
"In assessing the amendments, my group has tried to tread a middle path between the most far-reaching demands of those protecting the interests of the outermost regions and the indifference towards, or even repugnance for, this topic felt in Member States which cannot relate to it in any way."
"In any case, we have, however, subordinated our repugnance for this topic' s colonial backdrop to the interests of those living in the regions concerned."
"This report is very timely, given the need to put Article 299(2) of the Treaty on European Union objectively and swiftly into practice, and I essentially support its positions on the sustainable development of the outermost regions."
"The special characteristics of these regions derive in general from their island status and their distance from continental Europe, but also from their chronic dependence on only a few products or even a single product, and thus require specific measures designed to overcome these constraints."
"I am therefore delighted that the report has adopted positions which to a great extent include the proposals I submitted to the Parliamentary Committee."
"I must also stress, however, that insufficient attention is given in the report to certain particular social situations that exist in these regions or in some of them, which would also require special measures."
"This could be rectified through the approval of a draft amendment that we tabled for this purpose in due time."
"Bowis report (A5-0272/2000)"
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has indeed voted for Mr Bowis' report and, while we welcome the fact that the European Parliament and the Commission, with its White Paper, are offering European consumers interesting prospects, food safety must remain an absolute priority in our policies."
"Let us not be too ambitious, however."
"The more progress that is made in scientific research, the more new questions are raised."
"We need only look at developments involving BSE."
"New cases are being identified week after week and in new geographical areas that had been spared in the past. This applies in particular to the Vosges department in the Lorraine region."
"With all the measures proposed in the White Paper, we will still have to flesh out a number of points in order to guarantee food safety and in particular restore consumer confidence."
"The most important points include the creation of the European Food Safety Agency, which we welcome and of which we expect a great deal."
"It is vital to its credibility that it is independent."
"This authority must be totally dissociated from the interests of private companies or the Member States."
"That independence also implies financial independence."
"The Union will have to free up funds to run it, but will the EFSA be enough to reassure consumers who are worried about what they find on their plates and will soon find in their drinks?"
"The authority will have to be set up by 2002/2003 and we very much hope that the question of where it will have its headquarters will not be an obstacle to its establishment."
"Meanwhile, the Union must continue to assess and manage food safety risks."
"That means it must be vigilant day in day out."
"It means guaranteeing that the policy-makers and the policies that have been put in place really do deal with what people want."
"The use of animal meal, which is triggering a new food crisis, is unacceptable."
"Henceforth we must ban all animal meal."
"That is the strong stance our citizens expect, rather than the kind of tolerance that can end up seriously damaging consumer health."
"This kind of recognised scientific risk must not be tolerated in any way. Mr Bowis' report takes that line."
"That is why the Green Group fully supported his work and voted for the report."
"Mr President, I apologise to the Presidency and to the interpreters, who have to listen to this last explanation of vote and, in particular, I sympathise with the translators of our explanations of votes, particularly, in my case, the Italian translator, Ornella Buson."
"I will endeavour to take as little advantage as possible of this right to explanation, but I would like to say that I too voted for the report on the establishment of the Food Safety Agency."
"The reason why the report is important is clear, especially when I remember that one of my neighbours was taken into hospital one day with acute stomach pains, after eating poisonous mushrooms which he had not had checked out by the relevant person."
"Mr John Bowis' report will ensure that the food we eat is always healthy, natural and safe."
"You said that this would be the last time you would speak, Mr Fatuzzo, but you must just have meant for today!"
"I was a little worried!"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Bowis' report and of course I want to emphasise the high quality of the work done by our rapporteur."
"Let me say how glad I am that our Parliament is finally delivering its opinion on such an important subject, while regretting that it has been 10 months since the European Commission presented its White Paper on 12 January this year."
"It was essential for us to give an opinion on an issue that is so important to our fellow citizens."
"Our vote has thus clarified the composition of the future European Agency, while also setting out our specific requirements regarding its funding and its independence."
"I hope that the Commission will, therefore, take the European Parliament' s demands on board."
"This first step must not close our eyes to the serious work that still needs to be done on risk management, developing and improving the Rapid Alert System, but also on ensuring traceability and public information."
"Far from representing a final stage, the report must therefore signal the start of a huge undertaking, namely the essential and rapid reworking of our legislation on food."
"At first glance, the Commission's White Paper on food safety appears to be full of good intentions, since it mainly proposes the creation of a European Food Safety Agency responsible for managing a rapid alert network and totally independent when it advises the management authorities."
"But on reading the report or perusing the European Parliament's resolution on the same subject, the picture becomes far less pleasing."
"In fact it becomes clear that the purpose of the agency is to take over national defence powers, or to paralyse them, and to put them at the service of the Commission's objectives."
"Now that is absolutely intolerable."
"The French must remember that despite the Commission's splendid declarations about its resolve ""to assure the highest standards of food safety"" in the Union, it is actually the Commission, and none other, that is giving precedence to the demands of the free movement of products over public health requirements; it is the Commission, and none other, that has, for example, just dragged France before the Court of Justice for maintaining its ban on British beef."
"It is unacceptable that we should abandon any part of our national right of decision and right of protection, in relation to food safety questions."
"However, the creation of that agency is imperceptibly guiding us in that very direction."
"First of all, we must remember that the power to provide advice plays a capital part."
"In the mad cow affair, the reason the French Government continued the ban was because it was backed up by the independent opinion of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA), even though the supposedly scientific European committee saw nothing wrong with allowing British meat to be imported into France."
"Consequently, if a European agency is necessary, it must be complementary to the national agencies and in no way reduce their legitimacy."
"That is not at all the direction taken by the White Paper, which wants to make the European agency into a ""scientific point of reference for the whole Union"" (page 5)."
"Secondly, the European agency must be completely independent."
"The director of the agency should certainly not be appointed by the Commission, contrary to what the European Parliament is proposing (paragraph 21 of the resolution)."
"Nor should the Commission appoint the scientific experts, even following what appears to be a rigorous selection procedure."
"Moreover, the agency must be able to criticise the Commission itself."
"That is not at all the view of the White Paper, which calls for the agency to develop very close working links with the Commission services because, as it explains with a certain aplomb, ""it will allow the Authority (Agency) to be responsive to the needs of the Commission services"" (page 20)."
"Thirdly, the Agency must not encroach upon the management of risks and regulatory power."
"The Commission's White Paper has the grace to admit that, but on closer perusal we find that the regulatory power it is so keen to protect is that of... the Commission, and not the states."
"That does not prevent the Commission and Parliament from christening the agency a ""European Authority"", a title totally contrary to the philosophy that supposedly inspires it."
"The European Parliament even adds, in paragraph 6 of its resolution, the phrase ""while subjecting the powers to be transferred to detailed scrutiny"", just when we thought that no powers were to be transferred."
"We therefore believe that the White Paper and Parliament's report are traps, which is why we are opposed to them."
"The Member States must retain full responsibility for food safety, because they are close to their people and will react more rapidly than the Commission, which, moreover is constantly blinded by its free-trade prejudices."
"There is without doubt a need for an agency that takes a European view of the situation, but it must be strictly consultative and totally independent."
"The best idea would be for it to emanate solely from the national agencies and to network with them."
"A serious problem for society and food safety has been caused by the serious crises and scandals involving food products that have arisen in several countries in the European Union because of the use of methods aimed at making the maximum profit from food-producing activities at any cost, ignoring the interests of consumers."
"Therefore all the measures proposed to change the situation and protect consumers deserve our support, particularly the setting-up of a European food Safety Agency to analyse the risks scientifically, working in close collaboration with existing national agencies in this field and the main European consumers' organisations."
"But we need to go further than this."
"We have to bear in mind the type of practices employed in farming and the food industry, the problem of imported foodstuffs, the composition of the ingredients of animal feedingstuffs, the maximum levels of dioxins and pesticide residues, food additives and other matters, giving priority to food safety."
"It is equally crucial that we support regional crops and products, family farming and rural development."
"Today, the question of food safety has become a primary concern of the citizens of our countries."
"The issue has now become particularly acute, not just because of the advances in our methods of scientific investigation but mainly because the consequences of a certain type of farming aimed at boosting productivity at all costs and inspired by a free-trade philosophy have come fully to light."
"So today we need to correct the adverse effects on public health of a policy very largely inspired by the Commission, as Mrs Thomas-Mauro quite rightly pointed out this morning."
"The question is what kind of mechanism will protect our citizens most effectively."
"If we take a look at recent events, we find that with regard to BSE, for example, and taking only the case of France, it is the existence of a competent and independent national Food Safety Agency that allowed the French authorities to rapidly take the decisions needed to protect the health of its people."
"But the contribution of the European institutions has, so far, been singularly negative."
"First there was the refusal by the Council and the Commission to take on board the French scientists' warnings, and we now see how relevant they were."
"Next came the incredible ruling by the Court of Justice against maintaining the ban on British beef, which France had decided at the express recommendation of the scientists."
"So that shows that the European institutions' behaviour on this issue that is vital to the food safety of our fellow citizens comes down to genuinely putting the health of Europeans at risk."
"There is a lesson to be learned."
"In the name of respect for subsidiarity and effectiveness, we must give pride of place to measures taken in a national context, where independent agencies can rapidly provide genuinely scientific opinions undiluted by other considerations and the political authorities can take the necessary risk-management decisions for the benefit of the people who have given them a mandate to protect their safety."
"Under these circumstances, a European agency can play a useful role if it really is independent, especially in relation to the Commission services and the various pressure groups at work there, and if its role is to complement and support the national agencies (from which it should emanate), in particular by acting as a forum for the exchange of expertise."
"That is not at all what the Bowis report is proposing; it gives the impression that basically it regards food safety as another pretext for fuelling the well-known process of strengthening the Commission's powers at the expense of the national authorities and public safety."
"In fact, without batting an eyelid the report endorses the new wording the Commission wants: we are no longer talking about a European agency but about an authority."
"The report seems to regard it as a matter of course that the Commission should appoint the director of the authority: no doubt that is the best way of guaranteeing its independence!"
"It has no problem with the location of the authority in Brussels: so it will be right next to the Commission services and therefore perfectly ""responsive"" (sic) to its wishes, as recommended in the White Paper..."
"On the other hand, the authority must be ""given powers to require"" Member States to provide reports, statistics and papers..."
"As for paragraph 6 of the report, it quite classically announces the transfers of powers that are bound to follow."
"Looking behind the apparent and certainly sincere concern to improve food safety in Europe, in fact we thus find ourselves faced with the usual logic: the aim is to get control over the Member States, in this sphere as in the others, to strip the national authorities of their powers and effectiveness and hand them over to a large, limp and flabby European institution, theoretically independent but in reality controlled by the Commission and its philosophy of absolutely free trade."
"The only power the European Food Safety Agency will have is to conduct the scientific analysis of food risks, but not the political management of these risks."
"We must certainly restrict its powers."
"In any case, we would have preferred an ""agency""."
"In charge, in the long term, of running the Rapid Alert System (RAS), which collects the information held by the Member States or the European Commission, it will in due course be responsible for coordinating the national agencies."
"We distrust this term, which suggests the perfect little bureaucrat, with the authority handing down orders to harmonise."
"Is it not the intention, in due course, to entrust the authority with managing the food safety aspect of the RAS?"
"That is why I abstained."
"For my part, in France, I do not need an authority in order to restore my confidence;"
"I trust the French Food Safety Agency and its opinions, especially in relation to mad cow disease."
"We voted for Amendment No 15 because we are very strongly committed to defending the European cultural heritage in relation to locally produced food."
"However, we fear that the stated means of ensuring the protection of locally produced food would be counterproductive."
"For are licensing and product certification not in fact a way of circumventing the principle set out at the beginning of recital I?"
"Small local producers will be unable to gain access because this certification is so cumbersome, complex and costly."
"We voted against Amendment No 7 because it would mean, even now, going beyond the field of risk assessment and encompassing risk management."
"It is not up to the authority to advise the states to adopt this or that type of control procedure."
"That is outside its remit."
"(The sitting was suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Honk Kong SAR"
"The next item is the report (A5-0284/2000) by Mr Cushnahan, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the first and second annual reports by the European Commission on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (COM(98)796 - C4-0100/1999 - 1999/2009(COS)) (COM(2000) 294 - C5-0500/2000 - 1999/2009(COS))."
"Mr President, Hong Kong went to the polls in September, for the second time since the former British colony was returned to Chinese rule."
"Analysis of the results reveals disturbing trends which demonstrate that all is not well."
"Voter turn-out dropped to 43% compared to 53% in 1998 and support for the region's pro-Beijing parties increased in marked contrast to the decline in support for the pro-democracy parties."
"I believe there are a number of reasons why Hong Kong voters have opted for apathy instead of exercising their newly established right to vote."
"The main problem is that while the election procedure itself is free and transparent it can hardly be described as truly democratic."
"Twenty-four of the 60 seats are directly elected on the basis of universal suffrage, where three million Hong Kong citizens have the right to vote."
"The remaining 36 seats are returned by a mere 179 000 electors drawn from Hong Kong's powerful business and professional interests as well as pro-Beijing groups."
"Furthermore the legislature has little real power."
"The real power rests with the Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa and his government which, in effect, is appointed by Beijing."
"The executive is totally separate from the legislature, which is left to operate more like a watchdog rather than a real decision-making body."
"The legislature's lack of real power has made voters unenthusiastic about participating in elections which, in their view, are not truly democratic."
"Although the Basic Law - which is Hong Kong's mini-constitution - lays down specific criteria for the holding of the 2004 election, it does nonetheless provide for the possible introduction of universal suffrage for the election of all 60 seats for the 2008 election."
"However, such a step is resisted by some who clearly wish to protect the power of big business."
"Even if universal suffrage were to be introduced - preferably sooner rather than later - it would not solve all the current problems."
"It would need to be accompanied by a reform to the Special Administrative Region's political institutions."
"The executive has no party base in the legislature, which means that these two institutions are effectively completely separate from one another."
"Furthermore, because the executive is not really accountable to the elected representatives and because the latter lack real power, they are also not held accountable for their own political pronouncements and actions."
"Consideration must be given to changing the respective rules of the executive and the legislature to ensure an operational inter-relationship."
"Other matters need to be examined."
"They could include the method of appointment of principal officials: should they be political appointments or civil servants, and how they should be held accountable by elected representatives?"
"As well as problems in this area there is also growing concern regarding increasing Chinese interference in Hong Kong's affairs."
"The rule of law is the cornerstone of the ""one country, two systems"" policy."
"Three recent, controversial legal cases have far-reaching implications for the integrity of the rule of law and ultimately for the autonomy of Hong Kong itself."
"Two of these resulted in the execution of individuals for crimes they had committed in Hong Kong, where capital punishment is banned."
"The third case related to a judgment handed down by Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal on a controversial immigration law concerning residency rights in Hong Kong for children of Chinese parents who themselves had resident status in Hong Kong."
"The Hong Kong Government was displeased with the liberal judgment and invited the Chinese authorities to reinterpret the Basic Law."
"Many observers consider that this has created a worrying precedent, which appears to enable China to issue interpretations of the Basic Law whenever local courts make decisions of which either the Hong Kong Government or mainland politicians disapprove."
"This situation was further compounded by mainland officials trying to interfere in press freedom and Hong Kong's trading relationship with Taiwan, following the recent Taiwanese election."
"As regards my comments on the dominance of the Li Ka-shing family - which was the subject of much media interest in Hong Kong today - in some sectors of Hong Kong's economy, I should like to point out that the reason I have raised this matter is that it has been raised with me by leading figures in Hong Kong and indeed was the subject of major media debate during a recent visit there by myself."
"I should also like to raise the question of visa-free access."
"I am very unhappy that this has been blocked by some governments."
"If we really believe in the ""one country, two systems"" approach then this is the one way of underpinning it."
"Visa-free access should be given to Hong Kong's passport-holders without any preconditions."
"So far I have concentrated on the negative aspects."
"While these events give cause for concern I would not be unduly pessimistic regarding Hong Kong's future."
"The ""one country, two systems"" remains reasonably intact, but, the real problem is that if the ""one country, two systems"" is seen to fail then the China-Taiwan problem will be even more difficult to resolve."
"In conclusion I should like to thank all those who were involved in the deliberations on this report: my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and members of the Foreign Affairs Secretariat, especially Mrs Opacic, and the Commissioner."
". (NL) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of my committee, I would like to highlight the importance of Hong Kong in terms of international trade."
"Back in 1997, Hong Kong was ranked eighth in the list of major world trading powers and tenth in the list of European Union trading partners."
"Since then, and despite the Asian financial crisis, trade relations between the European Union and Hong Kong have gone from strength to strength."
"As far as relations between Hong Kong and its international trading partners are concerned, more specifically the World Trade Organisation, the EU and Hong Kong share a number of common goals and the two work very closely together, which is useful in the light of the forthcoming trade round."
"In my recommendation, I referred to the important role which Hong Kong could play when China joined the World Trade Organisation."
"Hong Kong could show China how an open, fully integrated market can play a leading role in the region and can in this way achieve economic development and sustained growth."
"Moreover, since Hong Kong constitutes a major sales market for China, Hong Kong can exercise influence on economic reform in China."
"For these reasons, we must stress the importance of closer cooperation between the European Union and Hong Kong in financial terms and in terms of trade and direct foreign investments."
"Hong Kong has concluded many bilateral agreements over the past few years."
"We should bear in mind that in the framework of the EU-China agreement with regard to the possible accession of China to the World Trade Organisation, these bilateral agreements will need to be reviewed."
"Although, economically speaking, we are right to term the relationship with Hong Kong a success, I should highlight a number of drawbacks, including the fact that the protection of intellectual property rights remains a huge problem."
"Our companies are still being faced with violations of copyright and the manufacture and sale of counterfeit products."
"We also have concerns in the social field."
"After all, working conditions reportedly leave a great deal to be desired, especially vis-à-vis immigrant workers."
"As far as the inquiry is concerned, we must call for both Hong Kong and the European Union to play a valuable role in the many projects which are in the pipeline."
"I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Cushnahan, on his excellent work on such an important matter."
"I am delighted to see that Commissioner Patten, for whose attitude and efficiency as governor of Hong Kong I have a great deal of respect, is here with us today."
"I should like to dwell for a moment on two points which I believe are important, as of course are so many others."
"The first is purely legal."
"We must, I think, all agree that if, with measures such as those quoted in the Cushnahan report, we touch on the principle of the rule of law which should inform the legal and constitutional framework of Hong Kong, then we question the wider principle of ""one country, two systems"" on which developments in Hong Kong have been based."
"And the second point which I wish to raise concerns the risks threatening the freedom of the press."
"It is of paramount importance to the proper development of the principle of ""one country, two systems"", which constituted a revolution, as it were, in international relations because it introduced a new doctrine, to have, to protect and to respect freedom of the press."
"Why?"
"Because it is through freedom of the press that observations and proposals are made which aim to keep things within the democratic framework on which we are all agreed."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Cushnahan on his report. I should like to thank him for once again being so adaptable in writing that report and being prepared to involve his colleagues so that there is no need for us to go through a lengthy amendment procedure because we reached consensus when the report was being drawn up."
"Once again we see the handover of power in Hong Kong has generally gone very well and has defeated some of the more pessimistic forecasts."
"Clearly, demonstrations still take place on a weekly basis in Hong Kong, movements are permitted in Hong Kong which are not permitted in China, the economy has survived a difficult period and continues to thrive and, as Mr De Clercq has said, the WTO membership for China should actually be an opportunity for Hong Kong, given its tremendous power in financial services in particular, and given that much of Hong Kong manufacturing has already moved to China."
"However, as Mr Cushnahan has pointed out, there are areas of concern and they are set out well in his report so I do not need to go through them."
"But I may quote one or two examples."
"The Chinese news agency telling Mrs Anson Chan and the civil servants they had to better support the Chief Executive seems to me like interference in the affairs of another country."
"The various reports of businessmen being put under pressure not to trade with Taiwan is also cause for concern."
"The recent sacking or movement of one of the directors of Radio Television Hong Kong appears to have been as a result of pressure from the mainland."
"All of these things in themselves may not add up to a great deal because they are part of a normal power struggle that you would see, provided, that is, that what Hong Kong was based on was a thriving, democratic system that could resist those sorts of pressures."
"But we have to be concerned that in Hong Kong democracy is not going the way that we would have liked."
"We have already heard of the unfair nature of the election system."
"We will note, as was pointed out recently in the Financial Times by an adviser to the former Governor, the extent to which the rules were pushed back in 1997."
"But when you see someone like Christine Loh resigning because there is no point in being in the legislative any more that, to me, is a significant signal that things are not going well."
"And when someone who works for the Chief Executive is accused of interfering in opinion polls, that also bodes ill for the future."
"It is not just a question of point scoring, a lot of modernisation is needed in Hong Kong."
"That will only come about if there is a consensus and the top-down government in Hong Kong at the moment is ill-equipped to build consensus within Hong Kong."
"While we recognise there has been a smooth transition, there remain areas we have to watch. I would hope that we can continue with these annual reports and these Parliament reports so that we can monitor very closely the situation in Hong Kong."
"Mr President, I too would like to add my words of congratulations to John Cushnahan on this report."
"I envy him the opportunity of having been able to draw it up"
"If I take issue with anything in this report, it is purely on a matter of balance and perspective."
"It is a question of whether one regards the glass as being half full, or as being half empty."
"Mr Cushnahan rightly points to the question of the three legal cases which have caused concern."
"He rightly points to the lack of progress on the introduction of universal suffrage for the elections of the Chief Executive, to discrimination against companies with trading links with Taiwan and to the decline in confidence of the political system."
"These are all indeed serious challenges and if we must be grateful that things have gone as well as they have, we must nonetheless be concerned that greater progress has not been made."
"If we believe, as I do, that the biggest challenge of the 21st century is the democratisation of China, then of course Hong Kong is a fascinating experiment."
"I should be interested if the Commissioner would report to us something of the summit that Mr Prodi had with the Chinese last weekend and whether Hong Kong came up in those discussions."
"Democracy and the rule of law will not be achieved and sustained unless the West is determined to make its voice heard."
"I believe that the record of the European Union falls far behind that of the United States of America in this area."
"I am aware that our Member States have concerns about standing up against the Chinese on issues of human rights because they fear trade sanctions in retaliation."
"But if there is one area where western Europe could stand four-square behind the European banner, it is surely in this area."
"We must have a record on human rights which is as good as that of the United States."
"The ASEM summit last week managed to agree a statement which included as a goal of Asia-Europe cooperation the promotion of human rights."
"That is progress but we must look to the Commission for much more active involvement in this area; the fruits of such an approach will be enjoyed nowhere more than in Hong Kong."
"Mr President, our group has read the report by Mr Cushnahan with approval and due appreciation."
"In addition to overall satisfaction with regard to the functioning of the 'one country, two systems' policy, we too call for permanent vigilance which is in order following the worrying incidents."
"We are the first to express our anxiety with regard to the Hong Kong government' s decision to apply for an interpretation of the 1990 Basic Law from the Standing Committee of the National People' s Congress."
"The veto right which China could obtain as a result of this with regard to court rulings in Hong Kong puts a question mark over the legal autonomy of the Special Administrative Region."
"This is all the more worrying because the Hong Kong Government is not based on a democratically elected majority."
"The elections for the Legislative Council a month ago were once again proof of the democratic deficit."
"The electorate displayed their contempt for the system, in which only 24 of the 60 seats were filled by directly elected members."
"This partly explains the disappointing turn-out of 43.6%."
"The fact that an electoral college of 800 members subsequently decided on the occupation of six seats and the fact that only 175 000 businesspeople were entitled to elect the other half of parliament turned the elections into a complete farce."
"In this way, not only is the chasm between rich and poor sustained, it is also widened."
"We therefore opted for the swift introduction of direct elections by no later than 2008, at which time there will no longer be any legal restrictions."
"Finally, we would call for permanent vigilance with regard to the freedom of press, the need for laws with regard to fair competition and the possibility of an open trade relationship with Hong Kong and Taiwan."
"On that basis, we would recommend a stimulating trade policy vis-à-vis Hong Kong."
"I am delighted to be able to comment on this report and to commend the excellent work done by my honourable friend, John Cushnahan."
"He and I are old friends and, more importantly, old friends of Hong Kong."
"Both of us speak with - what I could describe with an understatement as - a degree of knowledge of that remarkable community."
"It has been a short debate, but we have heard some excellent and well-informed speeches."
"I was grateful for the kind things that the honourable gentleman, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, said about my time in Hong Kong."
"I agree with him about the importance of the freedom of speech and a vigorous media and, judging by my experiences last week, the media does remain - at least the written media - extremely vigorous."
"The honourable gentleman, Mr Watson, referred to the fact that we should not feel inhibited in what we say about Hong Kong or about other issues by our trading relationship with China."
"I am always surprised when people put the contrary point of view, not least because on the most recent figures, China had a EUR 30 billion trade surplus with the European Union."
"In the first six months of this year, the surplus was EUR 20 billion and looks like becoming EUR 40 billion for the whole year, so one needs to keep questions of trade in perspective, to put it very gently."
"It is a happy coincidence that the debate is taking place today, since I was in Hong Kong last week."
"It was my third visit since I relinquished the post of governor and my first full working visit as a Commissioner."
"I can report first hand to the House that while, as several honourable gentlemen have pointed out, some problems exist, Hong Kong nevertheless remains a free society, undoubtedly one of the freest societies in Asia as both the Commission and Parliament's annual reports make clear."
"The secret of Hong Kong's great success has always been its fusion of Hong Kong-Chinese entrepreneurial culture with the attributes of a free and open society founded on the rule of law."
"The concept of one country, two systems enshrined in the joint declaration is designed to maintain that special mix - a mix between independent judiciary, clean civil service, zero tolerance of corruption, free press on the one hand and market economics on the other."
"As both our reports make clear, so far, on the whole, it is managing to maintain the mix and I share the view in the honourable gentleman's report that the fundamentals of the arrangement remain reasonably intact."
"We must remember that Hong Kong has been through a momentous few years."
"Not only has it had to endure the transfer of sovereignty, no sooner did the flags change than Hong Kong - like the rest of Asia - was hit by the financial crisis."
"It is a considerable tribute to the strength and resilience of people in Hong Kong that they have taken these tumultuous events in their stride."
"It does not surprise me entirely, they are many of them former refugees or the sons and daughters of refugees and they are used to handling and overcoming adversity."
"I am delighted that the Hong Kong economy is now bouncing back very strongly after a difficult couple of years."
"Part of the reason for that is thanks to the excellent stewardship by Hong Kong's superb civil service, not least its chief secretary and financial secretary who served Tung Chee Hwa with the same skill and dedication with which they served me."
"Hong Kong has an outstanding civil service and it would have been nice if that had been the thrust of the Xinhwa report which the honourable gentleman referred to."
"For the most part, things have gone well but naturally there have been areas which have given rise to concern on the part of Hong Kong's many friends."
"Both reports address these directly. In particular, both reports mention the judgments in the right of abode case earlier this year."
"That was an important matter."
"We have emphasised and will continue to stress that the way in which this matter was handled, in particular the involvement of Beijing should remain wholly exceptional."
"There have been other issues too, including the recent controversy involving academic freedom and the even more recent one involving the Public Order Ordinance, where the provisional legislature replaced the more liberal arrangement that my administration bequeathed with something rather less liberal."
"I make no comment on that but I find it reassuring that Hong Kong public opinion continues to make clear that it takes its freedoms and rights very seriously."
"That goes for the media as well, as I mentioned earlier."
"The long-term success of one country, two systems was always going to depend on the willingness of Hong Kong people to stand up for their rights and liberties; so far they have shown every sign of being determined to do so."
"There are one or two specific issues in our bilateral relationship to which both reports refer."
"One is visa-free access to the European Union for Hong Kong SAR passport holders and the same issues apply equally for Macao."
"Both the Commission and the honourable gentleman's report support visa-free access."
"It was an issue that came up several times in my visit last week."
"I made clear then - as I make clear today - that I strongly support visa-free access."
"There are concerns on the part of some Member States."
"These concerns are profoundly misplaced."
"They stem from worries about illegal immigration from mainland China, not from the special administrative regions of Hong Kong or Macao."
"We remain wholly satisfied with the integrity of the border controls in place and with the integrity of SAR passport issuing procedures."
"The Council's visa working group which inspected the system was, I believe, impressed."
"I hope that we will be willing to grant visa-free access."
"I hope too that we will be able to reinforce a flourishing economic relationship with Hong Kong, with strengthened cooperation in other areas, such as education and the environment."
"We will aim to promote the use of the European Communities' existing instruments in Hong Kong, such as participation in the Fifth Framework Programme on research, as the honourable gentleman's report recommends."
"There are a number of further recommendations in the report which my officials will be studying closely."
"If I can just say one word about intellectual piracy, to which the honourable gentleman, Mr De Clercq, referred; it has been a problem for years."
"My administration took much more vigorous measures to deal with it."
"The present administration is taking particularly vigorous measures to deal with it, under the new director of the customs service whom I happen to know rather well because he was my private secretary for a number of years."
"Everybody has been impressed by the leadership that he has shown in tackling what is undoubtedly a serious problem for industry."
"In closing, we strongly endorse the view in the Parliament that this monitoring - your monitoring and our monitoring - is valuable and that it should continue."
"We do not seek to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs, but the international community and the European Union in particular have a considerable stake in Hong Kong and its continuing rights and freedoms are embodied in a treaty lodged at the United Nations."
"We will continue to maintain our interest in Hong Kong."
"It is a community which inspired admiration the world over for its achievements and which, much to the satisfaction of its last governor, continues to do so."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Cooperation with ACP countries involved in armed conflicts"
"The next item is the report (A5-0296/2000) by Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission' s Communication to the Council and the European Parliament: Cooperation with ACP countries involved in armed conflicts [COM(1999) 240 - C5-0115/1999 - 1999/2118(COS)]."
"Mr President, the Commission communication which we are discussing was published one and a half years ago following the outbreak of war in Central Africa."
"In the absence of a consensus, the Council has put the communication on ice all that time."
"In that time, an estimated 1.2 million people have been killed in the Congo war."
"In my report, I made a modest attempt to formulate a number of proposals in order to help end the spiral of violence and underdevelopment in which many of our ACP partners have ended up."
"These proposals also aim to avoid European funds being used to finance the war machine."
"My report can be summarised in three Cs: conditionality, coherence and control."
"More so than has been the case so far, there should be a clear link between debt relief and financial assistance on the one hand, and good governance, respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law on the other."
"I would even argue in favour of fixing a ceiling for military expenditure in the ACP countries above which assistance or debt relief is no longer provided."
"If these conditions are not met, the European Union needs to be prepared to take appropriate measures, ranging from diplomatic pressure and suspending aid, through to sanctions with a preference for arms and diamond embargoes or so-called 'smart' sanctions, which target the ruling elite rather than the population."
"In this connection, I would also urge the Commission to apply unambiguous criteria for suspending aid."
"I believe it would be particularly useful, in the framework of Article 96 of the Cotonou Convention, to compile a list of all possible infringements of this Convention."
"At present, I cannot shake off the impression that the Commission is applying an ad hoc approach too often, which can make it vulnerable to the accusation of applying double standards."
"In addition to conditionality, the emphasis is on more coherence, i.e. more coherence between the Lomé track and the CFSP track and between the policies of the Union and of the Member States."
"Situations such as those in Ethiopia, where the European Commission and a number of Member States froze aid, while other Member States started up new programmes, must be avoided at all costs."
"Moreover, stricter control on Community spending is required as a matter of urgency."
"ACP states involved in armed conflict should allow the World Bank and the IMF full access to their accounts."
"Misuse of European development aid for the purchase of weapons should immediately lead to the suspension of structural aid."
"In that respect, Europe cannot be strict enough."
"All of this should not detract from one of the European Union' s key roles, namely conflict prevention."
"As Rwanda and Ethiopia have shown, the alarm signals are usually in place, but the reaction to these is often inadequate and late."
"This is why it is important to tackle the cause of the problems in good time."
"Conflict prevention also involves the fight against poverty, the reinforcement of democracy and civil society, better control of the illegal arms trade, the setting up of an African peace-keeping force, as well as an international regulation on the use of mercenary armies and better control of the worldwide ban on child soldiers."
"In my report, I also call for greater involvement of the European Parliament."
"It seems essential to me that we have more of a say in the freezing or unfreezing of aid."
"I hope that the Council will not once again shelve this important communication, inspired by former Commissioner Deus Pinheiro."
"If we are serious about contributing to a peace deal in Central Africa, we must take firm and coherent action, aid must be made subject to conditions and a general arms embargo will need to apply in the Great Lakes region."
"Development aid should under no circumstance be used to fund wars."
"That is unacceptable, both to the people affected and to the European taxpayer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to add a few considerations to the valid points already made by rapporteur Van Hecke."
"I, and the rest of my Committee in fact, can concur with him in every respect, and I also want to thank him for the constructive cooperation which resulted in all amendments tabled by my Committee being incorporated in the text."
"This will please the President as he will not have to sit through many votes."
"The considerations which I would like to bring to you today for consideration, Commissioner, are mainly of a practical nature."
"As recently as today, we read in our newspapers that the situation in the Ivory Coast has taken a turn for the worse once again, and that our own people who are there to report on the elections are running the risk of being involved in a new armed internal conflict."
"We question the coherence of the policy of the Commission and the Council, whose absence in this Chamber I once again regret."
"Although in September 1998, it was agreed not to provide any budgetary aid to countries at war, in March 2000 the Commission provided Rwanda with EUR 110 million, while this country is occupying considerable parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in defiance of the peace agreements."
"I know that many who are involved in this conflict are themselves open to criticism."
"But do we then not apply stricter rules to Kabila' s DRC than to Uganda?"
"Are we not stricter with Zimbabwe than with Rwanda?"
"I have the impression that that is clearly the case because, in practice, countries which are even involved in one and the same armed conflict are being treated differently."
"Some are supported almost unconditionally by the European Union, the IMF and others."
"Other countries are given aid under strict conditions."
"This sometimes directly affects the power relations between countries involved in one and the same conflict."
"Let me make myself abundantly clear: I am against any form of budgetary aid given to warring countries, for this aid is invariably used to buy weapons, directly or indirectly."
"This is another weak area in our European policy."
"Arms exports deserve a mention as they are without a doubt implicated in the various conflicts."
"Not only is the illegal arms trade flourishing, but the controlled arms trade is also more interested in ""fair competition"" among arms traders than in the peace we are promoting."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has set itself the objective of eradicating poverty in these regions of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, which must be rescued from their wretchedly poor situation."
"That is Europe's duty, as a rich continent, but I am convinced that it is also in its interest."
"In his very comprehensive report, our rapporteur Johan Van Hecke rightly condemns the prevailing anarchy, the result of armed conflicts that cause endless bloodshed in some of these regions, as one of the causes of this poverty."
"He has rightly included the establishment of a peace force in his list of remedies to this situation, without this interfering in the internal affairs of all these countries, which are jealous of their independence."
"Given my experience in this field, allow me to go into this point a little further."
"We have moved beyond the age of military intervention by European contingents, not so much because this smacked of neo-colonialism as because the recent interventions by the international community, whether under the UN mandate or as a result of multilateral agreements, have shown the need to take a more regional approach to crises."
"If we want to make a really useful contribution to keeping or restoring peace, we need a deeper knowledge of the history, culture and even language of the country in which we are to intervene."
"That is why regional conflict-management mechanisms have been set up and must continue to be examined and developed, with the help of the European Union."
"They must gradually take on responsibility for measures in the field, as part of a common strategy, coordinated between the Member States and the ACP countries themselves, and it is up to our Parliament to continue to define these measures and to play a more active part in monitoring their implementation."
"In that respect, our rapporteur also deserves credit for proposing a very exhaustive list of the approaches and measures that can and must be adopted."
"Mr President, the new cooperation Agreement signed in Cotonou represents an ideal opportunity to correct the deficiencies noted in previous measures and to clarify concepts and standards for action in specific situations in which we cooperate with the ACP Countries, for example, in the situation that gave rise to the Commission Communication which concerns us here and to the reports by Mr Van Hecke and Mrs Maes, that is, what should happen when an associate country is involved in armed conflict."
"Along the lines of what was said by the rapporteurs, we think the European Union will have to revise its programmes of aid to countries at war, amongst other reasons to prevent the funds allocated from being diverted to military activities."
"Also as a matter of principle, it should reconsider support to countries or regimes responsible for armed invasions of neighbouring countries or that spend a disproportionate amount of their resources on arms, if not on operations to repress the rights of the individual or minorities within their own population."
"We must bear in mind Article 11 of the new Treaty which states the European commitment to policies of building peace and preventing and resolving armed conflict."
"The dialogue between the opposing parties and the dialogue of the European Union with these same parties must be the key mechanism of these actions."
"Like Mrs Maes, we are perplexed at the paradoxical behaviour, in which we see how, since the creation of the European Union, millions of euros of aid have been approved for countries that are clearly involved in the military occupation of one or other of their neighbours."
"In this respect, the double standards with which aid policy is sometimes applied are unacceptable, and we are also concerned by the contradictions that can arise in the conduct of Member States, or some States, and the European Union itself."
"I think Parliament would benefit from greater transparency, coherence, information and control over these policies."
"Finally, we must understand that the reduction or freezing of our development aid for a specific country at war would often need to be accompanied by additional efforts in humanitarian aid to the people of the country, who are the main victims of such conflicts."
"Here again, the intervention of trustworthy NGOs is essential, enabling such programmes to be carried out with guarantees of success and effectiveness."
"Mr President, violent conflicts are always man-made, however bestial in nature; they are never unavoidable like natural disasters; the leaders who cause them bear immense responsibility."
"That is always the case, but especially so in extremely poor countries, where the population suffers twice as much; development grinds to a halt and years of external effort and aid are nullified."
"And what is it about: gaining or refusing to relinquish power?"
"Accumulating minerals, massacring other ethnic groups, establishing independence or occupying part of the desert?"
"Africa, in particular, is an unusually belligerent part of the world."
"One in five Africans live in a country which is embroiled in serious conflict and, to make matters worse, the conflicts are increasing, both in number and in intensity."
"The big question is: why is this?"
"It is the European Union' s political and moral duty to do everything in its power to prevent or stop conflicts in ACP countries."
"The report by Mr Van Hecke is very close to my heart."
"We need to be much stricter vis-à-vis irresponsible ACP regimes; criteria for suspending aid must be clear, and sanctions need to be tailored to each country individually."
"We must target the rulers and not the population, however difficult this is, and our Parliament must be directly involved in the decision to suspend aid."
"It would be a complete outrage if European development aid were used to fund arms deals."
"EU Member States which provide weapons to warring parties are partly to blame for the profound human suffering and the obliteration of their own development aid."
"The Cotonou Convention is right in laying the foundation for further development, participation in world trade and political dialogue, but ACP countries which slip into violence destroy this cooperation and tear the Treaty to shreds."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on it."
"There is only one area of serious concern, and that is where the rapporteur extends the principle of conditionality to the area of debt relief."
"In almost every other area I would support conditionality."
"I strongly believe that we have a responsibility to use the tools available to us to promote good governance, democracy and the rule of law in our international relations."
"But while these should indeed guide our aid policies, there is an important distinction to be made when it comes to debt relief."
"That is because history demonstrates that responsibility for the debt lies with the lenders as well as the borrowers."
"Moreover, since the original loans were made the debt stock has continued to grow way beyond the original loans."
"Many countries are repaying their debts several times over."
"Some countries still spend more on debt repayment than on health and education combined, and yet the people suffering from this diversion of resources are certainly not those who had any benefit from the original loans that were given."
"There is a valid argument that says, what is the point of cancelling debt if undemocratic governments simply misuse the funds for their own ends?"
"That remains a possibility."
"But there is perhaps a stronger possibility that once populations know that debt has been cancelled, they can exert more pressure themselves on their governments to achieve much needed social spending."
"Mr Van Hecke's report says that applying conditionality requires consistency and courage."
"I agree."
"But in the context of debt relief it also requires justice and a recognition that in many cases, the original debt has already been repaid many times over."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the pertinence of his comments and for his many proposals."
"Out of the 34 poorest countries in the world, 20 are involved in a conflict. This situation is giving rise to instability in entire regions."
"Mr Morillon is right to highlight the question of poverty, the eradication of which is one of the objectives we set when we met with the ACP countries."
"I think that today we cannot afford not to think about debt cancellation and the structural adjustment policies which push these countries off course."
"I think that we must stop fixing the prices of raw materials ourselves and that we must sell triple-drug therapies and medicines at cost price."
"I am convinced that this is where a certain number of solidarity measures must be put in place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I am talking to you I feel I must spare a thought for all democrats and for the people of the Ivory Coast and, in the name of democracy, to ask for the departure of the military junta and General Gueï."
"We know that, if he stays, this will mean the balkanisation of Africa."
"His power is based on ethnic divides which we cannot accept."
"I therefore believe that, to go in the direction outlined by the rapporteur, we must have extremely clear things to say to the European taxpayer and to the ACP countries."
"We must make a commitment to tell the military junta in the Ivory Coast, and all dictatorships, that we will never issue them with visas or give them protection. We will also freeze their assets and, in addition, we will give our full backing to all democrats."
"It is simple and powerful phrases like these that will allow us to understand each other."
"Mr President, the Van Hecke report raises a fundamental question: to what extent is international aid to countries involved in conflicts a factor in these conflicts and to what extent does this aid favour corrupt and belligerent governments?"
"In connection with one of the poorest and most unfortunate areas in the world, I should like to give two examples of the pernicious role played by unconditional international aid."
"I am referring to one country which has been constantly at war since the 1960s and to another now enjoying a shaky peace, which, perversely, may be threatened by international aid: they are Angola and Mozambique, respectively."
"In Angola, the government and UNITA are waging one of the cruellest civil wars in Africa, and unfortunately it is clear that international aid to the Luanda government in particular has played a part in perpetuating this conflict."
"Unfortunately, I am afraid that my own government, the Portuguese Government, is involved in this military effort."
"In the case of Mozambique, where there is a shaky peace that was only achieved with great difficulty, the ruling party' s use of international aid to favour certain provinces to the detriment of others according to their election results may in itself be a major factor in destroying the peace that was achieved through such efforts a number of years ago, thus reopening the civil conflict in Mozambique."
"This is an issue that should be of fundamental concern to the European Union and the donor countries: whether in certain countries like Mozambique international aid is being used as an instrument of power to legitimise a government at the edges of democracy, and is thus helping to destroy a very shaky peace."
"These are issues raised by the report that warrant considerable reflection on our part."
"Mr President, I also welcome both the Commission communication and the report we have here today."
"One key message in all this is the need for consistency."
"The European Union has a number of activities under its umbrella: trade, Lomé agreements, CFSP, external policies and far too often one part is not necessarily consistent with another."
"Consistency must be our primary objective."
"Secondly, conflict prevention must be a priority of the European Union."
"We are now getting the measures in place."
"We have the High Representative, we have the planning and early warning unit in the Council."
"They must now emphasise that it is conflict prevention we need to focus on rather than intervening militarily after a conflict has got out of control."
"In particular, we must give due emphasis to things such as scarcity of water resources as a cause of conflict."
"Commission policy should be aimed at ensuring that we enhance water supplies, not diminish them as has sometimes been the case."
"As has been mentioned before, we need to stress the importance of good governance and democracy."
"That should be a part of conditionality and we should demand of Member States that they do not support politicians for short-term requirements if they do not meet the essential requirements of good governance and democracy."
"Far too often, we are prepared to support one against another group to the long-term detriment of peace in a particular region."
"Finally, what we must do of course, is to stem the flow of arms into these regions, not just by actions against small arms."
"I would like to see, as I outlined in my report last month, action taken against arms brokers throughout the European Union."
"In many countries, there are no controls over the activities of arms brokers."
"They are able to trade as they will, and in almost every conflict you will find arms brokers behind the proliferation of arms."
"It is crucial as part of the EU code of conduct that we license arms brokers and start to control their activities."
"It is no good governments tidying up exports if we allow private individuals to act in they way they are doing."
"Similarly, we should also look at licensed manufacturing."
"It is no good having rules on manufacturing within the EU if EU companies are able to license production outside as a way of getting round the controls."
"I welcome this report, but would stress that we will not get anywhere unless we are prepared to stem the flow of arms into regions of conflict."
"That requires much tougher action than we have been prepared to indulge in up to now."
"Mr President, the report highlights what is self-evident, that is, that armed conflicts in Africa have seen a dramatic increase in number and intensity, and that they result in immense human suffering."
"However, this compassionate language is also a way of covering up the direct or indirect but nonetheless overwhelming responsibility of the major European powers themselves in the majority of these conflicts, from Rwanda to Sierra Leone."
"Today, in the Ivory Coast, even though, faced with the reaction of the population of Abidjan against the recently attempted coup d' état, both Lionel Jospin and Jacques Chirac have taken a stand against the putsch, how is it possible not to condemn the policy of French imperialism?"
"The links between General Gueï and the French administration are notorious, as are his links with a certain number of major French industrial conglomerates which control entire economic sectors in the Ivory Coast."
"Paris noted the first coup d' état by General Gueï with a benevolent neutrality. What is more, it exhibited shameful discretion towards the despicable ethnic, xenophobic demagogery which has been developed over a number of years by the rulers of the Ivory Coast."
"The French authorities also remained silent on the fact that ethnicity was used in the selection of candidates for the presidential elections, which ran the catastrophic risk of transforming rivalries for power into all-out ethnic war."
"If the European institutions really want to tackle the causes of the evil that is striking Africa, they must start by opposing the policy of the major European powers themselves."
"Mr President, the rapporteur should be congratulated on the excellent work that was done so intelligently."
"A good proposal such as this is actually crying out for implementation in practice, and we should commit our policies to it wholeheartedly for our own sake."
"The report states quite rightly our own importance as the largest donor of aid to many ACP countries, a fact which is not yet sufficiently reflected at political level in the resolution of conflicts."
"This must be the starting point for any action we take."
"For that reason, I welcome the fact that the report speaks about the importance of positive conditionality with a high level of self-confidence. There are good grounds for that."
"The profile that crises have assumed in the last few decades has decidedly changed."
"The UN, which was originally established to respond to conflicts between states, is seeking once again to get a grip on managing the increasingly common crises taking place internally in countries."
"For this reason the EU, as an economic and political partner, now has an enormous responsibility and, furthermore, plenty of scope for influencing situations."
"The trend worldwide would appear to be that more and more conflicts have a religious dimension: Kosovo, Chechnya, southern Sudan, Northern Ireland, East Timor, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Kashmir and, one of the worst in recent times, the Moluccas, in Indonesia."
"In the West this is not completely understood."
"We are easily led to believe that when religion plays a part we are dealing with a private matter."
"But in these countries religious tensions have been used for political purposes."
"Mr President, we need the right tools to solve this delicate problem."
"One important aim would be, in my opinion, to create the post of human rights observer, or representative, who would report to the EU, particularly on the issue of religious tensions."
"The EU would also have to put pressure on governments, determinedly and systematically, to allow international human rights observers access to countries at war to conduct an impartial, neutral study of conflicts."
"We must also use all the means available to us to demand that governments should always commit to ensuring the safe passage of those taking humanitarian aid to various regions."
"The Commission initiative to review cooperation with ACP countries involved in armed conflicts in 1998 and its communication of May 1999, served to initiate a debate on the most appropriate response of the EU towards countries in conflict with which the EU has a close cooperation relationship."
"My colleague, Mr Patten, proposed in March this year that the General Affairs Council should consider this communication in the context of its debate on conflicts in Africa."
"The General Affairs Council concluded in May that the relevant bodies of the Council should continue their reflection upon the issue of development aid to countries involved in armed conflicts, on the basis of the Commission communication."
"I regret that the Member States have not taken up the Commission's communication more actively."
"Events in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbours in Angola and Burundi, the Horn of Africa and now, again, in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone, have shown that we cannot escape facing these difficult questions."
"The Commission is considering its response and in particular the use of Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement wherever this is appropriate."
"A comprehensive framework would help us to respond on a case-by-case basis to each conflict."
"If the Council is willing to follow up the communication, for instance by formulating Council conclusions, the Commission will assist in ensuring they reflect the many advances since mid-1999 in the EU's policy on crisis management and in the CFSP, as well as developments in the international community's response to conflicts."
"We will also take account of the innovations of the Cotonou agreement, particularly regarding political dialogue, which should help us to find appropriate measures and proportionate and coherent responses."
"But it is clear that there are no easy solutions to these problems, as the contributions in the debate here this afternoon clearly demonstrate."
"The bottom line will, in any case, be defined by the real political will of Member States to stick to a common line."
"The Commission cannot promise Parliament miracles in this field."
"We are prepared to broaden deliberations to other countries involved in armed conflicts."
"Violent conflict is not a phenomenon limited to ACP countries."
"The European Union must be prepared to react to violence in an efficient and coherent manner in other regions of the globe too."
"The communication is an invitation to engage in a debate about EU relations with countries for which the traditional form of development cooperation has become questionable or obsolete."
"This is a difficult debate."
"We would prefer to devote all our efforts to assisting the ACP countries in the difficult task of overcoming poverty and of integrating into a rapidly changing global economy."
"However, for a considerable number of our ACP partners, the major challenge is the restoration of peace, or the containment of regional destabilisation."
"Peace is an indispensable precondition to development, and countries that remain entangled in violent conflict exclude themselves from the potential benefits of the new cooperation relationship the EU is offering them."
"They are also depriving themselves of the opportunities of the ongoing transformation of the global economy."
"They contaminate the prospect of foreign investment, not only in these countries, but also in their regions."
"In less unstable countries, our efforts to fight poverty and provide debt relief are contributing to conflict prevention in the longer term."
"The Commission has not been idle since submitting the communication."
"It has already taken numerous initiatives aimed at strengthening its capacities for effectively addressing the problem of violent conflicts in ACP countries."
"Support is given to the OAU and sub-regional organisations such as ECOWAS and IGADD in the areas of conflict prevention and management."
"It is remarkable how much funding is committed for the management of crises or for post-conflict reconstruction."
"We are committed to stepping up our efforts for effectively preventing violence and for resolving crises peacefully."
"The Community has a great number of instruments available for conflict prevention and resolution, ranging from trade and cooperation agreements to support for institutional capacity building, for strengthening respect for human and minority rights or for demobilisation and rehabilitation."
"We are committed to making even more effective and targeted use of these instruments."
"In this context we are aiming in particular to introduce conflict prevention objectives into the programming of economic and development assistance programmes."
"The problem is, however, that the rigid character of these instruments is in itself a limitation to what we can do and how we can use them."
"Budget line limitations and comitology-based decision-making procedures limit our options for flexible and quick reaction."
"All this looks very different from the toolbox concept, which is what I think of when we talk about the numerous instruments that are available."
"The toolbox concept provides a good image of the ideal situation and a satisfactory way of making use of the diversity of instruments."
"However, we find ourselves in a different situation even though we are making determined reform efforts."
"I would add that the basic value of development cooperation in relation to the issue of conflicts is the preventive effect."
"Our hands are not so strong once conflict has actually broken out; we can make more meaningful efforts beforehand."
"There is no doubt whatsoever that the HIPC initiative, funded by the EU but not yet funded by the US, is making the biggest contribution to conflict prevention in the world right now."
"There is little doubt that the very poor, highly indebted countries will plunge into instability and conflict if the rich world does not deliver on HIPC."
"Also the creation of regional economic cooperation, as provided for in the Cotonou Agreement makes a basic contribution to stability in Africa."
"In the next few years we will give top priority to the creation of regional stability and cooperation structures as a major contribution to the promotion of peace and progress in Africa."
"I should say a few words on the situation in the Ivory Coast, in view of what has been said in this debate."
"Unfortunately there has been a rapid deterioration in the situation since the elections on Sunday."
"It is changing almost from hour to hour, but we are of course following events very closely."
"We anticipate that we will have to reopen the Article 96 consultations if a situation of stability and clarity is not established following the election."
"This is really a situation that is highly regrettable and we fear there will be even more violence if things are not brought under control quite rapidly."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Moratorium on death penalty"
"This Parliament and, for what it is worth, this Commissioner, have been long-standing opponents of the death penalty."
"Speaking for myself, I voted consistently against it when I was a member of another parliament."
"One of the first decisions that I took when I was Governor of Hong Kong, with the support of organisations like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, was to take the death penalty off the statute book of Hong Kong and I am delighted that it remains off the statute book."
"Parliament has declared in the past that it considers capital punishment an inhuman, medieval form of punishment and unworthy of modern societies."
"I know that many people would echo that sentiment."
"I am pleased that all Central and Eastern European countries which are candidates for membership of the Union have abolished the death penalty."
"We are moving towards a Europe in which the death penalty is outlawed continent-wide."
"The European Union is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances and has agreed to campaign for its universal abolition."
"That stance is rooted in our belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings and in the inviolability of the human person."
"In my case, my opposition to the death penalty is also rooted in my belief in the sanctity of human life."
"Some 87 states retain the death penalty and about 30 carry out executions in any given year."
"One or two states carry out executions in industrial quantities."
"The European Union has been for some time now actively seeking a global moratorium."
"The Union has defined a set of guidelines for identifying circumstances in which the European Union can take specific, targeted action."
"These guidelines specify that the European Union will encourage states to accede to the second optional protocol of the Convention on Civil and Political Rights and comparable regional mechanisms aimed at the abolition of the death penalty."
"We will also raise the issue of the death penalty in multilateral forums."
"The European Union shares the deep concern of all those opposed to the death penalty, that it is impossible to reduce to zero the risk of applying the penalty in error."
"That risk, the risk of taking innocent life, is reason enough in the view of many of us to outlaw it as a punishment."
"Nor do we accept the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to violent crime since in our countries the evidence simply does not support that claim."
"In countries which maintain the death penalty, the European Union aims at the progressive restriction of its scope and respect for the strict conditions set out in several international human rights instruments under which capital punishment may be used, as well as at the establishment of a moratorium on executions, so as to eliminate completely the death penalty."
"During the presidencies of Finland and Portugal, the European Union raised the issue of the death penalty with a host of countries including the authorities in Antigua and Barbuda, Burundi, the Bahamas, China, Guyana, India, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, the Palestinian Authority, Pakistan, the Philippines, Tajikistan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Uzbekistan, the Yemen and Zimbabwe."
"In the case of China, we used the forum of our dialogue on human rights to press the issue time and again."
"I regret that China continues to make almost daily use of the death penalty."
"The European Union is especially concerned about the imposition of the death penalty on young people below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime."
"The European approach to juvenile justice is consistent with internationally recognised juvenile justice standards as enshrined in the international human rights instruments."
"I said at the outset that the European Union had decided to raise the issue of the death penalty in multilateral fora."
"This has not always been simple."
"The House will recall that following intensive negotiation, we decided at last year's UN General Assembly in November that no resolution was better than a fatally flawed text and that therefore the European Union should not pursue its initiative in the United Nations General Assembly."
"This April's UN Commission on Human Rights resolution was, however, adopted with a clear majority, I am extremely pleased to say."
"It would seem that while the hard-line retentionists are resigned to further Commission on Human Rights texts on this issue, they will continue to resist strongly any efforts to secure a General Assembly resolution."
"This would lead to further divisive debate."
"As a result the European Union has decided that it would not be either advisable or timely to table a resolution on the death penalty at UNGA 55."
"In the meantime we continue to support campaigns designed to achieve a moratorium on the death penalty and executions, and eventually the abolition of capital punishment throughout the world."
"We do so under the budget lines that fall under the chapter ""European initiative for democracy and human rights""."
"In particular under budget line B7-704 we are pursuing a number of initiatives throughout the world designed to mobilise public opinion against the death penalty."
"In 1999 a joint programme was established between the Commission and the Council of Europe to raise public awareness about various themes related to the abolition of the death penalty in Russia, Turkey, Albania and Ukraine."
"The programme, worth over EUR 670 000 over two years, will provide information to parliamentarians, to legal experts and to the general public on the penal policy arguments against capital punishment."
"Let me repeat, this is a subject we take seriously."
"It is a subject which I personally take extremely seriously."
"We speak on it as a Union with a degree of moral authority."
"We are making progress."
"But it will take time and persistence as well as the continued advocacy of this Parliament if we are to attain one day our goal, which is to see the death penalty consigned to the history books as a form of punishment which has absolutely no place in the modern world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said so well on many occasions, Parliament, and with it the Group of the European People's Party, has declared itself against the death penalty and in favour of a universal moratorium on capital punishment, the sole objective of which is to achieve the definitive abolition of the death penalty throughout the world."
"It could not be otherwise, given that this practice, which is directly connected with respect for human life, runs contrary to the defence of human rights, the first of which, the basis and foundation for all the others, is the right to life, which is promoted by the European Union."
"There comes a time, however, when words are not enough and a far more aggressive attitude must be adopted in defence of what, for the Christian Democrats, constitutes the very core of our philosophy and our political action: the transcendental value of the person and the right to life from the moment of conception until their natural death; two principles which are incompatible with the application of the death penalty."
"Therefore, we are not only advocating its abolition, but also proposing the possibility of using budget lines intended for human rights to campaign in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty, and that non-governmental organisations, both international and local, and religious authorities may also participate in the implementation of these budget lines."
"And we propose this, first of all, because human rights and the abolition of the death penalty constitute a whole and because this enables us to move from words to action, and because the participation of civil society is essential to creating a mindset and a collective awareness in favour of abolishing the death penalty."
"It is clear that there is a tendency in favour of abolishing the death penalty."
"We need only look at the statistics."
"Nonetheless, it is still applied in 90 States and we cannot turn a blind eye to the 1,625 known executions carried out in 1998, 80% of which took place in just four countries, including, in third place, the United States of America with 68 executions."
"Therefore, together with respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty must be a key element, Commissioner, in relations between the European Union and third countries."
"This is particularly so in the case of the United States due to the contradiction inherent in championing freedom throughout the world and having the power of life or death over its citizens, be it in order to set an example or because a majority of citizens requests it."
"Democracy cannot subject everything to the law of numbers as no action affecting the fundamental rights of the person, the first and foremost of which is the right to life, can be undertaken or justified in the name of the majority."
"If the death penalty - as the community of San Egidio told us - dehumanises our world by giving primacy to reprisals and revenge, then placing all measures, both economic and political, within our reach in order to banish a practice that is contrary to the principles and values that constitute our raison d'être should be a priority objective for the European Union."
"We are therefore pleased that the Commission has adopted this objective and that it is being treated with the degree of gravity that the Commissioner told us this fundamental issue deserves, so that we might be in harmony with the principles we are defending."
"Mr President, once again Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of human dignity and against the death penalty."
"But on this occasion it has done so following the approval by the Convention of the definitive text of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"This Charter actually devotes its first chapter to human dignity, stating that it is inviolable and will be respected and protected."
"It also states that nobody can be condemned to the death penalty or executed."
"Parliament has spoken in favour of the Charter being incorporated into the Treaties and these rights of European citizens being applied to citizens of third countries."
"However, it is more relevant than ever for us to ask ourselves whether it is time to demand that the Commission and the Council incorporate the abolition of the death penalty as a clause respecting human rights into negotiations with all third countries, not only those waiting in line to become part of the European Union."
"1999 was another bad year."
"According to Amnesty International, almost 2000 people were executed and in 63 countries 4000 others were condemned to death."
"China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States are some of the 31 countries in which executions took place."
"Did you know that in this last country, in the United States, that great upholder of democratic fundamentals - as Concepció Ferrer was saying just now - 98 citizens were executed in 1999?"
"Did you know that in 18 North-American states it is possible to execute a sixteen-year-old?"
"Did you know that in that same country, since 1976, 34 mentally-retarded offenders have been executed?"
"I draw attention to the United States, not because I am anti-American, which I am not, but because we are talking about a democracy with which we are on good terms, which watches over the interests of peace and democracy in the world."
"I would like us all to ask ourselves whether we can do more."
"It is time we understood that humanitarian declarations alone are not enough."
"I believe that if we do not turn this fight into a political commitment, with a capital P, as a fundamental part of European foreign policy - and that is why I am pleased that Commissioner Patten is here - we will be doing less than we could to prevent this barbarism."
"Let us do all we can from within this House."
"Let us remember the words of Albert Camus: ""There will be no lasting peace either in the heart of individuals or in social customs until death is outlawed"" ."
"And another thing, Mr Patten, you were saying in your speech that we cannot guarantee zero error in executions."
"Every execution is an error."
"I am agnostic, but I read the Bible and it says that nobody should touch Cain in spite of the fact that he killed his brother Abel."
"Every execution is an error that democracy, the defence of human rights and human dignity cannot accept."
"Mr President, I welcomed Commissioner Patten's speech, in particular his words about his own personal experience, and the absurdity of a punishment which is becoming increasingly less effective in the world as a deterrent in the minds of a growing number of citizens."
"Europe has certainly made substantial progress in its undertaking, with the formalisation of the rejection of the death penalty and the affirmation of the right to life in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the forceful stipulation that any country wishing to join the European enlargement process must abolish the death penalty, the increase in intervention measures in respect of relations with third countries under the human rights clause and, lastly, the Council's prioritisation of the moratorium on the use of the death penalty as a common foreign and security policy action."
"When our international institutions, when the AJA Tribunal is faced with the sentence inflicted on the criminal Tadic - who is guilty of heinous crimes - and we compare these appalling crimes with any of the incidents in any countries, including democratic countries, as a result of which thousands of people are now waiting on death row, we may be able to appreciate the fact that what had been a purely European characteristic, that is the rejection of capital punishment, may - in political time, not historical time - spread until it becomes the clearly predominant political, institutional and humanitarian modus operandi throughout the world."
"This is the inspiration behind the new Europe of the start of the third millennium."
"This, Mr President, is why it is necessary for the Commission - and I would ask Commissioner Patten to give an incisive response - to make good use of these amendments to the European Union's budget that were tabled by our Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party in respect of the 2000 budget."
"Indeed, there can be no institutional initiative in this field without close cooperation with non-governmental organisations."
"I therefore propose, Commissioner, that you consider the possibility of Europe establishing a European Day of protest against the death penalty: this would make a substantial contribution to generating a universal consciousness from that cradle of civilisation which Europe is and wishes to remain."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance firmly supports the resolution which will be adopted tomorrow on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty."
"It was on 10 March 1992 that Mrs Adelaide Aglietta presented the first major report to the European Parliament calling for a moratorium on executions, to be decided upon by the UN."
"8 years on, as our resolution also highlights, the situation is serious and gives cause for concern, but international interest in the moratorium is constantly on the rise."
"We must take this as a fresh starting point, despite the recent lull in UN activity and, for this reason, we must make good use of the resources available under the budget."
"Of course, a moratorium would not have been able to prevent the 4 000 arbitrary executions which have taken place in recent years in Iraq or the thousands of executions which have taken place in China, but in other countries, especially the United States, the only great democracy still to exercise the death penalty with stubborn pride, this long labouring to mobilise public opinion to call for a moratorium is having some, very slight, effect."
"Mr Bush, in whose State 144 executions have been carried out, succeeded in removing the issue of the death penalty from the electoral campaign and discreetly and hypocritically postponed the executions in his State until after the elections."
"Might this not be yet more proof of the cynical manipulation of people's lives - even though they are often guilty, of course - as a cynical political move?"
"This is why we must continue along this road with the same conviction and tenacity that Mrs Aglietta had when she founded the association 'Hands Off Cain'."
"We may not get there immediately but we are confident that, with the available funds from the budget and the assistance of the Commission, we will succeed in achieving this objective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone has the right to life and freedom under the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"All the Member States of the United Nations have committed themselves to respect that declaration."
"The death penalty irrevocablyviolates the right to life and is inevitably cruel, inhumane and humiliating."
"In the year 2000 alone, 70 people have been executed in the USA."
"There is a long list of countries in which the death penalty is carried out or in which death sentences are imposed, such as China, Iran and Iraq."
"Although no death penalties have been carried out in Turkey since 1984, over 69 people have been sentenced to death."
"The Turkish Parliament has the final word on carrying out this sentence and has 49 cases to deal with."
"This is unacceptable for a state which is seeking membership of the European Union."
"Turkey must abolish the death penalty if it is to be accepted into the European Union."
"Why have a death penalty?"
"Since the death penalty has existed, people have unsuccessfully tried to justify the need for it."
"Nowadays, supporters of the death penalty chiefly use the argument that it acts as a deterrent."
"They maintain that the number of serious offences rises when the death penalty is abolished."
"There is not the least evidence of this anywhere in the world."
"For example, how can you explain that the murder rate in the USA, where the death penalty still exists, is considerably higher than in countries where it has been abolished?"
"There is always the risk of an innocent person being executed - there have already been many cases in which innocent people have been sentenced to death."
"In particular, the death penalty is applied relatively often to the disadvantaged and to minorities."
"The underlying principle of the death penalty is revenge, which is inappropriate in a civilised state."
"Whether it is Abu-Jamal in the USA, Öçalan in Turkey or even the execution of Abdul Achmin Sabiin Iraq - we should condemn all of this."
"I regard the death sentence as a barbaric ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, in the same way as the Treaty of Amsterdam and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament has repeatedly declared itself to be opposed to the death penalty which sadly, as has been pointed out, still exists in many countries of the world: countries with antidemocratic traditions such as Communist China and extremely liberal countries such as the United States."
"We are also aware of how difficult it is to succeed in eliminating this penalty which is so very unnatural and inhumane."
"It is even difficult in America where, as Mrs Frassoni pointed out, those who represent the institutions, the policy-makers, do not dare to propose abolishing capital punishment for fear of losing support."
"The reason is clear: with the rise in organised crime the death penalty is considered to be a deterrent, containing and checking the increase in crime and illegal activity."
"However, we know that this is not at all the case; we know that the death penalty is an abhorrent practice, a form of State-legalised crime."
"We know that, even though it is strict and uncompromising, the fight against crime must be pursued under the banner of the law and social rehabilitation, certainly not in the name of repression alone or, what is even worse, with the mentality of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
"This is precisely why we must promote a Europe-wide campaign for a moratorium on the death penalty, a large-scale human rights campaign which involves everybody, from those with political or institutional roles to the citizens themselves, especially the younger citizens, precisely in order to create genuine civil awareness of the matter and to put political pressure on the countries in which the death penalty is still part of the law."
"I would also like to propose that the European States refuse to trade with those countries in which the death penalty is still practised, but I know that this is nothing but a utopian dream."
"I refer, in particular, to China, which, as the Commissioner too mentioned, issues a death sentence every day of the week and in general shows very little respect for human rights but which, regrettably, is also a highly attractive trading partner for all the European countries and one they cannot do without."
"I would like to end by saying that these campaigns against the death penalty would be much more efficient and much more widespread if we were to succeed, as an institution, in conveying to our citizens the idea that we are simultaneously working, with equal determination and efficiency to build a safe Europe where it will be possible to eradicate terrible criminal scourges, such as drug trafficking, the exploitation of human beings and child abuse, in the very near future."
"It is to her that we owe the start of this lengthy undertaking in 1992, the start of this interminable battle in which we are still engaged. And it is precisely with a view to the past, when I look at the progress made since 1992, Commissioner, that I cannot share your positive reaction to the Union's withdrawal of its support from the resolution presented in November at the United Nations."
"Commissioner, I am convinced that this was an opportunity missed and that, due to the issue of the inflexibility of the wording, which prevented a compromise being reached on the preamble - I repeat, on the preamble, nothing to do with the body of the text at all - we were actually in danger of losing sight of the crux of the matter and ended up dancing to the tune of a whole range of powerful countries, some well-disposed towards the project and others not so well-disposed, or of great markets whose noses were most certainly put out of joint by this initiative."
"This is nothing new - Europe was divided as early as 1994 over the motion for a resolution presented by Italy - but for this very reason it is all the more serious, for the eight years of work put in not only by Parliament but by your staff, I am sure, Commissioner, and the Union as such, could have resulted in a victory last November."
"There is no doubt that victory would have been possible. I repeat, in my opinion, we missed a major opportunity."
"Having said that, Commissioner, I feel that, precisely on this type of subject, working in conjunction with organisations which operate in society or with non-governmental organisations is a key factor, for these organisations usually have greater room for manoeuvre, and are able to be bolder and uphold positions which are, so to speak, less influenced by other considerations or interests, in themselves legitimate but all too often liable to lead governments and institutions to compromise and assume less forthright positions."
"This is precisely why part of the resolution calls upon the Commission to be more explicit in its report and in providing transparent information on the use of the year 2000 budget lines relating to this matter and to democratisation in general."
"It has, in fact, happened in the past and still happens that the very organisations which have put most work into this matter have, so to speak, been excluded from working with the Commission on a project, even though they have been doing so for many years because, it appears, there is no more funding and we do not know exactly where it has gone."
"That is why, Commissioner, I feel that transparency and the provision of information would benefit a joint project which, I feel sure, is of interest to us all."
"Mr President, we must thank the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council for including this vital issue in the weekly priorities, in particular at a time - as Mrs Díez reminded us - when the European Council has just proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"At the moment - as it has been said - the images of the American electoral campaign and the final debate between the two main candidates are fresh in our minds; a debate in which the candidate for the Democrats stated publicly that the only thing he had in common with his opponent was being in favour of the death penalty."
"I think it is important for the European Union to head the campaign to abolish the death penalty, given that it is a campaign in favour of human dignity and the most basic of fundamental rights."
"Commissioner, I believe - and you expressed this very well - that when developing the European Union' s external affairs policy we must consider, with regard to the third countries, that there is already a declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam which clearly reflects that to be eligible for membership of the European Union, candidate states must have abolished the death penalty."
"But, I insist, in relations with third countries we must be extremely clear and firmly promote relations with those countries that share our views on this matter."
"Commissioner - Mrs Ferrer expressed this very well a moment ago - sometimes we need to move on from beatitudes to balance sheets and we must therefore support the Commission's action with adequate programming, effective action and, in particular, visible, clear, transparent action by the European Union with the participation - as Mrs Bonino stated - of the non-governmental organisations, which have a lot to say and contribute from this point of view."
"Mr President, I believe that the institutions must live up to the values of our civilisation and that our citizens must see themselves reflected in the ethical mirror that, as a result of our work, we should be for them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if every petition which we discussed and approved in this House were worth a life then I would be satisfied."
"Regrettably, however, this has never been the case and it is not so now."
"We must avoid turning our reasoning and indignant declarations into a wake because, while we are expressing our indignation, executions are still being carried out."
"Therefore, what we want from Parliament, the Commission and the Council too is sound pragmatism: we must endeavour to understand how we can be effective, how we can tip the balance so that the death penalty ceases to disgrace the whole of humanity."
"This is what the resolution is trying to say."
"There are two points which we consider to be of basic practical concern."
"Firstly, the abolition of the death penalty or a moratorium must continue to be an inalienable priority in our relations with third countries, not a condition for friendship but a condition for political, commercial and economic cooperation."
"The second point - which you raised, Commissioner, and which, I am happy to say, was taken up by many of the Members - is that the Commission must exercise great care in allocating its financial resources in order to support campaigns which are able to alter the public perception of the death penalty."
"As Mr Salafranca pointed out, there was a rather embarrassing moment in the debate for the US presidential elections when both the candidates for the Presidency of the United States declared that they were in favour of the death penalty."
"We are the children of Cesare Beccaria: we do not want our heritage to be confined within the borders of Europe."
"Therefore, we need actions in support of non-governmental organisations, in support of civil society, in support too of those who have proved that they have the enormous amount of courage necessary to invest in this area, as Mrs Bonino mentioned."
"I will end, Commissioner by calling for the highest possible degree of pragmatism from the Commission;"
"I call upon the Council to give voice to our governments; I call upon Parliament to be courageous enough never to fall silent on this matter."
"Mr President, every day, people are executed and, every day, people are condemned to death."
"It is incredible and horrific that this should still be happening in the year 2000."
"As has also been said by other MEPs in this Chamber - most of whom have been Italian, though I do not believe that that is really significant, given the disgust we all feel - it is an unworthy punishment: a punishment unworthy of a civilised society, which always involves a risk of innocent people being convicted."
"China tops the list when it comes to the death penalty, and I and other Members of this Chamber have often made a point of condemning China."
"Today, I thought, however, of concentrating on the United States."
"There is a presidential election in the United States in two weeks' time, and the next president may be George Bush, a person who has signed 145 people' s execution warrants."
"There have been legal doubts concerning a number of the cases, and there have also been a number of cases concerning children."
"In at least one of these cases, the child concerned was mentally handicapped."
"It is abominable and shameful, and it seriously damages the United States' s reputation as a democracy."
"With the presidential election in mind, it is incredibly important that we should express our disgust in this Chamber."
"I wish vigorously to support the proposal of my fellow MEP, Mr Rutelli, for a European day of opposition to the death penalty during our Presidency."
"Mr President, between noble intent and practical action falls a shadow; on the issue of the death penalty it is the shadow of geopolitics and economic interests."
"Your stand today on capital punishment goes beyond noble intent."
"You mentioned the year 2000 budget lines aimed at financing campaigns for the abolition of the death penalty."
"So far so good."
"But the shadow is still there."
"Let me come to the point, Commissioner Patten."
"The EUR 700 000 invested by the Commission went mainly to Penal Reform International, a legal organisation which operates in the Caribbean islands, and to the University of Westminster, which provides a database and research for lawyers in study centres in the Philippines."
"So I urge the Commission to focus and extend the use of the assistance funds to the two main nations where state murder is practised with no restraint and with great relish: the People's Republic of China and the United States of America."
"Yes, we know the issue has been raised ritually and periodically with the governments of both countries, but we have to do much more."
"For instance, as regards the United States, some of this money should be invested in sensibilisation campaigns in Europe, certainly not in order to boycott a sovereign state like Texas, but to re-route European tourism and European industrial investment to those 12 states that do not indulge in such a barbaric practice."
"Mr President, I am personally opposed to the death penalty for a variety of reasons, and despite this, I would like to make two fundamental observations which are at odds with everything that has been said so far in this Chamber."
"First of all, surely we should not be comparing apples and oranges."
"There is a world of difference between the implementation of the death penalty in, for example, the United States on the one hand, and in countries such as China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, North Korea - to name but a few of a long list - on the other."
"In the first case, we are talking about the highest penalty for extremely dangerous criminals who, moreover, have been able to avail themselves of very many defence mechanisms in the democratic court procedures."
"In the other cases, the death penalty is often a kind of random and horrifying tool of intimidation used by no means only against dangerous criminals under common law."
"Anyone who lumps all of this together is clearly deluding himself."
"Secondly, I have to say that it is easy to shed crocodile tears over the fate of dangerous criminals in democratic states."
"It is somewhat more difficult to take pity on those left behind, for example old people who are tortured to death for their savings, badly paid money couriers who are shot dead by gangsters in a heartless act, or children who are raped and killed."
"If I were convinced that in Europe, there is the will to look after the fate of victims and the safety of victims, I, along with you, would condemn the death penalty here today without any reservation."
"I can only establish that in practice, certainly in my country, extremely dangerous criminals are systematically set free early and it is not unusual for them to commit horrific crimes again."
"It is in those circumstances not surprising that many people say that the death penalty for some monsters who have offended again and again could have saved numerous innocent lives."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this debate, which is a repeat of other, previous debates would, on the surface, appear superfluous and outdated."
"A debate on the death penalty is a debate which harks back to the development of a civilised legal system, which is something Europe already has."
"And yet it is topical and important in terms of world affairs."
"It is important for the Parliament of Europe - of Western Europe - to treat it as such since two traditions have evolved in Europe over the millennium: one which derives from the Roman tradition which influenced the European legal culture, particularly that of Italy and Germany, and recently paved the way for the new rights to freedoms, and then the tradition of Common Law, which is a basic part of the British Bill of Rights."
"Despite certain very tragic events which have taken place in Europe, despite the fact that there have been fascist and communist cultures that have trampled underfoot rights to freedoms and the rights of individuals, I feel it noteworthy that agreement has been reached time and time again in this Parliament in discussing the death penalty and firmly condemning it in any form whatsoever."
"In my opinion, the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is under discussion, for which Nice will be a decisive moment, is based on this value, the value of the human person, the value of the right to freedom."
"We Italians are of the tradition of Cesare Beccaria, as has already been said, but Beccaria was a man who belonged to Europe, who rejected mediaeval, obscurantist law in its entirety in favour of modern law, in favour of a legal system which does not make us wolves to our fellow men but, by means of peaceful civil coexistence, guarantees freedoms."
"Capital punishment is always incompatible with peace in civil coexistence and we must find the courage to declare that accepting a moratorium - although that would be great step forward - is not enough to make a country genuinely democratic: to achieve true democracy it must abolish the death penalty."
"And so it is true: a humanitarian undertaking is not sufficient."
"Mr President, in 1999, eighty-five percent of all executions took place in only five countries: China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States."
"It is, of course, correct that the European Union does not permit the death penalty within its borders."
"The death penalty is the cruellest, most inhumane and degrading penalty."
"It violates the right to life, is irrevocable and can involve innocent people."
"Furthermore, it has never been proven that it is a better deterrent against crime than any other kind of penalty."
"It was stated a moment ago that in the United States, there might be a better legal procedure or that very serious crimes are sometimes committed there."
"But that is exactly the point."
"We, as government, cannot afford to stoop to the level of the criminals we punish."
"That is precisely the civilisation which we have achieved here in Europe and that is the civilisation which we must hold on to. We therefore give our warm support to Commissioner Patten' s policy."
"Mr President, it is high time we adopted a universal moratorium on the death penalty, this 'veritable administrative murder' , as Albert Camus called it."
"This is what I was saying in this House back in October of last year, when mobilisation was urgently called for to prevent the black American journalist, Mumia Abu Jamal, being executed."
"What is the position today? A total of 77 states still see the death penalty as the appropriate response to certain crimes."
"In 1999, 1813 people were executed in 31 countries and there are at least 3 857 people condemned to death in 63 countries."
"The life of Mumia, who is waiting for a possible review of his trial, is, more than ever, hanging by the thread of international solidarity."
"So what approach is the European Union going to adopt to ensure that the death penalty disappears before the end of the century?"
"During phase 2 of his life on death row, Mumia Abu Jamal sent this courageous message: 'Phase 2 is the second phase of the fight."
"We will win' ."
"Indeed, encouraging signs bear witness to the rising abolitionist trend at a global level."
"Like the European Parliament, the United Nations is now participating in the inevitable debate that is taking place across all levels of society."
"In the United States, opinion is still very much in favour of capital punishment, but its hold has been shaken."
"A study by the University of Columbia brought to light an almost 60% rate of errors committed in twenty years in the executions that were carried out."
"Innocent people are being killed and racism is evident in the application of the death penalty."
"The residence of the governor of Texas and the Republican candidate for the White House is regularly the target of demonstrations by opponents of the death penalty."
"The European Union must put its full weight behind achieving this moratorium and imposing it as an inviolable principle on all nations still practising this form of state-sanctioned murder which, as Victor Hugo declared, 'traumatises the human conscience' ."
"Nineteen years after the abolition of the death penalty in France, initiatives are currently being taken in favour of a national day for the institution of a universal moratorium on capital executions."
"And I am in favour of this proposal being advanced at a European level."
"On 10 December, hundreds of thousands of petitions will be handed in to the United Nations."
"The Presidency of the European Union could also join this campaign, thereby giving inspiration and crucial backing to those who are fighting for abolition."
"The mobilisation of Europe is critical."
"Mr President, I will sum this up very briefly and I hope Parliament will not misunderstand what I want to say at the outset."
"We do not want to get into competitive humanitarianism, but I feel as passionately about this subject as any Member in Parliament and I have spoken in debates about this subject as often as anyone in Parliament, indeed I suspect I have probably spoken in more debates than some people in Parliament."
"I have spoken in debates at university when I was a student."
"I have spoken in debates at universities subsequently in my political career."
"I have spoken on radio and television programmes."
"I have been booed for what I have said at public meetings on capital punishment."
"I have spoken in Parliament about capital punishment."
"I have spoken in Parliament during highly charged debates on terrorism, on terrorist acts and capital punishment, against the use of capital punishment."
"This is in my experience a completely unique debate."
"I have never taken part in a debate on capital punishment where everyone was on the same side and that is a point worth reflecting on."
"The honourable lady in an extremely good and moving speech referred to the Bible and referred to Cain and Abel."
"The Bible has been more misused in these debates - and I am not suggesting the honourable lady was misusing it - than most other texts except perhaps for Confucius."
"Usually we hear the Bible quoted in another way."
"We hear that verse about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
"That is usually the text which is quoted so it was admirable to hear the honourable lady going back even further to Genesis."
"And you cannot get much earlier than that."
"I just ask Parliament to reflect on the fact that this debate included speeches all of which were on the same side - a side with which I passionately agree."
"That suggests to me that we need not only to think about public information campaigns in other countries, but occasionally to think about the need for continuing public information campaigns in the European Union as well because I am not sure that everybody outside these extraordinary halls, outside this Parliament, thinks exactly as we do."
"And we must remember that it is one of the tasks of political leadership to carry public opinion with you and not just to assume that everybody agrees with us."
"I thought Mr Rutelli's idea about a European day in our calendar when we make the case again and again against capital punishment was a sensible and effective idea which falls into the area that I have been touching on."
"When I find myself disagreeing with the honourable lady, my initial reaction is that I must be wrong."
"The disagreement we have about the UN General Assembly is solely a disagreement about tactics."
"There is no question that we want to see as a medium-term objective, a successful resolution and the UN General Assembly against capital punishment."
"There is no question about that at all."
"It was our view last year that we could not succeed as we would have liked."
"That there was the real danger of a ending up with a resolution being accepted which would have made the point with which I thoroughly disagree, and I think the honourable lady thoroughly disagrees, that the human rights record in one country is no business of other countries."
"We could have seen the misuse of treaty language to make that point."
"We want to have a good clean text denouncing capital punishment and asserting the universal validity of human rights including the sanctity of life."
"We want to continue to build on what has been achieved in the Commission on human rights in order to build up the majority that we would like to see in the United Nations itself."
"There were several references to countries where capital punishment is carried out in prodigious, horrific quantities."
"There were references to China and we know well the record there."
"It is an issue that we raise again and again in our human rights dialogue."
"I cannot say hand on heart, or even hand off heart, that it is getting us very far, but we continue to raise the issue."
"It is also an issue that we raise with the United States."
"We made a general démarche in the United States in February this year, in addition to the démarches we made to individual state authorities: for example, in relation to individual cases of the death penalty."
"We called upon the United States to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, with a view to completely eliminating capital punishment."
"We urged the United States to withdraw its reservation to the article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning the prohibition on imposing the death penalty on minors."
"We also called upon the United States to respect the strict conditions under which the death penalty may be used, which is set out in several international instruments."
"One or two honourable Members referred to the presidential debates."
"They referred to the fact that both the Republican and Democrat candidates, whatever they disagreed about - the size of government, the rate of taxes, moral standards in public life - the one thing they agreed on was capital punishment."
"They may agree about capital punishment."
"They may say capital punishment is effective and morally justified because they believe that."
"Most American politicians, public officials, seem to take that view and it is sometimes the case that public officials, elected officials, take particular points of view because they think they are popular."
"It may be that, going back to the point about public information, we also have to address that issue in even perhaps the best informed society in the world."
"The number of executions, the number of people in prison, the number of executions in the United States is extraordinarily high for a country whose democracy was celebrated in such appropriately eloquent terms by Alexis de Tocqueville a century ago."
"I am not sure what he would have thought about the presidential debates."
"I am not sure what he would have thought about the amount of capital punishment in the United States."
"This has been a useful, if admirably atypical, debate."
"I hope we have it again."
"But I hope that we also go out and debate this issue in company which is not so uniform in its judgments and wisdom."
"I hope we use our intellectual as well as financial resources to put the case again and again for the sanctity of human life, against the intolerable practice of capital punishment."
"We must all look forward to the day when capital punishment is regarded as a medieval barbarity, as it should be."
"I have received two motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken on Thursday."
"Mission by Commissioner Patten to Serbia"
"The next item is the Commission communication on the mission by Commissioner Patten to Serbia."
"As one or two honourable Members may know, I had been due to attend, alongside Javier Solana and Bodo Hombach of the Stability Pact, the special summit of south-east European leaders in Skopje today, which has been organised by President Trajkovski to welcome Yugoslavia back into the family of south-east European nations."
"But I told President Trajkovski that much as I would have liked to have attended, I needed to be here in this Parliament today, demonstrating democratic accountability in action."
"I have had several debates and it has been a pleasure to take part in them."
"But I am pleased to be able to report back to the House on my visit to Yugoslavia yesterday and on Monday."
"Like many honourable Members, I had long hoped for the chance to report on such a visit and on our efforts to build ties with a democratic Belgrade."
"Many of us have been surprised and inspired by the triumphant return of democracy to Serbia in recent weeks."
"I guess we should not have been surprised that democracy always wins in the end."
"The European Union made abundantly clear before the elections which took place just a month ago today that democratic change in Yugoslavia would mean a radical shift in the European Union's policy towards that country."
"What a difference a month can make."
"In the summer I reported to this House about a Serbia that was an outcast among European nations, about the repression of the brave, independent media, about our support for the opposition."
"Today, although it is early days, the opposition are in government and the independent media suddenly find that they are no longer embattled and alone but in the vanguard of a new effort to create a truly open and pluralistic media for the whole country."
"From the moment the people of Serbia made their democratic will clear and from the moment they insisted it should be respected, the European Union has been as good as its word."
"Barely four days after the democratic transition on 5 October, European Union foreign ministers announced the lifting of sanctions and the immediate repeal of the oil embargo and the flight ban."
"They announced the extension of the European Reconstruction Agency to Serbia and Montenegro."
"They underlined our willingness to press ahead with clearing the Danube and to provide the resources to do so."
"They asked the Commission to draw up proposals to extend our recently announced trade preferences for the Balkans to the whole of Yugoslavia."
"They expressed a wish for Member States to re-establish or normalise diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia at the earliest opportunity."
"They underlined the willingness of the European Union to contribute to the institutional and economic rebuilding of the FRY and they extended an invitation to President Kostunica to attend the informal European Council in Biarritz and to participate in the regional summit that the Presidency is organising and which is to be hosted by the Croatian Government in Zagreb on 24 November."
"The day after the foreign ministers' meeting, Foreign Minister Védrine representing the presidency, flew to Belgrade to inform President Kostunica in person of the measures decided by the European Union to honour the promises it had made to the people of Serbia during the election campaign."
"The same day, just five days after 5 October, a team of Commission officials arrived in Belgrade to discuss with President Kostunica's advisers an urgent, short-term assistance package."
"Later that week, the European Commission proposed to the European Council at Biarritz that the budgetary authority, including this Parliament, should approve an emergency package of assistance to Serbia worth EUR 200 million, 180 million of it mobilised from the emergency reserve."
"In the last few days, a team from our Reconstruction Agency has been in Belgrade, working out in close partnership with President Kostunica's team, and in particular with Professor Labus and the G17 group of economists, as well as with other donors, precisely what assistance we can deliver and how we can ensure it arrives on the ground in Serbia as rapidly as possible in the next few weeks, given the onset of winter and given the upcoming Serbian Republic elections on 23 December."
"Following these initial missions I went myself to Belgrade on Monday and yesterday afternoon I visited Podgorica."
"In Belgrade I met President Kostunica and held a separate meeting with him and some 80 mayors from democratic municipalities."
"I visited the headquarters of the students' resistance movement, and met the brave independent journalist, Marislav Filipovic, jailed by Milosevic for telling the truth and recently freed under President Kostunica."
"I met with Professor Labus and his colleagues of the G17 group of economists and with colleagues from the World Bank to discuss both short-term help and the longer but vital task of long-term reconstruction, especially institution building and building the rule of law."
"I met the Mayor of Belgrade and visited with him a Belgrade school being renovated under the European Commission's Schools for Democracy programme."
"I visited the Independent Media Centre, a kind of haven for independent journalists which the European Commission has helped to support; and gave an interview."
"I also visited the studio of the independent television and radio station, B92, which was harassed by Milosevic and supported amongst others by the European Commission and whose journalists, like other independent journalists, will deserve prominent and flattering mention when the history of the last few weeks in Serbia comes to be written."
"They were infinitely braver than I have ever had to be."
"I also had important meetings with representatives of the democratic opposition of Serbia and with NGOs and representatives of civil society, including the impressive head of the Civic Democratic Alliance, Goran Svilanovic."
"I briefed European Union heads of mission before my departure to Montenegro where I had meetings yesterday evening with President Djukanovic and Prime Minister Vujanovic."
"Let me just say a word about my meeting with President Kostunica and the emergency assistance package that we are finalising for Serbia."
"I set out for President Kostunica our determination to provide assistance to Serbia as rapidly as possible."
"I was impressed by his commitment to democracy and made very much aware of the huge challenge he faces in consolidating democracy in Serbia, especially in the run-up to the Serbian elections."
"I made clear to him our willingness to be as helpful as possible."
"I applauded the approach he had taken at Biarritz and during his recent visit to Sarajevo, in particular his willingness to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina without delay."
"Others will have seen the comments he made during a recent CBS interview."
"It seems to me that President Kostunica has made an impressive start in formidably difficult circumstances that few of us predicted a few months ago."
"He deserves a certain amount of political elbow-room, as he tackles those problems and consolidates his position, and all the practical support we can muster."
"That is why we have moved fast to put together a large-scale emergency assistance programme for Serbia."
"Our priorities which have been drawn up, following close consultation with democratic leaders in Belgrade, are to provide help, above all, with energy supplies as well as with medicines and possibly with food."
"As part of the same package we will extend country-wide our highly successful Schools for Democracy programme which for some months now has been providing basic improvements to schools in municipalities which were run by the opposition."
"Now we will do that Serbia-wide."
"We are going to launch a new programme called Towns for Democracy to provide basic municipal improvements and services and we are going to reinforce our support for the media and civil society in this critical phase."
"It is clear that Serbia faces a formidably difficult winter, especially on the energy front."
"We are going to do everything we can to alleviate the problems but it will still be tough because Milosevic has left Serbia's new leaders with a spectacular shambles."
"On energy we are looking urgently to extend our Energy for Democracy programme across Serbia."
"In particular we are envisaging shipping in diesel and heating fuel, both to keep the power plants running and to fuel district heating plants."
"We will operate mainly through the municipalities, as we did last year under our pioneering Energy for Democracy initiative."
"I had an extremely useful meeting with President Kostunica and many of the mayors to discuss priorities."
"I hope I have made it clear what a formidable task we face."
"We will have to work with others and, despite our efforts, Serbia faces a difficult period."
"But we are working flat out to get our help on the ground as rapidly as possible, which means from the second half of November."
"The people of Serbia know that, from now on, they do not have to face the future alone but with the staunch support of the European Union and the entire family of European democracies at their side."
"It was clear from my meetings with the mayors and others that expectations of the European Union are very high."
"We must not disappoint them."
"I hope there will be rapid agreement in the Commission and in the management committee on the programmes we have in mind so that deliveries can indeed start in the second half of November."
"The people of Serbia will not understand if bureaucracy stands in their way and nor will I. We simply must get moving very fast indeed."
"Let me make a further very important point: none of the assistance that I have described is at the expense of our efforts elsewhere in the region."
"I and, I believe, ministers in the General Affairs Council are acutely aware of the European Union's obligations to Croatia, to Bosnia-Herzegovina, to Albania, to FYROM and to the people of Kosovo and to Montenegro."
"We are not going to relax our efforts elsewhere in the region."
"If anything, we are going to redouble them."
"That was one reason why I visited Podgorica yesterday, my third visit since March and the first time I was able to fly in with a visa from Belgrade."
"I discussed our considerable assistance programme with President Djukanovic."
"We have given EUR 55 million to Montenegro this year in recognition of the pressure that Montenegro was under from the Milosevic regime and the brave democratic path that it has taken in the last three years."
"I informed the president and prime minister of our plans to extend the activities of the European Reconstruction Agency to Montenegro and I informed them, in the light of the welcome democratic change in Belgrade about our proposals to extend the full benefits of our recently implemented asymmetric trade measures for the region to Montenegro as well as to Serbia."
"This will be a big boost to Montenegro's economy."
"I listened to the views of the prime minister and the president on recent developments and on relations between Montenegro and Serbia."
"I made clear to them and to the press that I had been impressed by President Kostunica's commitment to democracy and the formidable challenge he faced in consolidating it."
"The European Union was determined to do all it could to help, which was why we were putting together a substantial emergency package for this winter."
"Speaking as a friend of Montenegro, I said that when elected democratic leaders held out the hand of friendship it was very important to grasp it."
"I underlined my view that with Milosevic gone, remaining problems should be resolved through a process of rational and calm dialogue displaying understanding of others' points of view, a certain generosity of spirit and a degree of patience."
"(These are attributes that have not always been widely available in the region in the last decade - I understate the point.)"
"Now a new generation of leaders was in power who want to do things differently, I concluded."
"Let me just finish today by saying that this year began with democratic change in Zagreb and this autumn we have seen much hoped-for democratic change take root in Belgrade."
"There is still much to do."
"Democracy, although I believe it to be irreversible, is still young and fragile in Serbia."
"What we have now before us is the best prospect for a generation of building lasting peace and prosperity across the whole of south-east Europe - the chance truly to draw a line under the traumas of the recent past and to look to the future, a future in Europe."
"The European Union is ready for that task and stands ready to do all in its power to deliver on the hopes of so many whose lives have been blighted by the horrors the Milosevic regime inflicted inside and outside the borders of Serbia."
"It is an enormous challenge, but this is the challenge for which all of us have been working for so long."
"Now we have a duty to rise to it."
"Mr President, let me start by thanking the Commissioner for his swift visit to Belgrade and for reporting back to us so promptly."
"Normally speaking, I believe that that is one of the tasks of the Commissioners and I would not comment on it under normal circumstances. But I would like to make an exception and say that I appreciate the fact that he is here today."
"Last time we talked about Serbia, I urged MEPs to exercise some patience with Mr Kostunica because I had the impression that there had been progress almost every day, and I believe we can see evidence of this progress, up to and including yesterday when Mr Kostunica declared himself willing to assume responsibility, which I believe is crucial, for the Serbian crimes in Kosovo."
"I specifically have three questions for the Commissioner."
"Did he and Mr Kostunica discuss the position of the Kosovar refugees?"
"As you know, there are still approximately two thousand people in Serbian prisons without any charge."
"Rumour has it that this situation will soon change."
"I was interested to hear if he had any further information on this."
"My second question relates to Kosovo."
"I share his view on what he said here about Montenegro, but the biggest problem is, of course, what to do with Kosovo."
"My final question is about the money."
"I welcome the emergency aid."
"Is the Commissioner convinced that the maximum sum of 250 million, which is earmarked for next year, will be enough to provide Serbia with structural aid?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for your comments, and support everything you have said."
"I would have said it in a similar way, except that I express myself differently."
"I had the same experience when I was in Serbia a fortnight ago with Mr Swoboda."
"Although we were not there before Mr Hombach, we did go there, because we have the funds to help people there."
"Mr Hombach only went there to make his presence felt and to establish what it might be possible to do."
"We know what can be done and we are in a position to make the funding available tomorrow, which I am very pleased about."
"I am also sure that under your auspices, Commissioner, emergency aid really will be provided swiftly."
"This is an opportunity for the Commission to demonstrate that it does not deserve its reputation."
"I have two questions."
"First, Mr Modrow alleged yesterday evening that everything we are doing there amounts to reparation for the NATO bombing."
"I told him that was nonsense."
"90% of the damage that we are making good there is the result of socialist and communist mismanagement."
"I would be grateful if you would confirm this point."
"Secondly, when we were down there two weeks ago, we were told that the sanctions were being lifted, but they have not been lifted."
"Where do things stand on trade sanctions?"
"Have you resolved that issue?"
"Companies need to be able to do business now."
"You can put Milosevic's entourage on a blacklist, but you should open things up for everyone else!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the dramatic apology of the Yugoslavian President, Mr Kostunica, also referred to by my fellow Member, his admission of guilt and the guilt of the Serbian people - something which many nations have never done - is a gesture which does him credit and which will make an important contribution to improving the climate in the region."
"Politically, Mr Kostunica is associating himself with the decisions of the international community which considers that Kosovo is still part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, at the same time, is lowering the hopes of the Albanians of Kosovo of achieving a state of independence."
"What kind of tension - a tension which naturally seems paradoxical to us, even with the return of some of the Serbian refugees - could be generated by this lack of self-determination so longed for by the Albanians?"
"In your opinion, Commissioner, on the basis of your conversations with him, to what extent is the moderate Mr Rugova likely to be willing to agree to enter into dialogue with his democratic counterpart in Belgrade?"
"I am sure that the honourable Member was right to say that we must show some patience about developments in Belgrade, in Yugoslavia, over the coming weeks as democracy is consolidated."
"It does not mean that we abandon or surrender our principles or our values."
"We cannot do that."
"But we need to ensure that Mr Kostunica has time to develop and strengthen the democratic base of his government."
"Everyone wants to see him succeed in the formidable task he has taken on, and so far it has to be said that everything he has done and everything he has said has pointed in the same democratic direction."
"He has set up an amnesty commission to deal with the issue of prisoners, though some have already been released, one or two of whose cases have been brought to all our attention here, but as I said to the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Vienna a week ago, the issue of the Albanian prisoners is going to be one which he will have to look at as a matter of some urgency."
"On Kosovo, as two honourable Members have mentioned, my position begins and ends with Security Council Resolution 1244."
"I note the imaginative leaps of others."
"I am not sure they are always very judicious or wise, but as far as I am concerned Resolution 1244 is where the policy rests."
"The EUR 200 million emergency package will partly be in structural assistance but I set out in my remarks the sort of direction in which we would be seeking to spend it and given that the bulk of it comes from the ""Emergencies in third countries"" line in the overall budget, we are not having to take money from other countries in the region, or from other regions, in order to provide this assistance."
"The honourable lady who knows so much about south-east Europe and who has been pressing for more sensible and effective policies in south-east Europe for months, and indeed for years, referred to the importance of us ensuring that we can deliver relief quickly and realistically."
"I am quite struck by some of the rather unrealistic promises that people make in Serbia."
"I would love to be able to clear the Danube in a couple of weeks time but it is not possible."
"One or two people have suggested that perhaps things could be done a little more quickly and perhaps we should take that as encouragement to speed up and deliver as rapidly as possible."
"I should like to make one very important substantive point."
"We are talking about emergency assistance and while that emergency assistance is being delivered we will, with the World Bank, be conducting an assessment mission of longer term needs."
"While that is going on we will be, I hope, assisting Yugoslavia in dealing with the problems about its membership of the UN, its membership of the World Bank and its problems with the IFIs to which it owes considerable arrears."
"I hope we will be able to deal with those problems and have completed the needs assessment by the middle of next year."
"It would be absolutely crazy to have a donors' pledging conference before we have those things in place."
"There is no point in having a donors' pledging conference before we can get a lot of money pledged."
"To get into a situation where we were not able to call on loan capital but were depending entirely on grants, for example, would means that any donors' pledging conference would go off at half cock."
"So I hope that we can keep that sensible speed of progress in mind."
"As for what the relief will go for, I dare say some reconstruction will be necessary after the Nato air strikes."
"But as people said at the time, we see in Belgrade that however tragic the loss of life, these were very surgically carried out on the whole."
"But the main repair work that has to be done is the repair work that is necessary because of years of communism and because of years of xenophobic nationalism."
"That is where most of the reconstruction is required: to bring the economy into the 21st century and to make it competitive in a Europe of open borders and open markets."
"That is going to be a considerable task but since there are so many capable and able Serbs helping in the economies of Australia, Canada, Germany and other places around the world, all of us can look forward to the day when Serbs are able to do a great deal more to make their own economy in Serbia prosperous and successful."
"We want to help them with that."
"On sanctions, we have lifted - as the House will know - the sanctions on oil and air flights."
"We are discussing with Yugoslav officials exactly what to do about the financial sanctions."
"Speaking for myself, although it will be a decision that the General Affairs Council will have to make very speedily, I am always reluctant to be more catholic than the Pope or - to use a more appropriate expression - more orthodox than the Patriarch: if we are told by the authorities in Belgrade that they want to get rid of the financial sanctions it would be slightly surprising if we were to say ""steady on, we think we can design some smart sanctions which will meet needs which you say you are quite content for us to forget about""."
"I will be reporting in that sense, in due course, to the General Affairs Council."
"This time last year I visited Belgrade, a rather bleak city, veering from despair to hope on a daily basis."
"I went to see the NGOs working in humanitarian and free media fields, financed by the European Union, and the picture was not a particularly happy one."
"The aspiration was there but the actuality was not."
"The promise was there but the performance was not, because the money was not coming through and there was an administrative bungle."
"I want to ask the Commissioner if he will confirm that he will thank the staff of the Commission both in Brussels, and in particular in the Belgrade office under Michael Graham, the head of the delegation, who throughout this time have gone through enormous change and have actually wrought a major difference in the process of moving towards democracy."
"Despite the difficulties, they have achieved something rather remarkable."
"I would like the Commissioner to confirm that he will thank not only those people but also the NGOs working in the field."
"More particularly I hope he will accept the thanks of this House, because he has demonstrated that democratic activism not only works in Hong Kong but also in Serbia."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his efforts and I hope I can without being pretentious assure him that the relatively low attendance in this House does not, I am sure, reflect the level of interest in this subject."
"I think, just as an aside, there is something weird about the procedures of this House that we spend an hour and a half voting at lunchtime but for such an important topic we do not enable people to be here in the numbers that would reflect the interest."
"I wanted to ask him about regional cooperation."
"Is he, and we as the European Union, making progress in convincing the players in the region that when we encourage them to have regional cooperation, this is not a diversion from a move towards Europe and to eventual membership of the European Union, assuming all the criteria will be met with no deadlines and timescales, but a step towards eventual EU membership?"
"Mr President, what I have to say relates to Kosovo because it was the Commission communication on Kosovo that you were supposed to talk about today, which somehow got transformed into a communication on Serbia."
"I understand this, given that there is a new leader, President Kostunica, and that it is necessary to be involved in the process with him so that things can go ahead properly."
"Last week, I was in Pristina."
"I met a lot of people and, in particular, I met Bernard Kouchner for a working session."
"I also saw the enormous problems that exist there."
"You spoke about the Danube, but it is simply not enough to carry out studies."
"Urgent action must be taken because the Danube is being polluted by stockpiles of sulphuric acid and from sources in Mitrovica."
"There needs to be a risk control plan not only for this region, but also for the town of Pristina and for other towns in Kosovo."
"Whole populations live in destitution."
"Attacks with enriched uranium warheads have polluted the town of Pristina and the other areas that were hit."
"The destruction of the sports stadium released asbestos into the air, which spread throughout the town."
"There is a very serious health problem."
"I would therefore like to draw your attention to this and to tell you that there is a social problem."
"This aid must go on social concerns, the widows and orphans and so on."
"Urgent measures need to be taken. I must insist on this."
"I am grateful to my honourable friend for what he said about Michael Graham and his staff in Belgrade."
"They have done an excellent job."
"I was delighted to be able to thank some of them, though on my next visit I hope to be able to thank all of them, and I will certainly refer to the honourable gentleman's handsome tribute."
"As far as the NGOs are concerned, they have done magnificently."
"The organisations in the media field have done magnificently."
"We were superbly well-served by the Swedish-Helsinki Committee, for example, but there has been excellent cooperation and despite all the difficulties put in our way by Milosevic's regime, we were able to get a considerable amount of help through to the democrats and the democratic forces in Serbia."
"That I hope played a small part in bringing about change."
"The honourable lady was entirely right to say that it is sometimes suspected that encouraging regional cooperation is a sort of Brussels stalling on the route towards Europe."
"We have to explain to people that what we are trying to see happen in south-east Europe is what we know has worked for us."
"The European Union is the best example in the world of countries dealing with ancient animosities, countries becoming both more politically stable and more prosperous by knocking down frontiers, by knocking down boundaries and in certain areas pooling their sovereignty and doing things together that they do better together."
"That is what we are trying to encourage the countries of south-east Europe to do."
"For example, we are saying to them, we will give you very generous trade access to our markets but you have to give generous trade access to your neighbours' markets as well."
"That is at the heart of the stabilisation and association process which is gradually and successfully moving forward."
"On the Danube and environmental and health problems, I agree with what the honourable gentleman has said."
"President Kostunica said at the meeting with mayors, that in the new democratic era Yugoslavia was going to have to do quite a bit about gender mainstreaming because they were only I think three women in the room at that meeting."
"But one of the women mayors present at the meeting raised specifically the question of the environmental and health hazards caused over last year and we will need to look at problems like that because they pose a serious health hazard to many people in south-east Europe."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Climate change - Floods"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A5-0270/2000) by Mr Moreira Da Silva, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a communication from the Commission on EU policy and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: towards a European climate change programme (ECCP) [COM(2000) 88 - C5-0192/2000 - 2000/2103(COS)];"
"the report (A5-0271/2000) by Mr Moreira Da Silva, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the European Commission Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within the European Union [COM(2000) 87 - C5-0193/2000 - 2000/2104(COS)];"
"the oral question (B5-0547/2000) by Mrs Jackson to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission strategy for the sixth Hague conference on climate change (COP6);"
"the statement by the Commission on the floods in northern Italy and Spain."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight years on from Rio de Janeiro and three years on from Kyoto it is no exaggeration to say that the dossier on climate change has now reached its most critical moment, its real moment of truth, for two basic reasons: first, because at an institutional level COP-6, which will take place in The Hague this November, is to draw up the Kyoto Protocol in its final form and initiate the Protocol ratification stage so that it can come into force by the 'Rio Plus Ten' Conference, i.e. by 2002."
"Secondly it is a critical moment because, at a domestic level, we are moving further away instead of getting closer to the reduction targets agreed at Kyoto, because of the failure by Member States to implement policies and measures on, for instance, energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy sources and taxation on energy and greenhouse gases."
"In this extraordinarily challenging context, we applaud the Commission' s initiative in bringing out together the Green Paper on emissions trading and the communication 'Towards a European climate change programme' ."
"Even though the substance of the proposals deserves a few comments and a few criticisms, as you will see, the truth is that this initiative has sent out two incontrovertible political signals."
"To the outside world it has regenerated the European Union' s capacity for leadership."
"Within the Union it has taught us a lesson about meeting commitments."
"Let us begin by examining the Green Paper on 'emissions trading' ."
"This Green Paper has opened the debate on the architecture of a future emissions trading system within the European Union."
"To start the system off, the Commission has defined a hard core of premises: the system should be based on a 'learning by doing' approach, it should start in 2005, and during an initial stage it should be restricted to carbon dioxide and major point sources."
"In my view, and this is reflected in the report, the establishment of a system of this kind within the European Union from 2005 has undeniable benefits."
"Let me highlight three."
"First, this system will allow industries, companies and Member States to gain practical experience and prepare themselves economically for the 2008 launch of the emissions trading system at an international level."
"Secondly, this system will help provide an easier remedy to the situation that most Member States are in today of not meeting their targets."
"Thirdly, the system will enable us to make huge reductions, in the order of billions of euros per year, in the costs of implementing the Community' s Kyoto commitments."
"Despite the merits of this initiative and the technical quality of the Green Paper, on which we congratulate the Commission, the coverage of certain points is rather limited."
"Thus the task of this report has been to extend the debate begun by the Green Paper in both breadth and depth."
"That is our task."
"Let me highlight six points from my considerations."
"One: the Green Paper should have set quantified targets for greenhouse gas reduction to be attained by the emissions trading system; in other words, the Green Paper should have said what percentage of greenhouse gas reduction would be allocated to emissions trading."
"Two: I believe the Green Paper should not have avoided carrying out an analysis into the possibility that the emissions trading system might give nuclear energy a competitive advantage."
"Three: I believe it is essential that the system should in future embrace certain sectors that the Green Paper has ruled out for now, especially transport, which is the sector in which emissions are growing the fastest."
"Four: in the debate on the scope of the system, the Commission should not have set direct emissions trading between companies as the only possible option."
"There are other options, and I hope the Commission will soon consider all the alternatives."
"Five: I believe it is crucial to involve the countries applying for membership of the European Union in the emissions trading system as soon as possible."
"To this end I invite the Commission to present a plan in a forthcoming communication specifying how those countries can be brought into the emissions trading system."
"Lastly, point six: I believe that, with regard to the method of allocating emissions licences, auctions could more easily ensure the desired environmental result, non-distortion of competition and the simplicity of the system than 'grandfathering' could."
"But this is not the appropriate moment to exclude any method, and so I invite the Commission to continue its deliberations and to include a third option, too: benchmarking."
"Let us now examine the communication on the European climate change programme."
"In view of the commitment and quality of the Green Paper on emissions trading, the communication on policies and measures, the communication 'Towards a European climate change programme' is a disappointment."
"It is a disappointment because it results in the role of policies and measures, in other words, the role of domestic and Community political action, being sidelined in favour of market mechanisms."
"It is also a disappointment because this communication results in an unbalanced treatment of the various economic sectors; in particular it was hoped that those sectors that were not included in the emissions trading system might see the approval of an ambitious approach with well-defined commitments in the other communication, the one on policies and measures."
"I therefore call on the Commission to conclude the European climate change programme, the ICCP, with some urgency and to submit, six months after COP-6, a set of specific proposals on policies and measures defining quantitative commitments on the reduction of greenhouse gases for each economic sector and for each policy and measure."
"Let me very briefly say a few words about the forthcoming United Nations conference, COP-6, which will take place in The Hague this November."
"The difficulty with COP-6 is not just a result of the complexity of the Kyoto leftovers but also of the political situation in the United States."
"Note that, regardless of the result of the American elections, it will be Bill Clinton and Al Gore who will be negotiating the Kyoto Protocol in The Hague."
"So we face some extremely worrying scenarios."
"If Bush wins, all the agreements we make in The Hague with the Clinton administration may be totally ignored by the new administration."
"If Al Gore wins, there is nothing to prevent it continuing to be very difficult to find the two-thirds majority in the Senate needed to ratify the Protocol."
"I therefore think that the European Union should not give up its negotiating agenda."
"The European Union has a good negotiating agenda and should not give it up."
"If we give it up in the hope of reaching an agreement with the United States, we risk ending up with a lose-lose result: we will have weakened the text of the Protocol and, what is more, it may even fail to be ratified by the United States."
"That is why we have to give signs of opening up towards Russia, Canada, Japan, Norway and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"I should like to close, Mr President, by thanking all the Members, particularly the draftsmen of opinions and shadow draftsmen, for having made it possible to reach a broad consensus on the strategy for halting climate change."
". (NL) Mr President, the emission of greenhouse gases is still on the increase, although the European Union has committed itself to an eight percent reduction in the emission of these gases in the period 2008-2012."
"We need to see the Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading against this backdrop."
"The Green Paper constitutes the first step towards establishing an instrument which is in conformity with the market, which prescribes a ceiling for emission levels and which, in time, will offer very efficient and effective opportunities to reduce these emission levels."
"In this way, there is a chance that the European Union will still manage to fulfil its obligations with regard to the Kyoto Protocol."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs endorses the thrust of the Green Paper."
"It does, however, set great store by a solid basis for the trading system, which must be simple and transparent to the participants and underpinned by sound market institutions."
"Otherwise, the system will expire through a lack of faith on the part of the market operators."
"In addition, the system must be competitively neutral on behalf of the companies involved."
"In this respect, we have serious objections to a few paragraphs in the present motion for a resolution, for these aim to distort competition through an inconsistent adoption of the sector-by-sector approach."
"The result of the rapporteur' s approach is that companies from the same sector in the various Member States may be treated unequally."
"After all, a lorry driver will not compete with a chemical company but rather with lorry drivers from other Member States."
"I hope that this misunderstanding can be put right with a number of amendments."
"I am interested to see if Commissioner Wallström will also be in favour of them."
"Ultimately, we want a cleaner environment."
"This can be achieved by the introduction of tradable emission rights without directly interfering in the economic structures."
"In the final analysis, we should fulfil our collective responsibility to manage God' s creation in a responsible manner and without any hesitation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for having reliably compiled all our views producing an excellent piece of work."
"The subject of emissions trading entered the debate on climate as part of the so-called flexible mechanisms."
"The European Union did not actually want these to be included in the selection, but they are now part of an international agreement, and regulations are being drafted in The Hague for these flexible mechanisms, of which the trade-off in emissions is an important one."
"As the EU has been a leading force in these international discussions until now, we must all certainly hope that this position of leadership will be kept up, and we place our trust in the Commission in this."
"For this reason, the European Union has decided to propose that we should adopt a system of trade-offs in greenhouse gas emissions within the Union as from 2005, and this is therefore different from what the Kyoto Protocol itself makes possible, which is that the international emissions trading is to start as from 2008."
"But within the European Union this system can be tried out and it can be developed."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market therefore also welcomes the Commission' s Green Paper and the fact that a framework directive is to be drafted based upon it."
"This emissions trading operation, to be carried out at EU level, is absolutely justified, as, otherwise, competition will be distorted."
"I wish, on behalf of the committee, to focus attention on the fact that a lot can certainly be done through a system of trading, but not everything."
"It is very important that emission trading are one of various ways to solve the problem, the most important of which are financial control mechanisms."
"It is also very important that the trade in emissions is monitored effectively, and I believe that we will also need environmental inspectors, which is the subject of talks we are now conducting with the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy also sees emissions trading as a reasonable solution."
"However, we also believe that it should only apply to 50% of the total reduction in emissions."
"The key point about emissions trading is that in future not only electricity and gas will have a price, but also CO2."
"That sounds very simple, but it means a total revolution in the energy business, in the energy sector."
"We need to be aware of that."
"It will have enormous consequences and I am convinced that it can also help to reduce emissions."
"What is the likely scenario for the next few years?"
"I hope that following successful completion of the negotiations in The Hague, the European Union will ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"That means that we will be legally committing ourselves."
"The next thing required is for the Commission to bring forward a directive sharing the burden among the 15 Member States."
"So we need quotas."
"But these quotas must be linked with sanctions, otherwise they will be meaningless."
"In other words we will then have a common energy policy via environment policy, which would be a very circuitous route."
"We could then start emissions trading within the European Union in 2005."
"Once more, I hope that we will be able to adhere to this scenario, more or less, and that we will not let ourselves be put off by the fact that others, perhaps even the United States, will not have signed it for the time being."
"We should support the Commission here and present a united front as far as possible."
"Mr President, it is high time the European Commission produced a concrete programme to curb the greenhouse effect."
"Climate change is evident all over the world and we in Europe are not so badly off as those in other regions - I have in mind the West Coast of America and also Bangladesh."
"But the latest disasters in Italy, especially in the Valle d'Aosta, and in Switzerland, have demonstrated that there can even be terrible disasters here now, disasters for which the local population has virtually no responsibility."
"We now need to implement the Kyoto objectives and the next climate change summit in The Hague must go further than our efforts so far."
"Since it is also clear that CO2 bears most responsibility for climate change and traffic is increasing further, what we need above all are concrete proposals for limiting urban traffic, and for appropriate taxation of transit traffic or for suitable road pricing arrangements."
"We now need measures that go beyond emissions trading, so as to come to grips with all of this."
"I do not want to question or attack mobility, it is something we need, but we must change traffic patterns, and emissions trading must not mean that we stop discussing other concrete measures."
"We in Europe are in the vanguard of environmental policy and if we want to maintain our credibility then we must go further than is proposed in the White Paper today."
"Mr President, I want to put on record the European Parliament's concern and apprehension on the subject of the Hague Conference."
"Firstly, as was mentioned earlier, there is the question of the participation of MEPs in the conference at all."
"Whatever European Union policies flow from this conference at The Hague will have to come to this Parliament for debate, amendment and agreement, that is the European policies."
"National policies, whatever they are, will have to go through national parliaments, but we will have a hand in agreeing whatever comes forward as a European Union policy as a consequence of The Hague."
"So far our promised participation in the EU delegation has been limited to three parliamentarians."
"At the same time the exact nature of parliamentary participation is very unclear."
"We would like to be able to send a bigger delegation."
"We realise that COREPER is going to wrestle with this next week but we look forward to hearing any news from the Commissioner on this."
"We would also like our representatives to be briefed before the conference."
"I hope we can have a full briefing from the Commissioner, we will hear about that in a moment, and to receive all necessary briefing during it."
"But that is not all: we need our representatives to be present at all the EU delegation meetings, including those where tactics and policy are discussed."
"We do not believe that in asking for this we are asking for too much."
"Given our involvement in the making of European Union law it is absurd for the Commission and Council to keep the negotiations to themselves."
"Secondly, there is the question of how far the industrialised countries, including the United States, are really sincere about COP6 and the ratification of Kyoto."
"Do they, and in all honesty do we, really want to go forward or are we about to witness a slamming on of the brakes?"
"We already seem to have devastating evidence of the impact of climate change, yet, when members of the Committee on the Environment had a recent meeting with members of the United States Congress, fortunately via a video link, the impression they gained was that Congress will not agree to the ratification of Kyoto."
"Now, if the United States cannot agree such pro-environment measures when its economy is prospering to such a great extent, what chance will we have another time, when things may not look so good?"
"We would welcome the Commission's views on how far the Americans are likely to sabotage The Hague Conference, and what we may salvage from the wreck."
"If the United States gives strong signals that it will not, ever, ratify Kyoto without the participation of the major developing countries, then what prospect is there that we could put together a coalition of countries that will ratify, and what danger is there that we would then put the European Union at an economic disadvantage?"
"We would also like to hear from the Commission a clear timetable of its plans for climate change measures next year."
"I realise that this may mean lifting the veil on the 6th Environment Action Programme, but this would be an opportune moment to clarify the broad lines of what we may expect."
"Finally, given that we know the causes of climate change, or are fairly clear that we know the causes of climate change, future generations will hardly forgive us for being so slow to deal with it."
"Governments are afraid to tax fuel for fear of not being re-elected."
"That is human and perhaps unavoidable."
"But we could at least devote more resources to developing alternative, renewable energy sources, and to making them into real alternative options soon."
"How sad it is that last year we actually cut the European Union fund for renewables, SAVE, to which we now devote a fraction of the money spent on subsidising tobacco."
"Future generations will not forgive us for that, and future generations will be right."
"Commissioner, allow me to focus for a moment, in the context of Mr Da Silva's excellent report and the situation which she has just described, which is important and full of potential for the future, on a phenomenon which is assuming dramatic proportions: the floods which affected huge areas of Europe last week, primarily northern Italy but also France and Spain."
"We are acquiring the habit of describing our times in dramatic language: verbs such as to overflow, to flood, to burst banks, are part of a vocabulary which is becoming almost the norm."
"We feel that this is a dramatic consequence of the climate change taking place and that the social and economic system must provide some sort of response to this."
"Even the climate experts tell us that the very meteorology of our regions is changing."
"The exceptional amount of rain which has fallen over the last few days has served to offset the prevailing drought of the past year."
"We are told that the drought trend will continue into the years to come and worsen as time goes by, unavoidably interspersed with the odd deluge and resulting floods."
"And so, now that, sadly, our dead have been buried, the journalists have left the devastated areas and the river, in this case the Po - I live by the Po - is again taking its normal course, it is time, as we say in Italy, to put up our umbrellas, not to appear prophets of doom but to evaluate once again the requirements and the remedies."
"Certainly, a great deal of progress had been made in recent years in the area of alert and alarm measures, which have made it possible to keep the scale of the disasters in check, but although this is important, it cannot be considered a primary factor."
"We need a defence policy dedicated purely to following up the recommendations of the experts."
"We need to be making political and regional planning decisions that protect the earth even when the sun is shining."
"I would therefore stress a few points."
"The first concerns the approach to man's built environment, which must not be overlooked. Construction must be oriented towards ever more stringent application of planning rules, standards and controls."
"In particular, there must be greater emphasis on man's agricultural environment. In the recent flooding of the Po, farmland acted as a floodway, protecting the urban centres, and agriculture channelled off the floodwater, bearing the brunt of it itself in order to protect built-up areas."
"Therefore, we must reaffirm the role of agriculture as the protector of the environment, a role which is wont to be sidelined, overlooked and undervalued on sunny days."
"There is no provision in agricultural or environmental policy or in town and country planning for this role played by agriculture."
"Europe needs to pinpoint appropriate forms of coordination in this regard."
"Mr President, there are three important documents we have to discuss today concerning one of the greatest challenges by far that we face, that is to say climate change."
"For a northerner from an area where the temperature at this time of year rarely exceeds seven degrees and where it pours with rain, the thought of a warmer climate perhaps appears attractive at first sight."
"It is not as simple as that, however."
"The climate changes we face are hardly positive in their implications for any of us."
"Instead, the scenario is exactly as it was described just recently: full of storms, rain and floods."
"To these must be added changes to the flora and fauna."
"Life will have changed out of recognition, and it will scarcely be very pleasant either."
"The three documents on climate change which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has dealt with may be regarded as documents representing different periods of time."
"The resolution on the conference in The Hague is that which is closest to us in time."
"It presents the view of those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and hopefully also the view of the European Union, of what we think must happen in The Hague."
"It has been characterised by considerable unity, which is a good foundation to have now that the conference in The Hague is beginning."
"The resolution signals a clear need for the Kyoto Protocol to be signed and for it being the industrialised countries which must head up the efforts to halt climate change."
"It also emphasises very clearly that the flexible mechanisms must only be complementary to the national measures adopted."
"I am glad to hear that this is also Commissioner Wallström' s view."
"I think the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has given a clear message that we do not consider three representatives from the European Parliament at the conference in The Hague to be sufficient."
"I am also pleased that Mrs Wallström says that the Commission' s proposal is for eight representatives."
"The European Parliament and those within Parliament who work on environmental issues must be taken seriously at some stage and not only be used along the lines of figureheads when it is convenient."
"When regular meetings and regular updates during the conference in The Hague are talked about, it is also important to emphasise that these must be constructive."
"It is important that MEPs' viewpoints should also be taken on board so that it is not just a case of one-way communication."
"The resolution on emissions trading is a good document, but it has been further improved following the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The most important additions include the clear indication, exactly as found in the COP 6 document, that emissions trading itself must not represent more than 50 per cent of the measures to reduce emissions."
"It is also important that measurable objectives be required for each country and for each sector."
"There must also be legally binding measures obliging the Member States to comply with their quotas."
"There is also a certain amount of concern about the fact that certain sectors have been left out of the Green Paper, for example the transport sector."
"We presume that this work will be included in the next document, concerning the strategy and measures to be adopted by the EU to reduce emissions, and that the transport sector will not be forgotten when we discuss climate change."
"The message is very clear: the principle must be that all emissions, no matter what their origin, must be covered by some instrument of control, be it in the form of emission rights or of legislation, but there must be practical limits and instruments of control for each type of emission."
"Many have had doubts about the proposal for emissions trading, especially when it comes to the socio-economic consequences."
"The fear, quite simply, is of a loss of employment and a concern that companies will play different industries off against each other."
"I believe we have taken account of these doubts and of this concern in paragraph 13 of this resolution, and I hope that this will reassure at least some of those who have felt concern."
"I want to emphasise that there is an obvious mistake in the Swedish version of this paragraph."
"Only half of the amendment published in the Swedish document has been adopted."
"The third document is perhaps the most important in the long term."
"It deals with the strategy and measures to be adopted by the EU in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
"It also concerns what is really required, namely to change our own way of life if anything is to be achieved."
"This is a welcome document."
"It would have been still more welcome if it had been clearer and more practical, but we hope it will be clearer following the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that the debate on climatic change in Europe and throughout the world has given us the opportunity to recall the cyclone that struck a large part of Europe."
"Christened Josephine by the German meteorologists, this cyclone struck north-west Italy, especially my region, Valle d' Aosta, causing tremendous devastation."
"In three or four days, between 500 and 700 mm of rain fell over a total area of 10 000 km2, which is roughly equivalent to the entire rainfall for one year."
"Terror struck Valle d' Aosta and the other regions and countries affected, which this terrible ordeal has placed in a veritable state of emergency, facing a long, costly list of damages."
"So, why does the European Union exist, if not to make us change our lifestyle and, above all, to understand the cycles that modify climatological conditions, to harness the necessary European funds to respond to the demands meet the acute need for intervention in the mountainous regions of Europe."
"If we do not intervene, we unfortunately run the risk that these floods will recur."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our climate is already changing."
"Over the past one thousand years, we have seen a drop in the temperature by one-fifth of a degree."
"But over the past fifty years, it has become one and a half degrees warmer."
"This warming process is accelerating all the time."
"Many citizens like the idea of a climate one or two degrees warmer, but the warm Gulf Stream which is giving us a pleasant climate at the moment could turn at any time."
"Europe would then acquire a climate like that in Canada, where, for many weeks during winter, the temperature is between -20 to -30."
"We need radical measures to stop global warming."
"The Kyoto Protocol is too restricted."
"The increase in air traffic in the next fifteen years alone will cancel out the reductions achieved via the Kyoto Protocol."
"China is already emitting more greenhouse gases than is sustainable."
"We cannot turn a blind eye to this."
"After 2020, developing countries too are supposed to fight greenhouse gases, but on an equal footing."
"Each world citizen has the same right to emit CO2."
"American citizens should not be entitled to emit two hundred times more CO2 than people in East Africa."
"On the basis of equity, the international trade in CO2 certificates is supposed to be going ahead after 2008."
"Only on this basis will developing countries, such as China and India, get involved."
"Opting in The Hague for the American line of grandfathering will block this route."
"Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are the way forward, both in the North and in the South, and not 25 cm high bushes, as the Australian government is proposing, or other forest projects which cannot be verified."
"Subsidising nuclear energy with Clean Development Mechanism funding is not the answer either."
"That would be perverse at a time when America and Europe are doing nothing but closing down nuclear power stations."
"Fortunately, our ministers and the Commission are on the right side."
"I wish them tenacity on behalf of my group."
"The swift ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is the right way forward."
"We should not rely on the American Senate."
"After ratification, CO2 emission will have a price tag."
"At present, it is still free to the large industries and the electricity producers in Europe, which are, together, responsible for 45% of CO2 emissions."
"The Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within Europe is an excellent initiative."
"Europe must make every effort to achieve this 8% objective."
"I would call on the European Commission to come up with extra proposals to curtail emissions in the transport sector."
"Only if we achieve this 8% objective can we be credible."
"And only then are climatic breakthroughs at world level possible."
"Mr President, as we all know, climate change is perhaps the most difficult environmental problem of our time to solve."
"This is not, of course, because we do not know what changes are required, but because the necessary changes would have such massive repercussions upon the whole of our transport and energy policy and, in point of fact, upon our whole method of consuming."
"We face completely fundamental social changes if we are to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
"It is the most developed countries - the countries with the highest economic standards and the highest per capita emissions of greenhouse gases - which have the biggest responsibility for taking the lead where reductions in greenhouse gases are concerned."
"In the run-up to the conference in The Hague, it therefore appears absolutely crucial to involve the United States in an agreement which leads both to real progress and to a situation in which the Kyoto Protocol can be ratified."
"A responsible policy on the part of the most developed countries must be based upon those countries' being able to reduce their own emissions."
"If there is to be a place for emissions trading, which is something I am very doubtful about, the latter should only constitute a minor part of the policy as a whole, in which case any such trading must also be strictly controlled, with consideration given to the social dimension and to the opportunities for developing countries to make further progress in the future."
"This system may entail very large risks in the future if Russia and the developing countries are included in the emissions trading and the practice becomes global."
"However, there are other types of flexible mechanism which can be used to advantage at a global level."
"Emissions and abatements trading are no substitute for the real changes required. The same applies, of course, to nuclear power."
"Instead, we need a vigorous policy to promote lower energy use, renewable energy sources, alternative fuels and effective environmental taxes on methods of transport."
"It is mainly the responsibility of the individual Member States to implement these measures."
"Where tax is concerned, a common minimum tax is to be desired."
"If it is not possible to agree upon a tax on greenhouse gases within the EU, those countries which are prepared to take the lead ought in any case to get together and introduce such a tax."
"When it comes to Mr Moreira Da Silva' s reports, we agree with the content of most of the paragraphs, but we are more sceptical about emissions trading."
"A system of that kind may be an interesting experiment at EU level, but it is no substitute for other measures."
"Mr President, in recent years we have witnessed an exponential increase in disasters on our territory: natural disasters which, in many cases, have caused havoc over entire regions and countries, natural disasters which are not entirely due to climate change - itself caused by interference from man - but which are also the result of changes made by man to the land, brought about by administrations, governments and citizens who have failed to make better provision for the environment, preserve it and guarantee its future."
"This year, Italy suffered first the tragedy in Calabria and then the current colossal tragedy, which has claimed over 25 deaths and left over 45 thousand homeless in the north."
"The Valle d'Aosta, Piedmont and many areas of the Po Valley and Lombardy were particularly hard hit."
"Last year, the tragedy in France destroyed hundred-year-old forests: an immeasurable loss for mankind."
"Mr President, five years ago, Italy suffered another great flood."
"Houses, bridges, roads, factories, shops and entire villages were destroyed on that occasion too."
"At the time, in my capacity as an MEP and member of the Alleanza Nazionale party, I asked the Commission to immediately prepare a measure identifying the areas at risk from flooding and to draw up a hydrogeological map of the regions of the European Union."
"Five years have passed, we are discussing another flood and there is still no hydrogeological map."
"Europe has done absolutely nothing to intervene and it has not put any pressure on the national States to change and improve the situations in the individual countries either."
"We are now proposing this map again, in the hope that we will not still be here, five years from now, counting bodies and reproaching ourselves for not having done our duty: a map of the areas of the European Union at risk, a directive laying down safety standards for buildings constructed beside rivers and streams, establishing operating criteria for forest management and preventing the working of mines and quarries in sites which are at risk, with penalties for those who authorise them and those who exploit them."
"We have to realise that preventing hazards which contribute to ecological change is the best way to protect the environment."
"This development, rural development included, must be environmentally friendly, for what is environmentally friendly is human-friendly as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the changing climate in Europe has been causing natural disasters for a number of decades now, and these disasters have not yet been sufficiently analysed and evaluated."
"Padania, which is the most advanced geopolitical and cultural area in Europe, has suffered tragic flooding that has taken a huge toll on human life and property."
"The Italian government, which has set aside ridiculously small sums given the scale of the disaster - of which, moreover, warning was given - in a key production area for Italy and Europe, is treating these hard-working people inappropriately, irresponsibly and inefficiently, as it did the people affected by the earthquakes in Umbria and southern Italy."
"No preventive or hydrogeological work of substance has been carried out thus far."
"Europe must provide a guarantee, it must call upon the Italian government to recognise the full scale of the damage suffered by the undertakings - which must, moreover, be exempted from paying any form of tax relating to this - and the citizens who, with the aid of a hard-working, exemplary Padanian volunteer force, immediately set to work to restore a semblance of normality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Jorge Moreira da Silva, for his excellent work and for his report."
"Climate protection is not a marginal subject for environment freaks, it is one of the greatest challenges of our time."
"The dreadful storms and floods which have ravaged Europe and the rest of the world in recent months should be a wake-up call for us all."
"Nearly all the scientific experts are telling us that these storms and floods will dramatically increase if we do not achieve a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
"So climate protection also makes good economic sense."
"That is why it makes me angry that when climate protection and the challenges it involves are being discussed people often just say what they do not want, and not what they really do want."
"There is a lack of alternatives, a lack of constructive debate."
"A lot of people say that we do not want nuclear energy, at any cost."
"Others say that we definitely do not want tax measures."
"However, I believe that we must use every possible means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"It also makes me angry that when Member States discuss national eco-taxes, although these national instruments are quite rightly criticised, few positive suggestions are made to replace them."
"And that is the reason why on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party I have tabled an amendment calling for a European climate tax which covers all greenhouse gases and is revenue-neutral."
"We have a chance to correct the mistakes made at national level and to give a positive signal on behalf of Europe."
"The Group of the European People's Party also considers that nuclear energy will be indispensable at least for the next few decades if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Abandoning nuclear energy, as is planned in some Member States, who are actually going ahead with that, gives exactly the wrong signal, because nuclear power stations emit considerably less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels."
"Before we abandon nuclear, we have to say how we intend to reduce greenhouse gases."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would first like to thank the rapporteur, because I believe that he has succeeded in a remarkable way in reconciling the various interests in this House so as to formulate a position on behalf of Parliament."
"Commissioner, I have been following the debate on climate change in this House since 1995."
"What I have observed since then is that Parliament has made certain concessions here, but always against the tactical background that we want the country with the highest CO2 emissions to come on board as regards Kyoto."
"So we have gone along with this and said that we accept emissions trading."
"We are in favour of it in principle and we have made many more concessions."
"At some point the hurdle will be so low that I can honestly say that I cannot lower it any further."
"It will not be possible to make any more concessions."
"That is why I believe that in future negotiations we should really concentrate on the idea that if the USA cannot initiate the ratification process, then we ourselves should enter into agreements with other countries, as ultimately ratification without the USA is not impossible if we are at long last to make some progress here."
"We cannot keep making concessions until there are no more to be made if we are not certain that Congress will eventually give its approval."
"Commissioner, I of course heard your speech about the European Climate Change Programme, the ECCP."
"It was a rather bland speech about what we could all do and how marvellous that would be."
"I seem to have heard a lot of bland speeches like that over the last few years!"
"In the end, I would far rather do battle alongside you for highly specific measures such as a switch to renewables."
"There is a proposal to that effect on the table, but I wonder just what the Commission's policy really is when I see the Directorate-General for Competition frustrating this proposal to promote renewables using funds from environmental aid scheme, perhaps to the point of destroying it."
"I would also like to fight alongside you to achieve a standard for low-energy housing."
"And I would like to battle alongside you to achieve a tax regime to promote cars with low fuel consumption."
"So how about finally forgetting those bland speeches, rolling up our sleeves and really getting something done!"
"Mr President, I am glad to hear that the Commissioner is pressing for eight Members of this House to attend COP6, but I want to emphasise that we want to play a constructive role in EU strategy making."
"We do not want to be squeezed out as Members were who attended the World Health Organisation conference recently."
"We see ourselves working together at a set of European institutions fighting to improve the situation and ensure that the Kyoto Protocol is ratified."
"Compare, after all, our common agreement with the experience we had just recently at that tele-conferencing session with members of the US Congress, which frankly was a very depressing experience."
"The chairman of the Health Science Committee spelt out, from the American point of view, that this was an economic issue, not an environmental one."
"That really spells out the differences between the approach of the United States representatives and those of this Parliament."
"There was no recognition of the need to make sacrifices or to accept that we have historic responsibilities on both sides of the Atlantic as the largest emitters of greenhouse gases."
"For all our good intentions, however, it looks as though in the European Union far from cutting CO2 emissions by the end of this decade we shall end up increasing them."
"So the prospects for COP6 look poor, but the prospects of our meeting our goals even with Kyoto do not look that good either."
"That is not helped by governments across the European Union responding to calls to cut fuel prices."
"If we are serious about the environment, these must be resisted."
"We should not be cutting fuel tax."
"I say ""yes"" to emissions trading - let us get on with it."
"Let us also hurry up with the measures we need to take in each Member State cutting traffic emissions, increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewables and CHP."
"The sad truth is we will not succeed in preventing climate change anyway, but if we do not start taking action now, the problems will become all the worse."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some people are attempting to get the nuclear debate put back on the agenda."
"I believe that European environment ministers have so far adopted the very wise approach of excluding it from the list of flexible mechanisms."
"Nuclear power is more expensive than other options, such as energy efficiency, for example, and every dollar that is invested in nuclear power is denied to other investments that are much more profitable."
"Nuclear power does not really meet the needs of people, who also want to live in heated or air-conditioned homes, depending on the climatic zones in which they live."
"Nuclear power does not provide a single solution."
"But solutions can be found in cogeneration, based on biomass or gas."
"Nuclear power is still dangerous."
"The accident at Tokaimura clearly showed this."
"And fifty years after the start of civil nuclear power, there are still no solutions as to what do with nuclear waste."
"We have already invested billions in research and we still have not made any progress."
"I fervently believe that we must appreciate the importance of energy efficiency."
"We can help the Chinese, the Indians, Indonesia and the Pakistanis much more by giving them the means to buy refrigerators that do not consume much energy, because there will be 800 million refrigerators over the next ten years."
"That is what will dictate the CO2 emissions of developing countries, rather than the two, three, four or five nuclear reactors that could be sold to them."
"Mr President, the rapporteur correctly maintains that climate change is one of the most serious environmental problems we are facing today."
"Although three years have already passed since the Kyoto Conference and the commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by 8% in comparison with 1990 levels, and as the European Environment Agency has reminded us, if very specific political measures are not taken, this reduction will not take place; on the contrary, greenhouse gases will increase by 6%."
"It should be considered that emissions from transport could increase the most rapidly, potentially rising by up to 39% by the year 2010."
"I also share the rapporteur's concern for specific policies and measures to take priority over emissions trading, which should be ancillary to them."
"I do not entirely share Mr Liese's faith and enthusiasm regarding nuclear energy."
"I consider, like the Member who spoke earlier, that nuclear energy poses unresolved problems, and the fact that the Commissioner said nuclear energy will not be promoted in the proposals currently being studied reassured me."
"In any case, we believe that the priority for the European Union must be specific measures and policies and the definition of a European programme on climate change, which must also have specific objectives and aims, and it worries us that this is not the philosophy that will be advocated at the forthcoming Hague Conference."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I, like other Members, will recall the floods in Spain and Italy, which seem to us, like other so-called natural disasters, to be an expression of climate change."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to add my congratulations to those already offered to the rapporteur for these two superb reports."
"With regard to the first report, I will simply make mention of the floods and the victims that there were in the East of Spain, attributed to climate change, as the previous speakers have already talked about both these things."
"With regard to the second report, I consider that emissions trading should be approached as an instrument with which to facilitate the fulfilment of obligations under the Kyoto Convention."
"Various attitudes have been adopted in the face of this flexible mechanism: expectant, reactive or active."
"I think that from both the economic and environmental point of view we must adopt an active stance."
"Reasons for this include the realistic consideration that this will enable us to achieve short-term environmental goals by establishing specific reduction levels, and timetables for fulfilment."
"This is also an opportunity to encourage research and development in the field of new technologies for controlling pollution, contrary to the opinion of those who believe that this mechanism is a way of perpetuating the interests of the large polluting corporations."
"If this tool is correctly applied, pollution will become more and more expensive and the market will ensure that products obtained through the least clean methods become obsolete."
"Likewise, making emissions the subject of trade will lead to greater control over them and, what is more, they will be documented."
"This will promote the development of activities with a less significant environmental impact."
"It is essential that this mechanism is developed transparently as an integral part of the raft of measures that the Member States is to adopt within the context of the European climate change strategy."
"To this end, all the Member States must take great pains to communicate with the public so that it is clear from the outset which objectives are being pursued with this mechanism and what the benefits are, that these are always partial and complementary to other types of measure."
"In this way there can be no misunderstandings."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a large proportion of the world population, especially in the Third World, will soon need boots to protect their feet from rising water levels."
"But recently, in Italy too, the dramatic effects made themselves felt."
"The exact relationship between CO2 emissions and global warming is not yet entirely clear, but that should not prevent us from taking drastic measures now."
"The precautionary principle is applicable here."
"According to experts, we need to reduce current CO2 emission levels by 60% in order to halt climate change."
"We are now working towards an 8% reduction, which is already quite a task."
"Although we are rightly investing in more sustainable energy and greater efficiency, our intentions are not new."
"Yet, we need to establish that our dependence on fossil fuels has hardly fallen since the 70s."
"We therefore need to employ all possible means and use them to the full."
"That translates into an unqualified 'yes' to the trade in emission rights, provided it is thought through properly."
"We still need to find solutions to major economic and political problems."
"Emissions trading could lead to a new form of colonialism."
"It is easier for rich countries to buy reductions in developing countries and thus acquit themselves of their responsibilities without giving the matter another thought."
"Technological innovation will be curtailed as a result."
"The success of emissions trading will therefore depend on the price."
"If the price is too low, the purchase of emission rights will be very attractive indeed."
"Its success will also depend on support."
"The trade in emissions must be fair and must be able to rely on a level playing field in the sectors involved."
"The market must be deployed in a bid to promote sustained growth as well as fair distribution."
"This requires clear political choices."
"The Climate Conference at The Hague presents an opportunity to take global steps, an opportunity which we should not let slip."
"We must not hide behind the unwillingness of the United States."
"Sound cooperation between rich and poor countries is needed to achieve climate objectives."
"We must lay down equitable points of departure."
"Equal emission rights for all global citizens is not only an equitable step, it is also effective."
"It is a means of involving developing countries and of promoting technological efforts."
"The Hague must also set an agenda for the future, of which equal emission rights for all the citizens of the world must certainly form a part."
"I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur for his work and wish the Commission every success."
"Mr President, the climate changes caused by our consumer habits have begun."
"My colleagues have referred to the catastrophes that are occurring in quick succession and which serve as warning lights that demand practical political intervention."
"We welcome the objective and clear-sighted findings of the report by Mr Moreira da Silva regarding the crucial issues and hopes, but also concerning the disillusionment and the renunciations that have infiltrated the battle line in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"We know that the most important stage will take place at The Hague in November."
"We will see whether or not the parties who committed themselves at Kyoto will exercise their responsibilities and meet the demands of the global issues that await us, which put us all in the same boat and spare no one."
"Many people forecast a fiasco, however, and even an agreement on the cheap, which will sound the death knell of the Kyoto Protocol."
"We refuse to believe this hypothesis."
"The European Union delegation must stand firm."
"It should continue to be the leader, as it was in Kyoto, it should set an example, and it should not give way under any circumstances to the temptations of get-out clauses."
"Our mandate is clear and our demands are forceful."
"Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol is crucial, as is the implementation of domestic measures that will make a real contribution to the fight against greenhouse gas emissions."
"Let us hope that the European Council does not fall into the traps that have been set for it."
"The European Union must refuse to integrate nuclear power, even if there is strong pressure in favour of mechanisms for clean development."
"Nuclear power is neither a sustainable energy nor a clean one."
"It would be just as unacceptable to admit carbon sinks among the flexibility measures."
"It would be particularly improper and fallacious to make citizens believe that it is enough simply to plant trees to comply with the commitments undertaken at Kyoto."
"With 80% of its electricity coming from nuclear power and with an extensive covering of forest, France, for example, has not achieved the undertakings it agreed to at Kyoto, which are nonetheless minimal at 0%."
"Action must be taken in other areas."
"The European Union does not have the right to shirk its commitments."
"Mr President, the two reports by Mr Moreira da Silva under discussion will be important while the Community prepares for the meeting next June of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol."
"Their aim is that the EU will play a leading role in the international struggle to slow down climatic change."
"I believe that Mr Moreira da Silva' s work has furthered this aim."
"According to an estimate made by the European Environment Agency, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU are expected to increase by 6% during the period 1990 - 2010."
"It also states in its appraisal that it is emissions from traffic that are clearly increasing most of all."
"Urban traffic in particular is the main focus for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from traffic."
"For that reason the committee is encouraging the Commission to make proposals in its new Green Paper to alter attitudes to transportation in densely built-up areas so that greenhouse gas emissions may be permanently reduced."
"The committee also considers it necessary to increase financial support for public transport and it criticised the Commission for the fact that policy and action in the EU strategy on a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions are of secondary importance."
"This is unacceptable if the EU really intends to lead the world in the process to slow down climatic change."
"The EU' s own input is vital, especially as the outcome of the sixth conference of the parties to the agreement cannot yet be certain."
"Mr President, now I would like to put things very simply."
"I feel that we politicians still have not grasped how serious the situation is with regard to climatic change."
"As politicians, we are used to making compromises with regard to almost anything, and we have learnt that the world is shaped that way - shaped for compromise."
"But now we have before us a party we cannot negotiate with. Nature is a hard fact of life: it does not submit to agreement; it just is."
"This is such a simple fact that I almost feel ashamed to mention it, but I believe this is the main source of confusion in the way we think."
"Mr President, I naturally agree with much of what has been said at great length today, but I would like to draw your attention to a very practical issue, which concerns last week's flooding in the north-west of Italy and in Spain and France."
"I am one of the signatories to a joint resolution, to be put to the vote tomorrow, which calls upon the Commission to provide emergency funding from its own budget to orchestrate the operations planned by the national authorities in the areas affected by the floods."
"It calls upon the Commission to grant financial aid immediately to the sectors affected, under Article 87, Paragraph 2 of the EC Treaty, and to take into consideration the fact that a large proportion of the areas affected are eligible for assistance from the Community Structural Funds. This would represent a considerable contribution to reconstruction and, most importantly, prevention operations."
"With regard to this matter, it is vital for the Union not to restrict itself to making exceptional interventions once disasters have already occurred, as has already been said."
"I would emphasise, in particular, points 6, 7 and 8 of the joint resolution: Europe must call upon the Member States to update their laws on the environment, the abuse of planning permission, reforestation, the revitalisation of mountain areas and, in general, on the promotion of farming methods which are intended to protect and safeguard the land as well as yield increasing quantities of produce."
"Clearly, an action of this scale cannot be effectively developed purely at national level, primarily because of the scale of the resources needed but also because of the very nature of the natural phenomena in question which, like those relating to climate change and damage arising from CO2 emissions, are in no way contained by borders."
"In asking you to support our resolution, ladies and gentlemen, we are calling not merely for an urgent intervention to contribute to repairing the damage but for a longer-term policy which will make Europe an increasingly safer and more enjoyable place to live for its citizens."
"Mr President, the Commission and others have predicted that most Member States will not achieve their targets for limiting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, so it is essential that effective measures are implemented now."
"Failure to reach the targets is simply not an option."
"One estimate says that 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years because of the effects of climate change, the majority of them in the developing countries."
"We need a radical change of direction."
"We can, and must, adopt effective and innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time protect our society and our jobs."
"Wales, which is the constituency I represent, is very dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry."
"Because the UK is introducing a climate change levy next April, I commissioned research on the effects of this on industry in my own constituency."
"The evidence suggests that not only could it keep Britain on track to meet its emissions target, but the levy could actually encourage a small increase in employment."
"Several economists have analysed the effects of this on a Europe-wide level, and have come to similar conclusions that there is, or could be, a beneficial effect on employment."
"The debate has moved on and we need to look at reducing emissions, not as a threat, but as a challenge and an opportunity."
"I hope Parliament's demands which are set out in the reports before us are acted upon and that governments approach The Hague Conference in a positive way so we can see the Kyoto Protocol ratified in the near future."
"Mr President, I must begin by congratulating Mr Moreira Da Silva on his reports and immediately declare an interest."
"I own some woods in the United Kingdom, the economics of which in the present state of the economy are quite hopeless."
"Yet my trees, and those of many others, clean up CO2 emissions discharged by some of the wealthiest companies in the land."
"No woodland owner gets a penny piece directly from this important social function and monetary payments for environmental permits and their trading must, it seems to me, have to work their way through to those who actually grow and manage the trees and not be expropriated by exchequers and others on the way."
"Obviously, unless forestry pays, nobody is going to plant the trees and if the trees are not planted they cannot clean up the CO2."
"In addition, it is quite wrong for the relatively poor industry to clean up the mess left by the relatively rich industry, free, gratis and for nothing."
"This in turn offers a potential further income stream for beleaguered farmers and others in the countryside to help rebuild its economic base, which at present, as we all know, is producing too much food at too high a price."
"Agriculture is a multi-output industry and public expenditure may well be necessary to achieve the full range of public goods the industry can and should produce."
"Given the potential of biomass and other crops for energy generation and for the production of hydrogen, if one contrasts the quantity of money supporting the production of unwanted food, and compares that with support for these alternative outputs and their utilising technologies, the disparity is self-evident."
"There is a very strong case for rebalancing the figures because unless new, sustainable agricultural outputs are devised, farming and the countryside's problems can only get worse."
"This is as much a matter of CAP reform as it is of environmental policy and it is only by drawing together the two that sensible progress can be made."
"Mr President, as some speakers have already indicated - and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moreira Da Silva, on his report - in a tragic coincidence with this debate, nature has decided to remind us of the consequences of climate change."
"In the north of Italy and also in my own area - the Mediterranean coast of Spain - the forces of nature have once again unleashed themselves, leading to loss of life and the loss of possessions, in homes, factories and so forth."
"On our coast, on the Spanish Mediterranean coast, this is the product of a phenomenon known as la gota fría (cold front), caused by the warming of the waters of the Mediterranean, which generates an increase in water vapour which, upon contact with the cold layers of the stratosphere, produces this heavy rainfall."
"It is true that this normally takes place in autumn, but it is also true that this used to take place every 15 to 20 years, while it currently happens almost every year, with tragic consequences at least every three or four years."
"Is this or is it not the result of the greenhouse effect and climate change?"
"Although the experts cannot guarantee it with all the scientific evidence, I believe this to be the case."
"We must therefore remedy this situation."
"It is true that with the measures contained in the Kyoto Protocol, to which the report we are debating today refers, we will not achieve short-term results, but it is also true that the human race should try to solve the problems it creates."
"Other causes - also triggered by human greed - combine with the greenhouse effect, such as building on watercourses, which heightens the damaging effects of these natural disasters."
"I am therefore one of the signatories to a motion for a resolution suggesting not only the rapid application of the measures contained in the Kyoto Protocol to combat climate change, but also other types of preventative measures, for example continuing and intensifying efforts to prevent the effects of rain when creating infrastructures, and finally, aid to all the victims, given that they are not responsible for the short or long-term damage caused by human greed and speculation."
"Mr President, the joint resolution on the floods calls for civil protection at European level and emergency funding."
"However, it should be remembered that the environmentalists are almost alone in fighting to stop construction on floodplains, to bring about the cleaning-up of water channels, to stop the concreting of river banks or uncontrolled excavations, and to call for measures on reforestation and the protection of mountains, the only operations which can reduce the amount of rain water and avoid landslides."
"I do hope - although I fear that it will be thus - that in a few days' time, when the floods no longer make the headlines and those who have been flooded out of their homes are left on their own to sort out their problems, that people will not cease to be willing for their land to be used as an overflow area."
"I hope I am wrong, but I have a strong suspicion that some mayor or other will object and request that a bank be raised somewhere else: all this against any logic in terms of regional planning or safety."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe can certainly contribute, but it is the, sometimes unpopular, decisions taken in the areas affected which will be a true measure of the commitment to attempting to ensure that such catastrophic events are not repeated."
"Mr President, everyone agrees about the seriousness of the climate issue, and everyone agrees that the EU must have an intelligent policy for complying with the commitments we made in Kyoto."
"I believe that we must go a step further."
"It is not enough just to have a good policy in Europe."
"I believe that the EU must take the lead in the work being done internationally on climate change."
"Otherwise, I do not believe that the climate convention will amount to much more than theory."
"In order to take on such a leading role, an aggressive energy policy is required, but the truth of the matter is that the European Union at present lacks an energy policy worthy of the name."
"I myself am a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy which is responsible for energy issues."
"I have seen again and again during the last few months the unsystematic way in which energy policy is conducted within the European Union."
"Those proposals which are being presented are not part of a coherent strategy. On the contrary, they are not shown as having any connection with each other."
"One month we applaud the fact that deregulation of the electricity market has led to lower prices."
"A few months later, we complain that the lower prices have reduced the incentives in favour of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources."
"These are just a few examples."
"An aggressive strategy must include a change to our energy systems."
"At the same time, it must also include more active support for the developing countries."
"It is, in any case, in the developing countries that most investment in energy production will take place in the future."
"I can see that the Commission is doing its best."
"As I see it, responsibility for the lack of results lies mainly with the Member States and their governments and is due to their refusal to agree to a common carbon dioxide tax and their refusal to accept the need for a common energy policy."
"I wish Commissioner Wallström all the best with her work, but I want to conclude with a question: Does she really believe that it makes sense to implement an aggressive climate strategy without a common energy policy?"
"Firstly I would like to thank Mr Moreira da Silva for his clear-sighted and pertinent analyses, and for the excellent proposals he has put forward in both his reports."
"However, I wish to express a few reservations in the case of the early implementation of what must be called 'a system of entitlement to pollute' ."
"I would like to repeat that, if we have to recognise the system of trading in CO2 emission rights as one of the provisions of our international agreements which we cannot go back on, the Commission seems to forget that this mechanism is just one of the systems described as flexible by the Kyoto Protocol."
"As a result, this mechanism must be looked upon not as a frontline tool but, on the contrary, as an instrument complementary to other measures aimed at reducing greenhouses gases."
"We are fully aware that this mechanism does not encourage companies to become less polluting and to change their ways, and that, if nothing else is done, especially in the area of transport, we will certainly not achieve the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol."
"The Commission Green Paper can thus be accused of putting the cart before the horse and of urging the European Union to put in place a system of advance trade in CO2 emission rights, even though it is not obliged to do so, especially vis-à-vis its commercial partners."
"On this point, it seems to me that there is a case for backing one of the amendments tabled by my colleagues in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, who deem it necessary to stay the implementation of a system of entitlement to pollute until the Council and the Member States have drawn up and ratified an operational plan of measures to reduce greenhouse gases, encompassing all the sectors involved, especially transport and agriculture."
"What is more, the Commission remains silent on the economic and social consequences that this system cannot fail to create."
"But can we seriously ignore the unacceptable practices which will inevitably result from the capitalist strategies of the most polluting industries?"
"Can we act as if we did not know that some industrial groups will merge at the cost of redundancies, and buy up non-polluting or less polluting companies with the sole purpose of recovering their right to pollute before relocating them or purely and simply closing them down?"
"Finally, where are our environmental objectives in this sort of international stock market of pollution rights and what can be expected of a system which simply opens up a huge market of rights on behalf of countries which, like Russia, may today have room for manoeuvre, not by virtue of bringing their factories up to the required standards, but quite simply by virtue of a dramatic reduction in their industrial output."
"To conclude, I think that we must press for the implementation of a framework agreement of cooperation between Russia and the European Union so as to put in place ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the priority in the Union' s policy on climate must be a sustainable environmental policy, in taking decisions we must also pay attention to the importance of the international competitiveness of industry and the undisturbed workings of the Internal Market."
"Individual countries are responsible for implementing the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol and the obligations related to the Union' s distribution of the burden."
"Different countries' scope for implementing action to reduce emissions varies considerably."
"If country-based quotas were allocated to different sectors in the EU, as, for example, Mr Blokland suggested when he presented the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, companies engaged in the same sort of business would end up in totally unequal positions across the different Member States."
"Although a given sector might be amongst the world' s best in terms of environmental efficiency in one country, and I can say that is true of many sectors of industry in my country, Finland, for example, it might have to agree to a more stringent quota for emissions than its less efficient competitor in another country."
"This would inevitably lead to distortion of the competition situation and, for that reason, we must not impose binding, quantitative targets on different sectors of industry at Community level."
"It is essential to promote measures that can be implemented in practice and do not jeopardise the competitiveness of enterprises."
"Along with France, my own country, Finland, is at present the only EU country where the building of additional nuclear power stations is being considered."
"I wholeheartedly support the building of additional nuclear power plants, as it would give our energy-intensive industry a greater competitive advantage both in terms of economy and emissions."
"For that reason we should not adopt a position in this report either in favour of individual forms of electricity production or specifically in opposition to them: instead, all the various forms of energy production must be at our disposal while we formulate national climate strategies."
"I would also like to emphasise the importance of voluntary, negotiated target agreements."
"In many Member States they have been considered a very effective means of promoting the implementation of climate-related targets."
"Voluntary agreements could in particular be a good mechanism for use in the enlargement process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in illustrating the resolution proposed by Italian MEPs, I feel that it must be said that, for the second time in five years, we have experienced a natural disaster in the same region of our country, Italy."
"This has, on the one hand, allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the issue, an understanding forced upon us by tragic events but, on the other hand, it imposes upon us certain burdens which are certainly not ours alone: they are not the burdens of one or more affected regions, they are burdens not only of the country but of the international community as well, so that solidarity is displayed and acknowledged at different levels."
"And it has been displayed, at least initially, at moral, political, economic and legislative levels."
"We expect the Commission to acknowledge the disastrous situation in certain regions in our country and to affect land rehabilitation, in collaboration with the national States, of course, but we also expect it to intervene with legislation to raise awareness at European level, so that the issue of floods and disasters, the victory of ill-omened nature over man and organised society - can in some way be changed for the better."
"Mr President, the issue of global warming, although not yet proven beyond doubt, is of the greatest concern for the world at large and knows no respect for national boundaries."
"It is very much part of the concept of Gaia, or geophysiology."
"As a supporter of free markets and the huge prosperity and freedom which they have brought to countless millions, I welcome the harnessing of market mechanisms wherever possible to facilitate environmentally-desirable goals such as the reduction of CO2 emissions, as proposed by the Commission's Green Paper and Mr Moreira Da Silva's report, which I welcome broadly, and will help, no doubt, achieve the Kyoto targets."
"I put down two amendments, one calling for further research into the other greenhouse gases such as methane, soot, CFCs, etc. I believe that the tradable quota system may need to be extended to these, as in many ways their reduction would be far more cost-effective and less destructive to the world's economy."
"The second amendment I put down was for the granting of credits to national quotas for the planting of forests, which, as my colleague Lord Inglewood pointed out before, act as carbon sinks."
"They are desirable in terms of supporting the beauty of the countryside and they are also eminently policeable by satellite technology."
"I also believe new ideas such as planktonic oceanic seeding, to irreversibly fix CO2 to the ocean bed, need further investigation."
"I should like to touch on two controversial topics in the report."
"One is the issue of an EU-wide carbon tax, which I reject both because it encroaches on prerogatives on taxation and because it would drive jobs offshore to non-EU jurisdictions, in my view, and be damaging to our economies."
"The other is the issue of grandfathering rather than national auctioning of the CO2 quotas."
"I personally support grandfathering along US lines to prevent penalisation of existing heavy energy using industries and doubly rewarding those industries which have made energy savings in the past and hence savings on their electricity costs."
"Lastly, I too, like my colleague Mrs Kauppi, support nuclear energy as the only long-term solution to reducing CO2."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want of course to thank you for your constructive contributions to the debate on climate change and on how we are to combat this."
"In just a moment, I intend to comment on the floods which have hit Italy and Spain."
"I have a statement to read out from the Commission, and shall come back to this in a moment."
"First of all, however, I want to round off the discussion about what we believe must happen in The Hague in a few weeks' time by saying that our role must clearly be that of instigating change internationally."
"We shall be compelled to be the ones who take initiatives, who force the pace and who, at the same time, build bridges between, in particular, developing countries and countries such as the United States and others in that group."
"We must of course force those who are dragging their heels to turn this conference on climate change into a success, as well as show that we are credible when it comes to taking action too."
"To answer a direct question, I do not believe that we shall tackle this matter successfully in the long term if we do not have access to a range of tools and a range of political initiatives."
"What we are concerned with here, of course, are methods and systems of transport, which must be equipped for the future. It is also a question of energy policy."
"I am nonetheless pleased that the Commission has been recognised as having taken initiatives in this area."
"I believe that we need more in terms of financial instruments of control."
"We also need, of course, to discuss new areas and the integration of environmental and climate considerations into all policy areas."
"Again, it is a question of credibility."
"Emissions trading merely supplements those measures, both at Member State and European level, which we shall be sure to incorporate into our basic political systems and infrastructures in order to manage climate change."
"As has also been pointed out in this Chamber today, I think we are right to be careful when it comes to competitiveness and the socio-economic effects."
"This problem must not, however, be used as a reason for not taking action but may even perhaps be turned to our advantage as something which strengthens competitiveness and offers us benefits."
"Once again, I want to thank the rapporteur and everyone who has taken part in the debate."
"As soon as possible after the conference in The Hague, we shall of course come back with a plan for implementing all these measures, by which time we shall also hopefully have clear, agreed rules."
"I hope we shall be able to come back from the conference and say that it has been a great success."
"The natural catastrophes which have struck the European Union and its citizens have had tragic consequences."
"They have confronted us with severe physical damage and in some cases loss of human life, recently in Italy and now in Spain."
"The Commission is acutely aware of the weight of these catastrophes."
"This is why the Commission, in the area of Community action for civil protection in the period 2000-2004, is developing initiatives in close collaboration with Member States to prevent catastrophes and educate the public."
"On 27 September the Commission therefore adopted a proposal based on a Council decision which instituted a Community mechanism to coordinate measures for civil protection during emergencies."
"The key actions included in this decision are: identification of and improved coordination among the key actors to intervene in the case of emergencies; special training programmes to promote better cooperation and complementarity between the actors concerned; establishment of efficient communication systems to allow for better and more rapid communications."
"The proposal also permits faster and more effective steps to be taken on behalf of victims."
"In the area of research I would like to point out that there are currently several projects under way related to flooding as well as the concerted action to reduce the risks associated with climate."
"Finally, although the structural funds are not designed to address the consequences of natural disasters, they can be used for reconstruction projects if the beneficiary Member States allocate the funds for such uses and the region hit by the disaster is eligible."
"The possibility of structural fund involvement in cases of natural disaster must fit within the requirements of the funds and the following conditions must be met: the area in question must be eligible for funding under the territorial objectives, namely Objective 1 or Objective 2."
"Co-finance projects must involve expenses that are normally eligible for structural funds."
"Eligible reconstruction projects may not represent the majority of expenditure in the programme concerned."
"The actions must have a transitional nature, one or two years maximum, and they may not continue throughout the programming period."
"And the Structural Funds may not be substituted for insurance."
"In order to call upon the structural funds for this type of action it must be shown that the programme has room to manoeuvre internally."
"It goes without saying that the Member States concerned are in charge and that it is up to them to envisage what type of measure they would like to see eventually financed by the Structural Funds when the conditions for intervention are fulfilled."
"With regard to cooperation on spatial planning solutions to flooding problems, the Commission knows that the Interreg III guidelines make specific reference to the possibility of formulating joint strategies for risk management in areas prone to natural disasters and drawing up and implementing integrated strategies and actions for the prevention of flooding in transnational river catchment areas."
"The Commission would also expect that flood prevention actions would form part of a transnational strategy which covers areas where flooding is a particular risk under Interreg III."
"For its part, the Commission will continue to give prompt and constructive consideration to this type of request."
"Let me just finish by underlying the support of victims."
"The European Parliament regularly asks the Commission to intervene on behalf of the victims of these disasters."
"The Commission is obliged to respond that there is no longer a budget line which permits such measures."
"Last September, on the occasion of a resolution regarding forest fires which was passed by your assembly, Mr Nielson announced that the Commission was considering whether or not to propose a legal basis for a budgetary line which would permit the Commission to respond to emergency needs in the Union."
"However, the Commission has not yet taken a final position on whether to propose a legal basis for measures in this area."
"In any case, our deliberations will need to consider past experience which would suggest that there are two possible courses of action."
"The first would be a budget line where appropriations are allocated on a semi-automatic basis but with sums which, at best, can only be of symbolic value."
"The second option would be for the Commission to propose a legal basis but this would mean tying up significant sums within heading 3 of the financial perspective."
"The Commission would also need to take into account the resource implications of managing any new activities in this area."
"Thank you for your contribution to this debate."
"At the end of this debate, I have received a motion for a resolution on climate change pursuant to Rule 42(5), of the Rules of Procedure, as well as six motions for resolutions on floods pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, is there nothing in the Rules of Procedure which requires Members to be present to hear responses to points they have made to the Commissioner during the course of the debate?"
"Surely it is a gross discourtesy to the Commission to behave in this way."
"Should this not be something which is raised in the Conference of Presidents?"
"No, Mr Davies, this is not something one can legislate for."
"How MEPs interpret their duties is a matter for them to decide."
"I for one am pleased you are still here, but I agree with you that more members should have been present."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The meeting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Endocrine disrupters"
"The next item is the report (A5-0197/2000) by Mr Lund, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on a Community strategy for endocrine disrupters - a range of substances suspected of interfering with the hormone systems of humans and wildlife [COM(1999) 706 - C5-0107/2000 - 2000/2071(COS)]."
"Madam President, we now have a considerable amount of knowledge of endocrine disrupters."
"There have been many suspicions, but many causal relationships have been clarified concerning how endocrine disrupters affect animals and humans."
"We know that they can result in lower reproductive capacity."
"We know that they can cause deformities in the sexual organs, in both animals and humans, and we know that they can cause severe diseases, including testicular cancer and breast cancer."
"However, at the same time, there is still great uncertainty concerning the collective consequences of the many endocrine-disrupting substances."
"In reality, then, it is impossible to form an overview of the situation, including the situation where future generations are concerned."
"In my opinion, this is a really frightening prospect."
"Until now, the attitude has been that there must firstly be an acknowledgement of the risks posed by substances and that action is not taken until the damage has been done."
"Naturally, this situation is untenable."
"That is why it is a good thing that the Commission has led the way with a communication concerning an EU strategy for endocrine disrupters."
"However, I think that the Commission's strategy is a little too hesitant."
"It could easily be slightly more ambitious."
"I think that what are needed are some more aggressive and effective initiatives in the short term."
"And it is this that I am trying to rectify in this report."
"First and foremost, it is important that the list of substances that are, or are suspected of being, endocrine disrupters be drawn up and that this be done very quickly."
"In the report I have proposed that this should be done before the end of this year."
"It is also important that we have the necessary resources for the list to encompass all the relevant substances, expected to number approximately 560."
"At the same time, it is essential for the most dangerous substances on the list to be identified so that initiatives can be taken immediately to intervene in respect of the most dangerous substances."
"Various measures may be taken: bans, phasing out over a shorter or longer period of years and other restrictions on use."
"It ought to be possible to draw up this list of dangerous substances by mid-2001."
"In this connection, I believe that it is important to conclude that it must be done without waiting for further testing."
"We must also do it through aggressive use of the precautionary principle, in which connection I also think it is important to give consideration to particularly vulnerable groups."
"I am thinking of pregnant women, infants and certain groups of workers who run a particularly high risk of being affected by these substances."
"I also think that a major effort should be made to establish effective monitoring in the Member States and under the auspices of the EU."
"Industry must be required to report on which chemical substances are being put onto the market, in what quantities they are being used and what the expected effects are."
"We all also know that more resources must be put into research into both the extent of the problem and the consequences of it, as well as research into test methods and special research on mixture effects and synergetic effects."
"We know that these substances can interact in a particularly unfortunate way."
"In this connection I also believe that special research into the risks is important and, moreover, that we should ensure that the research is independent, i.e. that we do not base our political initiatives on the producers' own research."
"Where research is concerned, we also know that international cooperation is important, including cooperation with the United States and Japan."
"As part of future legislation on chemical substances, I believe it would be a good thing if we succeeded in establishing a special framework, some special chapters on endocrine disrupters."
"There must be a legislative framework that is based on the precautionary principle and on the principle of a reverse burden of proof."
"At the same time, a timetable should be set for the testing of existing substances."
"In suggesting a legislative framework, I am also saying that I believe the rules should be binding."
"All experience of voluntary agreements in this area is poor."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the various groups and thank the Commission for the cooperation we have had in connection with the drawing up of the report."
"Regarding the amendments, I will simply point out that my own is a linguistic improvement to Paragraph 15 of the report and that I cannot recommend that we vote for Mrs Grossetête' s three amendments."
"I believe that the proposals are largely inspired by the chemical industry, members of which have made the effort to contact me."
"The intention is clear: they wish to try to put obstacles in the way of action being taken here and now, and I believe it is important to emphasise that the advice we are getting from the scientific ethics committee is, in fact, advice and that it will not become actual legislation."
"It is ourselves in the Commission, the Council and Parliament who must lay down the legislative frameworks, and not the scientific committees."
"They serve as advisers in the same way as we receive advice from the other side."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report and I hope that we can work swiftly on this important problem."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is frightening, particularly the effects on generations to come and the effects on unborn children."
"In recent decades, growing evidence has accumulated on the hormone-like effects of a number of industrial chemicals that have appeared in the environment."
"These substances have been termed endocrine disrupters."
"Endocrine disruption is not in itself an adverse outcome but a mechanism, which may have carcinogenic, reproductive, developmental or behavioural effects."
"Some of these effects can be detected using current testing procedures even though it may not be clear whether the disorder has been brought about through endocrine disruption."
"The EU Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Eco-Toxity and the Environment has noted that there is a potentially global problem with wildlife."
"Equally, the Scientific Committee's opinion on human and wildlife health effects - with emphasis on wildlife - said that the health effects on human beings must be investigated because the associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals and human health disturbances need to be verified."
"In general, scientists are suspicious of organochlorine compounds such as PCBs."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has therefore reached certain conclusions, in particular that all 560-plus suspected endocrine disrupting substances need to be fully evaluated."
"We need to look at these in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"We need to focus on both women and men."
"We refer to the technical term ""oestrogen"" as well as ""androgen"" so it is not just a male problem."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as regards endocrine disrupters we currently have a lot of doubts, a lot of questions and absolutely no certainties."
"These substances can have excessively harmful effects on reproductive functions, whether they be human, animal or plant."
"We do not know the maximum exposure levels or the likely exposure times involved."
"These substances themselves have not been listed."
"That is already a lot of questions."
"Focusing on research now will provide us with the means to find answers to all these questions."
"Moreover, this is the meaning of paragraphs 3, 6 and 7."
"Better cooperation with American and Japanese research authorities is absolutely vital."
"A programme of Community research that enables as much information and scientific proof as possible to be gathered must be supported."
"In our 2001 budget, we must set aside appropriations on a par with our ambitions for the sixth framework programme on research and development."
"This research alone will allow us to take into consideration the specific risks linked to these disrupters in future framework legislation on chemical substances."
"The rapporteur - who has produced an excellent report - cites the precautionary principle as the basis for the relevant measures to be taken."
"But also in this respect, intellectual honesty must be demonstrated."
"The precautionary principle not only leads to the implementation of legislative measures; positive, non-legislative measures may also be introduced. My amendment aims to make this reality."
"I also hope that the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and the Environment, which was expressed on 5 September, will be taken into consideration."
"The expertise of this scientific committee is well known and it would be appropriate to take its opinion into account before any legislative decision is taken."
"I think that it is important that we should rely on the opinions of experts."
"The precautionary principle also dictates that we should base our decision on the best scientific knowledge available."
"The Group of the Europe People' s Party and European Democrats is henceforth opposed to the motion to shift the burden of proof as of today."
"I feel bound to repeat this, although this is what I have been saying all along."
"So, even though there are no certainties, it is much too early to overturn the regulations on responsibility applied to this matter."
"In the case of dangerous substances, authorisation is required before they can be placed on the market."
"It seems to me that this procedure is already a safeguard."
"I agree with the rapporteur that our Parliament must send a realistic and responsible message to the general public, to consumers, to the Commission and also to industry in general."
"Their doubts and concerns are real."
"We must provide a commensurate response."
"Mr President, I represent the north-west of England which, with the cities of Manchester and Liverpool, is I suppose one of the most densely populated parts of the European Union."
"We have a particular problem with marine flat fish - flounders in the estuary of the River Mersey in fact - which are exhibiting extreme intersex characteristics and we do not know what the cause is."
"We have a lot of chemical factories around the estuary and suspicion has fallen on them, but the scientists are also looking at the detergents which are used both for industrial purposes and in our own homes."
"They are looking at oestrogens - synthetic oestrogens in particular - used perhaps in the pill by hundreds or thousands of women in the region."
"Indeed, they are looking at natural oestrogen produced by women in their millions."
"It could be a combination of all these things - and this is the difficulty."
"We do not know the answers and there are more than 500 chemicals from which we could choose."
"I have doubts about the use of the precautionary principle and of course, about the misuse of the precautionary principle - by its nature we never know when it is appropriate to use it or not."
"There must be very great concern about the long-term effects of putting thousands of chemicals into the natural environment, but it is difficult to identify exactly which chemicals to target."
"The evidence of falling sperm counts, of rising levels of breast cancer, of female polar bears growing penises or whatever gives rise to very real fears and we have to be prepared to ban some substances on suspicion alone, even before we have firm scientific evidence."
"I support both the Commission's proposals and the rapporteur's suggestions."
"However, we can be sure that there are many disputes to come when we start highlighting chemicals which must be banned."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Torben Lund on a sterling report which can rely on my group' s unqualified support."
"Endocrine disrupters are a relatively new concept."
"In my own linguistic area, the term did not become an established concept until one or two years ago."
"I know that the Danish equivalent is oestrogen substances and that they have been the topic of discussion for nearly ten years."
"The English term is endocrine disrupters and, certainly in scientific literature, they are the subject of a heated debate."
"But in German, for example, there is still no term which has become established."
"This indicates that the problem is new but no less serious as a result."
"We fully back the 2001 deadline."
"I fear that the European Commission, under pressure from the chemical industry, will want to wait too long before introducing statutory measures."
"Half of the 560 substances which are suspected of having an endocrine disruptive effect are pesticides."
"The Commission has admitted this in response to my questions within the Environment Committee."
"We ought to start with these. They should, in any event, not be placed at the end of the list."
"Do endocrine disruptive characteristics play a role in the approval of pesticides at the moment?"
"Unfortunately not."
"They do not feature in the so-called uniform principles, although they should."
"In my view, this should be put right during the revision of the Pesticide Directive in 2003 at the latest."
"I hope the Commissioner is able to give us a response on this issue."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Torben Lund for the excellent report which he has prepared and which deserves the full support of the entire Parliament."
"The effects of artificially produced chemicals that are discharged into the environment are clear."
"There are many examples of damage to the reproductive capacity and development of animals and plants."
"One of the more unpleasant examples of this is sexual abnormalities observed in bears in the Antarctic."
"This example shows that the harmful effects of various endocrine disrupters is a global problem that has affected even the most isolated parts of the world."
"The research results presented by Professor Skakkebæk of Denmark concerning the marked reduction in male sperm quality should also give rise to deep concern."
"We are actually in a situation in which young men should have their sperm quality tested to see whether they should start a family before they had intended to, simply in order to be fairly certain of having children."
"As Torben Lund so rightly stated, the precautionary principle should therefore be put at the top of the agenda."
"It is precisely now that there is reason for using this principle far more aggressively."
"With reference to the precautionary principle, we shall be able to introduce urgent measures with a view to avoiding possible irreversible damage to humans, animals and plants."
"It is appropriate now to put practice before fine words concerning the protection of health and the environment and to make use of the principle in an area about which we still know very little."
"It is the only answer to give to a concerned public."
"We cannot be too prompt in implementing the report' s recommendations to the effect that future framework legislation on chemical substances should be based both on the precautionary principle and on a reverse burden of proof."
"Madam President, it is now our task, in our capacity as politicians, to make decisions within a very difficult area of health."
"I say that, despite the fact that my ordinary profession is within the area of internal medicine."
"Far too little is known about the mechanisms of action of endocrine disrupters."
"Individual variation is very great."
"In addition, sensitivity varies from one period to the next during the human life cycle."
"Therefore, we cannot follow conventional routine and establish limit values for appropriate maximum exposure, since such limit values cannot be established in the case of endocrine disrupters."
"In our capacity as politicians, we must take the problem of endocrine disrupters with the utmost seriousness."
"I consider that the Commission' s strategy document in this area is very good."
"We need greater knowledge, research must be given priority, risk assessment must be accelerated and possible replacement substances must be identified."
"We need statements from the scientific committee."
"The public should be given objective information."
"We need consultation with Member States, with industry and with a variety of organisations."
"To achieve this, it is reasonable for the Commission to work on the basis of a priority list."
"As regards the proposal on the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have an important objection, for I do not share the view that voluntary agreements in general are not a practicable way to proceed."
"On the contrary, I feel that voluntary agreements can be a faster way to proceed than going down the route of legislation."
"Agreements such as time limits on use, restrictions on release onto the market and the phasing in of various risk-free products are often preferable when the circumstances have not been clarified, but where it is valuable to be flexible and to take measures rapidly."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise that the legislative methods must always be preceded by a comprehensive scientific assessment and recommendation from the scientific committee."
"These assessments and recommendations must be observed by us as decision makers."
"It is a requirement of political propriety."
"I think anyone listening to this debate who has never heard of endocrine disrupters would be forgiven for thinking that endocrine disrupters were more to do with some science fiction horror story than their own public health."
"Yet the reality is that this is a critical public health and animal health issue."
"Presently, Community chemicals legislation fails to address the risk that endocrine disrupters pose."
"It is a worrying fact that the human body contains more than 100 chemicals which were not present 50 years ago."
"Numerous female health problems have been linked to exposure to endocrine-disrupting substances."
"There is also a possible link between such substances - as other colleagues this evening have mentioned - with increased incidences of breast cancers, other cancers and the lowering of sperm count."
"The impact this may have on the health and reproduction of both humans and wildlife is worrying, with children, pregnant workers and other vulnerable workers being some of the most sensitive groups."
"A further problem is the fact that it is almost impossible to set limit values for hormone-mimicking substances."
"From the consumer's point of view it has been suggested that the balance of proof be changed to require manufacturers to prove at least a reasonable certainty of no harm before putting any product on the market."
"Wider availability of information is also recommended under the right-to-know principle."
"There is a need for more research to enable us to act quickly, effectively and with certainty."
"The need for a European strategy is critical."
"That is why this report is so important."
"More information, more public awareness and, most importantly, more research is what is needed."
"I thank the rapporteur for this report and I recommend it to the House."
"First I would like to express my appreciation for the Parliament response to the Commission communication on a Community strategy for endocrine disrupters and for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Lund."
"There is hardly any conference on the topic of chemicals that does not touch on the subject of endocrine disrupters."
"One of the reasons for this is the significant potential damage that such substances can cause to animals and human beings and, most importantly, to the unborn foetus and our reproductive capacity."
"It is difficult to imagine a more unsustainable trend than one that would lead to deterioration in our capacity to reproduce."
"The area of endocrine disrupters is a complex one where there are still many questions to be answered."
"There are certain things we know."
"For some we can make predictions with confidence and others where we are faced with considerable uncertainty."
"What we do know is that a number of man-made chemicals that have been released into the environment, as well as a few natural ones, have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, including humans."
"Among these are persistent bio-accumulative compounds that include some pesticides and industrial chemicals as well as other synthetic products."
"Many wildlife populations are already affected by these compounds."
"There are adequate quantitative data showing a causal link between exposure to these substances and a reduction in reproductive success in wildlife."
"There are also some general conclusions that have been drawn by the research community such as the fact that the chemicals concerned have entirely different effects, as Mr Arvidsson said, on embryos, foetuses and perinatal organisms than on adults and that effects are more often manifested in offspring, rather than in a parent that has suffered exposure."
"However, there are also many uncertainties since the nature and extent of the effects of exposure on humans are not well established."
"Information is limited, especially on concentrations of contamination in embryos."
"The need for further examination of the potential risks of such substances to fill the knowledge gaps so we can take appropriate action is the very reason why I presented the proposal for a Community strategy for endocrine disrupters."
"All of us have the right to know and the obligation to learn."
"Let me turn to the key elements of the strategy."
"The basis for it is the precautionary principle."
"I am pleased that Parliament supports the Commission objective to identify appropriate policy action on the basis of the precautionary principle in order to respond quickly and effectively to the problem of endocrine disruption."
"This principle and the need to develop quick and effective risk management strategies in relation to endocrine disrupters was also stressed by the Environmental Council in its conclusions of 30 March."
"At the same time, Parliament perceives a lack of ambition in the Commission strategy concerning the need to reduce human exposure to endocrine disrupters and protect wildlife."
"This I would like to address at the outset with a number of comments."
"There are two core components of the Commission strategy."
"One is further research and development and the other is the development of agreed test methods."
"Regarding research and development, the Commission's main instrument is the fifth framework programme on research and development."
"I am pleased to inform you that endocrine disruption has been highlighted as a priority research topic in the latest revision of the relevant programmes concerning human health and the environment."
"The Commission is also planning a dedicated call for proposals on endocrine disruption which will serve to further reinforce endocrine disruption research."
"The recommendations in the Parliament motion for a resolution will be taken into account."
"Regarding the development of agreed test methods, this will require a two-to-four year horizon."
"Agreement on test methods aims to ensure that everyone involved agrees that the tests designed to detect the right elements and the test results can be interpreted in a uniform way."
"Without such agreement we will constantly be faced, not just with scientific uncertainty but with opposing views on the science."
"For this reason we believe that legislative action to reduce exposure in a comprehensive manner, on the basis of the precautionary principle, can be considered only when agreed test methods are available."
"Agreed test methods are also necessary to launch a comprehensive exercise in the search for substitutes."
"Otherwise, possible substitutes may be open to the same suspicion as the substances they replace."
"At the same time we need to take into account existing scientific evidence."
"That is why we make provision in the short term to act without agreed test methods on the basis of the precautionary principle and on a case-by-case basis."
"Parliament supports the Commission objective to identify a first set of endocrine disrupting substances by the end of this year and to identify specific cases of consumer use and eco-system exposure for special action without awaiting further tests."
"An analysis of existing legal instruments relating to endocrine disrupters will also be part of this exercise."
"Let me make two comments on this."
"First, the Commission objective of the end of 2000 is based on a two-step process: firstly a candidate list compiled by consultants and secondly prioritisation."
"Commission adoption of a proposal for prioritisation will follow."
"So far, only the candidate list has been completed."
"The second step of this exercise involves consultation with stakeholders in which we aim to achieve as wide a consensus as possible on priority substances."
"I cannot give a commitment now that all 553 candidate substances will be on the priority list without pre-empting the outcome of the stakeholders' discussions, which are under way."
"The Scientific Committee as well as industry have been critical of the candidate list, the BKH report."
"In contrast, initial comments received from Member States and NGOs indicate support for the report as a valid starting point."
"The Scientific Committee's criticisms of the scientific shortcomings of the report will be addressed in the next stages of prioritisation and further evaluation."
"I would like to add here that some of the criticisms are based on the false assumption that a group of 60 substances identified in this report will be the priority substances."
"These substances are in fact part of a candidate list of 553 substances on which discussions on priorities are still under way."
"It is also important to bear in mind that the list to be established must be a dynamic one."
"New substances can be added or indeed initial substances removed as new evidence comes to light."
"My second comment in relation to the priority list of substances concerns the request in the motion for a resolution for a decision on intervention on specific cases by mid-2001."
"In order to identify specific cases for special action from the priority list, a more in-depth evaluation will be required on consumer uses and eco-system exposure."
"In addition, the role of the scientific committees in providing independent scientific advice will be crucial in these specific cases."
"It is ambitious to expect to achieve these goals in six months."
"However, we will use our best endeavours to work as quickly as possible."
"Finally, as you are aware, the Commission intends to present a White Paper on the overall chemicals policy by the end of this year."
"We are working on that right now and I have seen the first drafts."
"One of the fundamental principles for this policy is to ensure a high level of protection."
"Clearly the endocrine disrupting strategy must be consistent with the overall policy on chemicals."
"A number of specific elements in Parliament's motion for a resolution, such as the shifting of the burden of proof, a redefinition of the responsibility of manufacturers, a review of labelling legislation and grouping of chemicals for screening and testing, must be and are being addressed in the context of this overall chemicals policy."
"The views of Parliament expressed in the motion for a resolution will be taken into account in the White Paper under preparation."
"Finally, regarding international cooperation and information exchange, the Commission is organising a workshop on endocrine disrupters in the first half of 2001 with the sponsorship of the World Health Organisation among others."
"This workshop will convene all stakeholders to take stock of progress and make further recommendations on the development of test methods and testing strategy, research and the establishment of monitoring programmes."
"I should again like to thank Parliament for its support in addressing this issue and I would like to underline the Commission's commitment to implementation of its strategy and to taking on board the elements of the Parliament motion for a resolution in a comprehensive way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Processed fruit and vegetables"
"The next item is the report (A5-0273/2000) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 on the common organisation of the market in processed fruit and vegetables and Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits [COM(2000)433 - C5-0391/2000 - 2000/0191(CNS)]"
"Madam President, the Commission has presented a proposal which, under the semblance of a technical adjustment, conceals new budget restrictions for a sector itself already discriminated against within the common agricultural policy."
"In recent years, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar and other circumstances have brought the level of aid down to half the level it was at four years ago."
"The Commission' s proposal, however, consists in stabilising aid at the reduced level and granting aid directly to producer organisations, with which the minimum price regime will disappear."
"Before the end of the year, the Commission is to submit a report on the operation of the COM on fruit and vegetables, possibly supplementing it with new proposals for reform."
"The Commission justifies the proposal we are now examining on the grounds of urgency."
"Now, without questioning the urgent nature of the issues dealt with by the Commission, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has identified other urgent issues and also upholds different figures from those in the Commission' s proposal."
"One of the urgent priorities for the Agriculture Committee is the strengthening of producer organisations."
"The problem is that, after the 1996 reform of the COM, the producer organisations became its main instrument."
"Currently, however, only 40% of fruit and vegetable production is pooled within producer organisations."
"A COM that only covers 40% of production does not deserve the name."
"Therefore, if there is any urgency, it lies in encouraging the pooling of supply within producer groups."
"Since this is an exception in the common agricultural policy and the producers themselves have to cofinance the operational funds, an increase in Community funding is clearly the most obvious instrument for achieving this objective."
"The Agriculture Committee has therefore proposed an increase in the percentage of Community financing for certain joint schemes involving several producer organisations under certain conditions, especially in the regions most dependent on fruit and vegetable production, or for associations or mergers of producer organisations."
"The differences in the figures between the Commission' s proposal and that of the Agriculture Committee, which was, in fact, passed almost unanimously, basically centre on aid levels and processing thresholds."
"The aid requested by the Agriculture Committee may seem excessively high, but we must not allow ourselves to be deceived."
"What is happening is that the aid levels proposed by the Commission are excessively low and are intended to convert a temporary situation into something permanent, thus eroding farmers' incomes."
"This temporary situation has been brought about by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar and particular events on the markets."
"The Agriculture Committee' s line is in fact limited to restoring pre-1996 aid levels."
"Furthermore, on the subject of aid, the disappearance of the minimum price and paying aid directly through producer organisations may cause problems, particularly in the main fruit and vegetable producing countries."
"A reasonable level of aid would allow producers' incomes to be maintained in a particularly difficult situation."
"To avoid absurd situations of systematic penalisation, the Agriculture Committee has decided to propose setting it at the level of what was produced in recent years."
"In this way we hope to tailor the aid to the production structure and the ability of the market to absorb the supply, without running the risk of creating surpluses."
"One may ask how the amendments will be financed."
"You see, fruit and vegetables currently receive EUR 445 million less than the ceiling set in the Financial Perspective."
"It is true that budget neutrality must be respected, but we have to agree on what that means."
"In my view, budget neutrality consists in keeping within the limits set when the Financial Perspective was adopted."
"The Commission, however, intends to reduce spending to below the all-time minimum."
"I believe that discussion should focus essentially on how to achieve the objectives allocated to the COM and thereafter on establishing budget commitments."
"It often seems that less is demanded of institutions if they restrict themselves to proposing budget savings."
"Our main concern should be to improve the effectiveness of the instruments that we have all built up together."
"Without a budget there can be no building of Europe, and the budget for the fruit and vegetable sector symbolises and reflects many of the main social and territorial imbalances in the common policy."
"I should like to end by thanking my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee."
"Their understanding and efforts were of great help in reaching a final agreement, which enabled me to draw up this frankly rather difficult report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, tomorrow Parliament is to vote on the proposal for reform in the processed fruit and vegetable sector."
"I believe this reform is necessary, but in its proposal the European Commission is not moving in exactly the right direction."
"The objective of promoting supply pooling must be met by encouraging producer organisations."
"Last year, as Mr Jové Peres has said, only 40% of production was marketed through producer associations."
"Therefore, the amendments approved by the Agriculture Committee and Rural Development, under which up to 50% of the costs of creation and operation can be cofinanced under the EAGGF guarantee for the first five years, answer a need, Commissioner, as does covering the financial aid of 3 to 4.5%, as approved by the Agriculture Committee, of the produce marketed by each producer organisation."
"We are not happy with the thresholds proposed by the European Commission, since they should be adjusted in accordance with market fluctuations."
"Therefore the approved amendments proposed by the rapporteur on this matter enjoy our full approval."
"The list of products should be extended to include those that may be vulnerable to major falls in prices due to the weather or for cyclical reasons."
"The Commission' s proposal to reduce the maximum citrus-fruit withdrawal ceiling from 10% to 5% is unjustified and I believe it should not be upheld."
"Certain instruments for regulating the market in emergency crisis situations must be introduced to act as a safety net, for example, by exceeding the withdrawal ceiling by about 10% in the event of serious crises."
"There is a gap in the area of labelling."
"The legislation in force on this issue needs to be changed so that the consumer may be kept fully informed and know whether the product has been made from fresh fruit or not."
"This is a request and complaint that consumers are always making."
"I support the amendments affecting tomatoes, pears, peaches, cherries, apricots and asparagus, which are of major regional importance and should receive a fixed amount of aid per hectare to improve their competitiveness."
"With regard to dry fruit and nuts, especially hazelnuts, the request to extend the period of aid given to producer organisations that have implemented their improvement plans is still valid, as are the measures specific to this sector which are due to expire in the next round even though there has been no change in their circumstances."
"The analysis of the reforms, which the Agriculture Committee and Rural Development has so insistently called for, should be submitted by 30 June 2001 so that we can see how the sector has been performing."
"These reforms mean a budget increase, but within the line approved at the Berlin European Summit."
"The Commission should do its sums again in view of the fact that this ceiling is not exceeded."
"The difference between the Commission' s proposals and the European Parliament' s is EUR 151."
"Budget neutrality, Commissioner, does not mean that expenditure under the proposal does not exceed what is currently spent but rather that it stays within what was agreed at the Berlin European Summit."
"I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur and I applaud the teamwork we have achieved."
"I believe this has been one of the proposals most based on give and take and finding a balance that we have seen in this Parliament."
"Madam President, this debate is a consequence of the Commission' s proposed reform of three regulations: on fruit and vegetables, products derived from fruit and vegetables, and the aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits."
"As has been pointed out, the Commission has acted without awaiting the report on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 2020/1996, which, according to the Commission, will be available by the end of this year."
"The fact that it has not waited for this document - as would have seemed more natural - and has initiated the reform reveals that the Commission either has little interest in the results of its report or could not care less about its contents."
"With this action, one cannot help feeling that the Commission is determined to reform these regulations at any price."
"Is the reform that urgent?"
"In my view, if the question is whether or not the regulations need reforming, the answer is yes; but, on the other hand, if the question is whether the reform they need is that contained in the Commission' s proposal, then the answer is clearly no, because improvements in the operating mechanisms of the sector must not be achieved at the expense of precisely one of the sectors that receives least support in Community budgets."
"Since the details given in the report are not known, they cannot grab our attention."
"The fruit and vegetable sector accounts for an important share of final agricultural production of some 15%, while the financial effort is small and getting even smaller."
"Whereas, in 1995, it accounted for 5.3% of all spending under the EAGGF guarantee, in 1999 it was down to 3.6%."
"Added to this are two important details: first the importance of this sector for employment, and, secondly, the frequent concessions affecting the fruit and vegetable sector made under trade agreements with third countries."
"We do not intend to oppose these agreements or criticise them, because they are an exercise in solidarity with third-world and developing countries, but it does not seem sensible that the price of solidarity should be paid exclusively by a sector that has never been treated well in Community budgets."
"We are going to support Mr Jové Peres' s report without any hesitation."
"It is an excellent report - for which we congratulate the rapporteur - which provides a balanced reflection of the various interests and agreements involved."
"Its proposals, such as those that correct the most unfair aspects of the Commission' s proposal, may have favourable consequences."
"Our support will be unconditional and unqualified."
"Moreover, I give this support in the belief that the Council will be more sensitive than the Commission to the reasoned and reasonable proposals of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance generally supports the report by the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres."
"We are convinced that the Commission' s proposal is restrictive in budgetary terms, which would mean major financial cut-backs in the sector."
"It should be remembered that the fruit and vegetable sector is the first common organisation of the market to be financed by its own producers, so it is vitally important to encourage producer organisations and to support an increase in operational funds."
"It must be stressed that the fruit and vegetable sector represents a considerable percentage of final agricultural production in the European Union."
"Yet it only accounts for 4% of the EAGGF guarantee budget."
"It should also be remembered that there was broad consensus within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when this report was approved."
"I must mention the predominantly Mediterranean nature of this type of production, which affects several Member States."
"It is a sector which directly and indirectly generates a vast number of jobs, resulting in highly dynamic economic activity."
"In general terms it is the main source of income for almost two million families in Europe."
"It must be stressed that producer organisations, which will be strengthened and encouraged by the amendment introduced by the Agriculture Committee, are extremely important for the rural development of certain districts."
"Fruit and vegetable production is closely linked to the Mediterranean culture and diet, the greatest exponent of a balanced, healthy diet for our consumers."
"Therefore, an objective that producer organisations must prioritise is the encouragement of quality production."
"The fruit and vegetable sector, however, faces an uncertain future due in part to the erosion of Community preference in the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, which may wipe out all the work that has been done."
"We must therefore maintain a constructive and vigilant attitude for the future."
"Madam President, the Commission' s proposal for an amendment to the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is exacerbating the problems of the current market organisation and the unfairness of the CAP. It is also creating greater difficulties for fruit and vegetable growers."
"Particularly serious are the measures designed to abolish the minimum price, which affects tomatoes destined for processing, the reduction in the limit for aid for operational funds from 4.5% to 3% of the value of the production marketed by each producer organisation, the precautionary reduction of 9.1% of the amount of aid for the first marketing year following the reform of the COM and a reduction in the citrus fruit withdrawal ceiling."
"A sector as important in economic, social and strategic terms as this one, particularly for Portugal, with considerable scope for job creation and for supporting the rural development of huge areas of the countries of southern Europe, deserves special attention, which it is not receiving from the Commission."
"The amendments tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres, therefore deserve our support, since they seek to correct the unacceptable views held by the Commission, specifically in its proposals against increasing aid to farmers, on increasing thresholds and on resetting ceilings for aid to producer organisations."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the market organisation in wine and olive oil we now have the market organisation in fruit and vegetables, which is also of concern to the southern countries."
"In fact, the majority of speakers have been Spanish. Our friend and colleague, Mr Jové Peres, has produced an excellent report, which deals with a subject that is both extremely serious and extremely symbolic."
"It is serious not only because of the numbers involved - almost two million families, or 500 000 jobs are, as we have already heard, affected - but also because, behind the failure of the 1996 reform, there are nevertheless women, men and rural regions which, Mr Fischler, the European Commission has deliberately condemned."
"In France, in Provence to be exact, for a holding of 40 hectares of apples, production costs are twice the sales price, which means that a holding producing 40 000 apples loses EUR 320 000 per hectare per annum."
"This holding will disappear."
"To whom shall we apportion the blame?"
"It is not the fault of the tree growers; they have tried to form producer organisations and to build up part-financed operational funds."
"But in order to do this they need to have revenue and in order to have revenue they must sell."
"But they do not manage to sell because the powerful purchasing and distribution groups buy outside Europe - obtaining pears from Argentina and apples from Chile, New Zealand and South Africa."
"Supplies are acquired from these countries because they are cheaper, because workers in the southern Mediterranean or the Pacific have no social protection, because customs duties have been abolished, and because the European Commission is suffering from mad diplomacy disease, that is, the disease of global free exchange!"
"In the name of a global foreign policy, Brussels has sacrificed our tree growers, our market gardeners and our horticulturists, who have become a currency of exchange in the free exchange culture."
"The deal is well known: fruit and vegetables, flowers and wine in the southern hemisphere and, perhaps, industry in the north."
"So, in the words of Comrade Lenin, 'what is to be done?' ."
"Obviously we must adopt the excellent relief amendments put forward by Mr Jové Peres, who has produced an outstanding report, and those of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, without the pretext of budgetary neutrality."
"There is no lack of money to throw at Kosovo, at the Balkans, at Indonesia and at Asia."
"But if we do not put an end to the global drift in European integration, little by little not only will the farmers disappear, but the whole of Europe will drown in the ocean of the global market."
"Madam President, Commissioner, when developing any strategy, before starting to distort the past and adopt new operating guidelines, one must analyse how much has been achieved."
"It would now seem to be irrefutable that since 1996 - the year which saw a complete revision of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables - there has not been any form of discussion, even though it had always been intended, on the impact of the COM in that sector, despite the fact that it has reached its third year of application: a period of time that has to be seen as long enough for introducing any reform initiative."
"The interests of an entire industry are at stake, an industry which employs almost 2 million people in the central southern areas of the Mediterranean countries, universally acknowledged to be among the poorest countries in the European Union."
"The fruit and vegetable sector is struggling between production quotas and world-wide liberalisation of the markets for want of a policy for research into biotechnological innovations."
"It is the processing sector which feels the effects of the Marrakech international agreements most of all, even though it accounts for 16% of the value of European Union agricultural production."
"If the philosophy behind the new COM is to promote the system of associations of producer organisations as an alternative and a complement to the European economic system of large-scale distributors, it would be appropriate for this policy to be bolstered with the financial resources needed to implement the operational programmes, ensuring real financial assistance of at least 4.5% of the marketed production instead of the 3% proposed by the Commission."
"In order to be able to continue to work, producers are calling for the adoption of legislation which will support the development of the fruit and vegetable sector, not hamper it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the market organisation in fruit and vegetables was reformed in 1997 and, three years down the line, the results have not lived up to expectations."
"Based on reinforcing the economic power of producers, creating collective projects and contracting with public authorities within the framework of part-financed operational funds, the results of this reform have finally proved to be inadequate and disappointing."
"The reform has not brought the future we all hoped for at the outset because, in fact, as was highlighted by a previous speaker, the membership rate of the producer organisations has remained very low: less than 40%."
"Under these conditions, the producer organisations have been unable to have a real impact on controlling and promoting products in the fruit and vegetables sector."
"At the same time, although the EAGGF budget for this sector has been increasing steadily since 1997, it has nonetheless always been tightened during the accounting period because of the actual under-utilisation of appropriations due to the unsuitability of the rules of allocation."
"We are thus faced with a paradoxical situation where one of the most important sectors of European agriculture, which covers 20% of production units, employs a great deal of manpower in production and processing, and accounts for 16% of final agricultural production, is ultimately one of the sectors least taken into account by the common agricultural policy."
"Against this background, I naturally want to highlight the opportunity provided by the Commission proposal that we are debating this evening."
"But I want, above all, to congratulate Mr Jové Peres on the quality of his report, whose judicious proposals aim to improve even more significantly the results of this production channel for the countries of southern Europe, most notably by setting public support at 4.5% of the value of the marketed production and by increasing it in some cases to 6% in order to encourage producer organisations to pool their produce."
"Finally, I hope that the Council of Ministers will make a speedy decision in respect of this reform so that it can come into force in 2001 with the appropriate funding."
"Madam President, our rapporteur did an excellent job."
"It was a difficult topic to deal with in the middle of this crisis which has struck the vegetable and fruit sector in certain parts of Europe."
"I subscribe to that analysis, and we must also use that analysis in the forthcoming WTO negotiations so that we can adopt a firm stance in favour of those products which do not enjoy market protection."
"These, too, must be protected."
"The second point I would like to highlight is the position of the producers."
"I subscribe to the rapporteur' s plea to intensify support for the producers and to strengthen their position, and I consider these initiatives to be essential."
"For in the present commotion caused by buying-in organisations which operate on behalf of supermarkets, the question could gradually arise of whether there might not be too much merging and amalgamating on the part of these organisations, and of whether the latter might not slowly but surely be securing monopoly positions for themselves."
"There is only one possible answer to this: the producer organisations need to adopt a more powerful stance and improve the way in which they are organised."
"In my view, this would be more effective than injecting more money into the sector."
"The sector must secure a stronger market position."
"And I must also say that, in my view, this is more effective, especially with regard to vegetables and fruit, as well as delicate products which need to be sold quickly."
"I would like to make a number of observations with regard to the distribution of processing and threshold quotas across the countries."
"I have noticed that these are not evenly distributed on a number of counts."
"And I am also expecting the rapporteur to produce an oral amendment tomorrow with regard to at least one of the countries involved in the processing of pears."
"But if you consider the distribution across the Southern countries, for example the position of Portugal compared to other countries, one can ask oneself whether this distribution is even in every respect."
"In principle, I would like to say, and in that sense I would also like to follow the line adopted by our spokesperson, Mrs Rodondo, that it is essential to strengthen the position of producers and for producer organisations to become stronger, because I can tell you, this is necessary; they must secure a firmer foothold in the market, and the policy will need to be drafted to that effect."
"While we have a common organisation of the market and claim, on the one hand, that we do not want more money injected into it, this will only be effective if we, on the other hand, also consider the production side and possibly a certain level of control of this."
"But in this report, I am precisely in favour of strengthening producer organisations, also by way of responding to this report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 12 July the Commission presented a proposal for amending the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, although we are expecting an evaluation report from the Commission in December 2000 on functioning of this very market organisation."
"If we change some points now in anticipation of that, the Commission will then have to use this evaluation immediately to review the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables and make the necessary changes."
"Joining together producer groups and forming producer associations, and commercial cooperation between producer organisations from various regions, are all particularly important for the fruit and vegetables market sector."
"This should be the starting point for the COM."
"Nevertheless, we also have to bear in mind those farmers who energetically sell part of their production direct to consumers from their farms, for the benefit of themselves and their families."
"For many farms, direct sales bring much-needed additional income, and they are often run by farmers' wives as an independent part of the business."
"Furthermore, direct sales from the farm emphasise the regional nature of products and thus appeal to a certain type of consumer."
"The amendment to Article 11(1)(c) must therefore be framed in such a way that producers, in agreement with producer groups, can sell a proportion of their products - to be agreed on a case-by-case basis - direct to consumers for their personal use."
"If the present rigid limit is maintained, producer organisations will be obliged to expel members who do not respect these rules."
"The result would be that the producer organisations' sales volume would fall and that they would lose their influence over these producers' direct sales activities, as regards complying with quality standards, observing production guidelines and pursuing joint market strategies."
"I therefore ask you to take this into account also."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the fruit and vegetable production that concerns us today is concentrated in the countries of southern Europe and accounts for 13% of the final agricultural production of the whole European Union, reaching 25% in most of the producer countries."
"In several provinces in southern Spain the proportion is over 80% and it is the only driving force for development and employment in the rural areas."
"In addition, this produce has lost Community preference and has to compete abroad without the shelter of compensation that the traditional continental products enjoy, through roughly 70% of the EAGGF appropriations."
"Commissioner, this sector seems to be the hard currency used in preferential agreements with third countries and in the subsequent reviews of their protocols, with the added disadvantage that these countries produce without the economic, social and environmental conditions we have in Europe, but with the same timetables as our own producing areas."
"This situation is neither fair nor equitable, because it is neither fair nor equitable to have to compete abroad without the protection that continental products enjoy."
"Neither is it fair and equitable if the budget neutrality set at EUR 1 900 million in Agenda 2000 is not fulfilled because of internal obstacles and penalties incurred through the regulations."
"In conclusion, I believe this proposal clearly leaves room for improvement, and the report by Mr Jové, whom I most sincerely congratulate, sets the standard for doing so."
"This would be both appropriate and fair."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission' s proposal on fruit and vegetable policy is full of shortcomings and quite inadequate and I should like to highlight four aspects to demonstrate this."
"Firstly, the guarantee thresholds for different types of fruit and vegetable need to be raised with a view to harmonising the real production of the European Union and responding better to levels of demand."
"This is why I would particularly highlight the need for guarantee thresholds to be raised for tomatoes grown for processing in Portugal, which should at least approach the figure of 953 000 tonnes set at the Berlin Summit."
"Secondly, I wish to point out that the level of aid per tonne proposed by the Commission is quite inadequate. I think that what is needed is an increase of the kind proposed by the rapporteur."
"The truth is that the abolition of the minimum price, which is about to end, will result in a considerable reduction in prices paid for produce and we need to ensure that farmers' incomes do not suffer as a result."
"Thirdly, the level of operational funds is also completely inadequate."
"In fact, as the rapporteur proposes, unless the level of financing the funds improves, we will not be able to improve the way in which producer groups work."
"Finally, I wish to say that the Commission has wasted a superb opportunity to make the CAP a little fairer."
"As the Commissioner knows, a sector that accounts for 16% of agricultural production only receives 4%, in fact less than 4%, of the budget."
"The European Union' s fruit and vegetable producers are at the moment basically living from their income from the market, in other words, from what they sell on the market. They suffer the risks and uncertainties inherent in the market and are pitted against fellow farmers in other countries, who produce other products such as cereals, oilseed, beef, milk and so forth, and whose income is guaranteed by the CAP, with no risk to themselves."
"Commissioner, we must put an end to this inconsistency within the CAP as soon as possible."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcomed the report as it was presented to us and I also appreciated the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the position to be assumed by Parliament with regard to both the approach taken by past regulations and the current approach adopted by the Commission and the Council."
"Clearly, this does not take away the fact that there may be - and in fact are - diverging positions, as there will be tomorrow when the vote reflects this, just as there may be approaches which comprise or support calling for amendments."
"It would appear that the Commission and the Council's line takes little account of the methods used to grow certain products with specific characteristics in a specific social environment - as one of the Members who has just spoken also pointed out - with regard to certain sectors: I refer to tomatoes for the processing industry, citrus fruit and also nuts."
"I therefore feel that certain subsidies have been particularly depleted, not only by the general fall in the euro which we have witnessed recently - in which regard it would be appropriate to take action before the situation degenerates into a dispute with the European establishment as a whole - but also with regard to the attitude to be adopted in respect of Mediterranean products."
"Totally justified protests and accusations have been made recently but, at Parliamentary level, there have been some proposals as well: proposals relating to the ceiling on financial assistance, proposals to standardise the benefits due to all producers' associations irrespective of the legal basis, a proposal - which, I feel, must be supported - to continue support for production for longer than the current three year period, and lastly, for specific products, in particular nuts, the proposal for a particularly fair assessment of the aid or subsidies to be allocated."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have great sympathy for the efforts being made by the Commission and the Commissioner to make savings, which is quite justifiable."
"But without wishing to indulge in special pleading, the situation in the fruit and vegetable sector is visibly deteriorating."
"Growth in volume, imports from third countries, fluctuations in consumption - be it in quantity or quality - are the most important reasons for this."
"The situation is becoming more critical, even if it is not as critical as Mr Martinez says."
"For example, you can live very well from 40 hectares in the area I come from, the South Tyrol."
"So it is not quite that bad, but nevertheless ..."
"For example, when you consider that the fruit and vegetable sector is allocated 3.8% of the relevant budget, as compared with the 41% allocated to arable crops, then you cannot help feeling that a decimal point might have been put in the wrong place."
"Unfortunately, the decimal point is in the right place."
"We are talking about just 3.8%."
"This is a handicap that works to the advantage of another agricultural sector, that is arable crops, where there is surely more room for manoeuvre than in the case of fruit and vegetables."
"International trade agreements are to some extent at the expense of this fruit and vegetable sector and therefore benefit other sectors."
"I believe that this additional financial restriction will be hard to cope with and I hope that the Commissioner, the Commission and the Council will have the insight to make sure that a third handicap is not added to the two existing ones simply because of a desire to make additional savings in a particular way here, and that Parliament's wishes and proposals and those of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be taken into account."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I go into the details of the report, I would like to thank both Mr Jové Perez for his report, and the members of the Committee for the time and effort they have devoted to the 61 amendments."
"One thing is clear to me: as with any totally new system, the practical experience that we have gained in recent years suggests that the market organisation for fruit and vegetables must be the subject of a review as well, and it must also be fine-tuned."
"The Member States and the representatives of the sector itself agree with the Commission that there are some key problems that we should solve as quickly as possible."
"That was the reason why the Commission to some extent anticipated the report and brought forward this proposal for discussion without waiting for the final report."
"We concentrated on four areas: the double upper limit for financing the operational fund, the operation of the support system for tomatoes for processing, the level of quotas for tomatoes, citrus fruits and pears, and export refunds."
"But the fact that we anticipated these four areas does not mean that we will not present the report required in the COM."
"We will do that in any case, and will we do so before the year is out."
"However, as I can see from many amendments, you have taken advantage of this opportunity, and in addition to the four subjects brought forward for debate by the Commission, you have also anticipated the final report."
"There is accordingly a certain discrepancy between the Commission's views and what you are proposing here."
"What principles has the Commission been guided by in producing its proposal?"
"In view of the budget situation and the Berlin decisions, any proposal that would have led to substantial increases in budgetary expenditure in favour of a specific sector would have been unrealistic."
"The proposal is therefore based on the principle of budgetary neutrality."
"I am of course aware that appropriations for the fruit and vegetable sector - leaving bananas aside - have fallen since the 1996 reform and that the Agenda 2000 forecasts have also not been fully met."
"Two factors are chiefly responsible for this."
"First, expenditure on support for the operating fund has risen far less than expected, the reason for this being that the number of members in the producer organisations has not grown as much as was hoped, and, second, rising world prices and value of the dollar had to be taken into account when calculating processing aid."
"Finally, the Commission proposal aims at extensive simplification, by harmonising the existing processing rules for the most important products and also making them more transparent."
"For tomatoes, pears, peaches and citrus fruits, individual thresholds for Member States have been set in addition to the Community threshold, and permanent aid is paid direct to the producer organisations."
"One advantage of the proposed amendment is that on the basis of the future aid contribution - which has now been set for an indefinite period - the producer organisations can freely negotiate the price for unprocessed products."
"This will make minimum prices superfluous in future."
"Furthermore, the introduction of a single guaranteed upper limit for contributions to the operational fund will simplify both the creation and implementation of operational programmes."
"With these principles in mind, I would now like to turn to the amendments you have proposed."
"As I see it, they can be divided into three groups."
"The first group consists of general comments on the COM."
"Amendments Nos 1, 2, 44 and 19 relate to strengthening the role of the producer organisations, Amendments Nos 8, 14, 26, 27 and 35 relate to increased support for peripheral regions and less favoured regions, and to trade measures;"
"Amendments Nos 17, 48, 49, 50, 55, 56 and 59 relate to reporting arrangements for the COM."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 4 are about an increase in EU appropriations for the fruit and vegetable sector."
"As I see it, none of these general comments on the COM has any place in the proposal before us, because they anticipate the proposal that we are still considering, and should therefore be discussed in conjunction with this report."
"The second group of amendments are specific requests relating to the functioning of the COM, for example Amendment No 5 on new raw manure, and Amendments Nos 27, 21, 25 and 34 on special support measures for severe crises."
"Amendment No 18 is intended to improve the scope for direct sales, and Amendments Nos 22 to 24 relate to the operational fund."
"Amendments Nos 28 to 30, 33, 36, 37 and 38 concern inter-branch organisations, nuts and withdrawal."
"As with the first group of amendment, the proposal we are discussing today is not the right place for these amendments and I cannot therefore accept them."
"But I do admit that both groups contain some interesting points which the Commission will carefully consider in relation to the reports to be presented by the year end."
"I would like to point out that a proposal to the Council adopted on 5 October already covers consideration of an increase in appropriations for nuts."
"The third group of amendments does relate to the proposal actually being debated here."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 25 propose an increase in Community support via the operational funds."
"The aim of Amendments Nos 31 and 32 is to strike out the reductions in market withdrawal ceilings proposed by the Commission."
"Amendments Nos 67 and 68 address water consumption, and Amendments Nos 9, 11, 15, 16, 40, 41, 51, 53, 57, 60 and 61 in various ways propose increases or changes in processing thresholds and aid for tomatoes, peaches, pears, and citrus fruits."
"Amendment No 39 proposes simplification of the procedure for adjusting new products in the processing sector."
"Amendment No 43 relates to transitional arrangements for tomatoes and Amendment No 12 calls for a study on the abolition of the minimum price."
"Lastly, Amendments Nos 62 to 66 provide for direct aids for producers not involved in processing."
"Most of the amendments in this group would result in an increase in appropriations which in some cases would be substantial, and are thus very much at odds with the principle of budget neutrality."
"I cannot therefore accept these amendments."
"Of course the issue of the overall level of Community financing for this sector is also to be discussed by the Council on Monday."
"I am sure that these discussions will continue, and that this point will also be an important part of the final decision on this proposal."
"In my view, Amendments Nos 41, 53, 67 and 68 would complicate the system rather than simplify it, and the framework system does not cover Amendment No 12."
"However, the Commission agrees with the substance of Amendment No 39, but we will consider how to improve the drafting for legal purposes."
"Amendments Nos 62 to 66 change the existing system in a way that would jeopardise efforts to develop producer organisations."
"In conclusion, I would like to make the following comment. Any delay suffered by the Commission proposal would result in most of the changes due to come into force under this proposal with effect from 1 January 2001 or as from the start of financial year 2001/2002 not coming into effect until a year later."
"The Commission regards this as an unnecessary disadvantaging of this sector."
"That is why this proposal has been presented at this point, and I hope that Parliament will adopt its opinion this week and that the Council will adopt the proposal before the end of the year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Cod stocks in the Irish Sea"
"The next item is the report (A5-0276/2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa)(COM(2000) 190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071(CNS))."
"Madam President, when I first started to consider drafting this report, I wondered whether it was a wise decision for any politician from Northern Ireland to agree to bring forward a report on Box VIIa in the Irish Sea."
"However, I believe that in politics you have to take on board some of the more positive aspects of life."
"While this may have been a poisoned chalice initially, I hope that ultimately, I, Parliament and the Commission can together develop something that will be very positive and fruitful for the fishermen who depend on fishing in the Irish Sea."
"The report is designed to protect juvenile cod in the Irish Sea."
"We have to make it very clear that it is not just designed to protect juvenile cod but also to protect many other species in the Irish Sea."
"That is important."
"The other species in the Irish Sea will also benefit from this protection."
"From that point of view, the one thing that has changed dramatically in recent times is that there is a growing understanding that such protection is necessary."
"Perhaps five years ago if you told fishermen in that particular area that there was a need for this, they would have said there was no need for it."
"Now there would be a more positive response and a recognition that there is a problem, there has been a problem."
"The real question now is how we resolve that problem."
"I welcome the cooperation that has existed between the fishermen, their representatives, the Commission and local, regional and national governments, on this particular point."
"If we are going to find a way forward, that continued cooperation must exist."
"It is positive and has to be built upon."
"It must be developed and brought to fruition."
"But this cannot be a one-way dialogue."
"We cannot have the Commission telling the fishermen that it knows everything."
"The Commission must listen to the fishermen, listen to their experience, listen to what they know, take that on board and work and cooperate with them."
"This report also requires technical changes: to the mesh size of nets."
"It is a very technical report and requires the cooperation of the fishermen with the Commission and regional authorities to ensure that we no longer destroy what was considered a very natural resource in the past."
"In Box VIIa in Northern Ireland three ports are totally dependent on the fisheries industry: Kilkeel, Ardglass and Portavogie."
"Last year the fishermen in that area had an 11-week closure on their fishing rights."
"That was hard."
"But in the interests of protecting the juvenile cod and the spawning period, they cooperated and were very positive."
"I believe there will also be cooperation next year."
"What the fishermen are asking is that the Commission responds to them in a more positive way than it has in the past."
"We have to find a way forward."
"We have to find a resolution to the situation."
"That is no easy task way for anyone."
"I believe we can find a way through and a positive way forward, but only if everyone cooperates."
"I have tried to bring forward amendments which I hope will be helpful."
"I hope the Commissioner can be positive in his response."
"The technical measures should be reviewed on an annual basis."
"That would greatly assist fishermen in that area."
"It is not a burden that is easily carried so we require a review every 12 months."
"I also hope that the Commissioner can throw a life-line and address the socio-economic hardship associated with the proposals."
"Will the Commissioner, if the regional or national governments come forward with a proposal, respond in a positive way and try to find a way forward, to support those fishermen, to improve the technical aspects that need improving, to meet the new standards that have been laid down?"
"This is a very difficult situation."
"It is not an easy one to resolve."
"I ask the Commissioner to respond positively."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin with a variation on a quotation from the poet Heinrich Heine: ""If my thoughts at night to fisheries turn, many an hour will I toss and turn""."
"I might add that if I think about the stock of cod in the Irish Sea, then sleep is truly murdered."
"Vigilance is called for, or do you know the reason why cod stocks, which have for years been more depressed to say the least, have been allowed to reach such a historical low?"
"Is it because of the fish, the fisherman, environmental conditions or society at large?"
"What is the use of integrated coastal zone management, which we will be discussing shortly, when what structurally weak coastal regions need is a new kind of self-image and above all modern jobs?"
"However, this can only work if the problems of the origin principle and of recrimination, powers and responsibilities can finally be solved at all levels."
"Meaningful, technically verifiable measures need to be introduced."
"We need binding sanctions, and we need Member States that exercise their right to check origin, even if doing that hits their pockets."
"In addition, three things are needed: political will, fishermen who think like businessmen, and the interaction of consumers and entrepreneurs in the market place."
"Each of these three strands needs to be underpinned by the same concept - sustainable management of a valuable and irreplaceable food source."
"Those immediately involved are jointly responsible, money alone will not solve any problems in the long term, Mr Nicholson!"
"Nevertheless, technical measures can help nature to recover when it has got out of balance, and, I hope, can help to restock the Irish Sea with cod."
"Unfortunately, our society is inclined to skirt round the law."
"And it is quite simple to do that in the middle of the night in the Irish Sea."
"I believe that with targeted checks and reporting, and a continuous dialogue between those involved at all levels, we can all once again sleep soundly - including me."
"That is why the Committee on Fisheries unanimously supported our feisty colleague James Nicholson."
"We hope that this House, the Commission, and the Council will follow suit!"
"Madam President, rapporteur and Commissioner, this report is a tragic tale about a fish which one author has quoted as literally changing the world in the past thousand years."
"The beginning of this new millennium is very different from the beginning of the last."
"There has been a fishing spree across the world touching everywhere, the Irish Sea being no exception, and the results are devastating."
"The dramatic decline in cod in the Irish Sea is all too apparent."
"From 1988 to 1997 the Republic of Ireland's cod catch declined from 5 821 tonnes to 1 492 tonnes."
"It takes no mathematician to tell you that conservation is critical if there are to be cod fisheries at all in the Irish Sea."
"Before I speak about technical measure, no one has talked about the fish itself."
"Did you know that cod will eat anything?"
"Cod are quite lazy fish."
"The whiteness which we all enjoy eating actually is due to sluggishness rather than muscle tone yet the irony is that cod is a dieter's delight."
"Cod contains only 0.3% fat and boasts 18% protein, and when dried the protein dramatically increases to 80%."
"There is no waste in cod."
"The range of culinary delights a cod provides is extensive - and there are books written about this."
"This report outlines the technical measures which can be used to preserve juvenile cod."
"It deals primarily with mesh sizes and nets."
"The rapporteur does mention compensation, but I say this with some caution: compensation is a slippery slope."
"It can provide short-term solutions for a longer-term problem."
"Sustainable fisheries, where fishermen and their families can survive alongside conservation measures, are mutually beneficial."
"That will allow cod stocks time to replenish in order to ensure sustainable fisheries again."
"Let us make sure that in this millennium people can enjoy cod from the Irish Sea just as much as they did in the last millennium."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Nicholson for the swiftness with which he has submitted his report."
"This will enable us to vote tomorrow on a Commission proposal which very much needs to be implemented."
"I should like, however, to raise a series of questions that have occurred to me regarding Amendments Nos 1 and 2, which ask that the changes in fishing techniques to be adopted under this proposal should be subsidised under the FIFG."
"Although in principle I have nothing against aid to fishermen, I do think it should be granted within a specific framework and in accordance with unequivocal criteria, and this is the basis of my question: to clarify what these criteria are."
"The rapporteur invokes Articles 15 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 in support of his request for aid."
"I think in any case that only paragraph 2 of Article 16 should be invoked, and I should therefore like the Commissioner to clarify whether the requests in the report would come under the text of the said article. If the measures contained in this proposal can be financed under Article 16(2) of the FIFG, this would mean that any technical measure involving a major restriction in fishing activity could be too."
"It must be remembered that by definition any technical measure involves some restriction on the activity."
"I think it is worth making this point clear, because it is obvious that any technical measure means an economic loss for fishermen, either directly or indirectly."
"If this is the criterion that must be followed, it is also clear that if measures such as those proposed are subsidised, then subsidies will also have to be given to any others deriving from a modification of technical measures which would result in changes in the use of fishing techniques or methods, in other words virtually all the reforms under the technical measures regulation."
"Commissioner, I should really like you to clarify this point, seeing that Article 16(2) is open to all kinds of interpretations."
"I should like to know what interpretation the Commission gives to Article 16(2)."
"Thank you, Madam President, and I forgo one minute of my time this evening, which is getting rather long for everyone."
"Madam President, I congratulate Mr Nicholson on his excellent report."
"He pointed out that in order to be effective such measures require the support of fishermen and scientists who live and work in an area."
"This may well prove to be a vital trail-blazer for the strategy of devolved management of fisheries which all of us have been discussing in the context of the reform of the CFP."
"It has become increasingly evident that fishermen and scientists working in a specific fishery will more readily adhere to rules and regulations that they themselves have conceived, rather than Brussels hand-me-downs."
"The major fisheries organisations in the UK - the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations - which, between them represent the interests of 1900 vessels, both support the concept of zonal management."
"Fishermen are also deeply concerned that such rules and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently by fishing vessels from different Member States."
"That is why again, zonal fisheries management which involves all fishermen working in a common fishery will ensure that the rules are applied fairly and squarely across the board."
"This report is timely, as cod stocks are not only diminishing rapidly in the Irish Sea but are in spiral decline around all the waters of the United Kingdom."
"Some years ago when the House of Commons in London drew up an agreement which effectively ended the cod war between the UK and Iceland, it was famously referred to as ""the piece of cod which passeth all understanding""."
"Hopefully this report will mark the beginning of the recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea and will pave the way to the future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to offer my heartfelt thanks to Mr Nicholson for his excellent report."
"At the same time, I would like to reassure him that I am perfectly willing to listen to fishermen, especially as I shall be in Ireland the week after next and will be fostering close contacts and entering into discussions with the fishermen there, and with the entire sector."
"You are already very familiar with this proposal, so I believe I do not need to present it again here."
"I will therefore move straight on to the amendments tabled and I unfortunately have to say that I have some problems with them."
"There are two reasons why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 and 4, which relate to compensatory aid."
"First, this document is about technical measures, and a document on technical measures is not the right place for provisions on compensatory aid."
"Second, and even more importantly, there are Member States who have to decide under Regulation 27/97 whether they will offer fishermen compensatory aid for temporarily withdrawing from fishing activity or not."
"The other two amendments, Amendments Nos 1 and 2, address a future review of the regulation and the Commission finds them difficult for the following reasons: first, the fact that everyone - the Commission, Member States' administrations and also fishermen themselves - want the regulation to come into force on 1 January 2001."
"In my opinion, any delay in this entry into force is to be avoided."
"Second, this regulation was drafted on the basis of the outcome of meetings with fishermen, scientific experts and administrators, and we intend to continue with these meetings for as long as the cod crisis continues."
"This could well lead to a review of the measures and conditions to be put in place now."
"So I ask you to trust us."
"We will observe the review conditions in practice."
"I cannot accept this amendment if the regulation is to come into force as quickly as possible."
"I hope you will understand this."
"Madam President, I listened with great interest to the Commissioner."
"Maybe he could tell me when he is going to visit either the port of Kilkeel, Ardglass or Portavogie."
"Could he respond to that?"
"He said he is going to visit the fishermen."
"I would love to be there with him."
"I would love to accompany him and speak to the fishermen alongside him."
"Can he tell me when he is going to visit those ports?"
"Madam President, I mentioned that I am going to Ireland - and I am also visiting Scotland, by the way - and I have left it to the governments and the various authorities there to put together my programme and also to decide which fishermen I should meet there. So I cannot change that at the moment, but you are more than welcome to accompany me if you wish, Mr Nicholson."
"Madam President, I do not want to prolong this but I have a horrible suspicion that the Commissioner is not going to come to Northern Ireland but perhaps to another part of the island of ""Ireland"" that has nothing to do with Northern Ireland."
"Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom."
"If he wants to come to Northern Ireland to visit fishermen I would be happy to go with him."
"But please do not give me the type of platonic responses you have just given."
"I will not accept that."
"If you want to defend that to the fishermen you can do so, but I will not be part of it."
"Please do not in any way get involved in that type of situation."
"Fishing is something on which we all cooperate, in both the north and south of the island."
"Do not try to make it a political point of view."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Unbundled access to local loop"
"The next item is the report (A5-0298/2000) by Mr Clegg, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on unbundled access to the local loop [COM(2000) 394 - C5-0432/2000 - 2000/0185(COD)]."
"Mr President, colleagues, it is always a pleasure to be debating with each other in such cosy circumstances late at night."
"I certainly did not know when I took on the rapporteurship of something as obscure as local loop unbundling that it would be quite so controversial and so complicated as it has proved nor that our discussions would culminate in such nocturnal circumstances."
"The local loop unbundling regulation is an important piece of legislation which completes unfinished business from the past but also represents an important step forward into the future."
"It completes unfinished business in the past because it is enforcing competition in the final segment of the telecommunications world which until now had escaped earlier liberalising European measures."
"At the same time, by ensuring that access to the local loop - the last mile of so-called copper wire - is now open to all new market entrants and is not the exclusive province of the so-called incumbent operators, the regulation will act as a significant boost for increased choice of non-voice services for consumers."
"It should lower prices for consumers and act as a boost to the take-up of new fancy broadband services and so point Europe very firmly in a dynamic, forward-looking direction."
"As such, it will help fulfil the promise made in Lisbon in March of this year when a number of ambitious targets were set, which, it is said, will help ensure that the gap that has opened between the European Union and the United States in the information economy is closed as soon as possible."
"The procedure we had to follow, in order to act as quickly as possible upon the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit and the proposal of the Commission in July, has been unusual."
"I am told that if we vote on the report tomorrow and adopt our report as voted in the committee it will be the fastest piece of legislation of this type ever processed by the European Union institutions."
"This has only been possible because of an unprecedented degree of cooperation."
"Firstly, cooperation with the Commission - and I would like to thank Commissioner Liikanen and all his extremely good officials who have been working on this for their assiduous help throughout the process."
"They really have provided us all with an invaluable service."
"I would also like to thank the Council for their cooperation, firstly driven by the mandate in the conclusions in the Lisbon summit but also by a particularly effective series of French Presidency initiatives in the Council of Ministers and last and by no means least I would like to express thanks for cooperation within this House."
"I have had the privilege and the benefit of working with a number of colleagues of all groups who have pulled together in the committee to produce the report which we will be voting on tomorrow."
"I would like to thank all of them for the great cooperation which they have extended to me."
"It has not been easy: firstly, because the procedure is difficult, it is new."
"Those of us who have worked on it all agree that if this sets a precedent for the future, we could perhaps consider promulgating some rules which will facilitate this kind of process in the future but also some rules on substance."
"This is a measure which is clearly going to prove to be painful to some of the incumbent operators involved and I understand that a number of colleagues have been in discussions with incumbent operators and I am very grateful to them for conveying their concerns to me and also working with me to find an appropriate way forward."
"We can be proud of the work that we have completed and that I hope we will complete by our vote tomorrow."
"It shows that, even in difficult and controversial areas of policy such as this, this House is able to act decisively and clearly when it needs to and for that I would once again like to extend my thanks to all concerned."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur."
"He has done some excellent work as part of this difficult process, and, taking into account the problems created by this 'fast-track' procedure both for the timetables for the legislative work and parliamentary debate, we should be very satisfied now with the compromise that has been reached."
"What is important for consumers is that the regulation should enter into force immediately from the start of the year."
"The matter is very urgent, as free price competition in local networks is one of the cornerstones of Europe and, more generally the development of the European information society."
"I am particularly satisfied that Parliament, the Council and the Commission were able to work in such close cooperation in this matter and that they treated this complex issue, discussing it constructively, in an atmosphere of understanding that was perhaps unprecedented."
"As Parliament hopefully tomorrow will adopt the report, as I sincerely believe and hope it will, in the spirit of consensus achieved, the ball will then be in the Council' s court."
"Free competition in local calls will benefit users of the Internet in particular."
"The telecommunications monopolies have been charging exorbitant sums of money until now."
"The European consumer has, in the worst cases, had to pay ten times more to connect to the Internet than the Americans."
"Reduced charges will lower the threshold at which people can start to use the Internet in their everyday tasks."
"For example, the limitless possibilities of e-commerce will be within easier reach for Europeans."
"Lowering local call charges will benefit everyone, including those who are not excited about byte-inspired adventures and the Internet."
"National watchdog agencies have an enormous responsibility to see that the telephone companies that enjoy monopoly status really do open the end of the last copper wire to the new companies in the industry."
"It is to be anticipated that some monopolies will try every trick in the book to cling on to their competitive edge."
"This will have to be dealt with severely."
"The monopolies will have to be prepared to pay substantial sums in compensation if they delay opening up their networks."
"Only in this way may we ensure that there is free competition immediately at the start of next year."
"On behalf of my group, I hope that tomorrow' s vote has a positive outcome and then the ball really will be in the Council' s court, and we shall be able to apply the new regulations within the framework of new legislation at the beginning of the new year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to Mr Clegg for his excellent work. He has had a rather extraordinary time of it recently, but, despite all that, I must thank him."
"For the Commission this is an important and very successful achievement, it must be said."
"We have now a record in a field in which developments come so fast that records befit it rather well."
"Opening up local networks to competition is a ""fast-track"" opportunity afforded by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which we are now taking full advantage of, as, otherwise, every day we will be losing money in the shape of exorbitant charges and creating barriers to the process."
"In just a few weeks we in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have dealt with this issue and have, under the leadership of the rapporteur, succeeded in negotiating this proposal with the Commission and the Council, a proposal that must surely be adopted tomorrow without amendment."
"This is my firm belief."
"We have in practice thus discussed the issue simultaneously with the Commission and the Council, as well as amongst ourselves and with many other parties, and now we have achieved this result, which is nothing to be ashamed about."
"Local networks have, I would say, been the greatest bottleneck in the European telecommunications market and now it is being removed, and if it is not, then the national authorities can intervene, and if the prices are not right we then have recourse for compensation."
"Consumers and enterprises have lost millions and millions as a result of too high charges."
"Now charges for telephone calls, fast Internet connections and multimedia services will come down throughout Europe."
"This is just the right measure as far as consumers are concerned, and it will help us too."
"The networks have to open up with terms and conditions that are fair and non-discriminatory."
"That is very important."
"On the other hand, in the parliamentary amendments we have given consideration to the fact that the owners of the network and those who built it should not go penniless: they must receive a fair income for their work and, furthermore, their future investment in the network must be made possible for the future organisation of the infrastructure."
"The problem here of course is that privacy will suffer, as now anybody with the permission to do so can install their own equipment at exchanges and switchboards."
"Thus, the traditional secrecy of the sound telephone is now truly crumbling."
"The auction of radio frequencies, however, is promoting developments in the opposite direction."
"It is pushing up charges to the consumer and has led to something like chaos in the market."
"This is pushing up charges, as I said, and what is going to happen on the fourth and fifth generation mobile front?"
"States are losing their ability to control matters."
"Already things are moving in such a way that an oligopolistic situation is developing, which will result in the market being carved up directly."
"It was the case in Holland, and just recently in Italy, that the number of players taking part in auctions was only equivalent to the number of licences available."
"This is therefore a matter of a sort of private agreement, which means that the market can no longer function properly."
"I propose that the Commission should give an account now, while there is so much data on this, of what all this means."
"This is development in the opposite direction to what we have achieved in connection with this regulation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the opinion of the Communist Party of Greece, telecommunications are a sector of strategic importance and, as such, should be driven not by the quest for profit but by the desire to provide a better universal service."
"As part of the European Union's general policy of opening the doors of every sector of social activity to big business, the regulation which we are examining today gives the monopolies what is perhaps the most important chunk of the telecommunications network."
"This infrastructure, which has taken a long time and a great deal of public money to develop, is being offered for a mess of potage, with the telecommunications organisations receiving no more than maintenance and operating costs in exchange."
"The argument that this will allow new services to develop does not stand up, given that these services can be developed by the telecommunications organisations equally well and, without the strain of having to make huge profits, certainly more cheaply."
"The European Commission and the Council are not content with simply handing local loops to the private sector; oh no, they have to do it, and with what haste, in the form of a regulation which will apply immediately."
"I believe that we can draw useful conclusions from this example as to whose interests the European Union is actually serving."
"At the outset I would like to pay tribute to Mr Clegg who has worked extremely hard over the last few of weeks with a view to ensuring that the final report was well-balanced and reflected the concerns of the difficulties of the various political groups within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I am satisfied that the text voted by the committee takes into account two issues which were of particular concern to me."
"The first one was fair pricing and the second was the provision of a universal service in the context of the further opening of the communications market to competition."
"I believe it is important to ensure that the changes take place in a controlled way, to allow all players involved the time to adjust and to guarantee the rights of all consumers."
"It is clear that we must all support the upgrading of existing telecommunications infrastructures so that we can take advantage of evolving new technologies."
"In my country we are determined that our telecommunications infrastructure be of the highest standard in order to secure new investment into the country."
"Investment in our infrastructure is a critical component to the continued success and growth of the Irish economy; in particular, Ireland is aiming to become a world centre of e-commerce."
"At the same time it is essential that all citizens be guaranteed the same benefits from the upgrading of telecommunications infrastructures."
"The opening-up of the local copper networks to provide competition must lead to all local networks being upgraded in all towns and indeed in all villages."
"We must avoid cherry-picking by new entrants who might wish to upgrade only networks in the bigger urban areas."
"On the question of fair price, the price charge for access to the local loop must be allowed to reflect sunken costs in addition to a margin for reinvestment."
"In this respect I am glad to see that the Commission supports the historical cost formula for pricing."
"We must guarantee that existing telecommunications operators can secure adequate financial compensation for opening these local loops."
"I believe that the national regulatory authority should be able to play a fair and mediating role between existing operators and new networks."
"In conclusion, I believe that it is a fair and well-balanced text."
"I should like to thank Mr Clegg for being prepared to listen to so many of his colleagues."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Lisbon extraordinary European Council set a basic strategic objective for the European Union: that of becoming 'the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world'."
"For this statement to become reality, it must be followed by measures to liberalise the markets, promote competition and thereby open up access for new suppliers of telecommunications services and in particular Internet services."
"In my opinion, the Commission and the European authorities have always been consistent with the Lisbon declarations: I refer, for example, to the proposal for a directive on e-commerce which, with the objective or the excuse of removing a form of discrimination against European producers who distribute information services will, in the end, be penalising the development of e-commerce throughout the whole of Europe."
"This is a matter on which we are, however, moving swiftly and, it would appear, genuinely in the right direction."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Clegg, has done a good job, making the Commission's proposal clearer and more specific and setting out the necessary conditions for that rapid conclusion of the legislative process which so many of us hope for and for which we too will vote tomorrow."
"I would, however, like to take this opportunity to warn the Commission that, once this regulation has been adopted, other obstacles will have to be tackled if the 'last mile' of the telecommunications sector is to be genuinely liberalised as well."
"In my country, Italy, the conditions for the liberalisation of the last mile have existed for a long time, but the national telecommunications authority has delayed practical implementation, in particular with regard to fixing price charges for access to the local loop."
"In the case of Italy, but also other European countries, this is probably due to the powerful position of the incumbent operator, which is trying to put off the move for as long as possible."
"There are parties who have much to lose and, in Italy, there is a conflict of interests between the State as regulator and the State as owner or controller of some of the main telecommunications services companies."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the previous speakers have already said, we are entering new territory with the Regulation on unbundled access to the local loop."
"The accelerated procedure provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam is being used for the first time, that is, there is no second reading."
"The aim of this is to approve the Regulation on unbundled access quickly, so that local telecommunications markets can be opened up to competition by the end of the year."
"Our initial experience with this procedure suggests that it is only suitable in very exceptional cases, but that it is possible with important subjects like unbundled access to take legislative decisions with all due speed here in this House. I am of course particularly pleased about this."
"Without Nicholas Clegg and all his commitment it would not have been possible to consider the regulation so swiftly in committee and here in the plenary and, I hope, to approve it tomorrow."
"He has been able to reconcile varying positions and to present Parliament's views to the Council."
"My dear Nick, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you again very sincerely for your splendid work!"
"Why do we need the regulation?"
"Despite the complete liberalisation of the European telecommunications market since 1998, the ""last mile"", that is the subscriber's link to the network, is at present still in the hands of the ""incumbent"" telecommunications company."
"The regulation is intended to provide for competition in this ""last mile""."
"Only by ensuring that there is true competition in this market segment can we guarantee rapid and low-cost access to the Internet and to multimedia applications in the long term."
"This is not only the dream of every Internet user, it is also an urgent necessity in the era of the new economy."
"The reality in large parts of Europe is at present very different, so that dialling into the net is expensive, telephone lines are engaged while surfing the Internet, surfing is costly, and there are long waiting times."
"According to the latest studies, at the beginning of 2000 only 400 000 Europeans had access to broadband services, compared with 3 million in the USA."
"The European Commission has therefore rightly decided to lend a hand here - and quickly."
"In my opinion there is no other alternative politically speaking but to approve the regulation in its present form and thus remove the final bottleneck."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to Nicholas Clegg also for his hard work."
"To give one light-hearted example, his compromise proposals reached me when I was on the way home on the motorway."
"Of course I pulled over, in accordance with the law, and then discussed them further with him."
"This shows how we worked on this and I think that this was superb."
"We are also willing to do this again in future, but we could do with a bit more time now and again to discuss particular points in still greater depth."
"Our political objective was to enhance competition and so smooth the path to the information society."
"This regulation is intended to achieve a marked improvement in competition in the local access network, with the aim, for example, of giving Internet services better access to the mass market, so that market penetration will increase."
"This initiative will ultimately also help to promote the information society."
"But quicker and cheaper Internet access without content is worthless."
"Above all, the information society must mean investment in people and their skills."
"One important point is that the regulation regulates in the spirit of the original telecommunications liberalisation, that is in an asymmetrical way."
"This has certainly demonstrated its value when it comes to improving competition."
"But this regulation will be superseded in future and we will move on to a new regulatory framework under competition law.In view of that, I would say that Amendment No 13 is particularly important, as it provides for a new Recital 10(a) which emphasises once again that a new regulatory framework will replace this regulation in the not too distant future."
"Of at least equal importance is the fact that the Council is not holding up the telecommunications regulatory package."
"I also trust that the Council will adopt it soon and that we will continue the consultation procedure on the rest of the package quickly and in a serious manner."
"I hope that the Council will not leave us in the lurch should one or other Member State perhaps still have reservations."
"Our work should set an example here."
"We have reached agreement quickly and effectively, and I hope that the Council will follow suit."
"Mr Clegg said in his speech that this was a controversial and complicated piece of work and I think therefore we chose well to appoint him as a rapporteur."
"He has been very unflappable throughout and, on behalf of the House, I would like to record that at the time he was successfully decoupling the local loop, he was also making a very successful coupling of his own, by getting married."
"I am sure that we all pass on our congratulations to him."
"It will not surprise this House to know that, as a representative of the British Conservative Party - and it was the Conservative Government that privatised British Telecom over 17 years ago, probably the first of the large-scale telecom privatisations in Europe - I very much welcome this essential further action to deregulate and open up the market."
"In pushing this forward it has been very important for the Commission to lay the foundations with the telecoms package that we are now considering and we very much admire their ambition and their zeal to do this."
"My only comment, when looking at the slightly loose wording on some of the timing - for example, that notified operators shall from 31 December meet reasonable requests from beneficiaries - is to ask the Commissioner to assure us that he will be very severe in monitoring this, because there is no point in pushing this text through here if we have very slack and loose implementation in the Member States where this also needs to be pushed through."
"Can I also say this that this has been an admirable initiative resulting from the Lisbon summit but a lot of other key aspects concerning moving forward in the new economy were mentioned in Lisbon?"
"Who is going to use all this new low-cost deregulated capacity?"
"We want to see the new entrepreneurs, the new Internet companies coming into the market."
"I remind the Commissioner that one of the other key aspects of Lisbon was the creation of new conditions in the European economy, to get the new investors."
"Can I encourage him with the new spirit of adventure that we see here - and perhaps that is not a word that we always associate with the Commission - to move forward with zeal and vigour to achieve these other aspects of Lisbon with the same effectiveness."
"Can I start by congratulating Mr Clegg on the speed and quality of his work and also welcoming him to this rather exclusive band of Members who so often are here late at night debating telecommunications issues."
"Indeed Commissioner Liikanen's predecessor, Commissioner Bangemann described us once as 'we few, we happy few, we band of brothers'."
"He rather ignored the sisters but I think you get the drift from his Shakespearian quote."
"I should also like to comment on the legal instrument - the regulation - because it is exceptional and historic and there are very special reasons: reasons of speed - post-Lisbon summit - and reasons of technical consistency which I think we all appreciate and understand."
"Parliament must be ready to look at new ways of working, imaginative and, as Mr Harbour says, adventurous."
"But we also must make it clear when such measures are appropriate and it is almost certain that the other parts of this latest telecommunications package are going to take rather longer and will be along more traditional lines."
"I want to comment too on one very important part of Mr Clegg's proposal which relates to the powers of national regulators and powers of initiative, which I think are very important components in the speedy and consistent enforcement and implementation of this regulation."
"Others have mentioned the Lisbon summit and it is of course right to stress that this legislation follows a commitment from the European Union Member States to support the growth and use of the Internet in Europe under the e-Europe action plan."
"Much of this would not happen without this promise to provide affordable, high-speed Internet access and we note the importance of unbundling in the success of the e-Europe plan."
"It is also true that the combined efforts of the Commission, Parliament and the Council have brought about this legislation as part of an overall effort to modernise telecommunications law."
"This effort will bring openness, transparency and competition to the industry while balancing the need for regulation with the desire for liberalisation."
"We have more legislation ahead of us and we have to learn the lessons from so much of the legislation with which we have been jointly involved over many years in the past."
"Then we tried to look backwards, to extrapolate from what we had done, before looking forwards and guessing, second-guessing or third-guessing what lay ahead of us."
"We made mistakes in such a fast-moving and volatile market but I would like to end with the point that if Europe is to stay competitive, to stay in this field, to bring the very real benefits of e-Europe to all the citizens of the European Union, to remain ahead in third-generation mobiles - if I can jump ahead - vis-à-vis the United States of America, it is going to need all our combined efforts to make sure that the total package is safely accomplished."
"Madam President, unbundling access to the local loop is intended to open up the level of competition, providing lower prices for the customer and easier, cheaper access to the Internet, fostering technological innovation in the local access area."
"I welcome these promised developments."
"But as the rapporteur mentioned, many of us have been made aware of the concerns of the local telecommunications provider."
"The Irish telecommunications provider, Eirecom, maintains that it should be allowed a reasonable time period to implement the changes and that the 31 December deadline is practically unachievable."
"Also, charging for unbundled access to the local loop should be fair and adequate to ensure the long-term development and upgrading of the local access infrastructure."
"If it is not financially viable to invest in less populated and less developed areas, it is unlikely to be attractive to new operators."
"When we combine this possible scenario with other measures that adversely affect rural areas, such as the liberalisation of the postal service, which threatens the survival of small rural post offices, and the recent closure of many small rural banks, how will the possible reduction of investment in long-term development and upgrade of local access infrastructure affect already disadvantaged rural regions?"
"It is my sincere hope that none of these concerns becomes reality and that in future we avoid the risk of seriously limiting discussion in Parliament by speeding up procedures on issues that will ultimately have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable."
"Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, behind the somewhat barbaric name of the proposal for a regulation which we are debating this evening, unbundling access to the local loop, an expression moreover which is totally impenetrable for the average citizen, there lies a simple yet serious decision regarding the liberalisation of the local network of voice telephony and data transmission services."
"As we have heard this evening, for some in this House, the closing of the final chapter of a public monopoly can only lead to an automatic reduction in the costs of local communications and this can therefore only be positive for consumers."
"For others, including me, this is far from being quite so obvious and, above all, quite so automatic."
"If unregulated competition always leads to a permanent reduction in prices, and always benefits each and every consumer everywhere, this would have happened long ago."
"Moreover, the example of mobile telephony, which is completely open to competition, proves precisely the opposite."
"Real prices of calls from mobiles continue to be high and the transparency of costs and prices is far from being guaranteed."
"Between the hype and the reality there is not a divide but a chasm."
"Many citizens have fallen victim to this and are unable to pay their bill, and resort to declaring their mobile stolen."
"Nevertheless, I approve of unbundling, but simple, clear constraints need to be worked out in this area as well in order to define the limits, follow progress and lay down terms for the financing of the universal service."
"Our rapporteur and colleague, Mr Nicholas Clegg, has certainly done a lot of work, and I congratulate him on that."
"He has even been open to the arguments of his colleagues, and I thank him for that."
"But he is very liberal and so he has naturally rejected anything that could lead to a genuine universal service."
"He is more afraid of public monopolies than private monopolies."
"I hope, therefore, that the framework directive entitled 'A Universal Service' , for which I was appointed rapporteur in July of last year on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and which I now have to salvage despite the attempts of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, will enable us to redress the balance to some extent."
"Mr Clegg has correctly and very seriously set forth the Commission's proposal on unbundling from a technical standpoint."
"But I am sorry to say that, as I see it, he has not adequately responded to the longer term risk posed for the weaker and the more susceptible players in a deregulated system, and to the risk posed by private monopolies."
"This evening, I repeat once again that, for me, a public service must not be a sink for the market."
"It must be, and it can be, an objective in itself and, for us Europeans, a value and an asset for balanced and sustainable development."
"All things considered, Madam President, as the three European institutions are in agreement on uncoupling, I will not be more catholic than the Pope, and I shall therefore be voting in favour tomorrow."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I have before me the documents we will be voting on this week."
"I think that the most important report is the Clegg report, which has quite simply demonstrated that decisions can be made swiftly and unconventionally."
"I think that this should serve as a model for us in the European legislative process, so that new developments can be responded to quickly, simply and unbureaucratically with the right decisions."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Clegg on having managed to reconcile so many different interests. And I would also like to thank the Commission for complying so efficiently and competently with the Council's request to use the accelerated procedure in this case."
"I believe that we really are taking genuinely forward-looking steps as far as the European public is concerned."
"The public in Europe will feel, in their wallets, in the quality of services and also on the labour market, that these measures have made Europe more internationally competitive."
"We know that UMTS will provide us with a new service."
"The environment and telecommunications will in future play a very special role in international competitiveness."
"That is why I think it is important to create a level playing field."
"This directive in particular demonstrates that we have been very thorough in aiming for fairness, and this has been a model of how to legislate, with a review, with a proper and thorough examination, with all stakeholders being consulted, and, lastly, a good, efficient, swift and precise procedure in the European Parliament."
"Once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks!"
"Madam President, it falls to me to be the one who cries wolf on this occasion."
"I do not normally take a position in this House which is based purely on national considerations but it seems to me that we are attempting to put in place a regulation which is inflexible and does not take into account the position of the market in Ireland."
"The proposal that we have will oblige Eirecom, a private limited company, a former state monopoly, to open up its local loop to alternative providers and will not oblige alternative providers already in the market place such as cable TV, satellite and wireless local loop operators to do the same."
"They are excluded from the scope of this regulation."
"Cable TV companies in Ireland already possess the network and are already gearing up their network to provide telephony, Internet and other interactive services."
"In many cases they operate large and exclusive franchise areas."
"In the case of Ireland, penetration rates by these companies in the larger cities and towns is of the order of 90%, far exceeding those of Eirecom PLC. It is impossible to understand and entirely unacceptable that the proposal does not also encompass these TV cable companies."
"In addition, fixed network operators such as Eirecom will find it impossible to compete with these companies which are providing bundled services to customers, which often include Internet access and free local calls as part of their standard bundle of service offerings."
"Clearly where an alternative competing network coexists with a copper network, either all should be unbundled or none."
"This will be consistent with the stated justification for unbundling put forward by the Commission."
"The regulation on unbundled access to local loop is by its very nature inherently flawed."
"I do believe that worst law is in most cases bad law, and this is the case in relation to this regulation."
"The night sessions are not always the greatest pleasure in the European Parliament but tonight, I must say, it has been an extremely pleasant and positive debate."
"I share the view of those who consider this issue to be historic."
"It is historic in two ways."
"First of all, we will now complete the long march towards liberalisation of telecommunications."
"This also serves the interests of universal service."
"When we increase competition in the networks it will cut prices, improve quality and make the services more affordable."
"It will help to create an inclusive information society."
"Secondly, it is historic in the sense that we have replied to a question which is often asked: Is Europe too slow to act?"
"Are we able to seize the opportunity of information technology?"
"There is a lot of suspicion around."
"Can Community institutions ever make it?"
"If Parliament were to accept tomorrow the Clegg report we would show that we can."
"We can show that we are able to act in Internet time."
"We will have concrete proof, which would increase enormously the credibility of the European Union, especially in the eyes of the younger generation which lives in this age of the Internet."
"None of this would not be possible without excellent cooperation between the institutions."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Clegg, for the excellent work he has done, and also the whole committee."
"It would have not have been possible without profound knowledge of the issue."
"Neither would it have been possible without a strong will to negotiate, with many partners."
"I also thank the Council presidency, which has been very firm and very determined to drive this issue through."
"In many Member States it has been a very sensitive and complicated matter."
"Mr Gallagher and Mr Haarder raised a few issues in this context."
"It really is a key part of the e-Europe action plan to liberalise the telecommunications market to make the prices cheap and the quality of service higher."
"At the same time we must remember that this is one side of the coin."
"On the other side, we need people with skills and qualifications who can use these services."
"So we must continue to invest in the education of all people, young and old alike."
"Insofar as the implementation of this regulation is concerned, yesterday the national regulators had a meeting with Commission officials."
"They agreed to try to accelerate the implementation on this regulation and to do it in as harmonised a way as possible, so as to have a strong European market in this sector."
"The Commission can also welcome practically everything in the report."
"The report is supportive of the objectives and draft measures included in the Commission proposal."
"I should just like to mention three of those."
"First, the aim is to mandate operators not defined as having significant market power in the provision of fixed telephony networks to provide unbundled access to the metallic local loop from 31 December 2000 under transparent, non-discriminatory and cost-oriented conditions."
"Secondly, to ensure transparency by other operators we will have to publish a reference offer for the access conditions to the local loop and associated facilities such as co-location, including pricing, under the scrutiny of the national regulatory authority in order to ensure fairness."
"Here I am happy to note that the national regulatory authorities want to cooperate to make this effective everywhere."
"Finally, the regulations to unbundle the local loop will allow new entrants all types of access modalities where technically feasible, full unbundling and shared access to global loops and sub-loops."
"This maximises technical innovation, greater competition and choice for users."
"The Commission accepts in full all 18 amendments to the Clegg report."
"They improve the Commission's proposal, providing for more accurate technical definitions and more specific requirements of the national players and national regulatory authorities."
"These amendments are constructive and will ensure that the regulation is fully operational."
"Thus they guarantee that unbundling is rapidly and effectively implemented from 31 December 2000."
"The Commission also hopes that the Council will approve the text as amended in the report and hopefully accepted by Parliament tomorrow."
"Then the Council would be able to complete the codecision policy in one reading."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)"
"Statement by the President"
"Madam President, my intervention refers to the situation in the Ivory Coast."
"This week there is no debate on topical and urgent subjects."
"Yesterday it was the turn of the people of the Ivory Coast, after Serbia, to set an example of commitment and the fight for democracy by opposing a military coup d' état and rigged elections."
"I believe you should send Mr Laurent Gbagbo, the winner of the elections, a message of solidarity and support from the European Parliament."
"I shall be very happy to do so, Mr Barón Crespo."
"Vote"
"Draft amendments to Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII of the draft general budget for 2001 concerning the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, and the Ombudsman."
"Before the vote:"
"(The Greens opened yellow umbrellas with the words ""Climate Change"" on them) President."
"That yellow goes very nicely with our blue seats but, even so, I invite you to furl your umbrellas, so that the vote on the budget can proceed with the dignity befitting this Parliament."
"Wynn (PSE), chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"Madam President, as you said earlier, this will be a long process."
"Normally we like to streamline the budget votes so that we can get through them in as quick a time as possible."
"However, we have a lot of amendments on this occasion."
"Whilst I respect people's democratic right to table amendments, can I just warn Members of this House that if some of the amendments which are not in the general framework agreement between the groups are voted, then we will begin to exceed ceilings and we will have to stop the vote."
"We have no margins in virtually all the categories."
"If this vote does not go as we had planned, then just be aware that I may be standing up, or Mrs Haug may be standing up, to say we have to stop the vote."
"We can then assess what we can vote on."
"I would like to make two pleas."
"One is to our colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture who have tabled over 30 amendments."
"The amending letter will be coming forward before second reading and that is when we will take final decisions on agricultural issues."
"If I could ask them to withdraw those amendments it would save a lot of time."
"I would also ask Mr Heaton-Harris and his colleagues if they could withdraw their 33 amendments."
"Once again that will save us a tremendous amount of time."
"I must say the 33 amendments are far better than the 393 that were tabled by Mr Heaton-Harris and his colleagues in committee."
"So we have to be grateful there are only 33, but I would welcome it if he would withdraw them."
"It would speed this process up considerably."
"Madam President, following Mr Wynn's observation about the number of amendments my committee might or might not have tabled, it is fair to point out that this is part of the democratic process and if we are not here to question and raise points, then what are we here for?"
"Madam President, I would point out though that we still have not received an answer to one question, namely whether the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is prepared to withdraw its amendments."
"I would be very interested in this, because it is by far our most serious problem."
"You see, if we accept one single amendment - you know this, fellow delegates know it, I have said it more than once - then we will, as it were, already be in breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement, because we will then have gone over the margin for payments."
"Would you perhaps like to repeat the question to someone from the Committee on Agriculture?"
"Madam President, I understand the rapporteur's objections, but the vote on the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will not only be about money but also about a particular political line."
"The amendments go some way towards making it clear what the Agriculture Committee wants, and unfortunately we do not see ourselves in a position to withdraw them; instead, we will put them to the vote and we will see what the House makes of them."
"We in the Agriculture Committee believe that the views which they express are sensible and we cannot therefore withdraw the amendments."
"I hope that I am also speaking here on behalf of the other coordinators."
"The reply is clear."
"Mrs Haug, I believe you want to present some compromise proposals."
"Madam President, as we do every year and in every budgetary procedure, we will of course have to start by voting on a few additional technical adjustments."
"Last-minute negotiations have been held with all the groups and, in my capacity as rapporteur, I should like to table a number of technical corrections on five points."
"The first concerns line B3-300 on information measures."
"Here the groups have agreed to place 50% against the budget line and to leave 50% in the reserve, and not to put the total amount in the reserve as previously decided."
"The same applies to line B3-306 for the PRINCE information campaign."
"There too we should now like to place 50% against the budget line and 50% in the reserve."
"Where line B5-312 - for the Medicines Agency in London - is concerned, we should now like to pay an additional 1.3 million because we have noted that the Agency now has a heavier workload because of orphan drugs."
"So, we have an additional 1.3 million for the Medicines Agency."
"The fourth line concerns the performance reserve."
"When we decided on the performance reserve in the Budgets Committee we made a technical correction, deleting two lines in this reserve which no longer contained any amounts at all, just p.m. entries."
"These are lines B7-5211 and B7-547. They concern cooperation with the Baltic region and the civil administration in the Balkans."
"The final line in this compromise package for the groups is A-3027. This relates to the International Centre for European Training."
"Here it is intended to place the total amount against the line - so there are no longer any reserves - and at the same time, the appropriations are to be increased by EUR 300 000 to 1.8 million."
"These are the technical changes."
"They have been agreed with the groups, and I would ask you to make the necessary adjustments before the vote on the budget so that we can go into the vote with the package agreed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the administrative budgets are rather less complicated in this respect, but here too we may need to make a technical adjustment, depending on what the House decides today."
"I should like to ask you also to support our making the necessary adjustments to budget line A-206, Acquisition of immovable property, depending on which amendments are adopted, so that we do not exceed our self-imposed ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure."
"I believe that this is customary in the House and I would be grateful if you could support this proposal."
"I have received a motion for outright rejection of the general budget for 2001 tabled by Mr Wurtz."
"Madam President, we already know the result of the coming vote, but we wanted to put down a marker."
"The basic problem our resolution addresses is going to remain with us throughout the budgetary procedure and beyond."
"So, if our fears are confirmed, and whatever the vote today, I just hope all Members who share our ambitions for Europe will join us in the fray."
"I shall put the motion for outright rejection of the draft general budget to the vote. I would remind you that a qualified majority is required."
"(Parliament rejected the motion) - Before the vote on draft Amendment No 19"
"Madam President, we voted in block 1."
"The vote concerns an amendment tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to increase the tobacco subsidy by EUR 5 million."
"Yet, I have noticed that proposals have also been moved here to reduce the budget."
"I fail to see the connection between the two, and furthermore, it escapes me completely that in block 1, this increase was proposed by the Liberals, and that under Amendments Nos 6, 4 and 9, a number of the Members of the same Liberal Group subsequently proposed scrapping the budget altogether."
"Either this is a way of pursuing Liberal politics, where the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, or there is a lack of coordination."
"Surely we cannot vote in favour of an increase one moment and vote in favour of a reduction the next."
"If I am being honest, I feel we are to some extent deceiving the electorate."
"Those comments are no longer appropriate."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 929"
"Madam President, Mr Maat may wish to make the same comment as me."
"You see, we spoke again this morning."
"Amendment No 929, tabled by the Budget Committee, concerns two lines in heading 1b."
"They relate to young farmers and environmental measures."
"I should now like to propose an oral amendment to change these lines."
"We give the young farmers an additional 10 million and take the 10 million to finance this from the environmental measures."
"The effect on the overall budget is neutral, but we would accommodate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Madam President, I can only inform you that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development fully supports the rapporteur' s proposal."
"We have a request to table an oral amendment."
"Is anyone opposed to this amendment being taken into consideration?"
"(As more than 12 members rose, the President deemed the proposed oral amendment inadmissible)"
"Madam President, on the next amendment tabled by the EDD Group, I wonder whether you could give us some clarification, because it is my reading that if we vote for this amendment, it means our travel expenses will be reimbursed at cost, and if we vote against this amendment, then we maintain the present travel allowance."
"I just want to check this is actually the case, because it does change the way people might vote."
"The honourable Members can all read, Mr Heaton-Harris."
"Madam President, this is the fiftieth time that my fellow MEP, Jens-Peter Bonde, has tabled this proposal."
"Could we not give him a program for his computer so that he does not have to write it out every time?"
"It would make his work easier."

"I would like to assure the House that I have signed no amendments."
"I have not joined the Italian delegation for this occasion."
"That will be corrected, Mrs Lambert, and now I propose that we move on to the vote."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 60"
"Madam President, in Amendment No 60 there has been a minor calculation error that should be corrected, which affects the thresholds for pears in the Netherlands: instead of 243 tonnes it should read 279."
"I simply propose this minor correction, if nobody opposes it."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"2001 Budget"
"Madam President, it was with great regret that I had to vote against the budget as I find the items devoted to improving the living conditions of the elderly and pensioners to be totally inadequate, or rather completely non-existent."
"I furthermore note that a significant proportion of these funds have been earmarked for the notorious Community action programmes."
"It is my opinion that these programmes fail to perform the beneficial role that they should in terms of the utilisation of Community funds."
"I believe that the European Union must completely reassess the way in which it spends the monies of the 15 Member States."
"If the European Parliament were a real parliament, and if Europe were something more than a monetary and free-trade area, then the European budget would represent a great deal more than 1% of GDP."
"That kind of budget would be needed to harmonise social security systems and implement coordinated policy on energy and transport."
"It would be funded by the standardised taxation of capital."
"But it is no good dreaming: the Europe of today is dominated by neo-liberal dogma which seeks to reduce state subsidies and the Structural Funds to the strict minimum."
"Instead of controlling the erratic movements of capital, the priority is 'structural reforms' actually aimed at privatising and deregulating anything still left to be privatised and deregulated."
"The real surprise in this budget relates to external actions, where selfishness and stinginess are the rule."
"Europe has a special responsibility to the Balkans and the south of the Mediterranean."
"Contributions that are relatively minor for our richest countries could have a strategic role for peace and development in those regions, yet the choice has been to make significant cuts, which looks like a dangerous policy of burying our heads in the sand."
"That is why we voted in favour of the motion to reject this budget, contrary to the guidelines proposed."
"In the budget vote we have generally voted against the Committee' s proposals to increase agricultural expenses in category 1."
"The reason is that we believe that the EU' s money can be better used in other areas where it is really needed."
"It is not reasonable for approximately half of the Union' s total budget each year to be spent on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products."
"The current Common Agricultural Policy is not only expensive for the Union, but also contributes to higher consumer prices."
"The export subsidies mean that the EU' s food surplus is dumped on the world market at low prices, as a result of which the food industry in many developing countries, for example, suffers serious competitive disadvantages."
"The fact that, in addition, the Union provides subsidies for tobacco cultivation is particularly worth commenting on."
"The EU' s activities and budget should instead be directed towards cross-border problems that the Member States cannot solve themselves."
"The EU' s agricultural policy, in the form of export and production subsidies, should therefore be wound down and, to a certain extent, replaced by subsidies for bio-diversity and environmental measures."
"In the matter of the external measures in category 4, we have chosen to vote according to a line which does not require revision of the Financial Perspective."
"For us, support for the democracy movement and reconstruction of the countries in the Balkan region is one of the EU' s most important priorities."
"It is particularly important to be able to offer subsidies for improving the situation in Serbia."
"To request a revision of the Financial Perspective at this stage would be unfortunate."
"If the budget plan is revised, we believe that there will be a significant risk of the EU' s costs generally increasing, which is not currently acceptable."
"Parliament should therefore act to maintain the Interinstitutional Agreement and to keep the budget within the framework of the budget plan."
"We believe that funds for the Balkans can instead be taken from the programmes in category 4 that are sadly not fully utilised at present."
"Funds can also be released through mobilisation of the flexibility instrument."
"I welcome the recognition in Parliament that although the European Women's Lobby is recognised as a valuable lobby group on behalf of certain women's positions, there are other women's lobby groups that deserve and must receive support, both financially and politically, at a European level."
"No one in the European Parliament would support discrimination or violence against women; we must remember that to deny women a voice is a form of violence against them."
"The Budget Committee ruled again this year that this was a monopoly situation, regarding this fund under A-3037, which is unacceptable within the European Union, and the budget line should be opened up to other women' s groups."
"As things stand the EWL is, and remains, the sole recipient from this budget line for women' s groups."
"Other women' s organisations representing many thousands of European women are thus ineligible for funding and left unrepresented."
"Democracy and subsidiarity are not served by the EWL having a monopoly and control on all of the woman's budget line."
"In the interest of giving fair and equal expression to the voices of European women there must be an end to monopoly funding"
"It is the duty of every elected representative to ensure that the voice of those who are voiceless is clearly heard."
"If the diverse voices of the women of Europe are to be heard, this monopoly funding situation must end."
"We must dedicate ourselves to upholding the European ideals of inclusiveness and democracy and resist the pressure of those groups that wish to maintain an anti-European monopolistic control."
"- (SV) We feel that the ceiling for the budget must absolutely not be exceeded."
"To obtain sufficient economic funds for increased aid to the Balkans, the Member States must reallocate funds from the available budget."
"We feel that, if the Member States have the will, they will be able to find available funds that are not being utilised in the budget being worked on today."
"(IT) The Members of Parliament belonging to the Lega Nord voted against the draft budget not because they oppose the idea of Europe but because they wanted to show their disapproval of the distorted way that this idea is being put into practice."
"If fine words have led the citizens to believe that the Union was attentive to their demands, their requirements and their needs, the vote today has proved the contrary."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will all be aware that the west of Padania has recently been hit by floods, bringing loss of life and substantial material damage."
"While there is unfortunately nothing that can be done to restore these things, aid measures were necessary and it was our duty to provide them."
"But this Parliament, which is always responsive to the needs of communities outside the Union, has shown itself hostile to its own citizens when misfortune has struck, in rejecting the amendments that allocated but a few million euros in their favour."
"That is why we voted against this draft budget."
"Haug Report (A5-0300/2000)"
"I voted against the Haug report, just as I voted in favour of my group' s motion to reject the general budget for 2001."
"First: because the budget of the European Union is not commensurate with the huge economic needs of the Community of the 15, especially of the countries and regions lagging behind."
"Secondly: because the new items for the reconstruction of Yugoslavia - which we need and which should be more substantial - have been found by slashing items for food relief, agriculture, social spending, etc., rather than by increasing the budget, which is what the Member States of the European Union should have done, given that they perpetrated and aided and abetted the destruction of the former Yugoslavia."
"Thirdly: because the budget remains a mechanism for applying a policy which falls short on the social and development side and which has not been reorganised despite constant warnings of the fall in the euro."
"- (SV) As Swedish and Danish Social Democrats, we have today voted in favour of Parliament' s proposal on the EU budget for the budget year 2001."
"The budget creates a reasonable balance between the need for budget discipline and the EU' s opportunities to implement important activities."
"In proportion to the Member States' finances, the Council' s proposal represents the smallest budget for more than 10 years."
"Parliament wants to increase this somewhat, but we still have a good margin to the budget ceiling."
"Nonetheless, Parliament has succeeded in driving through a number of important priorities - especially, increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equality issues, etc."
"We have voted against the right' s attacks on the LIFE programme and the European Women's Lobby."
"We are firmly resolved to find the funds required in order to be able to provide increased aid for reconstruction and democratisation in the Balkans, including in Serbia, now."
"Consequently, we call upon the Council to react positively to Parliament' s initiative for a common and long-term solution before the final decision on the budget is taken in December."
"Revising the budget ceiling for external policy (expenditure category 4) is not an end in itself, but we are prepared to do this if it is required in order to obtain the necessary funds for the Balkans."
"We take a critical view of the scope and direction of the EU' s agricultural policy."
"This needs to undergo more extensive reform in the future, partly in order to provide scope for the expansion of the EU."
"The EU' s agricultural policy is far too expensive."
"We are highly critical of the overproduction of agricultural produce and of the fact that the EU is using funds designated for information purposes to sell this surplus."
"We are also very critical of the extensive subsidy given to tobacco production, which we believe is in direct conflict with the EU' s increased ambitions in the area of public health."
"On this point, we have voted in favour of amendments that aim to abolish the tobacco subsidy."
"We would also like to emphasise how important it is that the implementation of the EU budget is made more efficient, so that we can get to grips with the great backlog that exists in certain areas."
"The budget system, like the methods for openness, auditing and political control, must now be rapidly improved and modernised."
"We, ourselves, have tabled proposals concerning what is known as the Baltic budget line, but have accepted that this will be put on ice for the time being and until such time as an overall solution to the problems within expenditure category 4 has been found."
"However, Parliament has been delighted to accept the Commission' s proposal to establish new budget sub-headings for local and regional cooperation in the Baltic region within the framework of the Phare pre-accession instrument."
"We have also voted in favour of an increase in the budget for twin-town cooperation, which we consider to be an important programme for encouraging cooperation at local level within the Union."
"The budget that Parliament has today approved at first reading could be described as uncontroversial and unspectacular."
"It has to be said that it is a budget that has been improved along the way, thanks to the efforts of the various political groups who have persuaded the rapporteur to revise the inflexible stance that she initially adopted."
"Parliament has been able to rectify, at first reading and without proposing any disproportionate or unreasonable increases, the somewhat reductive approach that the Council adopted in July."
"The funds earmarked for vital sectors of the economy in the Member States, such as agriculture, structural measures and external actions have once again taken on a more fitting scale, and this will enable the Commission to see through its commitments."
"We would also like to welcome the fact that Parliament has shown itself open to an initiative which, in our opinion, warrants the attention of this House."
"We refer in particular to the new pilot scheme to finance information measures in the fight against paedophilia."
"The Budget for 2001 still comprises obscure items that shower funds on a host of associations and cultural centres, the actual need for which is still to be fully proven."
"The review of the Financial Perspectives that Parliament has been demanding for some time in order to honour new commitments in the Balkan region, including Serbia, also continues to cast its shadow on proceedings."
"We realise that this review represents, once all the available instruments have been employed, from the redistribution of funds to the use of flexibility margins, the only way of addressing onerous and unforeseeable commitments."
"However, this revision must not, as is quite possible, result in further substantial cuts in the agriculture sector."
"Our group will strive to ensure that this does not happen and for this very reason has, in abstaining from the vote, adopted a cautious position on the Haug report that accompanies the 2001 Budget."
"Ferber Report (A5-0292/2000)"
"- (SV) Where travel expense refunds for Members of the European Parliament are concerned, we maintain our view that refunds must be made only for actual costs incurred for travel on official business."
"We have therefore voted in favour of Amendment No 3 from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, where this is required."
"The Left party supports the idea that the work in progress for a new statute for Members should lead as quickly as possible to a solution in which refunds of travel expenses also reflect the actual costs."
"That is the solution to the problem - not unhelpful comments on the budget."
"- (SV) The community sector in the Member States has been subjected to major cut-backs for a number of years."
"In this connection, it is depressing to see that, within the budget of the European Union, there is an incredible amount of unutilised resources and that, in certain cases, resources are being downright squandered."
"If the European Parliament were now to abolish its Friday sittings in Strasbourg, for example, this would save EUR 1 million."
"The European Parliament is also pushing hard for contributions to European political parties to be introduced."
"It is interesting to note that the EU parties are clearly incapable of inducing either their member parties or the individual members of the member parties to pay a fee for membership of the EU party. Instead, we are forced to finance the EU parties with public funds."
"That, if anything, demonstrates the low level of motivation that this EU project has, even among politically active citizens."
"Otherwise, we make a reservation in respect of the great outflow of funds that is taking place in the EU via agricultural subsidies, regional subsidies, operation of the Economic and Social Committee, etc. The public funds that are being spent by the EU can be better used in the Member States."
"Rühle Report (A5-0251/2000)"
"We have naturally voted against the budget for the ECSC, which until the ECSC Treaty expires will continue to rain down subsidies on shareholders in the iron and steel industry."
"Considerable sums have already been awarded to the bosses in this sector, allowing them to diversify into juicy new sectors, while many workers - whose jobs have been eliminated - are still unemployed."
"Although this draft envisages devoting a certain amount to social assistance, no precise figures are given, while the minimum guarantee should be full salary up to retirement age for all workers affected by future redundancies."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the ECSC Treaty will soon expire."
"Nevertheless, in Germany there is a compromise solution for coal which will run until the year 2005."
"I am assuming - and I hope that the Commission will contribute appropriate constructive solutions - that we will have a transitional arrangement to fill the three years between 2002 and 2005."
"But for the time after 2005 I should like to make it quite clear that there can be no 10% energy base in the EU Member States which is exempt from all supervision by the European Union's competition authorities."
"This is no solution for the future."
"This solution would damage the European Union's competition policy and at the same time make energy more expensive - on top of the effect of promoting renewable energies - which would in the end harm Europe's desirability as a business location."
"Clegg Report (A5-0298/2000)"
"Madam President, Ms Giuseppina Cardazzi, who is elderly and infirm but interested in electronics and the Internet, particularly as she is not mobile, asked me to help her understand electronic communication as she wanted to purchase a device that would enable her to access the Internet."
"She asked me whether, since she had little money as a result of having to spend a lot on medicines, it was possible to access the Internet for free."
"I told her that it was, and it is for this reason that I voted in favour of the Clegg report, as it enables one to access Internet sites by connecting up to the existing network at a reduced cost."
"The arguments for promoting competition imply yet another attack on the public telecommunications sector in an area of basic services that are vital to the public, without any corresponding improvement in the public service provided."
"As the report states, unbundled access to the local loop allows new entrants to compete with notified operators in offering high bit-rate data transmission services for continuous Internet access and for multimedia applications based on digital subscriber line technology as well as voice telephony services, using local network infrastructures that have already been installed by other operators, generally public service operators."
"Furthermore, the haste with which this liberalisation of the highly profitable telecommunications sector is going ahead, following the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit, does not augur well for the protection of consumers' interests or the interests of people working in the sector. This is another reason for voting against this report."
"We are voting against this report even if it does seem a mere formality in the process of the liberalisation of telecommunications."
"The amendments add nothing, apart from some further praise for the alleged virtues of competitiveness."
"What 'unbundled access to the local loop' actually does is force public operators to put the leasing of public telephone lines out to commercial tender as soon as possible."
"So 20 to 30% of the contracts will again be offered to private competition."
"Many have already anticipated this directive, like France Telecom."
"As well as the new constraints imposed on staff, particularly in the commercial services sector, inequality in the treatment of users is going to get worse."
"The regulation of the sector by the law of maximum return will result in the creation of profitable and less profitable areas in the territory covered."
"A high quality European public service must be imposed, to include mobiles phones and the Internet, to meet the basic needs of employees and users."
"That policy would put a stop to the generalised liberalism that is thriving under the French Presidency."
"The liberalisation of telecoms is already very far advanced in the countries of the EU."
"Now a further part of the network infrastructure is under discussion: the connection of market entrants and customers to the data transmission network."
"This is the next logical step in the deregulation policy hitherto."
"But, precisely because we are dealing with the local loop, customers' interests need to be taken into particular account."
"This being the case, a ""basic supply"" must also be guaranteed in this sector to all members of the public by extending the companies' Universal Service Obligations. For example, included in the Universal Service Obligation could be ""normal Internet connection"" by 2002 and a high-speed Internet connection by 2005, with minimum requirements for quality of service, consumer protection and content on offer and special tariffs for particular groups of society (the disabled, those receiving benefit or on a low income, those who live in outlying regions, and so on)."
"Since this is not guaranteed in this report, I voted against it."
"Jové Peres Report (A5-0273/2000)"
"Madam President, in this case, too, it was with deep regret that I had to vote against."
"Why was it, especially in my capacity of representative of the Pensioners' Party that I voted against?"
"It was because for some time now the tables of my elderly friends have been devoid of tomatoes, peaches, pears, oranges, lemons, grapefruit and so forth. The Mediterranean diet, so well-known in Italy, is disappearing."
"Why?"
"Because the European Union is incapable of promoting the development of the cultivation and marketing of fruit."
"It is my belief that we must totally change our quota system and at last resolve to provide aid to any farmer who wants to increase their agricultural output."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted against a report that would remove the subsidies paid to the producers of processed fruit and vegetables."
"Instead, we support the Commission' s proposal that would rescind onerous administrative procedures and make the schemes simpler and more flexible."
"The Commission has actually been friendly towards the producers."
"It has proposed a minor restriction on the great 'help yourself' buffet table that the scheme has been to date."
"We therefore support the Commission' s efforts at reform and oppose further preferential treatment of this sector."
"On the pretext of resolving a number of questions relating to fruit and vegetables, the Commission is proposing serious amendments to the regulations in question, even before the report has been finalised on the results of the previous regulations, which entered into force as recently as 1997."
"The Commission' s argument that these amendments regulate individual matters is completely hypocritical and misleading, given that the proposed amendments change the entire Common Organisation of the Market in processed fruit and vegetables, making it much worse for small and medium-sized farmers and much better for the trade and industry and the multinationals."
"With processed tomatoes and peaches, it is using direct aid to producers as an excuse to propose abolishing the minimum price."
"This price may not provide satisfactory protection for producers, but it is nonetheless a minimum safety valve."
"Instead of proposing to enhance it and hence provide an efficient guaranteed agricultural income, the Commission is proposing to abolish it, leaving trade and industry free to step up their exploitation of farmers and trample on the fruits of their labours."
"In addition, instead of proposing a substantial increase in quotas, the Commission is proposing to replace them with a system of thresholds so that, with subsidies rendered worthless by joint liability fines, farmers will be lured into producing quantities in excess of the thresholds, which the trade and industry will take as and when they please."
"Obviously, the quantities in excess of the thresholds produced by farmers will not have a ready market or a minimum price and will become another weapon in the hands of the trade and industry, which will blackmail farmers and set the price for the whole quantity, even the quantity below the threshold, at ridiculously low prices."
"The quotas and the thresholds are like Scylla and Charybdis and to change them is to jump out of the frying pan into the fire."
"Add the unacceptably low national thresholds which decimate subsidies to the proposed reductions in withdrawals to 5% for citrus fruits, 8.5% for apples and pears and 10% for other fruit and vegetables in marketable quantities, and it soon becomes clear that there will be no way of disposing of very large quantities of processable fruits and vegetables with the result that overall prices will drop and the crops will be left to rot in the fields and in the cooperative packaging shops, forcing farmers to uproot their crops."
"Finally, the Commission has lost no time in taking advantage of cyclical increases in international prices for processed fruit and vegetables during the last marketing year to set subsidies at low levels, subsidies which will apply for several years, i.e. until the next time the regulation is amended."
"The proposals for fruit and vegetables are part of the more general, anti-farming direction which the EU is taking, now that it has decided to persecute farmers."
"This persecution hits the produce of small and medium-sized farmers in the south particularly hard."
"What we need are not attempts to improve on disastrous proposals, as Parliament's report endeavours to do."
"We need to reject these proposals wholesale and without equivocation and to call firmly for agricultural policy to be revised for the benefit of the farmers and the countryside."
"In a bid to safeguard industrial peace in urban areas, the price of the food package has been kept artificially low for dozens of years now."
"The only way farms could survive was to scale-up and undergo mechanisation."
"That made them heavily dependent on loans."
"There is a lot of money about in the agricultural sector these days, but that does not appear to be a guarantee for a good income or safeguard the future of the business."
"My colleague Mr Salvador Jové is only too aware of the bad position which southern European small farmers and farm labourers find themselves in."
"Within the existing structure of extensive agricultural subsidies, he is looking for a majority to reach a compromise which will do more to safeguard the chances of survival of this group of farmers."
"I support his view, as long as this results in income support for those on incomes which are too low."
"If I were to have my way, I would invest less funds in agriculture but within this sector, give more to the poorest."
"This line of thinking is at odds with the idea that Europe should collect more taxpayers' money to subsidise the richest and most profitable businesses."
"The growing Dutch glasshouse horticulture, which yields a large volume of vegetables, fruit and flowers in a small space, is in a much stronger position than cereal or dairy farms."
"Since it appears from Appendix III that glasshouse horticulture does not benefit from the proposed subsidy scheme for vegetables and fruit, I am putting my objections on hold for the time being."
"I voted in favour of this report because it lives up to the expectations of Portuguese organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector, which have called for a drastic overhaul of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables, which they consider to be extremely damaging to our national interests."
"The loss of 7% of the tomato quota this year and the risk of losing more than 10% of the remaining quota next year have made a revision of this COM before the end of the year crucial for Portuguese farming."
"The present report puts forward amendments on a range of points that address the interests of European production in general and of Portuguese production in particular."
"These are: the inflexibility of the current system for processed tomato-based products, the quantity levels guaranteed for processed tomato, pear and citrus-based products, the complexity of the operational fund system and the management of export refunds."
"It is now absolutely vital for the Portuguese Government not to give in and for it to staunchly defend its specific national interests on each of these points."
"Indeed, it would be quite grotesque and humiliating if the European Parliament' s stance were firmer and more beneficial to Portuguese interests than our own government's!"
"Nicholson Report (A-0276/2000)"
"Madam President, it is a well-known fact that I am highly responsive to all measures concerning the harvesting of various species of fish, measures which by enlarging the holes in fishing nets allow smaller fish to survive, live longer, grow old and potentially become pensioners too."
"However, this is only one of the reasons why I did not vote against this measure."
"Why?"
"I abstained because I feel that in this case, as Mr Bushill-Matthews and the English Members have said, there has been a lack of subsidiarity."
"This is a fishing issue that concerns the British, the Belgians, the French and the Irish."
"I fail to see why they cannot be left to reach a decision on their own concerning their fish and their fishing."
"Cushnahan Report (A5-0284/2000)"
"Madam President, among my many elderly friends in Italy and elsewhere there is one Chinese man."
"This pensioner, who lives in Hong Kong and to whom I read Mr Cushnahan' s report said that it was a wonderful report which covered everything, but failed to say anything about the situation of the elderly in the special administrative region of Hong Kong."
"It is for this reason that despite having approved this document, I wanted to emphasise in the explanations of vote that next time it would be a good idea to survey and take into consideration the situation in which pensioners in Hong Kong find themselves compared with pensioners in the Peoples' Republic of China, in order to see whether this reunification has been advantageous or detrimental to them."
"Johan Van Hecke Report (A5-0296/2000)"
"Madam President, it is very important for the European Union to concern itself with the inhabitants of ACP - African, Caribbean and Pacific - States."
"Personally, as the representative of the Pensioners Party, I am concerned at the situation of the elderly in these countries."
"I have to say that despite approving of the contents of the explanatory statement on page 20, and thus of the need for initiatives for programmes concerning education, poverty alleviation and the capacity-building of democratic institutions, the proposal unfortunately makes no reference to this point."
"I believe that we can only help these states if we improve the conditions in which all their inhabitants live, be they young people, workers or members of a group very close to my heart, the elderly people and pensioners who live in the ACP States."
"It is extraordinary that the EU is reviewing its cooperation with the ACP countries involved in armed conflicts."
"It is important to ensure that aid funds are not used for military purposes."
"However, the Member States must have the opportunity to provide support for building up democracy in dictatorships, both bilaterally and through the Commission."
"It must be possible to provide education in good administration in order to counter corruption and, in the same way, to support opposition parties."
"We cannot therefore support Paragraph 4, which states that aid can only be granted on condition that the country in question has a good administration and respects human rights and the principles of the constitutional State."
"Moratorium on the death penalty (B5-0804/2000)"
"My position on the death penalty today is exactly the same as it was in 1981 when François Mitterand courageously declared his opposition to it while standing for president and then abolished it once he was elected."
"I was already against it back in 1981."
"I am certainly still against it in 2000."
"While I can certainly understand the feelings and reactions of the families of victims of what are often appalling crimes, a government cannot answer barbarity with barbarity. It has no right to do so."
"Besides, we know the death penalty is not a deterrent, it is quite unacceptable for countries claiming to be civilised (like the United States) to continue applying it in a wholesale and systematic manner, running an immense risk of making irreparable legal mistakes."
"That is why I have voted in favour of the call for a moratorium."
"Moreira Da Silva Report (A5-0270/2000)"
"The problem of global warming caused by concentrations of gases in the atmosphere which exacerbate the greenhouse effect, such as carbon dioxide, is taking on explosive proportions."
"It is only three years since the Kyoto Conference and the European Environmental Agency estimates that, if emissions in the EU continue at present rates, instead of an 8% reduction in emissions of CO2 between 1990-2010, there will be a 6% increase, while in the USA the outlook is even worse."
"The root of the problem lies in the fact that everything, including the quality of the environment and the climate, is sacrificed to capitalist exploitation of wealth-producing resources and excessive profit."
"Consequently, what could be more natural than calling for those who caused the problem to pay to resolve it?"
"The Commission communication should have been entitled differently, given that it contains no specific policies or measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases; on the contrary, it confines itself, as the rapporteur rightly comments, to merely producing an organisation chart and a vague list of common policies and measures."
"It restates the position that energy taxation or a tax on fossil fuels are the mainstay of the EU strategy to reduce greenhouse gases."
"We disagree with this measure because, whichever way you look at it, the 'polluter pays' principle is a hypocritical principle and its distorted application will ensure that the entire cost of reducing emissions is passed on directly to consumers, i.e. to the workers."
"Given the tremendous pressure to find a solution, one might well discuss the imposition of an energy tax on fossil fuels, but only as a measure to complement an integrated policy of measures to reduce CO2 emissions and on the strict condition that the revenue from this tax is used solely to relieve the burden on workers."
"We stand by the view that the cost of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases should be paid for by the real polluters (i.e. large-scale industry) out of their excess profits."
"We also agree with the rapporteur' s view that clear priority should be given to renewable energy sources and to giving support to public transport."
"We are also totally opposed to the immoral and inefficient system of emission trading between companies and countries."
"We fail to understand how it is possible to create an entire market which trades in pollution as a commodity and on which, instead of reducing their own CO2 emissions, some companies buy in surplus coverage from other companies which are within their limits."
"Of course, in a capitalist system in which everything can be bought and sold, this is bound to happen."
"Although opposed to the Commission communication, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece appreciate the rapporteur' s positive comments, which is why we opted to abstain rather than vote against the report."
"Global warming and extreme weather conditions are increasingly caused by industry, agriculture and transport."
"Despite this, the governments of the richest countries with the highest emission levels of fossil combustion products have failed to bring about a drastic reduction in these emission levels."
"The rapporteur is right to point out that the European Commission' s original proposal is inadequate."
"Kyoto' s guiding principle was that the rich countries would keep their own atmosphere clean, although they were allowed, up to a point, to add the emission which they were helping reduce elsewhere to their own table of results."
"The Member States themselves will need to drastically reduce their emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases by focusing on renewable energy, public transport and reducing traffic levels."
"The boom in the cheap transport of goods by road mainly leads to the polluting industry being relocated from the richer to the poorer countries."
"Nuclear energy is not an alternative because that too adds to global warming, emits greenhouse gases and leaves other waste products behind which hardly degrade."
"I fear that the forthcoming climate conference will be exploited as an opportunity to moderate the previously agreed commitment to reduce emission levels by 5.2% in the rich countries."
"The trading of emission rights may be interesting as an experiment, but it is not a viable solution."
"Moreira Da Silva Report (A5-0271/2000)"
"We are in favour of any tax or levy on the big industrial companies that are largely responsible for pollution in general, and atmospheric pollution in particular."
"However, we have abstained, not just because of the derisory nature of the tax envisaged, but primarily because of all the loopholes, which are likely to turn this tax into a modest subscription granting the right to pollute."
"Genuine prevention of pollution calls for restrictive measures as far-reaching as confiscation of a polluting company, which no company can wriggle out of."
"But beyond immediate measures, atmospheric pollution is a world problem which concerns the whole of human society. It can only be dealt with satisfactorily by a society which has control of its economy and is not solely driven by thirst for private profit."
"I am very keen to present my explanation of vote on this report, an explanation of what was in fact a vote in favour, because I would like to ask you, Madam President, in much the same way as I am asking myself, whether we are entirely sure that the climate changes that we are seeing have been caused by man, by industrialisation and by the emission of substances into the atmosphere."
"One or two millennia ago, when industry did not exist, were there not earthquakes, torrential rain and other assorted disasters?"
"When, Madam President, was the great flood?"
"How much industry and how many cars were there then?"
"I would therefore like to us to consider whether these climate changes really can be laid at the door of industry and the way we live today."
"The fact that Parliament is dealing with the causes of climate change on our planet is important."
"This really is a serious issue in the very short term, and it concerns all of us, both because we all breathe the same air, and because of the storms, excessive rainfall and water shortages affecting every continent to a varying degree."
"The developed countries doing the polluting and the less developed or underdeveloped countries about to do so must be made aware of the situation."
"So anything that can raise public awareness is useful and a step in the right direction."
"That is why our resolution is important, and I have voted for it."
"The fight against the greenhouse effect is a major challenge for the industrialised countries and constitutes a specific duty in respect of the peoples of the developing world who are already paying for the consequences of global warming."
"Accepting the establishment of a market in carbon dioxide emissions at international level amounts to letting western countries duck their responsibilities by purchasing fictitious Russian emission rights or financing projects in southern countries that are completely inconsistent with their development needs, without any means of checking actual reductions in emissions."
"Pollution is not merchandise."
"If it becomes a source of profit, the door will be opened to every abuse."
"The draft resolution proposes to ratify the establishment of such a system, when 'the technical and legal aspects have not yet been investigated' and 'the functioning and effectiveness of the system must be tested' ."
"No controls or sanctions are proposed."
"Moreover the development of nuclear energy and carbon sinks must be excluded from the calculations for the reduction of emissions."
"If the European Union is to respect its commitments it must adopt an ambitious European programme for combating the greenhouse effect without delay - and on a completely different scale from the motion for a resolution in terms of policies and measures."
"In particular, action in the transport sector must be taken into account."
"Lund Report (A5-0197/2000)"
"Madam President, I have to say that I abstained from the vote on Mr Lund' s report."
"I abstained because I noted that in this report, just like many others, insufficient attention is paid, and an inadequate commitment made, to research. Such is the case with this report, which aims to combat endocrine disorders."
"In my home city of Bergamo, many people are suffering from a thyroid disorder the cause of which is still unknown."
"This money should be spent by bringing into line and coordinating expenditure on research policy in all the 15 Member States of the European Union."
"We have to tighten the purse strings and only spend what is necessary."
"In summary, the resolution on endocrine disrupters adopted a moment ago illustrates that far too little is known about the harmful effects, that the European Parliament would like to see more research done and that measures need to be taken on the basis of the precautionary principle."
"Although I have voted for the resolution, I would like to make a few minor observations."
"I share the rapporteur' s opinion that the arguments in this discussion must be based on fact."
"However, I do not share his view that the measures need to reflect the concern among the public."
"The average citizen will in most cases be unable to make an adequate risk assessment."
"In modern society, with all its consumer goods, such as appliances, we need materials and substances with very specific characteristics."
"Everyone, or nearly everyone, accepts and uses these products."
"The substances and materials in these products, however, do carry a risk."
"As everyone knows, life is full of risks and uncertainties."
"The trick is to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a judicious manner."
"Science has still not proven beyond reasonable doubt that there is a direct link between these chemical substances and changes in human hormone levels."
"That does not detract from the fact that I am delighted with the interest in this topic."
"The possible effects of these substances are not insignificant."
"If these chemical substances really cause an increase in certain types of cancer, reduce fertility or threaten unborn life, something has to be done about it."
"Human life is worth protecting."
"Out of precautionary considerations, it is useful to be clear about these substances."
"Pursuant to the precautionary principle, the possible harmfulness of dangerous substances, materials and products should be given scientific substance."
"Both restriction and acceptance of a certain risk are important in this context."
"I do not much like the idea of simply banning substances in a bid to rule out every possible risk."
"This opens us up to the risk of a witch hunt being unleashed on all kinds of substances without any scientific basis."
"The reversal of the burden of proof is not appropriate either."
"To apply the precautionary principle correctly, we also need to know what the harmful effects are of any of the alternatives."
"- (EL) Generally speaking, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece agree with the main elements which need to be included in the sixth research programme because all the original objectives, such as setting up committees, developing tests, improving monitoring of endocrine disrupters (ED) in the environment etc., are steps in the right direction."
"However, we should like to highlight the need for a generally acceptable definition of endocrine disrupters, which we feel should include the effects of radiation (accidents, radioactive waste from peaceful or military applications, without impediment and without restricting the access of official scientific teams to industrial uses)."
"There can, for example, be no doubt that the effects of radiation cause cancer of the thyroid, as in the case of the depleted uranium bombs used in Yugoslavia."
"We also need to define a more specific framework for research, standardising tests and cooperation between various scientific teams so that reliable results can be achieved."
"We also need to safeguard and strengthen efforts to identify substances which are suspected of being endocrine disrupters, perhaps within a legislative framework."
"Awareness-raising campaigns directed at the public, at consumers and at people in professions which are at risk of exposure to endocrine disrupters (farmers, industrial and other workers) must be a basic concern if these efforts are to be a success."
"Similarly, we need to activate the principle of prevention contained in Article 130Ñ of the EU Treaty (in order to control and withdraw known or suspected endocrine disrupters and develop alternative harmless substances)."
"Adopting a resolution on a Community strategy on endocrine disrupters is the minimum we should do on a complex subject for which no regulation exists."
"Listing and studying the phenomenon of disruption of the endocrine systems of men and animals, validating the studies, and demonstrating the causal links between certain products and certain anomalies found in humans and animals (decline in fertility, certain malformations, certain cancers), is a necessary point of departure as long as it respects the precautionary principle and at the same time promotes a need for transparency totally absent from the text."
"The fact is that private and public decision-makers will not act unless obliged to do so by public opinion."
"The lists of products suspected of being endocrine disrupters must be made known to the public and health professionals, as and when new ones are discovered."
"While studies must be conducted to find out about the dangers of endocrine disrupters, firms using suspect products must also be made subject to regulations applicable to drugs, especially in terms of furnishing proof that these products are harmless, whenever they are considered suspect by the European groups of experts."
"So an arsenal of restrictive regulations is urgently needed to make it possible to ban such products in the years ahead."
"That concludes voting time."
"Retail payments in the internal market"
"The next item is the report (A5-0283/2000) by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on retail payments in the single market [COM(2000) 0036 - C5-0103/2000 - 2000/2018(COS)]."
"Madam President, by 2002, every citizen in the euro area will have euros in their pockets and expect certain benefits from this new currency."
"These benefits will not just appear out of nowhere. We will need to work on those."
"I would like to see the Commission communication on retail payments in that light."
"What should we all do to ensure that the European citizen, who has relinquished his own familiar currency, will actually benefit from this new currency?"
"We simply need to make transfers cheaper, quicker and safer."
"I therefore expect the Commission simply to transpose the recommendations to change the 1997 Directive, which I made in my report on behalf of Parliament, to a formal amendment to the directive without delay."
"What is it about?"
"At the heart of the matter lies the fact that transferring small amounts still leads to major frustration in SMEs and among individual citizens."
"This frustration is the result of the high charges and length of time involved."
"This leads me to conclude that the effect which the 1997 Directive had was inadequate."
"We need to go further."
"The consumer and SME do not benefit enough from the internal market which was completed following the introduction of the euro."
"One solution which this report offers is that the infrastructure of these cross-border credit transfers must undergo a thorough overhaul."
"It appears that at present, a number of actions are still carried out manually, which leads to high charges and extended handling times."
"I therefore call on the banks to take all the necessary measures in the shortest possible time, so that cross-border credit transfers can be carried out fully automatically and thus become a great deal cheaper."
"In my report, I have listed systems such as IBAN, SWIFT, STEP 1 and IPI."
"These systems can make payments between banks in different countries easier, quicker and cheaper, provided that the banks talk to their customers and make it clear to them that in addition to the permanent VAT number, their IBAN code should now also feature on their letter-headed paper."
"In order for this standardisation process to work, we need coordination."
"That is why we have tabled an amendment which urges the European Central Bank to assume this coordinating role very quickly, based on its responsibility for payment systems, such responsibility being imposed on the Bank by the Treaty."
"We would ask the European Central Bank to do two things."
"Firstly, to develop a European standard format for data transmission."
"This could be done very quickly, for that format already exists."
"This is to replace the national format which is already widely in use."
"Secondly, to create a European bank number, like the IBAN, for example."
"It is vital that such harmonised formats are used universally in the euro area."
"We might need to consider introducing them as a compulsory requirement if this is not done sufficiently promptly."
"As I have stated in my report, this automation and standardisation process should be in place three months before the introduction of notes and coins."
"That would be ideal."
"However, the banks keep maintaining that this is impossible."
"By way of compromise, I have proposed an amendment in this respect which states that the banks must be ready by 1 January 2002."
"In this way, as soon as the public actually gets to handle the euro, they can straight away benefit from the change in cross-border credit transfers."
"The banks alone cannot reduce the total cost of transfers more or less to the level of the cost price for domestic payments."
"They need the help of the Member States."
"After all, banks have so far been obliged by the Member States to notify their central banks of any cross-border payments over EUR 12 500, for the benefit of balance of payment reporting statistics."
"This notification procedure cannot be standardised and is therefore carried out manually."
"A very costly matter indeed which will be rendered completely redundant in one market with one currency."
"After all, they do not keep records in France of how many francs leave Paris for Auxerre, so why should we?"
"Moreover, volume and number of retail payments only form a small percentage of the total number of credit transfers."
"Your rapporteur is convinced that there should not be any objections to abolishing the report duties up to the full amount stipulated in the directive, namely EUR 50 000."
"The loss of data for balance of payment reporting statistics brought about by this change is minimal."
"A change related to this is that the money-back guarantee must be increased to EUR 50 000."
"At present, banks are almost rewarded when they lose your money."
"If you transfer EUR 30 000 and the bank loses that money, it only has a duty to pay you back EUR 12 500."
"Banks should of course not lose any money at all, and they must stand surety for their organisation."
"This is why we propose increasing the money-back guarantee limit up to EUR 50 000, the amount stipulated in the directive."
"According to the banks, nothing ever gets lost, so that can never be an issue."
"On a final note, I would like to give consumers more options to transfer money."
"I am thinking of insolvent consumers or consumers with no bank accounts."
"I would ask the European Commission to investigate whether companies such as Moneygram and Western Union could also fall within the scope of the second Directive on banking."
"As a consequence, these companies could have their base anywhere in the European Union, even though they are not banks."
"Needless to say, these companies will be subject to the same strict conditions in terms of security and money-laundering."
"I hope that this report will encourage banks sufficiently to continue on their path of innovation towards better functioning, cross-border credit transfers."
"But in order to grant banks absolute certainty and clarity in their heavy investment programmes, I am expecting the Commission to change the directive by return of post."
"Madam President, since the borders between the Member States of the European Union were opened, an increasing number of firms have been taking advantage of the opportunities offered by this common market."
"At that time we had to note on the one hand that freight transport had been made considerably easier, but that on the other there were still major barriers and costs associated with making the corresponding payments."
"The first study on this subject, which was carried out at the instigation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, showed at the time that cross-border transfers of over DEM 1 000 cost 25% on average, and as much as 75% in individual cases."
"You have to bear in mind that small and medium-sized businesses are of course the ones primarily affected by this."
"When the markets between the Member States of the European Union were opened up, our ambition as Members of the European Parliament was never to create access for large companies, which they had of course had for a long time already; it was always to open up this large European market to small and medium-sized businesses."
"That is why I am extremely grateful to our rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, for the persistency with which she has pursued this objective for many years, that is to bring down the costs of making transfers between the Member States of the European Union."
"I have to stress that there have already been some improvements here, that average transfer costs are much lower than they were when the borders were opened between the Member States, but I should like to emphasise just as clearly that they are still far too high and that further action is needed here."
"The banks repeatedly tell us - and with some justification - that the necessary facilities to effect transfers of this kind, the giro systems which exist in the individual domestic markets, are still not fully operational at European level."
"A major effort is needed here."
"This remark is not directed solely at the European Central Bank, but also at the various banking associations which we have in the European Union. What we wish to see is not just one single transfer system - which would once again be a monopoly - but competition between different transfer systems set up by different banks and groups of banks, competition which will at long last work in favour of the public and in favour of small and medium-sized businesses."
"Madam President, the rapporteur's report is very much to be welcomed because it highlights the problems associated with cross-border payments."
"After all, we expect credit transfers to strengthen economic integration in the European Union and not to throw a spanner in the works."
"That is what they are doing to this day, as we can see from the many complaints made by small and medium-sized businesses and the complaints made by the public about the high charges for transferring small amounts, which are quite simply very much in evidence."
"We even know of cases in which transfer fees for cross-border payments increased when the euro was introduced, and not only by a modest amount."
"The monthly cheque to a daughter or son in another EU country, the cross-border transfers for books or services, hotels or trips are being subjected to additional charges, despite the fact that the logistics of cross-border trade are supposed to be less complex and less expensive."
"There is even talk of it being possible to reduce costs by 90%, although the financial services institutions impress on us time and again that the higher costs are linked to processing the transfers and not to the technicalities of making cross-border payments."
"Nevertheless, it would have been good if a TARGET system for small payments and retail payments had been introduced at the same time as the TARGET system for wholesale payments, because technically that would have been possible; it is just that there was not the same determination to do so as there was for wholesale payments."
"In the European Parliament in our work in committee, we also very much regretted the fact that the offer made by the European Central Bank was not accepted."
"Here, too, we endorse the statement made by the European Central Bank that one day it should not be any more expensive to effect a cross-border transfer to another EU country than to transfer money within one single EU country."
"For years we have been pressing for the efforts being made to be harmonised."
"After all, it is in fact very possible to set up a quick, secure and cheap system, and fortunately the financial services institutions have now also come on board; they are on the right track."
"But it would have been good if we had already made use of the transitional period."
"The many complaints made by incensed members of the public speak for themselves, and I have to say that particularly at this time these are, of course, not likely to increase public acceptance of monetary union."
"The political objective is clear and is supported by the European Central Bank: what we need is a European payment area within which everything works just as smoothly as it does in a single EU country."
"Small customers are just as much part of the internal market as major customers; there should be no discrimination here."
"I believe, however, that there is also more that the governments must do, and I support the rapporteur's report."
"At the same time, the reporting requirement for balance of payment statistics should be abolished for small-value cross-border payments for amounts of less than EUR 50 000."
"Samples are actually sufficient."
"The European Central Bank could help by creating a single European data format for credit transfers and by supporting moves to create a uniform European bank sort code within the international IBAN system."
"It is important for all those involved to do what the European Central Bank is obliged to do as one of its tasks laid down in the Treaty, namely to promote the smooth operation of payment systems."
"The European Commission does not have the right to set the level of bank charges, but it can use its influence to bring down transfer fees."
"In the Union, charges sometimes vary very considerably, but sometimes they are also very similar."
"They therefore play a part in restricting freedom of movement in the internal market."
"I think that the Commission needs to be much quicker than it has been up until now about finally tabling the results of its investigations into whether there are, in fact, restrictive agreements between the banks."
"What is becoming important - and the report rightly refers to this - is consumer preference for electronic payments, and here we call for progress to be made so that here too an interoperable multi-currency standard for electronic purses can actually be introduced."
"This initiative, which so far is operational in Luxembourg, France and Germany, needs to be extended to the rest of the EU."
"I believe that this report is of central importance if we are truly to succeed in integrating the public and small and medium-sized businesses into the euro area and for increasing public acceptance of economic and monetary union."
"We need security, speed and also low costs."
"Living in the monetary union also means counting on a reliable cross-border credit transfer system - this is the battle cry for the remaining 432 days."
"Madam President, I would like to concur with the rapporteur and her excellent report. She expressed her views in no uncertain terms."
"I am also delighted that the European Commission, especially Commissioner Bolkestein and also Commissioner Monti, are putting this matter high on the agenda."
"Consumers and companies are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the high costs for cross-border bank transactions in the internal market, which is completely understandable."
"Consumers pay far too much for any type of cross-border bank transactions, as well as for cash, credit transfers, credit cards and cheques."
"For large sums, there is a refined network in place in which transfers are carried out as quickly and cheaply as for domestic transactions."
"However, the private individual still cannot rely on sufficient support, a reduction in costs and efficient processing of small amounts."
"I would therefore like to stress once more the need for efficient, safe and cheap services for retail payments in the internal market to go hand in hand with the introduction of the euro."
"The acceptance of the euro also depends greatly on whether consumers and companies are able to use the euro area as an internal payment zone."
"It is crucial for consumers to accept the euro."
"When euro coins and notes are introduced on 1 January 2002, consumers will start to use the euro frequently, and how are we then to explain that there are differences in its use, even though there is one currency and one euro area?"
"The idea that transfers in two participating euro area countries will no longer be considered as an international transaction incurring international costs but as a national transfer, will need to become universally accepted."
"The high bank charges involved in the completion of the internal market constitute a barrier."
"Consumers are discouraged from shopping internationally."
"For example, they will not subscribe to a foreign magazine if the international charges amount to double the price of the magazine because of the high bank charges."
"In the free movement of capital involving the single currency, there should not be any restrictions or huge discrepancies."
"The objective must be to establish one single payment area, where cross-border payments are subject to the same conditions and accompanied by the same costs as domestic transactions."
"That, in our eyes, is the only possible and logical consequence of the internal market and a single currency."
"The free movement of people in the euro area requires a flexible labour market."
"If there are still payment commitments with the home country, this should not prevent people from working abroad."
"It is a fact that banks throughout the euro area took a reserved stance before the implementation of the Directive on cross-border retail payments."
"Following implementation, a large proportion of the problems also remained unsolved."
"Now that the switch-over is drawing ever closer, it really is time for action, by banks and Member States alike."
"Banks must commit to implementing the existing standards for account numbering and payment instructions."
"In this age of modern technology, the electronic highway could offer a way-out."
"Maybe, in fact most probably, the time has come for an Internet bank to be set up which does not charge any costs."
"Madam President, Mrs Peijs' report on retail payments in the internal market takes up Parliament' s longstanding complaint about the high cost of cross-border payments within the Union."
"It is quite true."
"The cost is very high and we know exactly why that is."
"The interconnections between the computer systems of the various banks in the various Member States are poor, hence the need for expensive manual operations to process payments from one national system to another."
"This is not some fiendish ploy by the bankers, just a technical reality temporarily resisting resolution, but bound to evolve in the right direction in time."
"So I think we should put the problem into perspective, especially as cross-border payments represent a very small part of total payments."
"The documents I have looked at put their share as low as 0.2% to 0.04%."
"In every case, it is really microscopic."
"Yet the European Parliament and the Commission genuinely attach vast significance to it."
"Why is that?"
"The first answer is that the European institutions tend to prioritise everything that is cross-border, which is not surprising, after all."
"But nevertheless, this bias towards cross-border issues must not mean the great majority of citizens is penalised for the benefit of a tiny minority."
"Investment leading to significant reductions in the cost of cross-border payments would not be profitable because it would be amortised over far too few payers. To that extent, the conclusion must be that making that investment under these conditions would mean applying the costs to all bank customers, most of whom have nothing to do with the matter."
"I do not really think that, in all fairness, that is a desirable outcome."
"It is highly dubious politically, and we must also stop giving the impression that something that is expensive for technical reasons can suddenly become free because a directive has been passed saying so."
"I would remind you of the basic maxim everyone learns in the first year of economics: there is no such thing as a free lunch."
"Madam President, there is a second reason for the European Parliament' s perseverance."
"The Peijs report makes the point in recital D of the motion for a resolution, and I quote: 'the high level of charges for cross-border credit transfers is damaging the confidence of consumers in the euro' ."
"But why should it damage the confidence of consumers in the euro?"
"I have just explained why these two problems are not linked, at least not apparently."
"The fact is, several years ago, people were led to believe - who knows why, no doubt to get the euro accepted more easily - that this type of cost would completely disappear with the single currency. Here is a little leaflet."
"Millions of copies of it were distributed in public places in France, not least post offices, and this is what it says in the section on foreign exchange commission: 'in the euro area the commission on foreign exchange will disappear' ."
"Of course, in the strict sense that is true, but the naïve reader, the non-specialist, thought that all the costs of cross-border payments would disappear, when in fact foreign exchange commissions only represented a small part of those costs, just a small percentage."
"So now we are facing the consequences of the hard sell of the euro, and that brings me to a conclusion on this issue of cross-border payments, but also, Madam President, on the euro generally."
"One can deny reality using words. You can tell people stories, but sooner or later, your fudging and lies will come back to haunt you."
"Madam President, the no-frills approach, which typifies Mrs Peijs, is evident in virtually every paragraph of the present report."
"It is only right that the banking sector should be tackled and given a stiff talking to, for while the most important techniques and standards are in place, there is still no flexibility in sight for cross-border credit transfers for amounts up to EUR 50 000."
"One would almost be inclined to think that none of the commercial banks stand to benefit from modernising their present working methods."
"I endorse the dual-track policy, by means of which the rapporteur hopes to spur the slow banks into action."
"In my view, it is not sufficient to exert pressure via legislative measures. These could prove less effective than putting the pressure on by giving rival alternatives generous elbow-room to transfer money within the euro area."
"The Commission might well want to give this latter option serious thought, for I assume that the Commission too would prefer to see a reduction in the costs via increased competition."
"I have my reservations about one aspect, however."
"The demand to bring the costs for transferring money within the euro area into line with those within a Member State could well lead to a situation where the costs for domestic transfers will go up."
"This is certainly true of the Netherlands, where for years, customers were not charged for domestic transfers."
"This objection does not detract from the fact that I give the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, all credit for her thoroughness in this matter."
"Madam President, Commissioner Bolkenstein, the report that has been drafted with such professional skill by my colleague, Mrs Peijs, and which is now the subject of our discussion, is very important for consumers in the euro area and for confidence in the euro as a whole."
"Rarely in this House has there been such strong consensus on how important the report we are dealing with is."
"I share the concerns of those of my colleagues who have already spoken and agree with what they have said."
"This morning the euro sank to an all-time low."
"It was quoted at 0.8240 against the US dollar."
"That is a new record."
"We therefore have much to do in this area but the political resources and remedies politicians possess to deal with that are fewer than those we are able to employ to resolve this problem of Internal Market payments."
"I also wish to thank the Commission for the fact that you have taken legal action against one hundred and twenty banks and banking associations as a result of suspicions over a cartel relating to payments charged for currency exchange in the euro area exchange rate."
"This is excellent work on the part of the Commission."
"On the other hand, I do also understand the point of view of the banks to some extent."
"Although we in the European Parliament now criticise the banks we have to understand that cross-border payments account for only a six-percent slice of all payment transactions, so development of this area is an expensive investment in the eyes of the banks in relation to the benefits gained, from the point of view of the banks at least."
"On the other hand, the largest item of expenditure in cross-border credit transfers is manual handling, and a decision should be taken quickly to dispense with that."
"Just as Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we cannot order banks to reduce charges as a result of political decisions."
"What we can do is compel or put pressure on the European Central Bank to invite banks to attend immediately a meeting of a working party on standardisation at which decisions could be taken regarding the technical circumstances under which costs could be reduced."
"We cannot force banks to engage in unprofitable business, but, as politicians, what we can do is support the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, which calls for measures to be implemented before the end of next year, and, preferably, for these standards to be in place when the euro coins and notes come into circulation."
"Madam President, it is a source of deep regret that in a Parliament where a good 85% of people have staked their political reputations on the single currency, we do not have a greater attendance to discuss the performance of this currency."
"We know that it is 17 times more expensive to make a cross-border transaction transfer in the euro area than it is to make a domestic one."
"People joining the euro thought that if it did nothing else, it would make it easier and cheaper for them to take their money abroad."
"We see that this is not happening."
"This promised benefit has not materialised; and indeed, as the Commission candidly admitted when this report was discussed in committee, no improvement is expected in the situation after the introduction of notes and coins."
"This is another blow to a currency already struggling, a currency that hits a new low on the international market virtually every week, a currency with the bank president continuously under fire for his ill-judged comments to the press, a currency where, on the only occasion when the people of Europe were asked to cast their vote on whether to join or not, they voted ""no"" in the recent Danish referendum."
"We now hear that the printers responsible for producing the notes are threatening to go on strike."
"Above all, even the most basic benefit that the euro enthusiasts promised the people of Europe, the reduction of transaction costs, is not being realised."
"What are the benefits for the people of the euro area from this currency that has been foisted on them by a political elite in Europe?"
"This project is not about economics."
"This project is not about giving practical benefits to European citizens."
"It is and always has been a step on the road to creating a United States of Europe, a political project."
"We are seeing that it is failing to deliver any benefits to the mainstream majority of ordinary people in the euro area."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I too should like to thank our colleague, Mrs Peijs, very much for her report and for being so persistent in her efforts to achieve results for the public."
"On 1 January 2002, the euro will also become a reality for the public, because then we will have the euro in our pockets."
"Today the average fee for transferring EUR 100 to another country in the internal market is EUR 17.10, many times more than the fees for domestic transfers."
"In the future, the euro area will also feel like a domestic area and the public do not understand why in this area, in which there are no exchange-related risks and in which electronic payments with Internet banking are increasingly becoming a matter of course, transferring money from Munich to Salzburg is considerably more expensive than transferring money from Munich to Kiel."
"The advantages of the euro need to be demonstrated to the public and also to small and medium-sized businesses, precisely because we are having problems at the moment with the acceptance of the euro and it seems to many as though large companies and banks are benefiting from it, but not the man in the street."
"For me, the argument that nowadays very few transfers of euros are made to other countries in the euro area does not count either."
"That is a chicken-and-egg debate."
"We in Brussels are of course experiencing this ourselves as Members, but our colleagues are too, that we do not make transfers abroad because of the high charges linked to the euro."
"I am firmly convinced that if prices fall the number of transfers will increase in leaps and bounds and people will avail themselves of this possibility."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission is maintaining its pressure on the banks and that it may increase the pressure further with the action it is taking against 120 banks."
"The European Central Bank should also exert increased pressure."
"The proposal by Mrs Peijs and myself also seeks to bring the banks together around one table, not to lay down the law, but because we simply cannot increase the pressure any further from the political side."
"Neither do we want any price regulation in this sector, but we should at least coordinate this."
"The ECB would seem the ideal candidate to make progress on single data formats and uniform bank sort codes in Europe."
"I also hope that the low prices will not come at one fell swoop in five years' time, but that they will come gradually and that it will already be possible to see some progress as early as 2002."
"At long last we will have achieved our aim if the banks compete on offering customers cheap transfers abroad."
"Then we will have a real market in this sector."
"Madam President, I shall speak in English in answer to Mrs Villiers, who has spoken about the advantages, and possible disadvantages, of the euro."
"It is a much debated subject these days, but it does not come within my remit."
"So I shall inform my colleague, Mr Solbes Mira, who deals with macroeconomic matters, of the remarks by Mrs Villiers."
"I have no desire to add anything to the current debate."
"I do not want to muddy the waters."
"Madam President, I would like to start by extending a warm thanks to Mrs Peijs for her excellent report on the establishment of a unified, uniform area for payments."
"Upon completion of the internal market and the introduction of the single currency, we need a unified area for payments more than ever."
"Borders should no longer play a role in future."
"In fact, in time, there should not be a discrepancy at all between cross-border and domestic payments."
"Both the Commission and Parliament will need to invest many more years of work in order to realise this objective."
"In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the date of 1 January 2002."
"That date must be considered as an extremely important and symbolic milestone in the construction of the European Union - and I am also addressing Mrs Villiers with this observation."
"After all, on that fateful day, 1 January 2002, all citizens of the euro area will have the same coins and notes in their purses and wallets."
"After the European passport, this is the second concrete proof, which will actually make a tangible difference on a day-to-day basis, that we all belong to the European Union."
"We therefore need to pull out all the stops to turn this new phase into a success."
"After all, if the systems for making cross-border payments remain as expensive as they are today, the credibility of the new system of coins and notes will be called into question."
"This is why it is crucial that well before 1 January 2002, a whole host of measures are taken, so that these are in place when the new coins and notes are introduced."
"The Commission will take a very close look at all the proposals made in the report."
"We will especially study the problems in the field of competition."
"In this respect, I would like to say in response to the observations made by Mrs Kauppi and Mrs Randzio-Plath, who unfortunately had to leave the Chamber, that the Commission has looked into possible agreements between banks."
"This investigation took place in February 1999."
"The Commission has sent declarations of objection to banks in six Member States."
"That was done in July of this year and the Member States involved are Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and Germany."
"The relevant procedures and the investigation into the costs charged for cross-border payments is now under way."
"In more general terms, the Commission is of the opinion that technological development enables the competition in this field of credit transfers to intensify, for competition will of course lead to lower costs."
"We will be exchanging ideas on this topic during the large round-table conference to be held on 9 November next in Brussels."
"In the summer of 2001, the Commission will also be presenting a report on the improvement of cross-border credit transfers."
"That report - and I am turning to Mrs Peijs in particular - will contain legislative proposals amending the 1997 Directive which entered into effect last year."
"I am addressing Mrs Peijs directly because I know she appreciates a clear response in this matter."
"Once that report has been drafted - and that will not be by return of post as Mrs Peijs requested, but in any event reasonably promptly - I can promise Mrs Peijs that the Commission will produce legislative proposals in this respect."
"On that occasion, we will also be looking into reducing the implementation period for cross-border transfers, which Mrs Peijs calls for in her report."
"Even now, transfers take place within three days in 85% of the cases."
"It is, of course, our aim to increase this to 100%."
"The Commission is trying to exert pressure on the banks with this aim in mind."
"Once again, it will be some time before this becomes reality, but next summer, the Commission intends to make a statement on Mrs Peijs' proposal to reduce the period by half. It will attempt to meet the requirements of the House."
"The rapporteur' s report also focuses on the declarations of statistical data which banks need to produce for each cross-border transfer."
"These declarations are imposed by the Member States and not by the Commission."
"We are of the opinion that this form of collecting statistical data on the Union' s internal credit transfers is a vestige of the past which can no longer be justified in an integrated, unified area and which forms an obstruction to the proper running of the market."
"I therefore hope that the Member States too will take prompt action to update their systems for collecting statistical data."
"In addition, the Commission fully backs Parliament' s proposals to encourage electronic payment."
"It is important, however, that technical and legal security are guaranteed, especially with regard to direct debiting."
"We cannot, on the other hand, endorse the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, because this Committee is asking us to take a legislative initiative to bring the costs of cross-border payments in line with those for domestic payments."
"We can, of course, agree on the principle of this proposal, but not on the proposed working method."
"As you know, we are in favour of free competition, but not of administrative price regulation."
"Furthermore, as Mr Blokland was quite right to point out, such a measure could immediately have the opposite effect, because the costs of domestic payments could then immediately increase."
"I do not believe that that news would be well-received by consumers who never make cross-border transfer payments."
"This brings me to the end of my brief clarification on the action the Commission intends to take on the report by Mrs Peijs."
"I hope that the appeals you have made, particularly those directed at the banking world, will be heard."
"The Commission and European Central Bank are in constant, and often difficult, dialogue with the banking world to achieve tangible results, and your support in this is much appreciated."
"Madam President, by way of reassurance, I would like to say to the Commissioner that the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not been incorporated as a document in the EMAC report."
"Parliament, in its wisdom, completely shares your view."
"Madam President, I am grateful to Mrs Peijs for her last remark, which is also accepted as such by the Commission. As far as this matter is concerned therefore, the Commission can declare its concurrence - in every respect, in fact - with the report by Mrs Peijs."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship"
"The next item is the report (A5-0267/2000) by Mrs Montfort on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, 2001-2005 [COM(2000) 256 - C5-0274/2000 - 2000/0107(CNS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all carry our own list of recurrent disappointments we can do nothing about in our heads, but it is a good thing to have a moan about them from time to time just to show that we do not accept the situation and that impotence does not always rhyme with indifference, not yet anyway."
"Listening to what some Members had to say in committee, Members who have been in this House longer than I have, gave me the feeling that this multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship exercise that Parliament is going through for the fourth time belongs in that category."
"In substance, people were telling me that good intentions are always welcome but we need to make sure, contrary to what has always happened so far, that the next report on the subject does not have to make the same assessment as the previous one, because nothing has really changed in the position of European businesses."
"So the aim of the text before you today is to transform a pointless compulsory figures test into a promising examination of a freestyle programme where the European Union can add value as long as it understands its place and its role in the arrangement."
"The time when the defence of business, especially small and medium-sized business, was like a corporatist battle is long gone, not just because there is only a handful of diehards left who see the world of business through the distorting prism of the class struggle, but above all because, at the start of this third millennium, everyone knows that the issues of employment and social cohesion are crucial for our societies, and business has a pre-eminent role in those issues."
"In fact, it is well to bear in mind that, at both the economic and the social level, business leads."
"The major job-creator and driving force for social integration, it has also progressively acquired paramount importance as regards training for young people and continuous training, and as it has in the area of land development where it is, in the end, the most efficient instrument."
"Recognising this, the Fifteen adopted the Charter for Small Enterprises last June at the Feira Summit. Its existence is already affording us a glimpse of the considerable progress that can be achieved."
"Besides undeniably constituting the basis on which we must construct a policy on business which genuinely serves business, the Charter has the great merit not just of limiting our action to small businesses, but of making them the central point in our thinking, our priority unit of reference."
"Parliament, composed of elected representatives who regularly rub shoulders with representatives of small business, is duty bound to present this option clearly, turning it into an objective reality and introducing the only method that can properly embrace the diversity of the world of business."
"The SME is not a multinational in miniature, any more than it suffices to extrapolate the difficulties of a small business quantitatively to get a proper grasp of the problems of large units."
"It does seem sound policy to favour a pragmatic and hands-on approach, putting the small business at the heart of the system, rather than a proposal merely producing balanced statistics that are quite impossible to use in practice, on the pretext of avoiding a scattershot approach."
"So I am glad the Committee on Industry unanimously decided to prioritise a sectoral approach to business, the inevitable choice for identifying as precisely as possible the real and specific needs of businesses whose disparity lends itself poorly to a horizontal approach. That would not be effective."
"Certainly, comparing performance and exchanging best practice are most interesting ideas in absolute terms, but positive intervention in the day-to-day lives of businesses cannot be achieved by that means alone."
"So what should be done?"
"We need to start with three simple ideas: first, instead of accepting that we more or less give up trying to reach as many companies as possible directly, we should use the existing networks whose understanding of real-life situations makes them indispensable partners in the drafting, but also in the efficient implementation of a policy geared to businesses."
"That is why the report stresses the need for close links between consulting circles and organisations representing businesses, which have much to teach us and can prevent us from turning a good idea into a bad decision out of ignorance."
"Next, we should take care not to make access to capital for firms, especially the smallest ones, even more complicated."
"Here we are touching on a key factor in the start-up, development, recovery, transfer, even survival of businesses, and a certain number of decisions that have been taken, or are on the point of being taken, are causing concern. These range from the obscure reshaping of the respective tasks of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, to the draft Directive on banks' own resources, which we have still to be persuaded will have an impact on the ability of a business to obtain a loan."
"Whatever the case, with the advent of an economy based more than ever on knowledge and technological innovation, the Commission absolutely must ensure that the boldest, most innovative, risk-taking companies are helped to grasp the opportunities on offer and reap the rewards of their enterprising spirit."
"Finally, since the spirit of enterprise is inseparable from the notion of responsibility, we should establish clearly what Europe can contribute as added value in terms of business policy."
"The political orientation is the responsibility of the Member States."
"The Council set that orientation at Feira, with the Charter for Small Enterprises."
"By concentrating on coordinating the policies defined in this context and applied by the Member States, and in particular by a commitment to lowering all the technical and administrative barriers that place needless strain on business progress, that approach would find consummate expression."
"I hope the vote in this House will replicate the unanimity shown in the Committee on Industry."
"That would send out the strong and clear signal the business world needs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you in advance for supporting my report."
"Commissioner, I know I can count on your energy and determination to implement this programme."
"It needs to be linked to other Community programmes and an annual balance sheet should be drawn up so that adjustments can be made if necessary."
"In that way we can meet the two challenges of full employment and social cohesion together."
"Thank you on behalf of all enterprises, but also on behalf of our societies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Montfort on her report and also thank her for the very good cooperation which we have enjoyed."
"It really has been fun."
"Where the economy is concerned, Europe's aim is of course to become the number one in the world and the multiannual programme can make a contribution to achieving this."
"However, what is particularly important in this sector is that we promote a spirit of enterprise in society and that young people give more serious consideration to starting their own business or to going into smaller companies."
"To do this we need to be active in the context of education in particular."
"Until recently, after completing their studies and training, many young people made a choice between going into the civil service or simply into larger companies which are similar to the state."
"Here we need to bring about a sea of change."
"But we also sense that this is already happening - many young people are in fact also founding new start-up companies, and we should encourage this entrepreneurial spirit."
"But I have three specific comments on this programme."
"Firstly, the Commission is saying that in the future it will promote and define policies which are enterprise-friendly."
"To this end it wishes to introduce a benchmarking exercise, which is certainly an interesting initiative."
"We must, however, ensure that it is effective."
"At present the plan is that this exercise will be run by the EU and the Member States, which will certainly not give an accurate picture."
"If I take my native country, Germany, then one single set of statistics for Germany does not reflect the situation in the regions."
"There are huge variations between, say, Bavaria and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania."
"Or take Greater London and Scotland."
"Greater differentiation ought to be possible here; the regions need to be involved if we are to get an accurate picture of the impact of enterprise-friendly policies."
"Secondly, the Commission is considering taking more of a back-seat role in supporting SMEs."
"This is certainly also a debatable step."
"The success of assistance to small and medium-sized businesses should actually be measured on how effective it is, and that is why the question certainly does arise as to what extent it is possible to provide this assistance in this form at European level."
"But if assistance is withdrawn at European level then the regions need once again to be given increased opportunities to act."
"In this context the de minimis rule should, in any case, be re-examined and the group exemption regulation for SMEs should be revised."
"My third point concerns traditional companies and e-commerce."
"We always draw a distinction between the new economy and the old economy."
"Where I live in Bavaria there is one business, a carpenter, who now derives 70% of his turnover from the Internet."
"Is that the old or the new economy?"
"I think that we should merge these two sectors to make the normal, traditional sector of the economy also part of the new economy."
"I have two requests of the Commissioner here: the first is for the Commission to support the development of software intended specifically for SMEs, which in terms of size and cost would be suitable for use by the SME sector."
"The second is for DG Enterprise, which was formed by merging the industry and SMEs portfolios, to champion SME-related issues with more vigour and to assume a watchdog function in the whole Commission for SME matters; it should scrutinise all the Commission's legislative acts and communications for their effect on SME-related issues."
"Finally, I also hope that the assistance programmes which the Commission offers to SMEs in the future are presented in such a way that they are considered from the customer's point of view, so that SMEs can always understand their purpose."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after eleven years in this House, I can bear witness to the fact that debates on small and medium-sized businesses in our Parliament are neither new nor rare."
"It has to be said that on the basis of European Union criteria, over 99% of companies could be defined as SMEs, which is not very sensible. That very fact illustrates the European vagueness of the concept and explains many uncertainties."
"Bear in mind that the first Community action programme in this area was adopted in 1983, seventeen years ago."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Montfort, has done excellent work over the last few weeks, in-depth work in close collaboration with all her colleagues."
"She has identified the points where there was a lack of clarity or significant slippage between statements and reality in the Commission' s text."
"Her work, in which we have assisted, has consisted of pinpointing issues and trying to establish a more precise classification of the different types of SME, micro-enterprises and craft businesses."
"And, along those lines, we too have tabled and pressed for a series of strong, concrete proposals for moving from words to deeds, in relation to SMEs, by giving them access to innovation and electronic commerce, simplifying certain customs formalities for them, ending certain disparities in administration and regulations, developing - and this is important - access to risk capital, developing the Euro Info Centres to broaden the scope of business information and support, and making the framework programme for research and technological development more open to innovative SMEs."
"As far as I and my friends are concerned, we have sought to put the accent on crafts and micro-enterprises. I have asked for environmental and sustainable development targets to be properly taken into consideration, and for access of SMEs to new communications and information technologies to be promoted."
"I have also asked that actions geared to specific groups like women, young people and the social economy sectors be encouraged, not forgetting employee participation in the life of these SMEs in general."
"SMEs are the major source of job creation, in terms of both quality and quantity, and they play a crucial role in social cohesion and regional planning."
"That is why it is very urgent to remove the many obstacles to their development and organise the necessary training."
"So, Mrs Montfort, I hope a massive vote for your report will finally allow us to make a qualitative leap forward in this area, and also that certain excessively liberal amendments will be rejected, for instance, on reducing the number of promotional programmes and on creating a new monitoring centre."
"If I had to sum it up in a nutshell, Mr President, I would say that what we need here- and if I say so myself - is less ideology and more action."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first and foremost like to express a word of thanks to the rapporteur who has indeed compiled her report with great care."
"This care is more than needed if we want to establish 'Enterprise Europe' by 2005 and if we want to make the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world."
"The amendment to the report in the Committee, partly tabled at my proposal, emphasised that the multiannual programme must be used as an instrument to promote economic growth, full employment and social cohesion."
"I would like to stress that this is an important focus, which must be brought more to the fore in the information and information campaigns, because it cannot be emphasised enough that entrepreneurship and an entrepreneurial climate are both of key significance, and that this is the reason why particular attention must be paid to the education and training of young people, as well as to providing permanent training to staff of SMEs."
"Today, I would particularly like to make a case for systematically eliminating as many as possible, if not all, barriers which stand in the way of establishing the internal market, and for optimising the competitiveness of SMEs, allowing them to develop in a dynamic and sustained manner."
"In addition, I have always been an advocate of underpinning these goals with efficient and pragmatic policy."
"I am delighted with Mr Caudron' s final remark which amounts to investing less in ideology, but more in efficient and pragmatic policy, which means that red tape should be kept to an absolute minimum."
"In our Union, this should in the first instance translate into simplification of customs formalities, because the fiscal, social, administrative and regulatory disparities between the Member States in terms of costs constitute a substantial barrier to equal access to the internal market."
"Finally, I would also urge you to take into consideration the enlargement of the European Union which is upon us."
"The effective implementation of the acquis is necessary to ensure that enlargement becomes a win-win situation for the Member States and candidate countries alike."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I, too, would like to congratulate our colleague, Mrs Elisabeth Montfort, on the quality of her report on the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship for 2001-2005."
"She has studied the proposals with great care, and she has taken the trouble to consult with the many parties concerned. That approach has been an asset in defining and optimising the implementation of this programme."
"Here I want to stress some of the strengths we need to build on to improve Europe's contribution to business in the new 'knowledge-based' economy."
"How can we make a better contribution to Enterprise Europe, as President Prodi called it in a recent speech?"
"First, every business must be included."
"Of course there are large businesses, involving several thousand people, say."
"We need to recognise not just what they contribute to the market economy, in terms of jobs and profit, but also their contribution to knowledge through their support for applied research and to the creation of hosts of businesses around them."
"Through their contacts with - often public - research laboratories they undoubtedly supplement public funding, which frequently needs supplementing, and enables discoveries to be made."
"So it is important to make sure our action here is positive."
"Turning now to SMIs/SMEs and micro-enterprises."
"As Mr Caudron said, these represent 98% of our economic fabric."
"Our greatest potential for adaptation resides in them."
"They are the true economic and innovation vanguard, in the front line and openly exposed to the risks inherent in this domain."
"We should take special care of them and make sure there are concrete measures which they can assimilate easily."
"Secondly, and without going through the measures set out in the report, which are, anyway, the result of an assessment made last year, you will note, all the same, that we are taking up the same old essential points: simplification of the assistance formalities, which are still too cumbersome, and even stifling for SMIs; help with finance and risk capital to ensure greater stability; aid for research into new technologies; establishment of a European standard through the BEST process; aid with communication and information."
"These businesses need buttressing within their geographic or technological environment."
"We must encourage them, promote local development using local resources, both material and human, and foster their relations with local communities."
"Here we should not only be helping businesses with a traditional structure, but also public-private partnerships and cooperatives which are increasingly contributing, among other things, to improving stability and creating jobs."
"Thirdly, we must look for European added value."
"This could involve, in particular, the installation of a European network, both physical and electronic, which every SMI can join, where they can find information, exchange knowledge through appropriate mechanisms with appropriate ethics, and benefit from the prime advantages the European Union decides to establish for their support."
"It seems clear to me that Brussels cannot run everything in this domain."
"We need operations in the field, regional delegations the Commission, Parliament or the Council can control, as the Majo report recognised just recently."
"Certain intervention issues must also be selected."
"They are easy to find: in the information society especially, in that sustainable development we hear so much about, in the fields of the environment, clean technologies, eco-technologies, new energy sources and new materials."
"The hallmark of this European aid network should be a number of centres, like the Euro Info Centres."
"For an SME/SMI, working with this European network would undoubtedly mean that, where synergies exists, it would not have to form a consortium with several other businesses in different Union countries, which often results in an artificial set-up with masses of paperwork and endless complications."
"I really hope the Commission will set up a working group on this topic, involving interested Members of Parliament."
"Fourthly, there are the proposals for the European research area we are beginning to construct."
"In parallel, we propose to introduce a European innovation area, and I am grateful to Mrs Montfort for having agreed to include that proposal in her report."
"We must take account of the results of and follow-up to the work of the Science and Governance Conference held last week in Brussels under the auspices of the Seville Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, because there is plenty of overlap with the subject we are dealing with today."
"Finally, I am sure it is time to create a proper parliamentary office for scientific and technological options assessment within the European Parliament, to assist in decisions and monitoring. These exist in the national parliaments and ours would match theirs."
"Our President, Mrs Fontaine, is asking us, because we are responsible for STOA, to send a message of support today to the EPTA, an organisation specialised in technological assessment in Europe, founded under the aegis of our colleague Mr Barón Crespo, which is meeting in Berlin on 10 November."
"But STOA is not really that kind of organisation and we have specific proposals to make on the subject."
"Mrs Montfort, our group will give your report its wholesale support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, small and medium-sized businesses, both in the manufacturing and in the service sectors, can only survive on the market if they have full order books."
"They only have full order books if they have clients, and these can, roughly speaking, be divided into three categories: firstly, large companies; secondly, private consumers and thirdly, the public sector."
"It follows from this that small and medium-sized businesses only thrive if unemployment is low and if public budgets at all levels are free of debt and have sufficient resources to commit to the investment budget."
"Within small and medium-sized businesses I should like to pay particular attention to the very small and micro-enterprises, because, of course, here additional specific difficulties compound the situation, in particular in manufacturing."
"These companies very rarely have their own research and development capabilities and the danger is therefore particularly great that they will be cut off from the development of new products and the further development of existing ones, that they will use antiquated technologies and that they will not adapt to the demand for increasing quality."
"In addition, very often - because the managerial staff are not adequately qualified - the opportunities for support, which are readily available here, are not exploited to the full."
"All of this is quite apart from the main problems which to this day have not been resolved: permanent undercapitalisation; very poor access to credit because they cannot provide the guarantees required in normal banking practice; markets limited to their respective regions and cash loss."
"This means that a policy focused on small and medium-sized businesses is needed, on the one hand to standardise the assistance programmes and on the other, obviously, to take account also of the specific interests and problems linked to company size, company structures, production lines and so on."
"Mrs Montfort's report constitutes a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal."
"People might almost think, Mrs Montfort, that you yourself were a committed SME entrepreneur. Your report is excellent."
"Nevertheless, I would have liked even more attention to have been paid to at least two economic trends."
"The first is a greater emphasis on - I do not say a change towards but a greater emphasis on - demand-driven economic policy compared with supply-side economic policy. Secondly, there has also been a power shift within investment policy towards investment for expansion and - to a lesser extent - towards investment in rationalisation."
"Looked at another way, this means that the taxpayer makes tax receipts available which companies use to rationalise."
"Then they put the people who used to work there out onto the street and say to the taxpayer, now it is up to you again to sort out what happens to these workers who have been shown the door."
"Surely this cannot be what economists want."
"It may seem perfectly acceptable from a business management point of view because of the profits that it can be expected to generate, but not from the point of view of the overall economy."
"I think that we in the European Parliament have a responsibility to the overall economy which takes precedence over our responsibility to the business economy."
"Mr President, this multiannual programme provides a European framework for the development of the innovative potential and the competitiveness of industry in the Member States."
"In this context, the principle of subsidiarity is afforded the attention it deserves in our view."
"We endorse the attention which the rapporteur, Mrs Montfort, is paying - rightly so - to small and medium-sized businesses, and micro-enterprises, as well as to granting priority support to young fledgling entrepreneurs."
"The rapporteur has listed a number of key points in a bid to strengthen the European entrepreneurial climate."
"For example, she calls for enterprises to have access to new information and communication technology."
"The question does, however, arise as to how the Multiannual programme can help enterprises strengthen their competitiveness in specific terms."
"Whichever way, the Commission has a stimulating role to play in exchanging regional experience and best practices in this field."
"Another of Mrs Montfort' s key points is the improvement, or rather simplification, of legislation and the regulatory structure in the Member States."
"We have always been in favour of eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles for industry."
"In our opinion, a third point of concern is the protection of intellectual property rights at European level."
"We especially have the patenting of software innovation in mind."
"Enterprises need clarity."
"In other words: is there still any purpose in investing in this sector?"
"In this context, the question also arises as to whether Europe is possibly lagging behind the US precisely because of the lack of a European patent on software."
"Finally, practice at national and regional level will determine the success of the present multiannual programme."
"This is the level at which, according to our political vision, entrepreneurial initiatives should be taken."
"European backing for such entrepreneurial spirit is always welcome."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I myself come from a blacksmith's forge; I grew up there."
"I am familiar with the problems experienced by a small business."
"That is why I should like to congratulate Mr Liikanen, because, today, something has been achieved which is particularly important for small businesses and for our many sole traders."
"Unbundling of the local loop will open up new opportunities for competition and will therefore offer new businesses the possibility of making favourable acquisitions and give them good opportunities to prove themselves in this field."
"You will see that the programme has been allocated around EUR 230 million; if you divide that by the 16 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European Union the result is EUR 3 per company per year."
"The programme is so important precisely because it generates momentum, the right kind of momentum, which is also very important for us as Members."
"Take the example of the Euro Info Centres."
"My contact there is Magister Leitner, and if I come across a problem related to support programmes or a problem with the European institutions, then I can tell my employers that there is someone there who is competent and in the know, someone who can give information in the shortest possible time about public calls for tender, support programmes or research on infrastructure."
"This is excellent for Europe because help can be given quickly and competently in the form of technically correct information."
"It is extremely important, particularly for small companies, for help to be given quickly."
"For small companies, the three or six months which they have to wait for a piece of information to be forthcoming or for a programme to start is an endlessly long time."
"This means that the smaller the company, the more rapidly everything happens, and with new technologies everything is of course happening even more quickly."
"We all know that the pace at which we live our lives has become faster because we use mobile telephones, e-mail and the Internet, and this opens up entirely new possibilities."
"That is why it is important where financing is concerned for us also to ensure that companies have access to the capital market, not only to the stock market."
"Above all, when a one-man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it should not need to provide 120% loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea."
"Unfortunately, we are still a long way from this way of thinking in Europe."
"What we still need are more experts to guide our companies through complex procedures at European level."
"I should like, by way of an example, simply to mention standards."
"In principle a small company does not know very much about how a standard comes into being and how a standard is established at European level."
"That is why associations such as NORMAPME are very important, because this is another place where a small business can seek know-how quickly and efficiently, because tenders relating to this may be on the Internet and because, quite simply, this is helpful for its everyday work."
"One of the most important points is of course tax rates."
"America has an average tax rate of 30% while we have one of 45%, which means quite simply that small businesses here have to be 15% more productive or work for 15% longer for the same reward."
"That is why we should make it our business to bring down tax rates as far as possible by introducing less hefty laws, slimmed-down benchmarking and best practices so as to create a simple and well-ordered environment for our businesses."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Montfort for the excellent work she has done."
"I believe that the debate conducted within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to which I hope Parliament will give tangible substance when it comes to vote, has been all the more valid and necessary in terms of reintroducing into this multiannual programme, which we are going to approve, suitable time and space for small and medium-sized businesses and, in particular, for micro-enterprises and craft industries which are of such great importance to the economy of the European Union."
"From this viewpoint, I feel that we cannot approve of the fact that the programme presented by the Commission devotes little time or space to micro-enterprises, in particular, when in recent years the concept of micro-enterprises and craft industries has been gathering considerable momentum."
"In fact, we must do more and better for small businesses and micro-enterprises, and above all, we must do this in concrete terms when talking of the information and knowledge economy, research and innovation."
"When seen in this context, this multiannual programme can only represent a first step, after which we must continue in tangible terms - and I agree with what Mr Rübig has just said on this - by promoting, for example, the development of the Euro Info Centre network, which is one of the facets and mainstays of action in favour of small and medium-sized businesses within the European Union. I feel that this network should also be made responsible for the local-level coordination of those European networks that are already up and running."
"Furthermore, we must in practice set aside specific and ring-fenced amounts, under European Union actions, for small and medium-sized businesses, within the ambit of all those activities relating to research, innovation, the e-Europe project and so forth."
"Mr President, this report is an ode to the spirit of enterprise, but behind the lyricism lie subsidies and aid distributed by the European institutions, because it would seem that the spirit of enterprise needs an injection of hard cash."
"The explanatory statement emphasises that the term SME can equally relate to a business employing up to 500 employees and to a craft business employing only two or three people and that, taken all together, these represent 99% of the Union' s businesses."
"But how many SMEs are actually subsidiaries of large industrial groups?"
"And how are the subsidies distributed between them and the craft businesses?"
"The report does not breathe a word about that, because it would mean admitting that all the talk about small businesses is just a popularity-seeking justification for granting aid to big business."
"The national governments, and even the regional and local authorities, already act as gigantic finance pumps to siphon off taxpayers' money, that is to say the amounts levied on the majority of the population including the most disadvantaged, and pour this into big business and thence to proprietors and shareholders."
"All the European Institutions think about is boosting these appallingly unfair transfers when, even in the rich part of the continent of Europe represented by the Union, there are millions of people living in poverty."
"And if I may, Mr President, I would like to respond to something Mrs Montfort said. It is the big bosses who are waging the class war daily against the workers and the minority she referred to is defending the interests of the working class."
"Mr President, first of all I should declare an interest."
"I am the absentee boss of a very small enterprise, our family business in London."
"I will not say what it does, that might constitute an advertisement, but it was founded by my father, Francis Chichester, and I am very proud of it."
"It also enables me to come here and do my work for my constituents."
"I would like to welcome any measures, like this proposal and this report, that indicate our support at European level for the importance of SMEs and small businesses in particular."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Montfort on all her hard work in her report which, as we have heard, commands wide support across the House."
"In my view, the best thing for small businesses is for the authorities to leave them alone and to desist from the temptation of trying to pick winners."
"Diversity, safety in numbers, from which the winners will emerge, is the best way forward."
"I am reminded of what the Commissioner said to us a year ago about the experience in the United States, where they are not afraid of failure and they believe in the old Scottish proverb of ""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again""."
"The importance is to strike the right balance, to avoid having a continual situation of people failing at the expense of other people."
"I suspect that the real obstacles and hurdles that small businesses face are in other areas of European and national legislation, where they face great burdens in terms of administration, taxation and regulation."
"That seems very onerous indeed for small businesses, disproportionately so."
"I recently looked at the forms required for filling in tax returns for small businesses in the UK and the detail required great concentration on getting the right answer."
"Let me close by saying that in my view the most important thing for small businesses, the best medicine for them, is competition."
"That is the way they achieve efficiency, innovation and profitability."
"Mr President, we need to highlight the priority which the new multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship gives to small and medium-sized businesses."
"We all know full well that these enterprises have trouble surviving in the current environment; my own personal experience in publishing and bookselling leaves me little cause for optimism because I know the huge, sometimes insurmountable problems which these businesses face, precisely because they are so small."
"Because of its financial limitations, I think the multiannual programme merely acknowledges the problem and gives a positive political bearing and encouragement, but is not in a position to give any substantial help or, more importantly, to reverse the prevalent trends in the present economy, which are literally crushing small enterprises in every sector."
"It is generally accepted that small and medium-sized businesses are a fount of new talent and innovative ideas, trial goods and services and a spirit of independent creation."
"But how many of them are able to convert what are precious elements not only for the economy and society, but also for European civilisation, into real entrepreneurial development?"
"Very few."
"The nursery for small and medium-sized businesses contains several thousand experiments which feed large enterprises with manpower and ideas."
"They face tremendous competition and even if they succeed at production level, often presenting new, unprecedented and imaginative proposals, what can they do when it comes to distribution networks, marketing and advertising their products?"
"Distribution is highly complicated and costly nowadays, it needs large quantities of products and good organisation and it often exceeds the potential of small and medium-sized businesses."
"As far as advertising is concerned, it is generally prohibitively expensive."
"The takeovers which we have seen grow to mammoth proportions over recent years are literally annihilating these endeavours, stopping them in their creative tracks and robbing the environment of the competitiveness of creativity, in a bid to ensure that the market is left with conventional, stereotypical products."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I applaud this document and welcome the fact that Mrs Montfort has had occasion to bring to our attention the important role played by small and medium-sized businesses in Europe."
"In fact, I wonder how much longer we will have to wait until the European Union is empowered to amend the regulations that govern small and medium-sized businesses throughout Europe and above all, when we will see a change in a climate which in 45 years of left-wing or predominantly left-wing government has dampened the entrepreneurial spirit of European companies."
"In many of the Member States, people who set up their own businesses, rather than being viewed as having created at least one job - their own - are sometimes held to be delinquents, profiteers, thieves or tax evaders."
"New companies should be granted exemptions from taxes and charges for a period of at least five years, and we should provide for support to be given to young people setting up in business by an older person who can contribute their experience."
"Concerning the aspect with which I am most familiar - that of pensions and social welfare - entrepreneurs working on their own account should receive as much as people employed by others."
"In many of the 15 Member States, persons working on their own account have lower pensions, lower levels of mutual assistance and less industrial injury insurance."
"This is unjust and I therefore support this report."
"Mr President, I think that Mrs Montfort's very comprehensive report has added considerable strength to the Commission's original document."
"I am a constructive critic of some of Mr Liikanen's efforts - I think the first document that we saw was not really as focused as it should have been."
"Mrs Montfort has brought some valuable focus on the key issues facing small and medium-sized businesses."
"I particularly want to mention the innovation in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which held a hearing on the issues raised in Mrs Montfort's report."
"The more we get people from small and medium-sized businesses across Parliament's threshold talking to us about issues, the better we shall be able to do our job."
"This is something that the Committee on Industry needs to do on a regular basis from now on."
"In my closing remarks in this debate I should like to come back to this question of focus."
"The problem in small and medium-sized businesses is that they do not have a lot of resources to go out and get information, to find out what grants and help are available, to do the sort of administrative tasks that are increasingly being imposed upon them by national governments."
"What we need to consider is the way we make information available to them."
"What I want the Commissioner to address above all in the range of measures that we have proposed here is making access to support and information easy and quick so that people running these businesses will be able to use the information effectively."
"We know that there is a lot of help available across the European Union."
"People are always talking about helping SMEs, as Mr Caudron who is a veteran of this process has reminded us, but we know there are many businesses not taking advantage of the help available."
"A focused, effective, directed and simple set of measures is what we need if this programme is really going to have the effect that it should have."
"Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Montfort, and the European Parliament' s committee for the work done on the draft decision."
"Thank you too for supporting the Commission' s proposal."
"The multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship will constitute a major instrument in support of European businesses."
"It is primarily geared to small and medium-sized businesses."
"It is small businesses that suffer most from obstacles to enterprise."
"The red tape of restrictions and regulations hits them full force."
"That is why we should 'think small first' ."
"It is also the guiding principle of the Charter for Small Enterprises."
"We welcome the principle of amendment with reference to the Charter."
"Many amendments refer to micro-enterprises-enterprises and crafts."
"We welcome the support given to them."
"Account should be taken of that in implementing the programme but there are no grounds for mentioning them separately in the legislative text."
"To achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Summit on entrepreneurship and transition to an information society for all, we need dynamic and competitive businesses."
"They are the only ones that can provide more jobs and better jobs."
"We can only end social exclusion if we have competitive businesses."
"We need entrepreneurs from all sectors of society."
"More women entrepreneurs, more young entrepreneurs and more entrepreneurs from society strata which do not have the representation they deserve."
"They will all have a place of honour in the multiannual programme."
"Growing businesses need the type of financing appropriate to each stage of their life cycle."
"There are gaps in the market which need to be filled, especially at the start-up stage."
"Enlargement and sustainability need to be priorities in all our work."
"The Members of this Parliament have subscribed to those principles."
"We are likewise convinced of their importance."
"We are hoping for a limited number of effective projects, which is much better than spreading them too thinly."
"I am grateful for your support for this approach."
"Thanks to our BEST process, the Commission will identify and implement best practice."
"We will publicise the results widely and keep Parliament informed."
"We also need to give careful thought to the level of European governance best adapted to the various initiatives."
"We have no intention of imposing ourselves on activities which would benefit by being conducted at national level."
"But we will welcome - because we will need it - the participation of the Member States in terms of providing support and information to business on how to access the European market."
"The programme will ensure that the networks provide this information."
"We need advice from the business world and other interest groups in all our efforts."
"We are currently improving our advice structure so as to be able to remain in constant contact with these contributors."
"Mr President, European businesses need a good business environment if they are to develop."
"The multiannual programme will be committed to improving the modus operandi of small and medium-sized businesses."
"Thank you for supporting us in this work."
"Finally, I welcome the idea that we should review the implementation of the programme annually."
"I have a completely open mind as to the form of that review."
"We must think about that together."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6 p.m."
"Action plan for Albania and the neighbouring region"
"The next item is the report (A5-0287/2000) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Draft Action Plan for Albania and neighbouring regions [7886/2000 - C5-0305/2000 - 2000/2158(COS)]."
"Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere stress the need to cooperate with countries of origin and transit of migrants and refugees and, within this framework on the Council's instructions, the High-Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration has drawn up six action plans, one of which is the plan for Albania and the neighbouring region."
"Clearly, the basic objective of the plan is to stem migration towards the Member States of the European Union and repatriate illegal immigrants living in the Union."
"Most of the plan therefore contains measures designed to control and reverse migration flows."
"Obviously cooperation with third countries may help eradicate the causes of waves of refugees and migrants but this does not mean that endeavours in this direction release the Union from its international obligation to protect those in need or to provide help to combat the causes of migration."
"Europeans would do well to remember that the wider the prosperity gap between the Member States of the Union and our neighbours, the greater the pressure to migrate."
"Border fortifications and repressive policing measures will not stem the tide of those seeking a share of the prosperity which we all enjoy."
"Converting the Union into 'Fortress Europe' may put up the price charged by traffickers but, while there is no legal immigration route, it will not stop illegal entry, which is why we need to give Albania all the help we can in fighting poverty, improving the standard of living and employment prospects, setting up democratic institutions and strengthening respect for human rights, especially the rights of minorities, women and children."
"There is an urgent need, following the recent attacks on the Greek minority in Himara, to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in Albania."
"Our basic objective must be to speed up the rate of economic and social development in Albania and to foster its cooperation and peaceful coexistence with neighbouring countries."
"This is the only way of breaking the circle of poverty and violence which results in waves of immigrants and refugees."
"Choosing a preventative policy is not in keeping with the multi-sectoral analysis which should have informed the work of the High-Level Working Group or with the Tampere conclusions, which stress the need for absolute respect for the right to seek asylum based on the application of the Geneva Convention."
"Albania has little experience in questions of asylum and has not yet developed the mechanisms needed to examine applications for asylum and, therefore, cannot yet be considered a secure country for refugees; nor, according to the findings of the UN High Commissioner for refugees, is it economically, politically or socially able to shoulder such a burden."
"Of course, the main problem at the moment is the fragile nature of the Albanian political system, the weak role of parliament, the poor state of the legal and judicial system and the lack of government administration and programming."
"The country is marked by a lack of security in many regions and high crime rates, especially in relation to the drugs and arms trade, which is why we expect cooperation with the Albanian government in applying the measures proposed in the plan to be particularly difficult."
"Efforts are, of course, being made to improve the situation."
"However, as the recent municipal elections demonstrated, Albania, as it emerges from a long period of isolation, still has no democratic tradition and that is where efforts need to focus."
"Another problem is the integration, using specific means, of Albanians legally resident in the Member States."
"So bearing all these problems in mind, the proposals set out in my report include: gradual application of the measures proposed in the action plan, a study of the real needs, such as that contained in the first part, which indicates where the most urgent problems lie; for example, first the economy and democratic institutions need to be developed and infrastructures need to be created in Albania and then the Union can think about signing refugee and migrant repatriation agreements."
"I particularly stress the need to take steps to improve internal security, strengthen dialogue between European officials and local authorities in Albania and, as far as the Commission and Council are concerned, to promote specific action involving cooperation with the Albanian, Italian and Greek authorities."
"At the same time, we need coordinated action, with the maximum cooperation of Europol, in order to put an end to trafficking and prostitution rings dealing in women and children and the actions of criminal gangs involved in trafficking in human beings, whom they then exploit through illicit employment and prostitution."
"Finally, I should like to state that I support the preparatory work to conclude a stability and partnership agreement between the Union and Albania."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I really must express my surprise that the Commission has allowed a high-level Council working group to do the work that it should, in fact, have done after Amsterdam."
"I think that this is a shame, although what the group has done is not wrong because it touches on the right problems and also tries to point out the right possible solutions."
"As Mrs Karamanou has already said, since the opening of the Iron Curtain, which was of course drawn particularly tightly around Albania, it has been one of the most significant countries of origin and transit for immigrants entering the EU."
"Obviously this creates problems."
"However, we also have another problem in Albania."
"A considerable number of Albanians are leaving their homeland because of the instability in their country, because of the social difficulties and because of the pre-modern structures of society and family."
"They are leaving their country, and as they do so a part of the future of this country is lost."
"We need to help to establish a situation in this country which will induce people to stay there, to ensure that security is guaranteed, that there are jobs there and that the people simply do not look for a way out."
"Of course, we also need to prevent Albania from becoming more and more of a trade centre for refugees, drugs and trafficking in women."
"It is a country in which many are involved, in which many neighbours also get their hands dirty."
"That is why we need to help this country."
"We will do so as the European Union."
"We will train the police."
"We will help them with customs, but the problem is that so much is in a mess in this country that obviously progress is only very slow, despite some efforts being made by the government."
"I should like to say just one thing, Mrs Karamanou: if Albania is not a safe country of origin and we treat Albanian refugees differently from others, then neither can Albania claim that it wants to enter into a stability and association agreement with us."
"It has not yet come that far, but I think that it has come further than you suggest."
"For me, Albania is a country to which we can send people back."
"People are not persecuted there."
"All is not yet rosy either, but it is better than you have described"
"Mr President, the action plan states in its analysis that the status quo in Albania is worrying."
"The poor social, economic and political conditions combined with a lack of or insufficient legal certainty and organised crime are causing migration on a huge scale."
"Albania is a significant country of transit and origin for immigration into the European Union."
"On the other hand, positive efforts are being made to drive forward the democratisation process and to develop society, which we must and will support."
"Restricting the number of immigrants coming into the EU from and through Albania is the main aim of the action plan."
"To achieve this, measures are needed which work in two different directions."
"Firstly, the positive forces in Albania need to be supported; secondly, legal instruments need to be created for immigration from this region, which restrict or stop illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, as well as the diverse forms of crime associated with them such as illicit employment and prostitution."
"We need preventative measures specially tailored to Albania, which will provide support for building or rebuilding the country so as to enable people to live in dignity in the region."
"Many reasons for emigrating, seeking asylum and taking flight would thus cease to exist."
"But what we need on the other hand are stringent, uniform legal instruments for immigration in the whole of the European Union."
"These legal instruments cannot, however, include provisions to legalise criminal actions."
"Gangs of smugglers do not provide a service, generously rescuing people from persecution by totalitarian states."
"Paid traffickers, most of whom are involved in large-scale, cross-border organised crime, make cruel profits out of the misfortune and hopes of the people concerned and do not provide magnanimous humanitarian services."
"In this context, the proposal tabled by Mrs Schröder, to make EU aid available to the traffickers, must also be condemned as counterproductive and contemptuous of human life."
"You, Mrs Karamanou, are certainly right because the traffickers are not the root of the evil."
"But the root of the evil is not the European Union either."
"The root of the evil are the conditions in the countries of origin."
"I welcome the action plan, but I cannot support what Mrs Karamanou says in her report because she does not describe the illegal crossing of borders as a criminal act and therefore says that it is legal."
"For us to tackle the causes, however, and not continue just to fight against the symptoms, we need to provide help in the regions concerned and we need to resolve the whole issue of immigration, asylum and war refugees in the European Union by coming up with solutions which do justice to the immigrants but also to the host countries."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, unlike Mrs Pack, I am of the opinion that the more groups that are involved in Albania the better."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs constitutes a forum in which this issue should be discussed, because these are not issues that can be resolved instantaneously, but ones that we will perhaps be confronted with for decades to come."
"It would, therefore, be valuable for the programme that we have before us, and which I feel Mrs Karamanou covers very well in her report, to be subdivided into measures that can be implemented swiftly, medium-term measures and those regarding a legacy of history that we have been combating for 500 years and which will persist for centuries to come."
"The legal instruments selected fall into the bracket of medium-term measures; the issue of a group of honest customs officials and unimpeachable judges is an economic issue as well, and one that will take decades to resolve."
"Recently, we have, thank heavens, seen positive signals emerging from that part of the Balkans that has an indirect impact on Albania."
"The report mentions a remarkable fact - for reasons of brevity I will confine myself to talking about this point alone - which is to say that the action plan for Albania and the neighbouring countries was drawn up by a working party."
"Thus it is that documents have been circulating from one body to the next, and the European Commission, for example, refuses to make public the report concerning inter alia even the Customs Assistance Mission (CAM) established in Albania."
"Here we have another danger linked to the Albanian question: suspicions are being aroused that someone wants to hide something, to cover up something that in fact does not exist."
"Anyone who knows anything about Albania knows that it is somewhat undiplomatic to name the players in public life there, as much can happen in dealings between countries in the throes of change and an industrialised world that has cast itself in the role of aid donor."
"But, Mr President, since everything concerning aid to the Albanians is, in fact, quite clear and transparent, I consider the publication of all the documents pertaining to it to be an act of political honesty, and one that would nip in the bud any self-interested speculation."
"The overarching issue is, of course, that of providing Albania with all the aid that we can, in order to combat crime and make peoples' lives easier, thereby stemming emigration as well."
"Mr President, this is a very good report that is humane in intent, but the aim is nonetheless to stop the flow of human beings from and through Albania."
"The EU has adopted a rather sad refugee policy, which is largely based on the idea that we must close our borders."
"But how is this to be done?"
"Why are people fleeing?"
"Clearly, they are fleeing from oppression, terror and war, but they are also fleeing from chaos and poverty."
"Man' s longing for a better life tomorrow - a better life for himself, but perhaps above all for his children - is one of the very greatest and strongest driving forces."
"We cannot simply attempt to shut out all those who try to get here."
"We need to find better methods."
"The hard method - the police - can be used when it comes to the trade in children and women and to slave labour."
"The tighter the borders we attempt to create, the more insane forms of refugee smuggling we shall see."
"Clearly, there is no instant solution to be found to the entire problem, but in the slightly longer term it is a matter of creating a world of reasonable justice, of security and of opportunities for the future."
"This applies both to the Albanian people and to the people of other areas who attempt, via Albania, to reach the land of milk and honey represented by the European Union."
"Our forefathers went to the United States to create a life in freedom, as they believed."
"We are trying to stand in the way of those who are doing the same thing today."
"It is very sad to realise that, today in Western Europe, we are trying to create laws that would punish those who are hiding Anne Frank' s unborn grandchildren."
"It is quite incredible that we have reached this point."
"Let us try to see the truth with open eyes."
"We shall never be able to live in peace and freedom and with prosperity and justice if we perpetrate this appalling injustice on the very closest neighbours of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Greens of the EFA Group would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Karamanou, on her report; which is very accurate."
"It is indeed the case that measures must be taken with regard to migration, more specifically forced migration, and that the causes must be tackled."
"I would particularly like to highlight the predicament of women and children in Albania."
"First of all, it is tragic how many young people disappear, are kidnapped and leave involuntarily, or sometimes voluntarily."
"There are no children' s rights in Albania, no playing facilities or women' s rights - there is a great deal of violence towards women in the family by the partner or husband - no animal rights and no human rights at all."
"The villages are ecological disaster areas: waste is dumped everywhere, the water is not always drinkable and electricity is deficient."
"The people are, of course, hopeful of better political representation but at present, many people still live in fear; fear of all kinds of things, fear of the outbursts of violence which flare up now and again."
"There is also a chasm between the donors, that is to say all of us, Europe and the United States, who give money, organise projects and such like, and the actual people in the field."
"Another problem which I wanted to touch upon is the problem of the reception of Albanian victims of trafficking in women."
"Although they return to their country, there are no reception facilities for them."
"There is a reception facility at the ICMC for victims from Montenegro, among others, but not for Albanian girls who return from Italy, Greece, Germany, Belgium, etc. The appeal of the NGOs, of the women' s NGOs must be acted upon."
"There is also the threat that they will be picked up again by the traffickers and returned to the countries of destination."
"New life must be injected into the economy and a sound ecological policy must be put in place."
"The issue of schools and child reception must be addressed."
"Aid must be granted to the people who work out there in the field, in NGOs."
"Positive things are being done, the IOM is doing sterling work, so are the European police services, and the KFOR is present, but the local population must also do their bit to develop their country."
"Persecutors must be punished."
"Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the extensive, wide-angled approach in your report."
"Mr President, allow me to start by offering my warmest congratulations to our fellow member Anna Karamanou on the quality of her work and to highlight her comment that the action plan should focus on providing protection to persecuted citizens, who are subject to constant human rights abuses, and not on how to limit and stop migration towards the Member States of the Union."
"We all know that Albania faces acute problems, both as a country and as a society."
"The economic, social and political conditions which prevail in Albania force its citizens to seek in migration literally the only possible hope of survival for them and their families."
"The situation was exacerbated when action by political forces lavishly supported by the European Union resulted in the pyramid scandal in 1997 and robbed the people of their savings and, at the same time, shattered any confidence in the structures and organisation of the Albanian state."
"This situation resulted in a popular uprising which basically abolished the Albanian state, causing huge security, political and economic problems for the Albanian people."
"Massive quantities of arms passed into the hands of uncontrolled gangs which soon set up as mafia-type organised criminal gangs."
"The whole situation was made worse by events in Kosovo and the NATO bombings, which exacerbated the problems in the region."
"To turn a blind eye to this situation and to try and erect walls around your paradise, allegedly to protect it from desperate neighbours is both inhumane and short-sighted."
"Obviously, everyone wants to live in their mother country, provided of course that they can live a secure and dignified life there."
"On the other hand, however, there is no force which can stop a desperate person."
"What we need to do is abandon repressive measures and move in two directions: first, by helping Albania to revive its economy and restore its population there and, secondly, to legalise the Albanian immigrants illegally present in the Union, instead of treating them like second-class citizens and slave labour, and to put them to work where we need them."
"There are jobs in Greece, for example, which, if the Albanian immigrants leave, will remain undone, mainly in the agricultural sector."
"Let us make use of bilateral agreements to define jobs, periods of residency, places of residency, pay, hours, working and national insurance conditions clearly and legally, so that immigrants can prove their strength and help to improve our economies and build friendship and cooperation between peoples, rather than nationalist, cold-war aspirations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Karamanou on her work on what is in fact a very delicate and important matter."
"I think that we need to turn our attention to two - of many - basic issues. The first concerns structures and procedures in Albania and is even more important following recent events and incidents during the municipal elections, incidents directed mainly at the Greek minority living in Albania."
"What happened is proof positive that the European Union' s aim must be to establish structures which will ensure that democratic rules are respected and that the rights of minorities in Albania are recognised and respected."
"The second issue is the really huge and complex issue of migration."
"It is a very important issue which is being shaped by historical, social, political and economic factors."
"Because the problem is complex, we need to respond to it with a complex policy, a policy which brooks no simplifications, a policy which will result in a new legal framework, because a legal framework is a constituent element of a state, but a legal framework which is dynamic and solves problems rather than confining itself to simple repressive action, even where they are the effects of application of the law."
"I think that the time is now right to adopt and impose these measures."
"We have reached a stage where the conditions are in place and we all accept that if we do so we will be providing a huge service."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that an action plan has been drawn up for Albania and I also welcome my colleague's - Mrs Karamanou's - committed report."
"On the basis of her analysis of the political and economic situation in Albania, it is possible for us to reach a better understanding of the causes of the migratory movements and to develop corresponding measures."
"I do regret, however, the fact that this action plan, and also the other action plans which have been drawn up, are characterised above all by measures aimed at control and repression."
"Albania is one of the poorest countries in the world and has itself taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees."
"At present, there is a heavy stream of refugees returning which the lack of security, law and order is actually impeding."
"Some of the people being sent back have integrated well."
"Young people are having to interrupt their training and are facing an uncertain future."
"This is an ill-advised policy."
"The reintegration of the refugees must therefore take place under safe and humane conditions."
"For this to be the case, it is absolutely essential to draw up plans for a coordinated repatriation operation and, above all, to involve non-governmental and international organisations."
"I still judge the situation in Albania to be very serious because of the political instability, the disregard for laws and the extremely high levels of crime."
"Year after year, especially in summer, thousands of people risk their lives on their way to the EU."
"In so doing, hundreds of these refugees die at sea."
"We will never know the true death toll."
"Italy's 7 000-kilometre-long coastal border is difficult to police and offers gangs of traffickers, who proceed with remarkable contempt for human life, huge scope for their activities."
"Criminals, who exploit the refugees' affliction, must be punished."
"The toughest possible action needs to be taken against trafficking in human beings - in particular in small children - and the exploitation of people for illicit work and prostitution."
"But anyone who thinks that controlling the traffickers alone would contribute to stopping illegal immigration is mistaken."
"We need to step up the dialogue between the various negotiating and advisory forums and we need better coordination."
"Only in this way can we together contribute to combating the exploitation of refugees by traffickers."
"The Community must support Albania in its efforts to strengthen the rule of law, and also, particularly where financial support is concerned - I should like to stress this - we must not leave Albania and the region to fend for themselves."
"Finally, I would take this opportunity to call on the Council once again to take steps to bring the policy on immigration, asylum and combating trafficking in human beings entirely within the Community system."
"Mr President, it is very important for the sake of European stability to assist Albania and its neighbouring regions."
"Helping democracy to take root and establishing the rule of law are vital."
"We cannot forget nations that are in distress: our duty is to support them to the best of our ability."
"The action programme for Albania and its neighbouring regions will enable us to increase stability in the area."
"The main area of focus must not be how the flood of immigrants and refugees may be brought under control, but how conditions in the region can be improved so that people can stay in their homes."
"Albania, and Kosovo in particular, are not yet regions at peace, however, which means that the repatriation of refugees must take place in a controlled way, so that their safety is not jeopardised."
"The situation of the Kosovo Albanians has long been very difficult, and it is a great relief that, at last, their rights are being recognised."
"But it is just as essential to protect the rights of the minorities in Kosovo: the Serbs and the Romanies."
"It will be a long but necessary process to bring about reconciliation between the national groups."
"Only in forgiveness is there a revolutionary basis for building the future."
"Economic growth enables difficulties to be overcome in crisis areas."
"It is not enough merely to pile up aid: we need enterprise at grassroots level and we need to encourage people to stand on their own two feet."
"People with the same business affairs in common are peacefully bound to one another."
"Money, as is well known, brings peace."
"The EU CARDS programme is of the utmost importance in this situation, as, without a system of administration that functions properly, nothing works."
"We must help them to help themselves."
"Right now the region needs a guiding hand."
"The EU, as a partner of the Balkans, has a huge responsibility for the future of the region."
"We must put an end to selfishness and see our destinies bound together."
"Mr President, when about two months ago I proposed that Paragraph 6 of the report should include a reference to the need to improve the security and protection of ethnic minorities and the rapporteur, whom I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate on her work, accepted my proposal, I was of course thinking of the generally poor record of this country in its dealings with minorities on its territory, especially the Greek minority."
"However, I must admit that even I did not imagine that we would have such overwhelming confirmation quite so soon of the poor conduct of the Albanian authorities."
"Its undisguised violence and forgery at the expense of the Greek minority candidates and voters during the recent elections, as witnessed by objective official international observers, demonstrated that, unfortunately, Albania has little respect for even its most rudimentary obligations as it makes its way towards the European Union, at the very time when Albania itself is calling on the international community to intervene, including militarily, in the defence of oppressed Albanian minorities in third countries and demanding that all the human rights of Albanian migrants, including illegal immigrants, be guaranteed, a demand which we all feel it is advisable for us to attempt to satisfy, and rightly so."
"Greece is a typical example; despite providing various forms of generous support to the post-Communist Albanian regime and receiving and welcoming thousands of Albanian immigrants and illegal immigrants, it must now watch as the large historic Greek minority in Albania is systematically persecuted and its rudimentary human, political and cultural rights are repeatedly violated."
"All this and the unacceptable events in Himara give us cause, I think, to make a very careful assessment of just how able and willing Albania is to take on the accepted European criteria in the areas of human rights and democratic freedoms and, by extension, to modulate and adjust our general approach, our action plans and the various benefits which we provide this country accordingly until such time it revises its policy."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Dimitrakopoulos that the central issue in respect of the problems in Albania - be these of an economic, social or internal security nature - continues to be that of helping that country to reinstate the rule of law, bring security to the citizens, and restore the credibility of institutions and local administrations."
"Without this rise in the democratic barometer in that country, and in view of the latest electoral shenanigans and the denunciation of the gerrymandering that went on at that time, it is clear there can be no other way of ever resolving Albania' s problems."
"I welcome the fact that the report at last takes into account and develops two points to which we Italians attach great importance."
"Firstly, an unstable Albania means instability in the Balkans and an unstable Balkans means instability for Europe."
"This is an awareness that we must all help to foster."
"Secondly, another reality is that the pressures brought about by migration and the fight against criminality, both of which originate in Albania, cannot be shouldered by Italy and Greece alone."
"I have heard many declarations of solidarity and willingness to help, but I must remind you that the only real solidarity shown so far has come from people living in border areas within Italy and by local institutions."
"I have seen no sign of this solidarity that is supposed to bind Europe, now that it has come to sharing the problems of another people."
"However, what I cannot accept in this report, and I will state this quite frankly, is that it confuses cause and effect, which is to say it confuses a procedure for the carefully considered issuing of visas, and hence the possibility of migration, with a cause, that of illegal immigration."
"Things are completely the reverse, so let us not confuse cause and effect."
"Above all, I find it unacceptable and negative vis-à-vis Albania that we should in a sense intimate that illegal immigration could be tolerated."
"This is something of which Albania has no need."
"What Albania does need from us is tangible economic aid and genuine solidarity, but also a little firmness, because it must, with our assistance, go about reconstructing for itself a framework for the rule of law."
"Mr President, for many people in the EU, Albania is far away, further than the back of beyond, and yet the Albanians are one of the oldest European civilisations."
"In the Middle Ages they fought against the Ottoman invasion and they defended themselves against them as Europeans until well into modern times."
"They have suffered particularly badly from European disregard."
"In the nineteenth century, better prospects were held out for all the Balkan nations at the Congress of Berlin in 1878."
"In Berlin, the Albanians were almost brushed aside from the table - their views were not taken into account - and in the twentieth century, they have suffered greatly under one of the most terrible ideologies of the twentieth century, namely under socialism and communism in a particularly brutal manifestation."
"That is why, today, we have a European responsibility for this European Albania."
"That is why I welcome the line taken in the report and the approach adopted by the action plan."
"However, we need to make absolutely certain that we do not operate double standards."
"Much has been said here about minority rights."
"I should like to say that we are right to demand minority rights of the Albanians."
"But if we do so then we must also introduce them across the European Union."
"We have not managed to do this."
"We do not have any European standards on the protection of minorities."
"In all Albania's neighbouring countries - apart from Kosovo, where the Albanians are in a majority - we have Albanian minorities, and we can demonstrate here what the EU's standards on minorities are."
"I should like to make a second point. Like Mr Lisi, I believe that we need to incorporate burden-sharing in our policy on asylum and refugees."
"But the problem is that we have fought for this very point, and neither in this House nor in the European Union have we achieved a majority in favour of a system of burden-sharing based on quotas."
"Precisely in the case of Albania we see that it can affect any Member State."
"That is why it is important for us not to spend any longer tinkering about with the symptoms, but for us finally to establish a policy on asylum and refugees based on solidarity, with fixed quotas and a stable system of burden-sharing, before catastrophe strikes."
"Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council at Tampere called for firmer external action in the area of legal and internal affairs."
"The action plan being discussed is a major measure to strengthen external action."
"The enormous institutional changes that came out of the Treaty of Amsterdam have had an impact on the way asylum and migration are dealt with."
"The Community can now respond to the demands of the European Council by making use of its new powers regarding foreign policy and its programmes connected with external relations."
"In connection with the Stability and Association process we are discussing issues of immigration with the Albanians as equal partners."
"There should be similar sorts of discussions going on in the region as a whole."
"Since 1991, Albania has been granted a total of 750 million euros in multi-sectoral aid within the framework of the PHARE programme."
"In the last two years the country has been granted an additional 250 million euros in humanitarian aid under the ECHO programme."
"Legal and internal affairs are an important element in the CARDS programme that followed PHARE."
"We wish to emphasise in particular the fact that we fully support the comprehensive approach and aim on the part of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration to discover the real reasons for enforced movements of population."
"The General Affairs Council adopted the first five action plans last October, and they concern Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco, and Iraq."
"The action plan for Albania and its neighbouring regions was adopted in June this year and it is thus the sixth in order."
"The European Council at Tampere urged the Council and the Commission to report on the progress of the Working Group' s work in December this year."
"The report will discuss the action programme for Albania and its neighbouring regions in detail."
"The draft is being discussed today in the Council."
"The Commission is playing an active part in compiling the report."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Karamanou, and the whole Committee for this very thorough report and I hope that the Council will give consideration to the points of view expressed in it."
"I wish to raise three points for consideration, which the Commission regards as particularly important."
"Firstly, the Commission supports a balanced, impartial approach to the measures proposed and to their implementation."
"In this, we are of the same opinion as the rapporteur."
"Secondly, the situation seems to be excellent as far as the aims in the action plan for the year 2000 are concerned."
"The Commission has been involved in drafting the report on the implementation of the action plan."
"We also want to thank the Member States for their input with regard to this work."
"As I have already said, the Community aims to implement its aid programmes as efficiently as possible."
"This provides the focus for the work of the Union as a whole."
"Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its way of implementation must be observed regionally."
"The Stability Pact for South-East Europe offers an excellent forum for this."
"The parties to the Stability Pact have already delivered several opinions along these lines."
"We may also adopt a more optimistic attitude towards the summit to be held next month in Zagreb."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6 p.m."
"Better lawmaking"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you for still being here to take part in this debate this Thursday afternoon."
"I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market very much for the constructive and in-depth discussion we had on this subject."
"I am also most grateful for the supporting opinions of the other committees, and should like to express my thanks to Mr van den Berg of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr Candal of the Committee on Petitions."
"Indeed, we had a very earnest and also very self-critical debate about the quality of European lawmaking and the application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"What conclusions did we draw?"
"We established that the quality of lawmaking leaves much to be desired, particularly in the eyes of the public."
"There, frustration with, but also alienation from, European law becomes apparent from time to time, and we should like to urge Parliament, but also the other Community institutions, not to shy away from paying painstaking attention to detail here, to work with precision, and also to make the necessary time and staff available to do this."
"But it is not only the quality of lawmaking which is crucial; we also need to be shrewd about the quantity of lawmaking, because not every problem in Europe is automatically a problem for the European Union."
"We expressly declare our support for the points made by the Commission in its strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005. It says that we need to concentrate on our core tasks."
"It can, nonetheless, be a painful process to give up dossiers on which one has been working. Unfortunately, examples from the very recent past show that the Commission, and also the European Parliament, do not always succeed."
"You will remember the provisions recently presented to us on climbing ladders."
"I remember standards for ship survey organisations - I hope that I am not causing the interpreters problems - and I remember a proposal for a Directive on ambient noise which actually intends to produce noise cards for the whole of the European Union."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market explicitly calls on the Commission to resist the legislative pressure to which it has itself objected."
"This is no excuse for doing things which are actually superfluous."
"But of course, this request is also directed at ourselves to be sparing with European regulation."
"We are helped here by the principle of subsidiarity which, in the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, should also be applied when deciding whether to make a particular matter the subject of internal market legislation."
"This principle should also be observed in full for green and white papers and for action programmes."
"The European Union cannot claim to have a monopoly on competence here."
"Here, too, specific authorisation is required, together with thorough verification of compliance with subsidiarity."
"On this occasion, we have also discussed a tendency which we find worrying, which is for more and more decisions to be taken away from the institutions which actually have the democratic legitimacy to do this."
"The introductory comments in the Commission's White Paper on good governance set us thinking."
"If then a comprehensive set of networks is to be formed, if more soft law is enacted, if interpretative guidelines are adopted by the Commission and if many issues are resolved by agreement between the parties concerned, then this may well all be justified, but it cannot impinge on the responsibility of the legislator."
"We ask the Commission here quite specifically to observe the clear demarcation of responsibilities both between the EU and the Member States and within the institutions."
"With this report we want to send out a signal to the public that we are taking their complaints about the deficient quality of lawmaking and the complaints about over-regionalisation and centralism seriously."
"I would ask you to help us to send out this signal, and to vote in favour of this report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, may I first, on behalf of my group, congratulate the rapporteur very warmly on his report, which certainly gives a very good, consistent and comprehensive picture of the situation as he sees it."
"Nevertheless, my group tabled a large number of amendments both in committee and in the plenary, and the fact that it did so is no reflection on the quality of the report, but because we are, after all - particularly on the issue of the scope of the principle of subsidiarity - of a different political opinion."
"We want a strong union which takes full responsibility for the tasks incumbent on it, which creates a well-functioning internal market and which actually makes it possible to strengthen social and regional cohesion."
"It has to be possible for the Community to act wherever this makes it possible to achieve improved and increased European added value."
"It is particularly important for this strength of acting at Community level to be emphasised at this time."
"Firstly because, in view of the forthcoming enlargement, we are in especial need of a strong European Union if we want to help the future new Member States and their peoples, and also if we want to overcome the many crucial tests facing us in our Member States."
"Secondly, we in the European Parliament, of all people, should be emphasising European togetherness and the Community aspect, particularly at a time when we are seeing that the commitment of the governments of many Member States to this is declining, and that short-sighted, egotistical nationalism and a desire to go it alone are gaining increasing ground."
"But it is precisely when we want the creative power of the Community to be at work in all the central and important European issues, and when this is also accepted and supported by the public, that it is certainly necessary for us to concentrate more than ever on the essential points and to delete a good many of the points from our present agenda."
"I am also convinced, if we can agree on what is necessary and right, that it would be better to do this on a case-by-case basis and to remove anything superfluous from the agenda."
"It is certainly easier to make pragmatic decisions in individual cases than it is in general reports and debates of principle."
"This is particularly true of the principle of subsidiarity, but it also applies to the quality of legislation."
"Instead of having abstract arguments about general principles, we should consider the necessity of individual projects more often in this House and we should also invest more time and resources in legislative quality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first and foremost like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling for the work he has invested in his report."
"It is of course quite a significant topic, although this is not immediately evident from the small number of members present in this Chamber to continue with the debate."
"This Parliament produces European legislation much like a conveyer belt."
"All too often, however, we are forced to conclude that this European legislation is packaged in a language which is too technical, too legal and too complex, so much so that this European legislation becomes unusable, as a result of which the intended goal, namely to make legislation in the European Union transparent and unambiguous, is not achieved."
"European legislation must be a flexible and practical instrument which also becomes accessible to the average citizen pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity and reasonableness."
"I was delighted to note that Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6, which I tabled myself, have been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Indeed, the objective of these amendments is to continually evaluate the subsidiarity reports, to check on a regular basis whether they are up-to-date and to investigate beforehand whether certain regulations and/or directives are indeed useful."
"I am also in favour of making codified proposals with regard to amendments to existing EC legislation, so that the amendments can be integrated into the existing directives or regulations."
"Finally, I am an advocate of setting up some kind of scoreboard for redundant legislation."
"It is beyond question that redundant legislation needs to be abolished, for it is indeed not sufficient to restrict the inflation of legislation; rules and regulations must also be drafted in clear language and the obligations pursuant to these must be easily understood."
"I therefore hope that the report will be adopted without further amendment, by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and that it will be a useful instrument to simplify European legislation and to render it transparent and effective."
"Mr President, it is a great pleasure to have the opportunity of commenting on this report by Mr Wuermeling and on the fundamental underlying question of making our law in Europe good law and clear law."
"I congratulate Mr Wuermeling on his report."
"Etienne Dumont and his great English master, Jeremy Bentham, were inclined to make the point that since laws are always in some measure coercive, they are always in some measure evil."
"They may be necessary evils where they control yet greater evil; but they should only do so proportionately to the evil to be met and dealt with."
"We can accept this point and this report reflects that spirit, in demanding clarity of law, simplicity of law and proportionality of the legal means to the public end sought."
"In addition, and vitally, the report raises the issue of subsidiarity, which is in some measure controversial in this Chamber tonight."
"Subsidiarity, indeed, comes from the work of Pope Pius IX and therefore from an enemy of the Benthamite approach to law."
"But here two different traditions of thought come together."
"It is not a good thing to take decision-making away from the most local level at which it can be efficiently exercised, whether that be the level of the individual, the family, the village, the town or whatever."
"I receive letters from time to time, one only last week from one of my constituents living in a remote part of the West Highlands of Scotland."
"He said to me: ""What are you people out there doing?"
"For 2000 years or more people have been safely drinking the water from the burns (the little rivers), and now they are prohibited from doing so."
"Elaborate schemes of water purification are imposed upon them to no public good."""
"I hear similar things from residents of the Island of Islay, where the proposal for the protection of the local seal colony by a grand international body is resented, because the people have looked after the seals better for the last 2000 years than we think a grander organisation is likely to do in the future."
"The point is made."
"Law should be made close to the people, and local knowledge, whenever it is the most relevant knowledge, should always be applied, rather than the grand over-arching scheme."
"It is, however, also true that there are some public goods that can be pursued only at the most general level and there are, indeed, aspects of environment protection, aspects of species protection, for example, aspects also of single market law, aspects of law against protectionism, aspects of law to govern the Internet, which can only be approached at a level at least as general as the European level."
"The principle of subsidiarity, properly understood, points us in both directions: take decisions at the lowest level possible, but acknowledge that the lowest level possible may be indeed a very high level, when general goods are at stake that will be lost unless protected on the same terms everywhere."
"So that makes this stress upon subsidiarity very important."
"I think my friend Mr Medina, and his colleagues, are wrong in saying that this is only a political principle."
"It is a constitutional principle and, like all constitutional principles, it has on the one side a political impact when we, the legislator, decide what law to make; but it has, on the other hand, a legal impact when it comes to the question of how the courts should interpret and apply the law."
"May I finally commend to the House Amendment No 1 which asks that the Commission and the European Union take seriously the fact that we have, as well as the Union of the States, autonomous self-governing communities within."
"I represent Scotland in this House."
"Scotland and England formed the United Kingdom by Treaty in 1707 and have maintained it since then."
"For 290 years, however, Scots law, which remained a distinct body of law mid-way between the civil law of continental Europe and the common law of England and the Americas, retained a distinct system but was legislated only from Westminster."
"We have created a Scottish Parliament in the last year."
"Scots private law has been sent back home; Scots criminal law has been sent back home."
"It would be an irony indeed if, at the very moment of achieving that, we were to transfer the whole of legislative power over private and criminal and commercial law to the Union."
"I do not think that is what is intended or will happen."
"But it is important to bear in mind the interests of subsidiarity at levels below the Member States, as well as between the Member States and the Union, and there is no reason at all why the constitutional principle that is at stake cannot be interpreted widely and generously at all levels of this great Union."
"Mr President, I think we should be very pleased with the quality of this report."
"Our fellow citizens often see subsidiarity as a vague concept, but they can certainly appreciate its proper application."
"Mr Wuermeling has made an excellent presentation of subsidiarity, guaranteeing decision-making at the most relevant level."
"We would actually like the Commission to give us more details on the proper application of this principle for each proposal, so that a real balance sheet can be drawn up at the time of the annual report."
"It would also be very worthwhile if the Commission could make an inventory of the existing body of law in the light of that principle, to make it simpler, more transparent, more effective and more relevant, and to repeal superfluous texts, as Paragraph 6 of this report invites it to do."
"For example there is Directive 79/409, which has prompted the tabling of a written statement on the management of wild birds, already signed by a large number of Members."
"A text like that needs revision when it no longer responds to its initial objective and has become out of date and inappropriate, otherwise it will be a source of disputes as harmful as they are unpopular."
"While I share the rapporteur' s concern about quality legislation, I am even more concerned than him about real complementarity between our Parliament and the national parliaments."
"They must be asked to participate fully in a better application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Who better than they to assess what they are actually in a position to achieve at national level and what should be done jointly at European level?"
"The Heads of State and Government, to whom this report is addressed, will have an excellent opportunity at the IGC to assess which measures should be taken at European level and which at national level."
"In conclusion, I would say that while I find certain amendments very constructive, I wonder about the logic of certain others which seem to ignore the reality and importance of a principle enshrined in the Treaties."
"Mr President, Mr Wuermeling has done a first-class job on this report."
"In presenting a report calling for simpler and clearer lawmaking he certainly had to match his expectations of that with the quality of the work he produced himself."
"The report is a model of concise and clear drafting and I hope colleagues will take that very seriously indeed."
"I want to reinforce the points that have been made about subsidiarity but I want to put them in the broader frame of the reform of the European Commission."
"It is quite clear from all the communications we have seen, and particularly the importance that the Commission is rightly attaching to matching competences with resources, that the Commission itself realises that it has to produce less legislation and that it has to think about putting more resources into enforcing what it has already done."
"Arguably we have too much law in place now that is improperly enforced."
"If we have law in place that is not being properly enforced, it is not effective at all."
"We need to look at that as part of the review that is called for here."
"I attach considerable importance to this point and I particularly welcome the emphasis that Mr Wuermeling has given to aspects of scrutiny by national parliaments."
"One major problem in the European Union, and this particularly impacts on this committee from the internal market viewpoint, is what has now become widely called the gold-plating of European Union legislation."
"It is not enough for the Commission simply to look at transpositions into national law."
"It has to look at what national parliaments have done with that legislation."
"There are many examples where we see that a comparatively simple piece of simple market legislation - a common standard, a single principle - has become over-complex, over-enforced at national level and has caused considerable difficulties."
"I would ask the Commission to have a serious look at this problem of gold-plating."
"Let us take, shall we say, six clear examples and look at how they have been transposed in detail, how they operate within the countries, how they are being enforced and make a really clear and transparent assessment of the effectiveness of the legislation, because if legislation is not effective, then we have all wasted our time."
"Mr President, I should first like to recall the kind reference Mr MacCormick made to my intervention in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr MacCormick stated - it is, in fact, true - that I had said that the principle of subsidiarity was not a legal principle but rather a political principle."
"Having studied the report with great care, I have come to the conclusion that it is not even a political principle: it is a theological principle."
"Mr MacCormick, himself, has just pointed out that the principle was expressed by a pope, and it is clear that it is impregnated with theological considerations."
"I should like to recall that in the seventeenth century a great Dutch lawyer, Hugo Groot, better known as Grotius, one of the founders of international law, warned theologians to stay out of legal matters with that famous phrase, 'Silete, theologi, in munere alieno.'"
"At these moments I should like to express my sympathy, my admiration and my pity for the Commission for having to live with this kind of principle."
"The second paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is utterly unintelligible."
"This definition is a circular definition, not a legal definition."
"It states that 'In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.'"
"Nobody can understand that."
"Neither can anybody understand the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam to define subsidiarity, nor Declaration No 30."
"The poor Commission has made a very commendable effort with the documents 'Better Lawmaking 1998' and 'Better Lawmaking 1999' , in which it tries to be tolerant with this nonsense approved by the governments in the Treaty on European Union and the added Protocol."
"The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did not gain much enthusiasm from its Members."
"The proof is that, of the 17 Members on the Committee, 8 voted in favour and 9 abstained."
"In other words there were more abstentions than votes in favour."
"The reason why there was so much abstention is that we Socialist Members on the Committee - and some other Members - were expressing our scepticism regarding the overvaluing of the subsidiarity concept in the report."
"The subsidiarity concept as put forward in the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is a concept which has been exalted to heavenly heights, and therefore as a theological principle it lies beyond the scope of the Community."
"We have submitted 12 amendments to the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"We also support Amendment No 13 by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"We hope the House can accept our amendments, and if so we shall vote in favour."
"Otherwise we shall be obliged to vote against."
"Mr President, I will use this brief intervention to support the amendment tabled by Mr McCormick, which I believe has the merit, in this case, of having pinpointed the fact that the principle of subsidiarity, besides being a legal principle and, perhaps, besides being a theological principle, is certainly a principle of great existential importance, which is to say that it can immediately be related to the daily lives of our citizens."
"What in fact is the state, or in any case a governmental body, if not the fruit of a pact for freedom between the citizens?"
"In this sense, if there has been a pact for freedom, the state is the guarantor of any attempts that its citizens make to meet their own needs, it is not the master of them."
"If it is a guarantor and not a master, it immediately follows that in the structure created by Mr Wuermeling, under which powers would be devolved to the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, what should subsequently be guaranteed is that an identical process must also be followed by these same Member States."
"Observance of the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be guaranteed right down to the smallest communities, to autonomous units, to intermediate groups, social groups, families and citizens who are the only true sovereign power when it comes to legislative and administrative action."
"It is for this reason that I would like to state my support for Amendment No 1 to Paragraph 11a, tabled by Mr McCormick, which would seem to reproduce and propose in a sound and upright manner an interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity that is not theological but constitutional, as it should be."
"Mr President, the truth is that with this report and a few opinions something has occurred that reveals how complicated it can be to legislate or even just deal with reports in this Parliament."
"I drew up an opinion within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs which in principle was linked to this report, but it ended up referring to a different report on the SLIM project."
"Regardless of the reasons that may have caused this mistake, it is certain that it is motivated by the constant initiatives, originating in the Commission, that are carried out with regard to legislation."
"The Commission is aware of the inadequacies of Community legislation and so continually issues documents saying that we have to legislate better or we have to simplify the legislation."
"I referred to this in the report on the SLIM project, because Community legislation - and Mr Medina has just proved it by reading out one of the articles of the Treaty - is difficult to understand, even for the experts."
"Mr President, any of the observations I made about the SLIM report could equally apply here."
"And I say this from within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is the one most concerned about the proliferation of legislation and the lack of clarity in these texts."
"Yet the little confidence we may have in the improvement of legislation does not lead us to the same interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity that the People' s Party on the right of this House has reached."
"If we took this line of reasoning to the extreme, we could ask the Community not to do whatever the Member State can do."
"Coming down from this, we have just heard Mr Mauro support the idea that the family should do everything, that the municipalities should do everything, and any kind of administration should disappear."
"This would be anarchy, an idea that we, of course, do not share."
"Mr President, first of all I apologise to you, the Commission and all my colleagues for being late, but I have come from another meeting and could not get here any earlier."
"Several accomplished speakers from the European People' s Party have already taken the floor to express the views of the group."
"Let me, then, give an overall view."
"First of all, I think, of course, that the Commission' s work is laudable and often extremely difficult."
"In this document entitled 'Better Lawmaking' there are barely two paragraphs on subsidiarity."
"This is evidently related to the difficulty of this principle, which we have even described as theological."
"Nevertheless I believe we have to insist that as it is in the Treaty it is a principle that can stand before the Court of Justice."
"It is true that we do not yet have a case based on a breach of the principle of subsidiarity, but it is there and we cannot ignore that."
"In other words, Mr President, the principle of subsidiarity is probably the principle that fuses, brings together and sums up what the building of Europe is all about, because ultimately it is nothing but the political will that is included in the Treaty."
"An understanding of the principle of subsidiarity depends greatly on what the political will is at any moment."
"I am therefore not very enthusiastic about certain aspects of the report, because I would have liked the report to have been more 'communitising' as regards the internal market, and on this point, especially, these are clearly not the prevailing winds in the report."
"As regards the rest, Mr President, the report deals with other issues that are not on the same level."
"Codification and simplification are important and laudable issues, but only a matter of good legal technique."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to provide us next year with a report on the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity with all its consequences, and another report on the implementation of good administrative and legislative techniques."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing me, as rapporteur for this report, to make one additional comment on Amendment No 8 which was tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Much has been said about subsidiarity being a theological principle."
"I should like to recall a speech by John Paul II of four weeks ago in which he explicitly welcomed the fact that the principle of subsidiarity was being applied politically."
"I should like to recommend to all colleagues that they follow this wise piece of advice."
"That was not a procedural motion but I think you are entitled, as rapporteur, to make that point clear."
"I give the floor to the Commissioner."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their work on better lawmaking."
"We are dealing with an extremely important issue."
"We must always ask ourselves whether we need legislation to solve a problem."
"The second question is, if we need legislation, should it be at European level or national level?"
"Thirdly, if we decide to legislate at European level, how can we guarantee that the legislation is simple, clear and can be transposed?"
"Fourthly, is there any way other than legislation of meeting the same objective at European level, such as soft law, a code of conduct or co-regulation?"
"I also agree with the report and views expressed in the discussion here that enlargement will present a major challenge vis-à-vis the quality of legislation, owing to the economic, social and legal problems which the new Member States will bring with them."
"This must be respected and taken into consideration by EU legislators."
"Subsidiarity, proportionality, better quality legislation, simple regulation, increased codification: all must become major political issues on which we will focus."
"Actually, this screening of the existing acquis communautaire is often a very useful exercise in showing that it is not always necessary to legislate at Community level or whether a law is too detailed for legislation at the Community level."
"I do not want to go into a deep discussion about the theological or political history of subsidiarity."
"What is important for the EU institutions is that we have a strong commitment to improving the quality of legislation, especially with regard to subsidiarity."
"The Commission is making both political and internal efforts to incorporate subsidiarity into legislative proposals."
"The initiative to prepare a White Paper on governance, for example, is an attempt to promote the principle of subsidiarity at all levels."
"The rapporteur mentioned the question of soft law recommendations or other agreements."
"I think they are extremely important issues to discuss."
"I see here some colleagues of yours who played a considerable part in the regulation on the information society and the Internet."
"Is it possible to regulate the issues when technology moves extremely fast?"
"Is there a risk that we will put brakes on development if we legislate?"
"Is there a risk that technology will move so fast that the problem will have changed before legislation is ready?"
"That is the area where we must look at issues with a very open mind."
"I will take a very personal position by saying that there can be new types of governance here, where regulation and self-regulation can be complementary and not alternatives."
"But what is important for voluntary agreements or self-regulation is that they must be implemented, we must know that they are enforced, we must know how we can monitor that what has been agreed has happened."
"Then it is important to see what the European Parliament's role should be in discussions: there can perhaps be open discussions, debates, dialogue, which guarantee that the European Parliament is part of the debate."
"However, the more we go into the details of information technology, the rapid changes on the Internet, the more convinced I am personally that detailed regulation is not the solution to this problem or, if it is a solution to something, it is not the problem which is faced by information technology."
"There are also other areas of the internal market regulations which are very complicated."
"I will just mention so-called pedestrian-friendly cars, which the Commission will discuss in a few weeks time."
"This directive could be 64 pages long, extremely detailed, mathematical, and involve a lot of engineering expertise."
"Is that an area where we should go for detailed regulation, with guarantees that will be implemented everywhere or should we consider whether a voluntary agreement, provided that it can be enforced and controlled, as an alternative?"
"These are the kind of debates that we need to go through in the next few years."
"I hope that this report, which we Commissioners were given last year, will in future include subsidiarity, better regulation and assessment of alternatives, while respecting the legislative authority of the Council and Parliament."
"Finally, I want to take into account the criticism which we have seen in Parliament's report."
"It is concise and clear."
"I will transmit the message to my colleagues in the Commission and the Commission will do its best to react positively to these in the preparation of the next report."
"I hope that we can continue this debate so that it is not only a routine matter on Thursday afternoon but part of the central debate on Community legislation as a whole."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.27 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)"
"Vote"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution.)"
"Report (A5-0287/2000) by Mrs Karamanou on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the Draft Action Plan for Albania and the neighbouring region [7886/2000 - C5-0305/2000 - 2000/2158(COS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution.)"
"Sylla (GUE/NGL)."
"(FR) Mr President, forgive me for interrupting the sitting, but the news reaching us from the Ivory Coast is extremely grave, with civil war breaking out at this very moment between supporters of Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara."
"This morning we asked the President to send our congratulations to the self-proclaimed candidates, but I think we ought to be calling for democratic elections to be held that include all the parties which were excluded by the military junta. The alternative is the risk of seeing an inevitable slide towards a total balkanisation of the region."
"I voted in favour of the report, despite the fact that I did not get a number of amendments through, because it also concerns the excessively high exchange and transfer costs in the euro area."
"On 4 July, the Commission issued a warning to banks in Belgium, Finland, Portugal and Ireland on account of anti-competitive practices in connection with their exchange charges for currencies in the euro area."
"It sent statements of objections to nearly 120 banks and banking associations."
"The banks were given until the beginning of October to reply, but at the same time it was made clear to them that the Commission would severely punish agreements to fix charges, which would stand in the way of introducing the euro notes and coins and harm the consumer."
"Since 1 January 1999, exchange rates have been irrevocably fixed."
"It is understandable that the public is disappointed about the continuing high charges, because since this time the banks have no longer been faced with exchange-related risks."
"These charges still exist, both for exchanging cash and for making cross-border payments."
"In light of the fact that we are now living in a single market with a single currency, it is unacceptable that these excessive charges should continue to exist."
"This continuing state of affairs could have an adverse effect on the public's attitude towards the euro and its acceptance of it."
"If the banks do not cooperate and continue to levy high charges in the euro area, there is a grave danger that consumers will call into question the point and purpose of the euro."
"I would call on the banks to adopt the standards developed by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) as soon as possible, because these will allow cross-border payment instructions to be forwarded directly and automatically between banks."
"A survey in the 11 countries of the euro area has shown that consumers still have to pay costs of an average of EUR 17.10 to transfer EUR 100 between Member States."
"This intolerable state of affairs must be brought to an end as soon as possible."
"Banks and credit institutions need to do far more to reduce the costs of transferring small amounts between the Member States."
"I would make a firm plea for transfers to be made less expensive, more efficient and more reliable."
"Following the introduction of the quasi euro, everyone has noticed that withdrawing money from their bank accounts becomes more expensive when they cross the border."
"The old exchange rate difference between buying and selling has been replaced by a fixed levy per money withdrawal."
"If, in 15 months' time, the same coins and notes are introduced in 11 Member States, it will be more expensive to get hold of that single currency outside the country in which you live."
"The same irritation is felt when it comes to the high bank charges for small non-domestic payments."
"For the people living in our countries, the borders are simply maintained, even if the countries pass many of their powers to the European Union, and national banks merge across the borders."
"Apart from the UEN, which is acting as a mouthpiece for the French banks, every group is in loud protest against this state of affairs."
"But what do we do about it?"
"Commissioner Bolkestein replied that he believes the problem can be solved by research and free competition rather than price regulation."
"His passivity is the best guarantee for permanent charges and continuing frustration."
"As long as banks are only designed to make huge profits and are not brought under democratic control, this abuse will continue to exist."
"Karamanou report (A5-0287/2000)"
"Mr President, we took a great deal of care over preparing the Karamanou report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I should like to thank Mrs Karamanou for the effort which she put into this."
"In the process, we reached compromises with which we were not always satisfied but which, by and large, were acceptable."
"This makes it all the more disappointing that this report has been completely transformed into an ideological report by one unacceptable amendment - Amendment No 18 - tabled by Baroness Ludford."
"That is why we had to reject this report, and I should like to say to the Liberal Group that this will put a permanent strain on the cooperation in this House whenever the Liberals in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs table further amendments through Baroness Ludford which originate in the left outside the committee."
"I do not believe that this is any basis for constructive cooperation."
"Mr Posselt, that was all most interesting, but it has very little to do with the way in which you voted."
"Nevertheless, I did not cut you off."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.36 p.m.)"
"New EU/Morocco fisheries agreement"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0546/00) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the state of negotiations for a new fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by lamenting the fact that the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr Fischler, cannot be here today."
"I have been talking to him in person this week in connection with a fisheries event taking place simultaneously in Brussels, which we have already criticised in our Committee on Fisheries: a seminar on control over fisheries is being held, to which MEPs were invited during a week in which we also have a plenary sitting in Strasbourg, the timetable for which was known a year in advance."
"This is therefore doubly serious."
"I have made this known to Mr Fischler and I am now repeating it publicly here."
"Faced with this situation and the imminence of negotiations which might begin next Monday in Brussels, I do not think the Commission will give us much information today, due to the fact that it will do this - we hope - on Monday 30 October."
"The logic of not unveiling here - as the Commissioner himself said to me - the strategy that is to be revealed at the said negotiations, is justified and worthy of respect."
"So, as chair of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to use our oral question and this debate to talk to both sides - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides - about a few issues, and I would like to do so very calmly."
"First, I would like to emphasise the great concern of the Committee on Fisheries over the huge delay in negotiations - almost a year from the end of the previous agreement - which is the reason behind our oral question, which was formulated in September."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise the agreement reached within our committee - and I would remind you here of our powers regarding an assent which is necessary for a fisheries agreement with Morocco - an agreement to convey the unequivocal message contained in our committee' s motion for a resolution which all the political groups have negotiated and presented together and upon which we are voting today."
"On the subject of the said motion for a resolution, I would like to highlight our firm support for the European Commission to continue negotiating with Morocco, and our call for Morocco to negotiate and find the best, most beneficial solution for both parties, as this is possible and must be found."
"As stated in our proposal, it is impossible that within the context of close relations of every kind (political, economic, commercial, financial, cultural, etc.) between two parties who have signed an association agreement for there to be no room for the fisheries cooperation that the European Union is asking for."
"There is plenty of room for cooperation in the field of fisheries, and with willingness on both sides, it can, and must, be achieved."
"There need only be one yardstick for the conservation of fish stocks."
"The European Union applies to its common fisheries policy the fundamental principle of responsible fishing and the conservation of resources, which are essential conditions for everyone, for the Moroccans, for the Europeans and for the non-Europeans who fish in Morocco."
"On the other hand, having said this, we also maintain that not just any agreement will suffice."
"It must be an agreement which provides an impetus for fisheries cooperation and the Moroccan fishing industry, but which also fully satisfies the fisheries interests of the European fleets."
"It would be a pity for so much effort not to lead to a solution that we all want so much, or for our relations with the sovereign people of Morocco to be obstructed or clouded at a time when the new young monarchy is initiating a stage of progress that inspires hope and when relations with the European Union must play a decisive role in supporting such hope."
"I repeat, it would be a pity to dash so much hope for the future and so many possibilities for mutual understanding."
"We also tell the Commission in section 8 what we expect from it should it be unable to reach a satisfactory agreement."
"From this rostrum and with the weight of representing European democracy on our shoulders, I call for good sense and wisdom from both parties, who will meet in Brussels on 30 October at the highest level - the European Fisheries Commissioner and the Moroccan Minister for Fisheries if, as I hope, his attendance in Brussels is confirmed, and the technical delegations, with the Moroccan Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Morocco, if this too is confirmed, with the Director-General for Fisheries of the European Union as chair - so that serious dialogue may take place and solutions be found."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that there are many ways of reaching this agreement and there is still time, although unfortunately not much."
"This is what the people of the European Union, whom we represent here, are demanding."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has maintained a constant position throughout the contacts it has had with Morocco, a position which reflects the mandate approved by the Council in October 1999."
"It is now appropriate for us to initiate a new phase in our relations with Morocco, in a spirit which is best exemplified by our practical proposals concerning the aid that can be given to encourage growth and development in the Moroccan fishing industry, in line with the priorities set by the Moroccan Government in its five-year plan."
"All the efforts we have achieved over the last few months whenever the parties concerned have had meetings at a technical or political level, have essentially focused on outlining a new partnership in the fishing industry, a partnership which must be well-balanced and to our mutual advantage."
"Following the last visit by Mr Fischler to Morocco on 16 October, when he was received by His Majesty, King Mohammed VI, and was able to talk with the Moroccan Prime Minister, Mr Youssoufi, as well as with the Minister for Fisheries, substantial progress seems to be within our grasp."
"We may quite rightly assume that the discussions held resulted in the actual initiation of talks on the content of a new partnership in the fishing industry."
"We agreed that the new form of cooperation thereby established must take account of the interests of both parties and we took note of the fact that Morocco considered the potential spin-offs of a new partnership in terms of jobs to be an important element of our cooperation."
"The Commission emphasised on behalf of the Community that it was ready to provide Morocco with assistance in developing its fishing industry, but that achieving this objective must not make us lose sight of European interests linked to the possibility of sustainable fishing activities in Moroccan waters."
"From our standpoint, it is of vital importance that Community fishermen resume their activities at a level compatible with the obligation to guarantee sustainable resources."
"Consequently, we have reached a consensus to work together with a view to achieving a responsible partnership, and Morocco will give its views at a meeting to be held, as you have already pointed out, in Brussels, on 30 October, that is, on Monday."
"Finally, let me stress that, if the European Union and Morocco hope to cooperate in the future, flexibility is needed on both sides, as extremist demands will lead us nowhere."
"It is clear that all our efforts are currently directed towards seeking an equitable agreement with Morocco. But the Commission, in consultation with the Member States primarily concerned, is also considering measures that could be taken to help the industry in question if no consensus is reached on a new partnership."
"The Commission is optimistic that it will be possible to establish a balanced partnership with Morocco."
"It states that it is, in any event, too early to predict the exact nature of the measures that would be taken if Morocco were to adopt a negative stance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow it will be exactly a year since our last debate here in Parliament on the subject of Morocco."
"It is hard to believe that a whole year has gone by."
"A great deal of water has flowed under the bridge since, and yet the agreement has expired and not been replaced."
"We hear talk of extremely difficult discussions and tough negotiations."
"So, here we are a year on, and we could almost be having the same debate."
"But that would get us nowhere."
"I had hoped that reason would prevail, apparently in vain."
"Now we have the Commission's press release and Mr Busquin's announcement this morning."
"A Moroccan delegation will present its position in Brussels on 30 October."
"Commissioner Fischler has also confirmed this to me."
"Mind you, we are talking here about the Moroccan position."
"That will not bring the negotiations to an end."
"My question is, have they even begun?"
"Or are we clutching at straws here?"
"We held a special meeting of the Committee on Fisheries this week and passed a joint resolution intended to back up our oral question this morning and underpin our concern."
"My problem with the committee meeting and with the resolution itself is that we may be intervening in an ongoing procedure and, so far, we have not exactly learned anything new."
"Would we have done better to postpone?"
"But then, do we have enough time?"
"I understand full well the concerns of the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen who are affected."
"As a Member of the European Parliament from the German coast I can comprehend what the fishermen and their families, who have literally been high and dry for months, are going through."
"A few weeks ago, I myself was in Algeciras on the southern coast of Spain, which is not far from Morocco."
"The boats were tied up in the harbours and the fishermen were reduced to idleness."
"They are dissatisfied and disappointed with Europe."
"The fact that the agreement has still not been renewed is having huge social and economic repercussions because it affects both the fishermen and over 20,000 employees in the processing industry."
"There is, however, one piece of good news: financial compensation has been extended to the end of this year, although it is just a drop in the ocean."
"Of course the agreement with Morocco is a political issue."
"And sensitivity and diplomacy do, of course, have their place in politics."
"Now is not the time, with hardly any light at the end of the tunnel, to start banging our fists on the table and making demands."
"I think we banged our fists on enough tables last year and should proceed with caution."
"Caution is the watchword."
"But do we still have enough time?"
"Unfortunately negotiations are dragging on."
"I would like to see the Commission and Parliament working together to get things moving."
"Would it be totally unreasonable here to call for the European Parliament to be directly involved in the negotiations?"
"The importance of the agreement and its financial repercussions on the Community budget justify our involvement."
"If this is self-evident, why have we done nothing about it?"
"Do things need to be hidden behind closed doors?"
"I am most curious as to the latest developments, as to how the next few crucial days will turn out and as to what can or must be done to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"I am tentatively expecting a fast and satisfactory outcome."
"I wish the Commissioner all the luck in the world and bid a very warm welcome to the Moroccan delegation."
"Mr President, the absence of Mr Fischler from this debate is significant, but I consider the absence of Mr Smidt, the Director-General, to be even more so."
"I can understand the Commissioner' s reasons, but not those of the Director-General."
"Mr Busquin, it is said that the Commission is a collegiate body."
"I, however, believe that if this really were the case, this difficult matter of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco would have been addressed from the start with a global approach, involving all the Commissioners."
"I doubt that until now you will have heard of this problem, which is to be presented in this debate in all its harshness."
"You will leave here today wiser and the only thing we would like is to leave more informed."
"It is cold comfort that the European Union is financing compensation for fishermen and shipowners."
"From day one, what they have told us is that they wanted to fish."
"In any case, the aid will end on 31 December, the date planned for the conversion of the fleet."
"What a beginning to the third millennium for the European Union: we are converting the fleet because we have been incapable of negotiating a new Fisheries Agreement with Morocco."
"Eleven months after the expiry of the previous agreement, nobody is assuring us that we will reach an agreement before 31 December."
"What has not been achieved in eleven months will be difficult to achieve in a few days."
"Mr Busquin, I have sometimes, as a member of this Parliament, had the feeling that the European Commission, the Commissioner, and in particular the Director-General for Fisheries were acting as if they were ashamed of the sector and even of those Member States that they were called upon to represent in this negotiation."
"We all knew from the start that it was a difficult negotiation."
"Time has taught us that this could turn from being difficult to being impossible."
"Because contact cannot begin by turning our back on the demands of the sector and agreeing to Moroccan demands without any discussions."
"The Commission sent signals, not to the negotiators of the neighbouring country, but to European fishermen: too many cephalopod trawlers, a fleet with excess capacity, mixed enterprises, the need to negotiate by segments of the fleet, a ban on mentioning other types of trade and, of course, silence."
"Who does this silence benefit?"
"Does it benefit Parliament, which is accountable to the citizens of the European Union?"
"Does it benefit a sector which, more enterprising than the negotiators themselves, is going to Morocco and seeing that what is impossible for Brussels is possible for them: speaking directly to the Moroccans, establishing close contacts, principles of trade, industrial and fisheries agreements?"
"Does it benefit the Directorate General of Fisheries which, with all the Community apparatus at its feet, still thinks that our fishermen are the bad guys and wonders why they do not do something else?"
"We are left, Commissioner, not with the sentiment, but with the certainty that the sector would by itself have been capable of reaching an agreement which the Commission has still not reached today."
"This sentiment does not sit square with negotiations with a country that has an association agreement with the European Union and in whose development we are involved."
"And it fits in even less with a European Union that feels able to negotiate the accession of 13 new Member States."
"The Moroccan Government is requesting privileged relations with the European Union."
"It is right to do so and we should feel proud of this."
"We are the main importers of Moroccan fisheries, agricultural and industrial products."
"Moroccan agriculture enjoys special treatment when exporting to Europe."
"At each negotiation of fisheries agreements, when these were seasonal, Morocco systematically obtained permanent agricultural concessions."
"We could say that, eleven months after the docking, we are still paying for the previous agreement and the one before that."
"The European Union wants to continue its association with Morocco in the field of fisheries because we are convinced that a cooperation to the advantage of both parties is possible, for the same reasons that make the European Union the largest investor in Morocco."
"The first, the second and the third."
"Or that thousands of young Moroccans study at Spanish or French universities."
"Or that Morocco benefits from substantial European aid."
"Or that we share our Mediterranean policy with Morocco."
"If employment is truly one of the European Union' s priorities for action, an economic sector such as fisheries cannot continue to be sidelined."
"At least 40 000 direct or indirect jobs in the European Union depend on this agreement, in areas with no possibility of conversion."
"We are not dealing in intangibles ."
"The Commission is well aware of the importance of fisheries agreements for certain regions that are highly dependent on this activity: European regions of Denmark, Ireland, Scotland, Andalusia, Portugal and, Galicia, with extremely high unemployment rates and no industrial activity, that have exchanged their potential competitiveness for a marginal activity that the Commission seems to want to marginalise still further - and I am sorry to be so harsh."
"For these regions, the last return of the fleet will, in the absence of any other alternative, constitute a fatal blow from which they will find it difficult to recover."
"The European institutions must ensure that citizens and fishermen do not see Europe as a panacea, but as a suitable framework for the defence of their interests."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the fisheries agreements play a very important role in the fisheries sector."
"The agreements with third countries have very great significance for the European Union and especially for those regions with large fishing harbours."
"I am thinking here of employment in the sector."
"I am thinking also of the many subsidiary businesses and service trades which are wholly or partially dependent upon fisheries."
"By means of the fisheries agreements, the European Union is able to engage in fishing operations and exchange fishing rights with third countries."
"Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party therefore support the fact that the EU' s fisheries policy embraces these many agreements with third countries."
"The negotiations concerning a new agreement between the EU and Morocco have made slow progress."
"They have been under way since the agreement expired on 30 November 1999, and the European Union has paid compensation to the Spanish and Portuguese ship owners and fishermen."
"Commissioner Fischler has stated that this monologue cannot continue."
"I very much agree with the Commissioner about this."
"The fishermen in particular cannot be blamed for not understanding the situation and for being very disappointed about the fact that the negotiations concerning the Morocco agreement have dragged on."
"Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are in favour of as big an effort as possible now being made to bring the long-winded negotiation procedure to a conclusion."
"We therefore support the wording of the motion for a Resolution from the Committee on Fisheries."
"We nonetheless propose an amendment to the paragraph concerning the arrangements designed to mitigate the effects of a failure to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"We propose adding the words: 'which are to be co-financed to an appropriate degree by the EU' ."
"Mr President, we had a similar debate a year ago and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations even get under way shows how difficult it is becoming to find fish stocks for our massive EU fleets to exploit."
"The EU is ever more dependent upon the goodwill of other countries to let us fish."
"We knew five years ago this situation would arise."
"When Morocco signed the last agreement, it said it did not want another agreement of the same type and it has kept to that position."
"In the five years, what has the Community done?"
"It adopted a multiannual guidance plan which was far weaker than what was recommended by the scientists and the Commission."
"The Commission recently highlighted the implications of this."
"Then it adopted a structural fund, which will continue to pay for new vessels and the enlargement of existing ones, albeit with some controls."
"Yet, once again, the Council watered down what the Commission had bravely proposed."
"Consequently we are left with a problem of excess capacity and dwindling fish stocks."
"There will need to be further cuts in TACs this Christmas."
"The Commission is forced to look further and further afield to find fish."
"The Moroccan case is a special situation in that many of the vessels involved are relatively small and fishing close to home."
"We agree that the lack of this agreement has had a severe impact."
"But while we have plenty of vessels that cannot find fish in European waters, or even in areas where they have traditionally fished, at the same time we have some businessmen, or even business conglomerates, in northern European countries that are building enormous new vessels, which will be forced to depend on fishing far away from Europe."
"Given the difficulties in accommodating these vessels in the normal agreements, their owners are making private agreements with the governments of third countries."
"Since these are private agreements with no Community involvement, there is no transparency, no access to information, no public accountability."
"This is a very serious situation."
"Who is to control these vessels?"
"I would like the Commissioner to give us a detailed account of its activities and their impact."
"We will support the resolution, but we have to make it clear that nobody has any given right to exploit the resources of another country if it does not so wish."
"That should be taken into account."
"We must look at solving our own problem here."
"Mr President, I think it would be constructive if a new fisheries agreement with Morocco could be concluded, but I nonetheless think that there are major weaknesses in the text of the Resolution which is now being proposed."
"This especially applies to paragraphs 3 and 4, in which it is assumed as a matter of course that the EU should be allowed - in fact, be almost entitled - to fish in Moroccan waters."
"There is no such self-evident right."
"Rather, it is a question of negotiating with another nation."
"One can imagine how it would be received if Morocco were to make similar demands to be allowed to fish in EU waters and saw itself as being entitled to do so as a matter of course."
"Nor do I think it goes without saying that the EU should finance compensation for fishermen who have fished in waters outside the European Union."
"If the EU' s fisheries policy as a whole is looked at, and not just this agreement, a large proportion of the fishing done by EU fishing fleets outside the European Union is unsustainable in the longer term, seen from ecological and resource management perspectives."
"Fundamental changes are needed so that there is a reduction in global fishing and so that a smaller proportion of the fisheries budget is used for agreements with third countries."
"It is, of course, mostly Spanish and Portuguese boats which fish in Moroccan waters, but boats from northern Europe fish there too."
"For example, a number of Swedish boats have fished off Morocco."
"I was reading in a Swedish fishing trade journal about how one of these boats lands its catch in El Aaiún, described as a Moroccan harbour."
"El Aaiún is not, however, situated in Morocco but in Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco."
"I find it odd that boats fishing in terms of the EU' s quota are able to land their catches in an occupied country."
"I should like to ask the Commission whether these matters are being discussed in the negotiations with Morocco."
"What approach is adopted towards Western Sahara' s fishing waters?"
"And how is it possible to land catches in an occupied country under this agreement?"
"Mr President, we are debating the third agreement with Morocco, which above all concerns French and Portuguese fishermen, who make up the bulk of the fleet, even though a small number of French and Swedish fishermen are also concerned."
"It is clear that, together with Morocco, Mauritania a little further to the south, and Senegal, we are dealing with some of the richest fishing regions in the world."
"With the second agreement, things were very clear."
"Our Moroccan friends and I were in no doubt that this was going to be the final agreement."
"Now we have reached the moment of truth for all concerned, first of all for Morocco, which has a right to permanent sovereignty over its natural resources."
"But that is not what I heard just now, when talk was of fishing off the coast of an occupied territory, the Western Sahara in this case, which will be of great assistance to us during the negotiations."
"The Moroccans have the right to sustainable development and to a major small-scale industry, just as they have the right to create a food industry based on their fisheries and their fish."
"On the Spanish and Portuguese side, I understand they are invoking a certain historic right."
"The Spaniards have put forward the case of an established practice and presence, and of an economic and human problem affecting 20 000 people who work in the fisheries and supporting industries."
"I understand all that."
"And on the European side, we have the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which is being put to the test."
"In fact, all our fishing agreements are being called into question not just those with Morocco, as there is also Mauritania and soon there will be Guinea among others to consider."
"As for our Socialist Members, what a delight!"
"Champions of generosity and of the third world, they are discovering what Chairman Mao called 'the difference between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions' ."
"They have to reconcile defending jobs with their universalist and globalist convictions, which are being put to the test."
"It is actually easier to defend the suburbs than it is to defend Morocco."
"So do we really need a third-generation agreement with mixed enterprises involving a significant return for Morocco and privileged relations?"
"I think we should first of all pay a fair price for the resource."
"By paying one franc, or less than one euro, for a litre for oil, we have acquired bad habits as far as oil and for that matter, cocoa and the other natural resources are concerned."
"But we must also understand that nothing lasts forever, not even fish stocks."
"Morocco is a great nation, but it also has major demographic and economic problems."
"His Majesty, King Hassan II, is no longer there."
"Let us add, in conclusion, the problem of their natural and historic province, the Western Sahara, which has not been completely resolved."
"Today, Morocco is faced with factory ships which are coming to pillage its natural resources, and which the small vessels and small Moroccan industries are in no position to resist."
"There comes a time in life when we must learn to give in."
"This must not stop us from protecting our own resources."
"I am thinking of the tree growers and the market gardeners that we have sold out and also of the interests of southern Europe."
"To the Spanish and Portuguese Members of the House, I would say that in life everything has to come to an end, even fisheries agreements with the third world."
"Mr President, I think the most important thing at the moment is that for almost a year we have been starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and that in three days time - next Monday -, we will know what to expect, whether the fisheries cooperation with Morocco will continue and what type of cooperation this will be."
"This House has been quite rightly criticised along with the Commission regarding the agreement with Morocco, which from the outset has been addressed with tremendous hesitation and naivety."
"It has taken eleven months to arrive at the inflexible positions that we have today and the meeting on the 30th, and in this respect we should value the latest measures from Commissioner Fischler, the results of his trip to Morocco on the 26th of last month and the high level meetings that took place, including the one with the King himself."
"From this trip we can deduce that the meeting on the 30th will not just be one more and that finally, a Moroccan delegation will be present in Brussels with negotiating and decision-making powers."
"At least, that is what we can hope for at the moment, and from this alone we can be confident that fisheries relations with Morocco will be re-established as soon as possible and in the best possible conditions for both parties, because a fisheries scenario for southern Europe is unthinkable without satisfactory relations between both sides of the Mediterranean, while the needless sacrificing of a fleet that has contributed so much to the development of fishing in Morocco is unthinkable too."
"The resolution upon which we are preparing to vote does not, and cannot, contain anything new, since it is being voted on just three days before a key date for negotiations."
"As this key date is so close, I believe that we must be extremely careful with what is drawn up."
"There is one point in the resolution that has been interpreted in very different ways, some of which are truly ridiculous and false and have been published in certain sectors of the media."
"I am therefore particularly keen to make it clear that if there is anything that sets the PPE-DE Group apart, it is not only in supporting, defending and fostering fisheries agreements, but also in firmly promoting their extension."
"However, in no way can this mean that the PPE-DE Group is opposed to private fisheries agreements, simply because opposing them would mean condemning half of the Community fleet."
"I would very much like to know if anyone is really opposed to this solution, and how, and on what grounds, this will be explained to the fishing sector."
"I believe we are here to clear the way for the future of Community fishing, not to block it."
"Private agreements - of which there are many in the Member States and with many third countries - have yielded excellent results, both in maintaining Community employment and in providing fisheries products to the European Union."
"For example, we only need look at the case of Namibia, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Iceland, Mauritania, Morocco itself and many others."
"Furthermore, when we complain day after day about the fact that negotiations seem to be falling by the wayside, both the existing agreements and new ones, and the lack of interest that both the Commission and sections of the Council seem to be displaying - and here we have the recent cases of Angola, Cape Verde and Kiribati -, it is quite simply suicidal to block a path which is a solid base for the fisheries activities of the Community fleet, and could be even more so in the future."
"The two approaches are therefore completely justifiable, as both are based on the fundamental aim of conserving resources."
"We are therefore defending the responsibility that lies with us in the bilateral agreements and in private agreements, where the activity of the fleet is regulated - and will be even more so in future - by regional fisheries organisations such as ICCAT, NAFO and Camelar."
"I have nothing more to say, Mr President, except to express my hopes for the best before the meeting on the 30th."
"Mr President, the absence of Mr Fischler, which is justified, as the chair of the Committee on Fisheries made clear earlier, prevents me from going into too much detail."
"However, I would like to convey a few brief messages to the Commission, which is worthily represented today by Commissioner Busquin."
"The first message is the Commission' s inability to renew the most important fisheries agreement that the European Union had."
"I believe that this fact should be noted and made clear and doubts raised as to whether the Commission is capable of negotiating international agreements, especially having heard President Prodi request an international remit for the Commission."
"Secondly, I am concerned about Mr Busquin' s comment regarding support for developing the fishing capacity of Morocco."
"We are talking about a territory that does not belong to Morocco, but that is being administrated by Morocco."
"If we help Morocco to over-exploit this territory, which is awaiting a UN-supervised referendum, if we develop a Moroccan fishing fleet to exploit the fish in this territory, what will happen when this territory becomes self-governing and what will we do with the Moroccan fleet?"
"Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement came to an end, Community and non-Community fleets that are not subject to the control of either the Commission or the Member States have continued to exploit the Saharan fishing grounds, in particular a substantial Dutch fleet."
"What measures does the Commission intend to take to prevent at least the Community fleets from continuing to over-exploit these resources?"
"Fourthly, as Mrs Miguélez emphasised, when the previous fisheries agreements were signed, the European Union made significant concessions to Morocco on all points."
"Last year, Morocco withdrew from the negotiating table and, like a good player who has won, ended up with all the cards and did not forfeit a single concession."
"Is the European Union going to continue making concessions, if Morocco does not show the slightest desire to relieve the situation?"
"And finally, the Commissioner has spoken of the Commission' s measures to help the fisheries sector directly affected."
"But the fisheries sector is only part of the activity generated by fishing."
"At the moment, various Spanish regions, the Canaries, Andalusia and Galicia, and some Portuguese regions, are directly affected by the cessation of fishing activities."
"This means the end of shore-based activities, boat repairs, the provisioning of vessels, canning factories and oil factories, which is to say that a whole economic sector is currently paralysed as a result of this."
"My question to the Commission is this: if an agreement is not reached with Morocco, or if this agreement is concluded under the terms indicated by the Commission, an agreement that stimulates Moroccan production, is the Commission planning to adopt structural measures to compensate for the losses that will occur in the regions affected."
"Mr President, I rise to speak in order to express our support for a resolution with which my Group and I, as Member for Galicia, agree."
"However, after a wasted year, and at a time when we are trying to put budgetary appropriations that were earmarked for the agreement under other headings, I must also express my deep suspicion about the Commission's commitment to protecting the legitimate interests of the shipowners and fishermen affected, and state my scepticism about the real will of the Union and of many Member States, amongst them Spain, to negotiate the agreement in the ""general field of political and economic relations between Morocco and the European Union"" as we propose in the resolution."
"I nevertheless hope, of course, that I am mistaken and that the treaty will finally be signed without further delay."
"Mr President, this is not the first time that the right to fish in Moroccan and Saharan waters has been an item on Parliament' s agenda."
"Spain and Portugal took it for granted that Morocco was obliged to allow European fishermen to fish in its waters, and it was a shock when this came to an end last year."
"I can well understand why, because this type of fishing was a source of revenue and employment for what is by European standards a poor region."
"In the past, it was deemed quite natural for the economy to be prized more highly than the protection of the natural balance, and for the poorest people in Europe to try and pinch a few crumbs from Europe' s domination over the third world."
"We have now reached the stage where parts of the oceans are being fished to the point of exhaustion, and stocks of certain types of fish have declined to such an extent that they are at risk of extinction."
"Morocco has every right to afford its waters sustainable protection against over-fishing."
"Europe cannot lay claim to rights in other parts of the world any longer."
"In future, we will have to learn to live without fishing concessions bequeathed to us by our colonial past."
"The proposed resolution will not lead to the restoration of fishing rights, but, at best, to Spain and Portugal having a more solid claim to compensation subsidies."
"I would urge the Commission not to persist in bringing pressure to bear on Morocco, and to be more understanding of Morocco' s complaints."
"Incidentally, I agree with Mrs McKenna that the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen are not the only villains of the piece."
"The fishermen in the North, including my country, the Netherlands, must reduce their catches too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has had fishing agreements with Morocco since 1992."
"The agreement currently in force expired at the end of November last year."
"Under this agreement, around 500 boats from the European Union, 50 of which are Portuguese, have had access to Moroccan waters at an annual cost of around EUR 125 million."
"As we imagined, the difficulties in negotiating with the Moroccan authorities have been considerable."
"Morocco values its fishing resources very highly and it is constantly besieged by the great international fishing powers such as Japan, South Korea, and Russia to allow them to fish even more in its waters."
"It should also be pointed out at this juncture that the fishing agreement with Morocco is part of a broader partnership and cooperation framework under which the European Union also grants Morocco considerable trade concessions and considerable support for its development."
"I wish to highlight four points in this speech."
"Firstly, it must be emphasised that the fishing agreement with Morocco is by far the European Union' s most important agreement, representing more than 30% of all catches by the Community fleet in third-country waters."
"The 30 000 jobs directly or indirectly dependent on this agreement may seem few in terms of the European Union as a whole, but because they are concentrated in small fishing communities, mainly on the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, where there is no tradition or potential for economic conversion, the loss of these jobs would spell disaster."
"Secondly, I must stress, with considerable bitterness, the lack of openness on the part of the Moroccan authorities involved in the negotiations."
"I do not understand their position for two reasons."
"Firstly, in the meantime they have been granting private licences to various shipowners from other countries, which contradicts their argument that their difficulties in negotiating with the European Union are to do with the need to conserve fish stocks. Secondly, Morocco' s inflexibility is also incomprehensible given our willingness to open up our markets to Moroccan products, and the aid that has been provided under the general cooperation agreement with Morocco."
"Another aspect that I wish to highlight is the fact that at the end of this month, temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year of inactivity comes to an end."
"This situation is unsustainable, since they would all rather work than receive aid."
"The Commission and the Council of Ministers must shoulder their responsibilities, which involves not merely extending aid until the situation is resolved, but also reviewing the general framework for cooperation with Morocco in the event that this situation drags on."
"Finally, as the body responsible for conducting the negotiations, the Commission must keep Parliament properly informed about what is going on, since we find the current situation quite incomprehensible."
"Equally incomprehensible is the passivity of the Fisheries Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ""blue"" Europe, as it is metaphorically called, is in crisis."
"Our seas are being abused, our fish stocks are dwindling, and our fishermen, who are forced to remain idle, are finding it hard to accept the cruel fate that threatens the survival of a traditional activity and a particular way of life."
"On Tuesday, we debated in this Chamber the alarming breach in the Irish Sea of the ban on fishing for cod, that dish that is the very essence, by the way, of Portuguese cuisine."
"Today we are debating a fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"We are about to see another harsh blow dealt to fishing in the European Union."
"I say in the European Union and not just in two of its constituent parts, as some Members have insinuated: European solidarity must be more than empty words or just a one-dimensional idea that simply evaporates when the problems happen to be concentrated chiefly in Portugal and Spain..."
"Unfortunately, the Commission was not able to reach new agreements in the negotiations with Morocco held before the expiry of the fisheries agreement on 30 November 1999."
"Almost a year later, it seems that we are back to square one."
"The little information that is available is unclear, despite the fact that negotiations have continued - or so we are told - with various complicated ups and downs."
"In spite of everything, the Commissioner has given us a guarantee today that negotiations will reopen next week and that progress is being made."
"He said this in very vague terms."
"He told us that there is a possibility of achieving a balanced partnership with Morocco."
"Is this true, or is he saying what he thinks we want to hear?"
"Scepticism and confusion are widespread and legitimate."
"Does the European Union then not have sufficient weight and influence to convince its partner, Morocco, of the mutual advantages of signing the new agreement?"
"What is actually going on here?"
"Is the problem the rather unhelpful attitude of the Moroccan Government, which prefers to negotiate with companies on an individual basis, instead of negotiating with the European Union, with which it shares important and long-standing interests in several areas?"
"Has the European Union lost all its diplomatic and economic influence?"
"I think not!"
"My view is that the European Union has underestimated the problem."
"What happens if the agreement fails?"
"What attitude will the Council and the Commission adopt?"
"Surely it will not be to wash their hands of the matter, given that they are the institutions with the power and the responsibility for conducting these negotiations."
"Lastly, in the undesirable event that negotiations should fail, the Union has a political and moral duty to support the fishermen and shipowners with a reasonable amount of aid that will ensure that they have the means to live."
"That is the minimum requirement, but by itself it is not enough."
"The Union must prepare a programme for conversion of activities carried out by the operators affected, in order to give them a stable future."
"Switching this problem to the Structural Funds and to the Member States would mean discrediting the Union in the eyes not only of those affected, but of the general public too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to repeat what has been said this morning in this plenary sitting and has been being said for almost a year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that the Community fleets in Andalusia, the Canaries, Galicia and Portugal are in dock due to the lack of a fisheries agreement."
"Nor do I want to blame the Commission again for its lack of success in the negotiations or for the delay in beginning to put pressure on Morocco."
"This has already been done."
"This Andalusian MEP has been negotiating and proposing initiatives for a year in corridors, in offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner so that the highly specific idiosyncrasies of the Andalusian fishing fleet working in Morocco would be taken into account."
"We need a practical fisheries agreement."
"We do not want an agreement in which the interests of this large coastal fishing fleet are not reflected."
"Extremely important fishing towns in the south Atlantic zone - Huelva and Cadiz - and the southern Mediterranean - Malaga, Granada and Almeria - depend on this agreement."
"They have no alternative to fishing."
"Furthermore, the social repercussions of this fleet lying in dock are extremely serious and are, in some cases, related to drug cultivation and trafficking by the Kingdom of Morocco."
"I will end by saying that if the European Union was currently negotiating with the real owners of the Saharan shoals, the Saharan people, we would already have a valid agreement and we would not be being subjected to blackmail by the Alaouite Kingdom as a result of which failure to reach an agreement, or the sealing of an ineffective agreement, would have serious repercussions on the special relationship between Morocco and the European Union."
"Mr President, everyone knows that Jean Monnet was one of the founding fathers of the EU."
"He used to tell a joke about the Norwegians."
"The joke was that the Norwegians always talk about fish."
"It is a bad joke."
"It is as bad as Jean Monnet' s idea regarding how the European Union should develop."
"According to him, the EU should always have a management group, by which he probably meant Germany and France."
"It would have meant there would not have been democratic equality among the countries in the EU."
"But let me turn now to the question of fish."
"I would defend Norway, which is not a member of the EU, because the EU wants to bring Norway' s resources of fish under the auspices of the Community without giving it anything in their place other than Jean Monnet' s political management group."
"I would also defend Morocco against the fishermen plunderers of the EU countries."
"The world' s seas are now being emptied of its fish protein in a way that resembles plundering."
"We must protect the world' s fish stocks."
"We have to resolve the overcapacity situation in the EU fisheries industry."
"Let people fish with EU money in EU waters only!"
"Mr President, a Czech bishop, Bishop Koukl, to whom I am very close, has a rather nice saying: ""Loving thy neighbour would be so simple if only one' s neighbour were not right on one' s doorstep"" ."
"This saying aptly describes relations between numerous neighbouring countries."
"Historically, it is neighbours that seem to have so much trouble with each other and the idea of the European Union is to resolve problematic relations with neighbours."
"I should like here to take my hat off to Spanish foreign policy."
"Spain has done a magnificent job in turning round the difficult neighbourly relations which Europe and North Africa and Spain and Morocco have suffered during the course of history."
"I had the honour of attending the twentieth jubilee of former King Hassan of Morocco at the beginning of the 1980s, while I was working as a journalist."
"I watched from the front row, as it were."
"It was an impressive sight when the Spanish king came to Marrakech and drove with the Moroccan king in an open car through streets lined with over a million people."
"It reminded me of scenes from our history and from my childhood, when Konrad Adenauer and Charles De Gaulle drove through German towns in exactly the same way, demonstrating that the problems between the two neighbours had been overcome and that France and Germany would together form the core of European integration."
"Spain and Morocco have a similar opportunity to become the core of integration in the Mediterranean."
"I think that Spain and Morocco have done a great deal in order to avoid what many see as unavoidable, namely the clash of civilisations, the conflict when different cultures collide."
"Spain has developed a marvellous bridging function here, as has Portugal, and I think that we should look at this fisheries agreement in this light."
"The Spanish and Portuguese fishermen deserve our undivided support."
"This is not a local phenomenon; these are European fishermen and even though we are not perhaps directly affected, we must fight their corner."
"In doing so, however, we must not lose sight of the fact that relations between the European Union and the transit countries around our borders, and I am thinking in particular here of North Africa, Turkey and Russia, which act as bridges on the borders of the European Union to other parts of the world and to other countries - that these countries deserve our particular support."
"That is why we need to forge close economic and political relations with Morocco as quickly as possible, while at the same time defending our European fisheries interests."
"That is why I am in favour of everything that has been said here about forcing the agreement."
"However, I should like expressly to criticise the anti-Moroccan undertones that have also been heard in this debate because they do nothing to help neighbourly relations and because they do nothing to help the fisheries agreement."
"We must be critical and open, but we must say to the Moroccans that we are keen to forge a close and permanent partnership with Morocco and to stabilise Morocco's position in the Mediterranean, while at the same time safeguarding our own interests."
"I think that if we manage to persuade Morocco to take a European outlook, then Morocco will do what it should have done long ago, i.e. it will discuss the question of natural resources, of common resources with us and will stop giving preference to ships from third countries."
"Mr President, the tender fruit negotiation will be opened up in three days' time, and we will then know if it is ripe or green, or sufficiently ripe for us all to feel calm and for both the parties concerned, the European Union and Morocco, to start sounding out methods of cooperation and agreements in a manner that is flexible, Commissioner, but also serious and rigorous, so that the Community fishing fleet may recommence its activities in those waters."
"As a Spanish and Andalusian MEP, I assert the rights of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend their jobs, which have been endangered for almost a year, and for us also to defend these jobs here in Parliament."
"But I would also like to appeal to the intelligence of the Kingdom of Morocco, which time and again has knocked on the door of the European Union and this Parliament in search of understanding and assistance in resolving its economic, social and political problems, of flexible cooperation and, I emphasise, also seriously, of arriving at an agreement that satisfies both parties."
"Commissioner, agriculture, immigration - a field with regard to which we approved a new budgetary line yesterday for assistance to Morocco -, industry and the economy form part of the set of mutual relations between Morocco and the European Union."
"It would be senseless to exclude fisheries from this and, precisely, the association agreement that links us to Morocco consists of not excluding any aspect that affects our interests, as the alternative would be to dull the impetus with which the European Union wants to, and can, promote the wholesale development of this country."
"This is the clear message which should also be sent to the Moroccans."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to add that there are clearly agreements between the two parties to establish a timetable for negotiations and that Morocco has spent months preparing its five-year plan."
"Following Mr Fischler' s visit to Rabat on 18 May 2000, negotiations entered a new, more active, phase with a meeting on 25 July in Rabat of the Directors-General of Fisheries, another meeting on 28 and 29 September in Brussels and, finally, Mr Fischler' s meeting on 16 October with the Prime Minister and with His Majesty, Mohamed VI of Morocco."
"Mr Fischler, may I add, reported back to the Commission on his discussion."
"He had gained a favourable impression from his meeting, which augurs well for the negotiations, due to start on 30 October, being conducted in a constructive spirit."
"That is why the Commission is working on the basis of a new partnership aimed at an interesting development between the two parties involving, on the one hand, the development of the entire Moroccan fishing industry, the fleet, aquaculture, commercial processing and research and, on the other, providing European fishermen with fishing opportunities."
"I think we must therefore wait for the results of the meetings of 30 October."
"Mr Fischler will, of course, inform the European Parliament of these results immediately and I hope, as you all do, that the negotiations will be productive and will lead to the establishment of a fruitful association between Morocco and the European Union. It is therefore too soon to broach this issue."
"As regards the appropriate measures to be taken if the agreement does not succeed, the Commission is bearing these in mind but, as you well understand, we think and we hope that it will be possible for the negotiations to move forward on Monday in a more decisive way."
"These are the replies that Mr Fischler could have made in my place and I will not fail to convey to him everything you have said."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0823/2000) by the Committee on Fisheries on negotiations for a fisheries agreement between the EC and Morocco"
"(Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution) Explanation of vote"
"Mr President, I would like to thank my friends and hope that they are listening carefully to my explanation of vote, the contents of which are extremely serious even it may not appear so on the surface."
"I am very familiar with the problems of Spanish and Portuguese fishermen, problems which are shared by fishermen in Sicily."
"However, a few days ago, I discovered that a when a Moroccan fish bumped into a Spanish fish in the Mediterranean one day, he remarked (in his own language, of course), ""I have heard that Mr Fatuzzo is fighting so that we fish will be able to become pensioners too"" ."
"This gives me great pleasure, but I have another desire: I am a Moroccan fish and I would like to be caught by a Moroccan fisherman, not a Spanish fisherman."
"I have established a trade union."
"The other fish, the Spanish one, says: 'I would like to be caught by a Moroccan fisherman, not a Spanish one ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I would remind the honourable Member that the order of business allows one minute's speaking time and that applies to all honourable Members."
"Nonetheless, thank you for your most interesting contribution."
"Rights of language teachers"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0541/00) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the rights of language teachers: maintenance of the rule of law."
"Mr Wieland has five minutes' speaking time on behalf of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi."
"Mr President, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been unexpectedly called away and has asked me to stand in for her."
"I therefore only had a short time to prepare to present the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"What is at issue here?"
"It is not in fact language teachers."
"Many will perhaps say that the issue is far too detailed and far too complicated."
"But it is not about language teachers; it is all about an example, in this case about a citizens' Europe."
"It is about a story that was first brought before the European Court of Justice in 1989."
"An almost 12-year old story full of false hopes, stalling tactics, hopes and personal need, about placatory measures for those involved and tough defence of old rights against citizens seeking no more than their due."
"Let us name names, to coin a phrase: it is about the case of the Union citizens Allué and Coonan versus the University of Venice, it is about the case of the Union citizen Allué again versus the University of Venice and it is about the case of the Union citizen David Petri versus the University of Verona."
"The European Court of Justice returned a clear verdict."
"The European Court of Justice handed down three judgements vindicating these citizens who, before the first of these judgments, were employed to lecture in Italian universities as lettori."
"The tenet of these judgments is unequivocal: the rights of the persons affected to the free movement of labour and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality had been violated in that Italy did not offer the lettori the same terms of employment and job security as Italian nationals lecturing at a similar level in universities."
"Unfortunately, nothing was settled after the first judgement."
"The amendments made to the law in its wake in 1995 are still unable to guarantee full protection of the rights of lettori lecturing in universities. In the end even the ombudsman backed these citizens."
"I am not sure if this play on words works in the other languages."
"In German we say, ""having a right is one thing, being allowed to exercise it is another"" ."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has formulated a clear position here and thrown its weight behind the Union citizens whose rights have been restricted."
"Now a number of proposed amendments have been tabled which, to put it mildly, I find somewhat irritating."
"I only intend to refer to two examples which are an attempt to improve or, in one case, to reverse Parliament's position at the eleventh hour: the original recital H proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs reads: ""Whereas the persons affected, who are Union citizens, have suffered losses, stress and uncertainty over this period of several years, as the result of being involved in protracted and repetitive litigation in hundreds of court proceedings over 12 years and have had their legitimate expectation of being able to exercise their profession with reasonable career prospects has been dashed"" ."
"Now an amendment has been tabled, proposed Amendment No 8, which deletes a few words and adds a few, thereby not only watering down but almost reversing the meaning."
"The text would then read: ""Whereas the persons affected, who are Union citizens, have been involved in protracted and repetitive litigation and have seen their legitimate expectations dashed."""
"It is not only in German that this makes a clear difference."
"But now to what is, in my view, a much more serious process."
"Proposed Amendment No 9 suggests that ""Whereas the Italian government takes the view that it has fully satisfied its obligations vis-à-vis the lettori pursuant to Law 236/95, which complies with the principles of the Treaty"" ."
"Apart from the fact that this was not discussed in the Committee on Legal Affairs, we would be maintaining here that the legal basis in Italian law corresponds to the principles of the Treaty and yet the Court of Justice said exactly the opposite!"
"I consider this action to be dubious."
"If we take the view that these practices are legally acceptable and politically desirable then, as legislators, we should go ahead and change the principles, but if this is an attempt to use Parliament to conceal a position, then all I have to say is that the PPE wants no part of it!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the case of non-Italian foreign language assistants in Italian universities is well known in the Commission and in most European institutions."
"This affair has been ongoing for more than a decade and, as a result of intervention on the part of the European institutions, in particular the Commission, the situation of the assistants has improved."
"As you know, the issue is very complex and concerns some seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities."
"Throughout this decade, the Commission has worked assiduously to resolve the problem of foreign language assistants in Italy in respect of the free movement of workers, which is guaranteed by the Treaty."
"As you have highlighted, the Court of Justice has already delivered three judgments concerning language assistants and, with the case pending in Luxembourg, the Commission has taken action aimed at further improving the situation."
"More particularly, following the decisions of the Court of Justice of 1989 and 1993 - the Allué case - which ruled that the limitations on the duration of employment contracts of foreign-language assistants imposed by the Italian government were discriminatory, the Commission took a number of steps."
"It initiated an infringement procedure, which was dropped in 1995 following an Italian law bringing the legislation into line with the Court ruling."
"As regards the language assistants' subsequent claims concerning their acquired rights, the Commission launched another infringement procedure on the grounds that, in a certain number of Italian universities, the assistants' acquired rights were not being duly safeguarded."
"In fact, the Commission mobilised a lot of its resources in order to examine this case."
"In fact, the services of the Commission put together hundreds of pages of documentation on specific cases in a number of universities."
"We exchanged a great deal of correspondence with the players concerned and went to a great deal of trouble to select from among piles of irrelevant documents the elements that proved conclusively that the former lettori had in fact been the victims of discrimination by certain Italian universities in respect of their financial acquired rights such as salaries and contributions to pension schemes."
"In July 1999, the Commission brought this infringement procedure before the Court of Justice."
"It is now waiting for the Court to rule on this new infringement and on this new procedure, which was initiated by the Commission."
"The assistants not only invoked the lack of protection of their acquired rights, they also deplored the new legal system set up by the Italian legislation of 1995."
"They believed that the Italian state should have integrated them into the category of members of the academic teaching staff or, failing that, it should have created a specific category for them among the teaching staff."
"In the opinion of the assistants, this right would follow directly from the right of workers to free movement."
"On this point, however, the Commission was not in agreement with the assistants."
"It is our view that freedom of movement enables European citizens not to be the victims of discrimination under national systems of law."
"It does not give them the right to a special legal status."
"Each Member State is fully within its right to establish the provisions governing its own public service."
"Community legislation cannot prevent Italy from amending the provisions governing the status of former lettori and from transforming them into linguistic experts with partially different attributions."
"If the Italian legal system is reformed and modified, as it was in respect of academic teaching staff, we do not think that the Commission can intervene given that every European citizen has equal access to all categories of professions."
"Indeed, any European citizen may become a permanent member of the teaching body by taking part in the appropriate concorso."
"Mr President, I would just like to ask the Members to reflect a moment."
"If the matter is a legal one, we should proceed along legal avenues and the Court should pass judgment; those who need to appeal should appeal and those who demand justice must have it."
"If the matter is of a political nature - and therefore a matter for Parliament - it is a pity that we do not approach matters of this kind with due caution."
"I fully appreciate the Commission's position and, indeed, as Parliament, we must be very careful."
"I am not defending my government out of solidarity - it is not my government, I belong to an opposition party - but I am trying to clarify the matter."
"We make every endeavour to ensure that the citizens enjoy the same rights in all the States, but they also have to respect and face up to the same responsibilities in all the States."
"It is intolerable for European citizens to have some sort of privileged access in a State other than their own and not to have to undergo the same tests and bear the same burdens as the citizens of that country, in the case in the point the citizens of Italy."
"In the European Union, education and teaching is structured according to the principle of subsidiarity, with the result that the laws of the Member States differ."
"Under Italian law, you do not become a university lecturer automatically by virtue of experience, you have to pass a public examination."
"Therefore, until we manage to harmonise the laws - which we hope to do - respect for the principle of subsidiarity for the moment means that it is impossible on the grounds of discrimination to do away with something which is in all probability a request for a privilege."
"I repeat: there must be the same rights but also the same responsibilities for all."
"Otherwise, this problem, which is political, not legal in nature, will arise again and could occur in other States of the European Union where laws governing university career paths and education are different from elsewhere."
"I therefore advocate caution."
"Mr President, I rise to give my voice to this injustice that we have heard about, an injustice, as we have also heard, that has been going on now for 12 years."
"It has taken not one, not two but three court cases and it still has not been resolved."
"So why are we back here today debating this injustice in this Chamber?"
"It is because of our failure to resolve the issue that we are back here."
"We have to continue to publicise this issue until it is resolved."
"What is this injustice?"
"Mr Wieland started to highlight it when he spoke on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The injustice is about two people doing the same job, working side by side, but on different pay and under different conditions."
"If we truly believe in the single market and the free movement of people, that should not happen."
"I disagree with my colleague, Mr Lisi, who spoke earlier."
"He talked about these people wanting a ""privileged"" position."
"They are not asking for a privileged position, they are just asking for the same."
"Until they get the same as their equivalents in Italy this matter will rumble on."
"I listened carefully to what Mr Busquin said on behalf of the Commission."
"Some people say there is a whiff of hypocrisy from the Commission."
"Some even go further and say there is a stench of hypocrisy from the Commission."
"I will go as far so to say there is a small smell of hypocrisy coming from the Commission."
"If the Commission were truly serious about resolving this issue it would have been resolved years ago."
"We can perhaps accept that the previous Commission under Mr Santer was not the best, so that is why it went."
"But I have to say we are looking at this Commission: the President of this Commission is fully aware of this case, is fully aware of the facts, and yet nothing has been done to resolve it."
"We have to ask why."
"That is why this Parliament today is again debating this issue, highlighting this issue, to put it back before the Commission and say: get this sorted out."
"Mr President, politicians often have the difficult task of telling constituents that no matter how heartfelt their grievance, or how strong its moral base, there is no legal remedy."
"Sometimes they have the even more difficult task of having to admit that because of problems of access to justice or because of the law's own delays, the road to vindicating their legal rights will be long and arduous."
"Worst of all, I believe, is having to issue a warning that a court judgment in their favour may just be a set of comforting words and make no real difference in their lives."
"Fortunately, in a democratic society this is rare."
"The rule of law means just that."
"No-one can place him or herself outside its ambit just because of who they are or what they do."
"The American jurist, Lon Fuller, warned us that one of the ways in which something can fail to be a legal system is if there is no congruence between legal rules and official action."
"In the last eleven years we have seen three European Court of Justice judgments in favour of the lettori."
"On 13 September this year the European Ombudsman sustained a complaint by them and a number of individual cases have been upheld in the Italian courts."
"I am well aware that the circumstances have not been easy for people on both sides of the argument."
"But if in this Parliament the rule of law is important to us, we must ensure that it is upheld."
"If in this Parliament we genuinely believe in a citizen's Europe, we must strive to secure one."
"As has been said, this is the third time that this issue has come before Parliament in the form of a motion for a resolution."
"I hope and trust that there will be no need for it ever to do so again, unless it is to thank all those involved for the fact that effective action has now been taken."
"We are a small House because it is a Friday morning but it needs to be noticed and recognised that this is an all-party issue and an all-Union issue."
"Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market from all over the Union and from all the parties have come together to say that it is no use talking about rights, advocating charters of rights if you do not, in real cases when people's rights are denied, take effective action to get them recognised and to get them enforced, and that is the problem in this case."
"I was sorry to see, for example, one of the amendments taking out the reference not only to an appeal to the Ombudsman but the fact that the Ombudsman answered it affirmatively."
"That is a critical point because the Ombudsman said that the Commission acted wrongly in failing to communicate with the language lettori the fact that they were changing pleadings on an important and significant article, and the article on which the Commission changed its pleadings is the very point that Commissioner Busquin mentioned."
"The point is that the lettori claim the right to continue as teachers, not to be changed into something else."
"Nobody disputes that the Italian Republic is fully within its entitlement, in 1995 or at any other time, to say for the future we will not hire people as lettori, we will bring in people for a new kind of appointment."
"They can say that to anybody who applies in the future, but they cannot in respect of the past change the rights of people whose rights have upheld by the Court."
"I remind the Commission that I hope it will reply to the point that in the Allué case the ruling of the Court is as follows: 'Hereby rules, it is contrary to Article 48(2) of the EEC Treaty for the legislation of a Member State to limit the duration of employment contracts of foreign-language assistants in any event to one year, with the possibility of renewal where in principle no such limit exists with regard to other teachers.'"
"If that is so, then the people whose representatives are in the gallery today, are entitled to be recognised as teachers in Italian universities of similar standing to those holding ten-year appointments in the university."
"We do not say they should be made Italian civil servants."
"We say Italy should make its law conform with the decision of the Court and give these teachers the right to be such."
"Mr President, there is clearly something wrong with the policy governing the appointment of foreign teachers in Italy, if they are only granted temporary appointments as technical administrative employees."
"This leaves them in a precarious legal position, and means that they receive lower pay than their Italian colleagues for the same work."
"This has already been established by the Court of Justice and the ombudsman."
"What is important is whether this came about by unhappy accident, or whether a quite deliberate decision was taken to maintain this distinction on a permanent basis."
"I assume that the Italian educational authorities are already fully appraised of the criticism, but the impression I am getting is that this has not convinced them of the need to do things differently from now on."
"Even though I am an advocate of national autonomy and the right to diversity, I endorse the motion for a resolution because there must never be discrimination on the basis of nationality."
"If we adopt the proposed resolution, will it bring about any changes in the situation, or is there nothing the European Union can do about it at the end of the day? Is Italy to receive a fine by way of punishment?"
"Are we going to carry on complaining, with our hands tied, or are other Member States going to follow suit and start discriminating against Italian teachers?"
"By coincidence, this very afternoon I am off to Italy, a country that I love so much, to lecture about the benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which has been exported so successfully to the rest of the world, and therefore it saddens me all the more to make this speech criticising its government and its rules in this area."
"However, some of my British constituents who wish to lecture and reside in Italy are not so fortunate as I am today."
"In 1989 foreign lecturers working there won a case before the ECJ requiring their contracts not to be limited to six years."
"After the Italian universities had responded by saying that the judgment did not specifically require them to offer open-ended contracts, a second judgment of the Court in 1993 spelt out clearly that the length of the contracts could not be fixed."
"The universities responded by downgrading the status of foreign lecturers to support staff and no longer members of the academic teaching staff."
"These dismissed lettori, as they are known, took their employers to the Italian Supreme Court, which ruled in their favour and demanded their immediate reinstatement."
"The universities ignored the rulings, denying them the rights associated with teaching staff, including the twice-yearly pay rises so generous in the academic system in Italy."
"In a Kafkaesque style the universities even went as far as to remove their names from the internal telephone books, the doors and the university websites."
"This is quite unacceptable in a modern Europe."
"Some of you will be aware of my support for the right of the male descendants of the exiled Italian royal family to return to their homeland."
"They are subject to a medieval article in the constitution of Italy which prevents all male descendants of the family from entering Italian territory, in clear violation in my view of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Shamefully, in this very House the left-wing and Liberal groups have conspired to block the two princes' access to the Court of Justice although a ruling is expected shortly from the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"Governments must understand that if they sign treaties then they must either abrogate them as sovereign states or abide by their terms in a rule of law."
"The Italian Government, which comprises left-wing parties who constantly extol the virtues of European laws, rights and treaties, must act soon on both these issues if its commitments to the values for which it claims to stand are not to generate widespread cynicism in other Member States about Italy's commitment to uphold European law."
"So far the European Commission has proven unwilling to enforce the Treaties when the number of people affected are few."
"In the instance of my motion on the royal family this was even described by the Liberal rapporteur in this House on human rights as an exotic motion of no interest."
"Well, I believe that these matters go to the very heart of the fundamental principles of the freedom associated with European law, particularly the freedom of movement, and no exceptions can be made to these principles."
"There must be non-discrimination for EU citizens wherever they come from and wherever they want to go to within the Union."
"These issues are vital to uphold European freedom and in my view there is no national issue of vital interest to the security of the Italian State which is being threatened by either the royal family or the Italian foreign lecturers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on this question, which goes beyond Italy, is a highly interesting and most important debate."
"When we refer in recital C of the resolution to the three judgments, which state that the rights of the persons affected under the freedom of movement of labour in the Union and their rights not to be exposed to discrimination on the basis of their nationality were violated by Italy's omissions and when the ombudsman and numerous speakers here confirm this, then the argument of one of the previous speakers, namely that the violation can be justified on the grounds of subsidiarity does not stand up."
"When the European Court of Justice finds that European law has been violated, this cannot be countered by invoking the principle of subsidiarity."
"The second point is that this is, without doubt, a political debate because it is about the violation of the law."
"The legal status of the Treaties cannot be played off against politics; on the contrary, it is our duty, should this happen, to hold a political debate in the House on the violation of the law."
"I think that the saying ""If you don't take yourself seriously, no-one else will"" is most apt here."
"When there are three judgments in a case by the European Court of Justice and the country in question still fails to change its conduct, then we must intervene; we must make it public."
"We discussed the Charter of Fundamental Rights here in the House a few days ago."
"Surely compliance with current law is the very first fundamental right which can be demanded of us?"
"Surely promoting the community based on law is the basis for the European community of values?"
"You cannot play one off against the other."
"Obviously education still comes under subsidiarity but, within the framework of the Treaties, the freedom of movement of workers and the ban on discrimination apply to everyone, although we - and I in particular, coming as I do from a highly federalist state - support the principle of subsidiarity as a principle of order in our dealings with the European Union and do what we can so that powers are divided as quickly as possible between the levels in Europe in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Italy's conduct in this matter runs counter to the objectives of the Community and runs counter to our desire to increase the mobility and flexibility of workers."
"The diversity of cultures, which we see as a fundamental element of Europe, finds expression first and foremost in the diversity of languages."
"Anyone who stands up for the diversity of cultures must do what they can so that we can maintain the diversity of languages and learn them everywhere."
"We support the internal economic market."
"I say that also as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport: the internal economic market needs the internal educational market."
"There are still many fetters and many obstacles to this internal market, as today's debate has shown, and not just in this case."
"We should do everything to remove these fetters as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I believe that all the speeches have contributed specific elements to the debate."
"Nonetheless, I think that I have already answered a certain number of the points raised."
"I would like to recall once again that these mechanisms contain a time factor and that we are talking about facts going back ten years, different aspects of which must be taken into consideration."
"As regards the conformity of the Italian system to the decision of the Court in the Allué case, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure, which was dropped in 1995 when Italy adopted the law abolishing this restriction."
"Italy then adopted a new text in 1996 eliminating the discriminatory elements that existed before. But there is a second aspect to the problem: the question of acquired rights."
"In this area, we analysed all the processes, as I have already explained and the Commission launched a new infringement procedure against Italy in July 1999."
"We are waiting for the European Court of Justice to rule on this aspect of the problem."
"There are thus two things, which I would not describe as being different, but which are linked together slightly differently over time."
"It is therefore necessary to make a distinction between the two elements. As regards the equal access of all European citizens to all professional categories, it is clear that each European citizen may become a member of the Italian teaching body by taking part in a competition intended for Italian teachers."
"In this context, it can no longer be a question of discrimination."
"It is therefore necessary to look at the previous situation, which was manifestly discriminatory."
"The Commission did its job in bringing the infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice and the Italian State changed the law."
"It is clear that the entire problem of acquired rights still remains unsolved."
"We are once again in the middle of an infringement procedure and we hope that the Court of Justice will give its opinion as soon as possible."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0824/2000) on the rights of language teachers: maintenance of the rule of law"
"After the vote on recital H:"
"Mr President, I hereby suggest that we insert the word ""unconvincingly"" between ""government"" and ""claims"" in this amendment."
"I have no objection to its being drawn to our attention that the Italian Government has made a certain claim, but especially since the Commissioner has disgracefully shown that he perhaps believes the claim, let us put the word ""unconvincingly"" in or reject this amendment."
"As there are no objections to this oral amendment, we shall vote on it."
"(Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution) Explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I will not excuse the Italian government or the Italian courts for condemning many pensioners to a low pension, but in this case I voted against the report because I consider the judgments of the Court of Justice to be erroneous."
"The root of the issue is that it is impossible to grant a language assistant, a person who is well versed in English and comes to an Italian medical university to explain to the students what the Italian terms are for heart disease, operation, liver disease, and so forth, to have the same rights, on the basis of their having the same status, as someone who teaches medicine."
"Mr President, would you go for treatment to somebody who knows all the surgical terms in Italian, English, French and German, or would you go to a surgeon?"
"Mr President, I have a great deal of sympathy for language teachers in Italy who do not have Italian nationality."
"As a citizen of a very small country, I am a great advocate of the free movement of workers and self-employed people and also of the freedom of establishment. As an old suffragette, I have spent 40 years on the barricades, fighting against all forms of discrimination, whether based on gender or on nationality."
"But the free movement of workers must not result in discrimination against nationals."
"Coming from a country whose active population is more than 50% non-Luxembourgeois, foreign residents or people who cross the border every day to work, I know what I am talking about."
"In my country, for secondary school teachers we have very strict and very hard recruitment competitions."
"We cannot, and I say this as a matter of principle, discriminate against nationals by making access to employment easier for non-nationals."
"This said, I hope that our debate will go some way to promoting an equitable solution for language teachers in Italy."
"I feel bound to say, however, that we could easily fill up Friday' s agenda, if we were to deal with all existing similar cases of discrimination in this Chamber, especially those based on gender."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I am pleased that the Liberal amendments were defeated and that I was therefore able to vote for this report but I would like to query one point made by Mr Busquin."
"He said that everyone working in Italian universities has to pass the same exams as Italian teachers have to pass."
"I do not see why that should be the case."
"We are supposed to have mutual recognition of qualifications across Europe so that you can qualify in your own country and then move to others."
"That is a basic issue in Mr Busquin's response which needs to be questioned and I am sorry to see that he has now left the Chamber."
"Mr Purvis, that was not a point of order."
"Unfortunately, Mr Busquin has already left."
"I would advise you to speak to him directly."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned and wish you a pleasant weekend."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.56 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 27 October 2000."
"Statement by the President"
"Madam President, I should like to thank you very much for extending your sympathies and condolences on the occasion of this terrible tragedy which we have just experienced."
"Many of these mainly young people boarded the train with the prospect of enjoying themselves, having fun and experiencing something positive, and they instead experienced a terrible and tragic death."
"I should like to thank you - I do not know whether anyone else will be speaking about this - on behalf of many Members of this House and, in any case, on behalf of my group and my delegation."
"Madam President, may I take this opportunity, since you addressed this matter in such clear and sympathetic terms, to say that for this reason we can dispense with having a topical and urgent debate on this matter."
"I would ask you to understand that for this reason we do not really need to have the topical and urgent debate."
"Madam President, allow me to thank you very much on behalf of my delegation for your message of sympathy which you sent on behalf of the European Parliament following the catastrophe at Kitzsteinhorn to our President, Dr Klestil, our Chancellor, Wolfgang Schüssel, and thus to all the people of Austria."
"Thank you also for having the flags flown at half-mast."
"We are united in shock and grief for the 150 people who died and we share in the pain of their relatives."
"We extend our deepest sympathies to them."
"The great Austrian poet, Rainer Maria Rilke, once wrote that death is great and that we find ourselves in its laughing mouth."
"The burning inferno on the funicular railway - a railway which was considered to be one of the safest - which leads to one of the most beautiful areas of the Austrian Alps, makes everything else fade into the background, and the readiness to share pain and grief becomes our only comfort."
"I would therefore consider it to be appropriate to commemorate the victims, who did not only come from my country but from many European countries and from overseas, in a minute' s silence, and I also think that we should dispense with a resolution on this matter."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday 27 October have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, our Minutes of the 27 October record our decision to pass a resolution about the Italian lettori and we were very grateful that the House carried it with such a large majority."
"In the meantime, Members of the House should know that the president of the association of the lettori was last week visited in his classroom by the anti-terrorist police to check if he was planning any violent demonstration against the Minister of Education."
"This would hardly count as a positive response to the resolution that we moved."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents on Thursday 9 November, pursuant to Article 110 of the Rules of Procedure."
"a) Sittings of 13 to 17 November 2000 Relating to Monday:"
"With regard to the report by Mr Ceyhun, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I have received two requests: one request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists for referral of this report to committee, and one request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for deferral of this report to a later part-session."
"I will now give the floor to Mr Ceyhun, who will speak in his capacity as rapporteur and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Madam President, I should like to state - also on behalf of my group - that referring this report back to the committee responsible in accordance with Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure would actually be the correct course of action for Parliament to adopt, because I prepared a report and only found out afterwards that the Council had plans in this field."
"Since we were not given sufficient notice, it would make more sense to wait for the legislative proposals and only then have Parliament deal with this point so that we do justice to the problem."
"For this reason, I would request that the report be referred back to committee without there being a debate on it in plenary today, and the committee responsible, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will certainly be able to deal with this matter properly."
"It is therefore quite clear: the rapporteur recommends referral to committee."
"He was also speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, who made this request."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral to committee?"
"Madam President, the report drafted by my colleague, Mr Ceyhun, is a very important one, and we, too, have heard that the Council has some new plans with regard to these matters."
"I support Mr Ceyhun' s proposal, and I would be very grateful if the Council could clarify whether it really intends to put forward a new proposal with regard to this issue."
"You are, thus, firmly in favour of the referral to committee."
"Does anyone wish to speak against this request?"
"Madam President, it appears that the Council has known for some time that we were going to debate this subject today."
"In my opinion, it has made an institutional error in changing its position at the last minute, keeping us in the dark right up until the very last moment and then exerting pressure upon someone to request that the report be referred back to committee."
"We have done our job and, in my opinion, our work should be concluded irrespective of the Council' s position."
"We are not the Council' s slaves: we have our institutional autonomy and I therefore consider this referral to committee totally inappropriate."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the request for referral to committee made by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"(Parliament gave its assent) Relating to Tuesday:"
"With regard to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the third Asia-Europe Meeting, the Council has informed us that it does not wish to speak for the moment."
"That therefore leaves us with just the statement by the Commission."
"In order to group together the interventions by the President-in-Office of the Council, who has an extremely busy schedule, I propose that the statement by the Commission be inserted at the end of the joint debate on aid for reconstruction."
"Are there any objections?"
"There are none."
"Then that is what we shall do."
"Relating to Wednesday:With regard to the statement by the Commission on BSE and the ban on animal meal in all animal feedingstuffs, the Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that the Council also make a statement on this matter."
"The Group is aware of the fact that Wednesday morning will be a very difficult time for the French ministers."
"The initial meetings that we have had at administrative level were not particularly fruitful, but I am quite prepared to intervene at a more political level, in the hope of achieving success."
"Madam President, I would like to speak on a point of order, regarding not the agenda, but the order of voting."
"In order to simplify matters, I would like to propose that we vote on the oral question on the Euro-Mediterranean Conference at the start of voting time at 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday because, as you are aware, the Conference opens at 6 p.m. in Marseilles."
"The voting session will be long and will be interrupted, amongst other things, by the welcome presence of President Kostunica. In addition, some of us will have to leave in order to be present at the opening of the Marseilles Conference, and so we would like to be able to vote on the oral question at the start of the session before all the other reports."
"It would therefore merely be a matter of bringing forward the vote."
"Mrs Napoletano, we could of course proceed in that way."
"Relating to Thursday: President."
"The Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposes deleting the item entitled 'British submarine in Gibraltar' ."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group regards this incident as being so important that we do not consider it appropriate for it to be dealt with in the topical and urgent debate."
"We think that we should address this matter in the form of an oral question to the Council and the Commission, and would like to draft this carefully to ensure that both the Council and the Commission do discuss it."
"We do not think that the time is right to discuss this matter in a topical and urgent debate and would therefore request that this item be deleted from the agenda."
"Thank you, Mr Poettering."
"Does anyone else wish to speak in favour of this request?"
"Mr Poettering has spoken on behalf of the group which requested that the item be deleted."
"Madam President, no group is more sensitive than mine when it comes to sharing the quite natural concerns felt by the inhabitants of the Campo de Gibraltar area; therefore, as the Chairman of my group has already indicated, I should like to offer the Group of the Party of European Socialists a consensus so that we can have a serious and thorough debate on this matter by means of an oral question to the Council and the Commission."
"If this was not the intention of those who proposed this resolution, if through lack of experience - not through lack of scruples, I am sure - what was intended was to bring an internal, domestic affair before this Parliament - as the spokesman for the Spanish Socialists in the Spanish national parliament recognised at the weekend - then of course they cannot count on the Group of the European People' s Party to play this game."
"Madam President, my group has listened carefully to this proposal."
"With regard to Mr Galeote' s statements, I must point out that this is not a domestic issue: it is an issue in which the Commission has competence, as it has itself declared in its reply to a question from our colleague, Mr Aparicio."
"This reply also mentioned the lack of information and the obstacles raised by the British Government."
"Thus we are not talking about some domestic issue; we are talking about the presence of a nuclear submarine, the breakdown of which has led the Royal Navy to decide to dock eleven submarines in British territory."
"Therefore, under the Treaties and under the Euratom Treaty this issue falls within the competence of the Commission; it affects or may affect many citizens who are not just Spanish, because in this area and its surroundings - and there is no emergency plan in place - there are hundreds of thousands of European citizens from the fifteen countries of the Union as well as many people from outside, because this is the Costa del Sol."
"We therefore believe that the matter deserves substantive consideration."
"If the European People' s Party is proposing that at the next part-session we should support having this question taken up, we may consider it; if it is just a delaying tactic, we will be against it."
"I should therefore like to ask for a formal commitment from the PPE that we should vote together in favour of having this matter included as a question to the Commission and the Council at the next part-session."
"Mr Barón Crespo, I would like to make sure I understand you correctly."
"I have received a proposal from the Group of the European People' s Party for this item to be withdrawn from the topical and urgent debate, for the reasons that Mr Poettering and Mr Galeote have just set out."
"I have the impression that you agree with their rationale, Mr Barón Crespo, if I understand you correctly."
"Are you in favour of this item being deleted?"
"Madam President, my group would be in favour of accepting the inclusion of this question on December' s agenda."
"What we would not agree with is having this matter omitted and then seeing if it can be postponed indefinitely."
"Yes, there is that, but let us just say that we are formally withdrawing the item from the topical and urgent debate."
"However, we all quite agree that it should be discussed, as you have said."
"Mr Poettering, is that what you intended?"
"I simply wanted to say to Mr Baròn Crespo that he can always depend on the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to keep its word."
"If the Chairman of the group makes a statement here, then he can assume that the statement will still hold true the next day."
"That is why we will now set in motion the procedure with which Mr Baròn Crespo obviously agrees."
"It would be nice if the House were at one on this issue."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"b) Sittings of 29 and 30 November 2000:"
"No amendments were proposed."
"Madam President, it is sad but very enlightening to learn from the Spanish Minister of the Interior, Mr Mayor Oreja, that there is no point in talking with Basque nationalists, even if a new cease-fire were to take place in the future."
"This statement evidently does not support the position of our Spanish colleagues in this House when they affirm that in the Spanish Kingdom every political party can defend its ideas whatever they might be, with only one basic premise: the absence of violence."
"Can this House back the refusal of dialogue?"
"Can this House close the door to political solutions?"
"Can this House close the door on the democratic future of the Basque country inside Europe?"
"I would appreciate it if points of order really were points of order, and I would be grateful if you could begin by indicating, as, moreover, is stipulated in the Rules of Procedure, the rule on which each point of order is based."
"Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a certain written statement that my colleague, Mr Ebner, is putting forward."
"He is proposing that the Directive on birds should be amended to take better account of the principle of subsidiarity."
"I would like to tell you and all my colleagues that this statement is being marketed in a way that makes it appear favourably disposed towards birds, as promoting their welfare, but I can tell you that that is not the case, and that this will worsen the situation of migratory birds in the European Union."
"I would appeal to everyone that you at least make sure you know what you are signing if you sign this petition."
"I fully support the letter written by my colleague, Dorette Corbey, which she has sent to our colleagues regarding this matter: there should be no misleading marketing regarding this written statement."
"Madam President, some time ago in this House we discussed the issue of sanctions on Iraq."
"I am very glad to see that the British Liberals have decided to call for a review of sanctions on Iraq."
"The week before last I flew to Iraq, over Turkish airspace into Baghdad, on a humanitarian mission."
"In the six months since I was last there, the situation has got worse."
"More than 5,000 children are dying every month according to UNICEF."
"The Commission should come to this House and address that issue."
"These children have nothing whatsoever to do with the conflict in the Middle East."
"The Commission have slavishly taken the US/British line, while the US and British and Turks continue to bomb southern Iraq."
"Madam President, I would like you to advise the Commission to make a statement on the issue of sanctions."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I had indicated that I wanted to speak before you closed the discussion on the agenda."
"May I ask that we consider, this week, a Commission statement on the decision of the UK government to introduce a discriminatory tax on non-British road hauliers."
"I need not remind you or the House that this is completely contrary to the Treaties which guarantee unhindered access to the single market."
"It is also contrary to Directive 99/62/EC which provides, and I quote, ""that tolls and user charges may not discriminate directly or indirectly on the grounds of the nationality of the haulier, nor the origin or destination of the vehicle"" ."
"This impacts extremely seriously on Irish trade."
"70% of Irish lorries, Irish transporters, must go to, or through, the UK land bridge to Europe."
"I should like to request a Commission statement and call on the Commission to use its powers to maintain the freedoms of the internal market and to ensure compliance with Directive 99/62/EC to which I have referred."
"It is urgent that before the proposed change by the British authorities is implemented we have a debate and the Commission indicates quite clearly where the law lies in this regard."
"Mrs Doyle, I allowed you extra time because that was not a point of order."
"That was part of the order of business and I deeply regret not having been informed of it."
"I feel that the Commission has been very receptive to your request, as Commissioner Vitorino has confirmed to me."
"It will therefore be acted upon appropriately."
"Madam President, with reference to the smooth running of Parliament and the safety of the Members, I would like to inform you that, during the last Strasbourg part-session, on Wednesday evening to be precise, the PPE Member from Forza Italia, Mr Mario Mantovani, slipped on the steps and fractured his left foot while taking his suitcases down to the taxi outside Parliament."
"He stayed on to vote on Thursday morning and then his foot was put in plaster. He will not be able to take part in our work for 60 days."
"On the one hand, a representative of the Pensioners' Party might welcome the presence of invalids - another pensioner perhaps - but, on the other, I would like all our Members to be safe."
"I therefore ask you when a lift or an escalator will be installed, so that we will be able to go down to the cars at the end of the day in safety."
"Madam President, I would like to inform Parliament of a serious initiative undertaken last week in Italy by the regional government of the Lazio region."
"The regional government has established a committee to monitor the history textbooks used in schools. The committee is to ascertain the extent to which these texts are influenced by Marxism - as the neo-fascists who are in power in Lazio say."
"The fact is that these texts merely present the history of Italy, of the Second World War, of nazism and fascism, on the assumption that it is clear that the values for which the resistance and the antifascists were fighting and the ideas motivating Hitler and Mussolini cannot be regarded as equal."
"This is an extremely serious initiative towards reintroducing censorship in Italy, limited to text books for the moment but which will soon be extended to other areas."
"Since the allegedly liberal parties, including the European liberal parties, always tend to ally themselves with parties of xenophobic, racist, authoritarian inspiration, I feel that this is not only a serious danger for Italy, but also an indication of something which concerns the whole of Europe."
"I would ask the Members to sign a petition which I am circulating, which also bears the signatures of other European intellectuals."
"Mutual assistance in criminal matters"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A5-0313/2000) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime [10232/2000 - C5-0393/2000 - 2000/0814(CNS)],"
"(A5-0312/2000) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative from the Portuguese Republic with a view to adopting a Council Act on the drawing up on the basis of Article 43(1) of the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention) of a Protocol amending Article 2 and the Annex to that Convention [9426/2000 - C5-0359/2000 - 2000/0809(CNS)],"
"(A5-0314/2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, in particular in the area of combating organised crime, laundering of the proceeds from crime and financial crime [10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815(CNS)]."
"Madam President, the fight against financial crime and, in particular, crime involving money laundering, will feature at various points in today' s plenary sitting, and this reflects the political importance of the legal instruments which the European Union wishes to establish for the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Following the creation of the internal market and the corresponding liberalisation of capital and of financial services, the Union has committed itself to the fight against money laundering. This is a complex crime, which requires another, original, crime to have taken place, resulting in illegal profits that people attempt to recycle into normal, legal economic life."
"Money laundering, which is the final destination for the proceeds of international crime and a consequence of the globalisation of the economy and of the gradual liberalisation of trade, is at the heart of organised crime, as stated in the Tampere conclusions, and is often the result of drug trafficking."
"It is a sobering thought that the fight to end this activity involves seizing the proceeds of the original crime, which are later disguised as respectable wealth."
"The only way to ensure that this fight is effective is through international cooperation, which in Europe, in the face of international crime, takes the form of judicial cooperation between all the Member States."
"This report, therefore, highlights the measures proposed by the French Presidency, which, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency, has moved ahead with initiatives to approximate legislation, in line with the Tampere Council conclusions. The Treaty of Amsterdam has also been implemented, not forgetting the good work that the Commission has carried out in this area and the commitment and clear thinking of Commissioner Vitorino."
"There is, therefore, coherence between the three initiatives that are the subject of my report and of the reports by Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Roure in that the framework decision forces the Member States to comply with the outcome, in that Europol' s competence is extended to cover money laundering in terms of investigations and in that a convention improves mutual legal assistance."
"We are therefore heading in the right direction for the creation of a broad, effective legal framework, which will at least limit this type of crime."
"My report clearly supports the crux of the rationale behind the framework decision, with proposals that seek fundamentally to enable Member States to confiscate goods gained from serious crimes and to force them to punish offenders committing money-laundering crimes and to legislate against them, without the flexibility offered by the loopholes in previous legal instruments which made it easy for criminals to thumb their noses at the law and to control whole economies."
"We also support the result of the binding nature of the framework decision, which forces Member States to harmonise their laws for the common good whilst being subject to judicial supervision by the Court of Justice."
"The report also contains some criticism, however, of the French proposal."
"Why should only a part of the previous joint action be transposed, which would leave these measures split into weak and strong legislation due to their different natures, highlighting the fragility of joint action? Why not accept straightaway the complete transposal of the whole set into the framework decision, as stated in the amendments that I proposed, Nos 9, 12, 13 and 14?"
"Nor do we feel that tracing and confiscating goods should be restricted to cases in which the original crimes are classed as serious."
"This would open up a totally unjustifiable and huge area of law consisting of crimes that will not be prosecuted at all."
"Hence Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8."
"Lastly, although I must reiterate my appreciation of the French and Portuguese initiatives under the genuinely broader scope that Amsterdam, despite everything, has provided - and let us be frank about this, the Commission has been able to turn this to good advantage - there are still such differences in the origin and the effectiveness of the various judicial methods, directives, joint actions, framework decisions, conventions and international conventions that it is becoming urgent to communitise judicial, criminal and civil law, and thereby create an area of justice at the service of freedom and security."
"It is a shame that this is not already a priority in the reform of the Treaties, since the current IGC is at the mercy of the weight of the various Member States and of the measures that they wish to implement..."
"We nevertheless believe that the public will shortly be in a position to demand this new aspect of Europe. They will be able to force through a revision of the Treaties that is concerned with their genuine interests and we believe that this revision will indeed be carried out in the name of freedom, security and justice."
"Madam President, as Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I rise to present Mrs Karamanou' s report."
"Mrs Karamanou is sadly unable to be with us tonight, but I feel it appropriate that her report should be debated along with Mr Marinho' s excellent report, which we have just discussed."
"The Republic of Portugal presented a draft Protocol amending Article 2 of the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office, Europol."
"This Portuguese initiative aims to extend Europol' s competences in order to establish a general framework of competence for Europol in relation to money laundering."
"The fight against money laundering is, of course, one of the Union' s most important priorities, as rightly identified at the Tampere Summit last year."
"Considering that money laundering is at the heart of organised crime, especially drug trafficking, which represents such a threat to public health and public security, one cannot but endorse this proposed measure."
"Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime."
"This proposed Protocol should be seen as a necessary measure in a European strategy for police cooperation in the field of money laundering."
"But considering the urgency, our rapporteur seeks in her Amendment No 6 to have this Protocol adopted as quickly as possible that is, according to Article 34(2)(d) of the Treaty on European Union, when a majority of Member States have notified their approvals."
"The committee which I have the honour to chair adopted Mrs Karamanou' s report nearly unanimously."
"Much as we approved of the Portuguese initiative, however, we insist on a broader revision of the Europol Convention and indeed on mechanisms to ensure both democratic accountability and judicial control of Europol."
"Let me touch briefly on those two matters."
"On the question of democratic accountability, I note that at the moment Article 39 of the Europol Convention requires that the European Parliament simply be consulted on an annual report."
"This is quite unacceptable and on several recent occasions, Parliament has requested, in particular in the Nassauer and Cederschiöld reports, modifications to the Europol Convention to ensure true democratic accountability of this agency."
"In order for Parliament to exercise such democratic control, Europol must, as with the other European institutions such as the ECB and the Ombudsman, report on its activities in an annual exchange of views."
"The Director of Europol should be required to appear before Parliament' s competent committees when circumstances require."
"Moreover, Parliament should be represented on the management board of Europol and should have a say in the choice of the director of the agency."
"These requests are covered in Amendments Nos 2 and 4 of Mrs Karamanou' s report."
"On questions of judicial accountability, it seems to us equally unacceptable that possible disputes or conflicts between Member States or between Europol and Member States cannot be brought before the Court of Justice, despite the provisions of Article 35 of the Treaty which refer precisely to matters relating to police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"This contradiction conflicts with democratic values, particularly in regard to human rights, and especially in the field of data protection."
"This lack of judicial accountability of Europol is particularly dangerous given that Europol seems to be assuming more and more responsibilities and this concern is covered in Mrs Karamanou' s Amendment No 5."
"In conclusion, Parliament has considered attentively and positively this Portuguese initiative but we are unsatisfied with the limited scope of the proposed revision of the Europol Convention."
"Faced with the challenge of internationally organised crime, the European Parliament must be able to represent the citizens of the Union effectively and this is why we must be fully informed of and involved in Europol' s activities, its programmes, effectiveness, methods and means."
"I am fully aware that in this matter Parliament is only consulted."
"Nevertheless, we urge the French Presidency, which has shown such a determined commitment to fight against money laundering, to take account of our demands."
"The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialised agency under the sole control of national governments."
"This is a major area of European integration and the European Parliament is ready to offer its support to policies in this area provided it is duly involved."
"Madam President, international criminal networks have become considerably stronger and more organised in recent years."
"Factors such as globalisation can be seen to have enhanced the possibilities of laundering dirty money and the means of avoiding prosecution."
"According to figures released by the United Nations, 1 000 billion dollars are recycled every year through money laundering operations."
"Money laundering is a difficult offence to detect, and crime syndicates take advantage of every loophole in the various legal systems."
"As a result, international cooperation in police and judicial matters is the only way of effectively thwarting this illegal practice."
"At European level, mutual assistance in criminal matters has already, in general terms, seen the adoption of several texts, such as the Council of Europe' s Convention of 20 April 1959 and, very recently, the European Convention of 29 May 2000, for which our fellow MEP, Mr Di Pietro, acted as rapporteur."
"In the more specific area of combating money laundering, we could cite the Council Directive of 10 June 1991, as recently amended, for which our fellow MEP, Mr Lehne, acted as rapporteur."
"The initiative from the French Presidency that we are examining today is aimed at improving the two blanket conventions on mutual assistance in criminal matters that I have just mentioned, specifically in the field of combating money laundering."
"The convention that we have before us improves these earlier texts, and we welcome these improvements."
"By virtue of Article 2 of the draft Convention, the Member States can no longer decline to conduct searches or seize items by invoking the reservations set out in Article 5 of the Convention of 1959."
"Article 4 states that in order to facilitate enquiries, the Member States must take appropriate measures to promote the transfer and safekeeping of data relating to the existence, location and movement of the proceeds of crime, while Article 5 states that the Member States are required to furnish information on banking activities."
"Article 6, for its part, provides for the making of supplementary requests for mutual assistance, and Article 7 states that fiscal exceptions can no longer constitute a reason for refusing mutual assistance."
"One can only approve of the body of measures contained in this draft Convention."
"They respond to the concerns expressed by the Tampere European Council concerning the fight against money laundering, which is the very root of organised crime and which must be eradicated wherever it is found."
"It would seem to me that certain improvements could be proposed, and that is the point of my report."
"The non-invocability of banking and commercial secrecy in response to requests for mutual assistance is set down in Article 3."
"It would seem to me essential to extend this non-invocability to encompass the commercial and financial advice activities of lawyers and members of regulated legal professions, which due to their nature are not governed by professional secrecy."
"Furthermore, Article 8 of the draft Convention limits the reasons which Member States may invoke for refusing to provide assistance to ""essential interests"" ."
"This represents progress, but for mutual assistance not to lose any of its impact in an area in which only rapid cooperation at European level can be of any meaning, it would seem worthwhile to only grant the Member State asked for information two months in which to make known its refusal to give assistance."
"Article 9 requires the Member States to set up integrated multidisciplinary teams at national level in order to enhance the efficiency of searches and promote information exchanges."
"I propose that a coordination unit be set up for these multidisciplinary teams. This unit could facilitate information exchanges between the relevant authorities in the Member States and encourage the selection and use of best practices."
"The sole aim of these proposals is to achieve mutual assistance that is as effective as possible and meets the challenges posed by organised crime, particularly in the field of money laundering."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my task is a relatively easy one: if I am supposed to comment on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee on the Portuguese Presidency' s proposal regarding involving Europol in the fight against money laundering, then I can only say that it is a good proposal."
"That is also why we have only submitted a very small number of proposals for amendments, because we can, of course, agree to this proposal."
"There is a broad consensus in all of the European institutions - including, of course, here in this House - that we want to take all reasonable and possible steps to counter money laundering. Previous speakers have already said all that needs to be said in this regard."
"But, since I am now actually standing here and have the opportunity to comment on the issue of combating money laundering, I should very much like to voice some criticism."
"I should like to criticise something which actually has nothing at all to do with the proposal which we are debating today, but with the impact of the political position adopted by the Council on the second directive to combat money laundering."
"From the outset, the European Parliament tried to work in close cooperation with the Council."
"I can only say that, as a result, the Council did admittedly make a big show of cooperating, but the bulk of the amendments tabled by us and adopted here in this House by a very large majority were not accepted."
"In this respect, I can only say that if the concept of combating money laundering is damaged, then this is the fault of the Council and not of Parliament."
"The rules which were designed in the past with banks and providers of financial services in mind have been applied, as it were, wholesale to some of the liberal professions, despite the fact that they are not at all suitable for them, and in full knowledge of the fact that under these circumstances it would be absolutely impossible to avoid a difficult second reading with the European Parliament and a conciliation procedure at the end."
"After all, this is certainly not about the privileges of lawyers or practitioners of other liberal professions."
"It is about fundamental rights."
"Quite simply, it is about a client seeking legal advice or support before a court being able - as is also stated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, by the way - to go to a lawyer whom he trusts and to obtain his advice, without, if he reveals something to him, the lawyer being obliged to go directly to the public prosecutor' s office to blow the whistle on him."
"This is a fundamental right."
"This fundamental right must not be meddled with."
"The same goes for all areas where legal advice is dispensed."
"I am therefore very grateful for the compromise formulation in the Roure report which was drafted here in committee, which has simply made it clear that this traditional protection of fundamental rights must continue to be guaranteed."
"I should also like to make it clear, however, that when lawyers fulfil the same functions as banks and financial service providers, then there is obviously no reason to protect that part of their activities. But this is about dispensing legal advice and representing people before a court of law."
"The protection of fundamental rights must be guaranteed in this regard."
"As I have said, that is why I support the proposals on the table today but, at the same time, I would take this opportunity to give you advance notice that there will be a real battle with the Council over the common position on the second directive to combat money laundering."
"Madam President, I think that today' s debate is extremely important for the simple reason that it is about how we can put our house in order."
"Allow me to start by congratulating Mr Marinho on his work and to say that, although we need to support efforts to combat financial crime, we also need to be careful."
"The problem of financial crime is extremely complex: first it is a convoluted attempt to launder the proceeds of illegal activity and, secondly, it presupposes a series of other crimes which generated the illegal proceeds in the first place."
"I think that European society today is being crushed by organised crime, in all its manifestations."
"Financial crime, and first and foremost, perhaps, money laundering, is right at the epicentre of the organised crime plaguing Europe."
"Without doubt, the initiative of the French Presidency, on which Mr Marinho has taken a stance, is the right initiative; however, the same holds true of Mr Marinho' s attempt to introduce stricter rules."
"Of course, if we want results, we need to get right to the heart, right to the key of the tool which will help us fight these crimes."
"In my view, the key to fighting these crimes is to improve judicial cooperation."
"As I was reading the explanatory statements attached to Mr Marinho' s amendments, one, in particular, caught my eye. It says that economic Europe has reached a highly advanced stage."
"Political Europe is progressing slowly but, unfortunately, 15 internal borders continue to exist wherever judges and magistrates, legal proceedings and court decisions are concerned."
"This phrase troubled me greatly because I think it is the key to the problem."
"And I think - and I too fervently propose - that we need to take a great many steps, a great many fundamental steps, if we are to achieve judicial cooperation at European level and be able to fight crimes such as financial crime."
"Ladies and gentlemen, judicial and police cooperation is one of the most fundamental issues in the construction of a European area of freedom, security and justice and will enable this area to swiftly become real and effective for the citizens."
"In dealing with these matters, our rapporteurs have centred their considerations both on the Protocol amending the Europol Convention and on improving mutual assistance."
"We can but congratulate them on their work."
"Our primary concern, however, relates to the extension of Europol' s competences."
"We agree that there is an express and urgent need for effective judicial cooperation, but, at the same time, denounce a shift that contains the seeds of a Europol set up outside the control of Parliament or of any legal authority, and, in more general terms, a democratic deficit in a Europe that the Member States insist in confining to the misty realms of intergovernmental procedures, thus skirting the obligations, duties and control that derive from universal suffrage."
"I can see grey areas regarding Europol: the diplomatic immunity of its members, no definition of authorised resources nor of the limits on these, notifications of the filing of personal records, filing of records in areas protected by international texts and declarations of human rights, threats to freedoms given the risk of their being abused, now or in the future, following the kind of political changes liable to be seen in certain Member States."
"Were the European police force to be offered this heaven-sent chance of potential self-regulation, it would do its utmost to curb the European Parliament' s vague desire for democratic control, given the current deficiencies at organisational level and the lack of unity on the background issues."
"The Portuguese initiative concerning the Europol Convention is intended to spur the European Parliament into choosing the right route to ensuring security, with this hingeing around a discretionary filing of records on citizens in all the areas affecting their private lives."
"Of course, we must identify, prosecute and sentence people who launder dirty money on behalf of terrorists, arms dealers and drug traffickers."
"But this will not provide us with firmer guarantees on the right of defence and the protection of citizens' rights."
"It is for this reason that we are tabling amendments on the strengthening of these rights and freedoms, on the need to adopt an instrument, on the right of defence, and on the recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice."
"It has not escaped our notice that one of the articles in the Council Act, which has curiously not been commented on, stipulates that Europol is to specify whether data relating to ethnic origin, religious or other types of beliefs, political leanings, sexual tendencies or health can be included in the data records."
"Are we going to equivocate any longer over Europol' s competences when the very notion of democratic control has been struck off the statute book?"
"The democratic values that everyone in this Chamber shares must be the very ones that govern our deeds and works, in order to forge a European Union based on solidarity and social commitment and not on policing and repression."
"Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Marinho."
"I think that his analysis is extremely accurate and shows us how we really can make headway in combating the laundering of what we call 'black' or 'dirty' money."
"I would remind the House that we aim to use this policy to fight organised crime, i.e. drug smuggling, trafficking in women and children and many other wretched activities which have a terrible impact on society as a whole, even - and I say this somewhat cynically - the economy itself, in that it is generally acknowledged that this money increases the money supply and often destabilises monetary policy."
"The rapporteur is quite right in saying - and I too should like to say - that, having opened our borders, albeit for other reasons, to organised criminals, we must also open our borders to the bodies - i.e. the police and the courts - responsible for pursuing them."
"And, of course, we must do so on the basis of a common definition of what crime is and of what methods it uses, so that it cannot flee from one country to another, at least not for purely procedural reasons."
"The way forward, as Mr Marinho says - and I agree with him - is communitisation."
"Obviously, because that takes us the way of parliamentary and democratic control."
"However, there are still a great many issues outstanding, even if we accept everything that has been said so far."
"There are many serious issues outstanding."
"What I mean is this: there are countries today in the European Union which tolerate or even take advantage of strange situations, offshore companies, strange banking regulations and other such things and they do not inspire me personally with any confidence that what we agree will be implemented."
"Political unification, political control may be what we need to resolve these questions and, by extension, the reviews and harmonisation of the laws governing these issues."
"These are issues which require institutional changes which, unfortunately, not even Nice will make."
"I welcome this debate."
"Illegal sales of narcotics and other criminal activities, such as arms smuggling, are generating billions of euros annually, most of it in cash which has to be laundered."
"Our task is to detect, trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organised crime."
"We are faced with criminals who will use every possible means to avoid detection."
"We are at war with these people."
"Human life is expendable in the business of illegal profits."
"We need to coordinate fully our approach."
"Crime has no frontiers."
"The Proceeds of Crime Act, which my government introduced in Ireland, has been successfully utilised by our Criminal Assets Bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activities from enjoying the fruits of their crime."
"By the end of last year, the Bureau had obtained orders and property to the value of EUR 20 million under the Act and had made tax demands of more than EUR 40 million."
"While cooperation is growing between the EU Member States and our law enforcement agencies, the scale of money laundering and fraud is so vast that we are still only tinkering with the problem."
"One thousand billion dollars is the estimated annual volume of capital recycled by money laundering operations involving financial arrangements."
"These funds could be used in our towns and for other social purposes."
"I welcome this debate and discussion."
"I want to speak about the Karamanou report on Europol."
"Everybody who has spoken agrees that it is a very valuable initiative and we support what it says."
"However, as many speakers have said, there is not enough democratic control and accountability."
"That is the main focus of the cross-party amendments which the Committee is putting forward."
"We want to see parliamentary involvement in the appointments of the director, and by a majority vote because, when we have enlargement to 28 Member States, it will be very difficult to find everybody agreeing on the identity of the director."
"It has to be by a majority vote - we propose two-thirds - and we also want parliamentary involvement in the dismissal of the director, if ever that becomes necessary, by a two-thirds vote as well."
"We want parliamentary involvement in the management board."
"We could enormously improve democratic accountability and control."
"And we want the Court to be involved in disputes."
"These things are in the amendments and, judging by the debate in the committee, I am very hopeful that Parliament will vote for them."
"However, I want to look for just a few moments at the future, and at what comes beyond this proposal."
"I see two signs, one good and one bad."
"The bad development in the future which many colleagues have spoken about - including my friend, Mr Andrews - is the remorseless growth in organised crime which we are seeing across Europe."
"The opening of frontiers for the single market was a thoroughly good idea but it has also helped the Mafia, and criminals from Eastern Europe to spread their tentacles across our Union."
"When we get enlargement, which is the good aspect of the future that I see, we are going to find it more and more difficult to counter organised crime."
"The criminals can move freely across frontiers but our police forces cannot."
"Already today there are about 120 different police forces in the European Union, most of them, I may say, in my own Member State, because in the United Kingdom we have a police force in every single county and they only work up to their county borders."
"We have far too many police forces already and we are going to have even more once we have completed enlargement, our ability to deal with organised crime is going to be very much less than it should be."
"What we need is for Europol to be given operational capability across frontiers."
"At public meetings, when I talk about the growth in organised crime, the response invariably from the public is, ""Well, what are you doing about it?"
"Get on with it."
"Take the necessary powers."
"Organise the police forces so we can deal with the growth in crime."""
"The public is in favour and - as very often happens - is ahead of us and the Council of Ministers."
"I should very much like to hear the Commissioner' s reaction to the idea that when we hopefully get the concept of enhanced cooperation accepted at the Nice Summit next month that we create a European FBI."
"We do not have to call it a European FBI, but that is the logical next step."
"It would have full public support and it is necessary for the future."
"Mr President, I regret that mine will be a somewhat discordant voice in this House tonight, save for that of my colleague, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery."
"It is, of course, the case that this House has set itself a worthy and good objective."
"But good ends do not justify any means whatever."
"It seems to me that this set of initiatives is going forward in a way which risks setting at naught the protection provided by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"I do not see adequate account being taken of the right of defence, as Mrs Boumediene-Thiery said."
"I do not see adequate account of the rights of individuals to a fair trial, to fair presentation of charges before them."
"Without that, I fear we are creating a Frankenstein' s monster, though we, like Count Frankenstein, seek to do good."
"We must ensure that as we move towards mutual recognition of judgments we are establishing in Europe the highest common standard, not the lowest common denominator, when it comes to protecting persons brought into the justice system."
"As a member of this House, I have had cases brought to my attention."
"One example is a person on a money laundering charge, held for 364 days in custody in Portugal without any charge being presented."
"When finally it was presented it was in many pages of Portuguese, with an insufficient English summary translation, even though the person concerned knew no Portuguese."
"I have come across cases in France of lorry drivers, held on suspicion of drug trafficking - a shocking crime if it has been committed, but these persons are held in unacceptable conditions with no effective right to a defence of their own choosing, with inadequate or no interpretation facilities, with no opportunity to prove their innocence by due process of law in a reasonable time."
"While we live in a Europe in which such blots exist on our escutcheons we need to be extremely careful that the steps we are taking for good do not end up destroying civil liberty in some of its most fundamental aspects in Europe."
"Mr Andrews is right: those heavy penalties ought to fall upon those properly convicted, after fair trial, of offences of the kind we are considering."
"We must ensure that those who are the innocent victims - the collateral damage I suppose we should call it - of the war upon crime are not left languishing in jails, incommunicado from their families."
"There is too much of that in our contemporary Europe and before I give my support to a headlong rush to mutual recognition, I would like to see common recognition of fair standards."
"Mr President, I should like, in good faith, to accept that both the initiative of the French Presidency and our rapporteurs' reports are calling for better ways of combating money laundering."
"However, this raises two important questions."
"First, the upshot of the proposals under discussion is that they strengthen judicial and police cooperation with a view to creating a single European area of justice with communitised civil and criminal procedures."
"What I should like to know is if there is a country in Europe or area in the world, such as the USA, which already has a single area of justice and which has effectively combated the problem of money laundering, or are we endeavouring, ostensibly in order to combat a real problem, to communitise crucial institutions which are bound up with the national independence and grass-roots sovereignty of the Member States?"
"Secondly, will strengthening judicial and police cooperation allow us to combat the role of tax havens, of offshore centres and companies and, often, of the Member States themselves which, with their policies on transactions involving government securities, bonds and interest-bearing bills of exchange, help money launderers enormously?"
"Perhaps more honesty is needed and economic and social measures of a different sort if we are to combat this huge problem which is bound up with the very machinery of the economic system in a fully liberalised and unaccountable market economy?"
"Mr President, all EU countries have agreed to combat money laundering, and this unity is, of course, to be applauded unreservedly."
"In reality, however, it is not all as simple as that."
"I think that this Parliament is complicating the problems instead of simplifying matters and making them more efficient, and this may be seen in the proposal to extend Europol' s powers."
"This Assembly should give priority to establishing genuine and effective instruments for combating money laundering and professionally organised crime."
"The reaction to this initiative, taken in Finland, is both unfortunate and instructive."
"It stands to reason that, through cooperation between the countries, crime and money laundering could be better combated."
"Why, then, is the Commission' s new system thought to be needed?"
"In my view, it is not clear in which areas efforts are to be concentrated, except for the fact that countries are to have a uniform method of protecting data imposed upon them."
"Or, to put it another way, the fight against money laundering ought not to be impeded by the Commission having to organise its efforts in accordance with the most indulgent and indifferent Member States."
"Parliament ought not to frustrate the Council of Ministers' initiatives and the initiatives from those countries which are most inclined to stop these crimes."
"Parliament should be encouraging the Council of Ministers and the Member States."
"The trend should be towards establishing uniform definitions of criminal acts, and the countries' police and judicial systems ought to cooperate."
"Mr President, I have asked for these five minutes to speak today on the Roure report on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People' s Party."
"Following Mr MacCormick' s splendid intervention, I should like to make an initial observation."
"Here we have three initiatives aimed at combating organised crime, a major blight on society. They contain a clear political desire to combine efforts, to go further and to develop this area of freedom, security and justice."
"To do this we have to take care that measures do not become dispersed, with the creation of an absolutely lopsided situation in which, as Mr MacCormick has so rightly said, one part of the process suffers. We must be especially careful with this since what is at stake is the distinguishing mark of European identity: the protection of fundamental rights and guarantees of a fair trial."
"As a result of the Tampere agreements, we need the guarantees of a fair trial to be developed in the area of the third pillar, and we need these guarantees to be developed when transnational situations arise, such as the ones he has described."
"This picks up on the theme of Mr Lehne' s intervention."
"Mr Lehne was explaining the problem of a lawyer' s professional secrecy in the context of this fight against money laundering."
"Well, here we have another good example: in combating money laundering we may put at stake something that, far from being a lawyer' s privilege, is an essential element in this right to a fair trial, which in turn is an essential element in all our European development, culture and identity."
"I realise it is very difficult because here we have to construct something from a scattering of instruments."
"We have a directive to combat money laundering; we have a framework decision to combat it; we have an amendment to the Europol Convention."
"At some moment, we will have to compile all these texts because, Mr President, you and, doubtless, all of us here know that for this to be implemented by judges - who are the ones that have to implement it while guaranteeing the right to a fair trial - with this scattered system we are, of course, very poorly guided."
"I shall now focus on another issue, which also concerns the quality of the legislation."
"This report includes a recital on the Geneva appeal, and the Group of the European People' s Party will vote against it, not because we are against the Geneva appeal, but simply because as Parliament we must ensure the quality of legislation."
"The Geneva appeal is not a recital; it is not a legal reference nor a quasi-legal reference to a European Council."
"Finally, on the PPE' s initiative, two amendments to Article 8 have been included, because if we agree on the political will to combat organised crime, we cannot provide a chance for a Member State to refuse this cooperation - we are talking about legal cooperation, between judges - by invoking matters of national interest."
"Where does national interest come in when it is a case of one judge in the European Union asking for the cooperation of another judge in the European Union?"
"What intermediate authority is going to interfere saying that there is national interest involved here?"
"Let us be clear that it is one of two things: either we want to develop this area and not just leave a fine-sounding phrase in the Treaty, or - let us bow to the evidence - we do not want to carry what we have put in the Treaty through to its ultimate consequences and achieve this area of freedom, security and justice."
"Lastly, Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party supports the compromise amendment that we have reached with Mrs Roure on lawyers' activities."
"When lawyers act outside professional advice, outside what is fitting for a lawyer, let justice descend on them as it does on everyone else, because their professional secrecy is not a privilege for them, it is a right deriving from the legal structure and the guarantee of a fair trial."
"Hence we realise that the compromise amendment is certainly redundant, but for the sake of consensus in the House we shall vote in favour."
"Mr President, I should like to conclude by asking the Commission, in the difficult task it has ahead of it, in which it is making an enormous effort, to take into account these initiatives that I am putting forward on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Marinho report deplores the fact that borders have been opened up for criminals but remain closed to the institutions whose duty it is to bring them to justice."
"What can one expect?"
"You wanted a Europe solely geared to throwing open the doors to the free movement of goods and capital."
"Dirty money follows the same channels as any other type of money, even if many of the transactions made by companies of some standing are not as dirty as the capital transactions of the Cali cartel."
"What I am talking about are the proceeds of corruption and the profits reaped from exploiting children in less developed countries."
"You are incapable of taking genuine measures to prevent money laundering because to do so would entail laying the blame at the door of banking and financial groups, since they are the ones who are able to launder this money by cloaking themselves in banking secrecy."
"All the big banks themselves set up subsidiaries in tax havens, and these tax havens only exist because there are banks who use them."
"They do this with encouragement from the Member States themselves, such as France and the Netherlands in the case of Saint-Martin, and Great Britain in the case of the Channel Islands and elsewhere."
"We are the only ones here who want to see measures that truly prevent money laundering, which is to say the immediate abolition of banking secrecy, the trade secret, the business secret, access to the accounting ledgers of all banking and manufacturing companies and the right of all the employees of these companies, of all consumers, to bring to the public' s attention any transfer of funds that is against the interests of society at large."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our objective is, and must be, to extend the economic union into a security union."
"This is a task emanating from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Summit."
"However, it is also necessary if we are to strengthen the attractiveness of the European Union as a location for business; moreover it is something which the public wants and we must respect their wishes because the people who live in the European Union have a right to security."
"Today we are discussing how we can take one step further towards this security union."
"We are discussing this in connection with measures to combat money laundering."
"If money is the driving force behind organised crime, then the measures which we are discussing today to combat money laundering throughout the world are part of our battle against this organised crime."
"If we can stamp out money laundering, then, in so doing, we will, in the end, also stamp out organised crime."
"Organised crime - as has been stated here several times, and as we know - generates huge profits from drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, nuclear proliferation, car smuggling and from many other sectors including, even, the art trade."
"All of this illegally acquired money is, however, laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy."
"That is also the aim of organised crime and in this way organised crime and laundered money damage the legal economy of the European Union."
"The economy is being infiltrated on a huge scale."
"That is why these measures to combat money laundering are so very important."
"We can only tackle the situation as a whole, however, if we have a combination of several instruments to combat money laundering."
"Today we have an opportunity to discuss four such reports and measures in parallel."
"The first is to extend Europol' s remit."
"We know that Europol has competences in various fields, but now money laundering is to be added as an independent area of competence."
"This is a good thing."
"However, we must not forget to provide Europol with sufficient staff and funding so that it is actually able to assume the responsibilities which we are assigning it."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to call - as colleagues have done before me - for a serious anomaly finally to be removed and Europol to be subject to the same supervision as other institutions of the European Union."
"The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation."
"It only makes sense for Europol to have the relevant powers if we also succeed in harmonising the substantive and formal provisions of criminal law, in terms of what constitutes a criminal offence, the severity of the penalty and the confiscation of the proceeds of crime."
"The third point is a fundamental one, namely that it is also important to improve mutual assistance in legal matters."
"Mrs Palacio made clear reference to this point, saying how necessary it was to also involve the relevant occupational groups and to make it clear to the Member States that here European interests need to come before national interests."
"My last point - and I think that this is also relevant - is the establishment of Eurojust or the provisional unit, because this is about improving coordination on investigations and prosecutions."
"The European Union and we, the European Parliament, are seizing a new opportunity in the fight against organised crime, which preoccupies us to such an extent."
"The Union is thus laying a building block in the transition from an economic union to a security union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of the economy and the phenomenon of globalisation have been accompanied in recent years with an increase in international crime."
"According to the United Nations, the annual volume of money recycled through money-laundering operations is approaching USD 1 billion."
"In the European Union, we must continue to fight resolutely against money laundering, in the knowledge that, particularly after the creation of the single market and the liberalisation of the capital and financial services markets, there needs to be effective police and judicial cooperation between Member States which is as efficient as possible."
"Today we are discussing three reports that acknowledge the fact that money laundering lies at the root of organised crime and must therefore be eradicated, wherever it may take place."
"To this end, the Marinho report proposes that a guarantee should be given that specific measures will be adopted to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds from crime, requiring a joint mobilisation of police and judicial resources in order to ensure that criminals or the proceeds from crime can find no hiding place in the European Union."
"I agree with the general thrust of the report, but I harbour some doubts as to the rapporteur' s amendment claiming that this framework decision should also apply to less serious crimes."
"The aim of this framework decision is to combat the major crimes that are at the root of money laundering, not small crimes punishable by a lesser sentence, which, if considered within the scope of this framework decision, could negate its very purpose."
"The Karamanou report seeks to extend Europol' s competences to cover the crime of money laundering by strengthening police cooperation and by providing Europol with more effective instruments."
"This is a Portuguese initiative that has already been commended by a number of previous speakers."
"Finally, the Roure report seeks to remove a large number of judicial obstacles to mutual legal assistance and, at the same time, provides for the adoption of practical measures designed to strengthen this cooperation."
"I would like to see the report' s guideline with regard to the professional confidentiality of lawyers maintained, a guideline that has already received a favourable vote in this Parliament - when the Lehne report on money laundering was adopted."
"We also acknowledge here that professional confidentiality is an essential factor in the administration of justice, since any breach of this law could entail a violation of our citizens' civil liberties."
"Mr President, I must begin by informing the House that I am a lawyer by profession, although my membership of the Portuguese Bar Association has been suspended at my request."
"I shall therefore only speak from this specific view point, because I feel that the amendment to Article 3 in the Roure report that we are discussing entails, in the very way in which the compromise is worded, an unacceptable attack on the professional confidentiality of lawyers."
"Professional confidentiality is the basic premise, the correlative and the consequence of a relationship of trust that is established between lawyers and their clients."
"This applies regardless of whether or not there is a legal obligation, because confidentiality stems from the simple fact that the client is seeking advice from the lawyer or is simply treating them as a confidant."
"Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has recently been adopted, stipulates that everyone has the right to be advised, defended and represented in the law and Article 48 states that respect for the right of the defence of anyone who has been charged shall be guaranteed."
"Seen in this light, professional confidentiality is a lawyer' s inalienable duty."
"Where would we end up if, in this context, lawyers were not bound to maintain this confidentiality or if they were forced to become an informer rather than a legal counsel?"
"Lawyers should not have to bear the responsibility for the inefficiency or the weakness of the authorities charged with investigating crimes of money laundering or any other type of crime."
"With regard to a compromise situation on this issue, there are two options: either the article in question refers to people who concentrate on certain activities and does not need to mention lawyers or any other professional category, or it refers to lawyers, creating a situation which in itself threatens professional confidentiality, however much the article specifies or defines the activities to which it refers."
"There is no reason to assume that, if a lawyer is acting as a financial adviser, he or she is not exercising his or her profession."
"To conclude, Mr President, I shall limit myself to saying that the position of my country' s Bar Association on this issue is quite clear: professional confidentiality is the cornerstone and the fundamental duty of the lawyer."
"Any lawyer accused of carrying out or participating in criminal practices can be prosecuted, like any other citizen, but no lawyer can be forced to state or provide information on facts they have learned in the exercise of their professional activity."
"Lawyers are forbidden to do anything that is not strictly legal."
"The Bar Association has final and binding authority on issues of professional confidentiality and it falls to that body to decide whether or not to authorise - in exceptional cases - the disclosure of information at the request of the courts."
"For all of these reasons, Mr President, I shall vote against the amendment to Article 3, even as a compromise wording for the legislative proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as various speakers have emphasised, we are today looking at three legal instruments dealing with an activity that lies at the very heart of organised crime - money laundering. At the same time, this is the most vulnerable area in such organised crime because money-laundering activity is the point at which it is attempted to filter the proceeds of illegal activities into the lawful economic system."
"This is where Member States, through police and judicial cooperation, can act most effectively to combat organised crime."
"This was the political will expressed by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere European Council, in October 1999, when they called for specific action to fight money laundering."
"This was also the subject of the joint Justice and Internal Affairs/Ecofin Council meeting held on 17 October."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that this meeting took place and supports the French initiative to adopt a Council Framework Decision on money laundering, on the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of the instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime."
"We are convinced that this framework decision will constitute a significant advance in enabling common sanctions to be established for all the countries in the European Union."
"This means that, with this framework decision, we will have two legal instruments establishing, not just common incriminations, but also common sanctions for two types of offences."
"I am referring here to the Framework Decision on the protection of the euro and now the Framework Decision on money laundering as well."
"I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Marinho on his excellent report and to say that I share his concerns that we are moving closer and closer towards a definition of money-laundering offences that must lead to the adoption of common sanctions at European level."
"It is my view that, specifically where Mr Marinho suggests that common offences should be defined for those cases that are punished less severely or for other illegal acts provided for in Article 6 of the European Council Convention on money laundering, we ought not to consider this approach straightaway, but base our concern on an assessment of the specific results that are obtained following the implementation of the joint action that was agreed on in December 1998 and which has not yet shown all that it can do."
"Similarly, I would ask the House to reconsider its position, if possible, with regard to the amendments that have been proposed for the dates that have been stipulated for the adoption of national legislation on the transposal of this framework decision. I repeat, I should like to ask Parliament to revise the date of 31 December 2002, so that the Commission can present an assessment report on the transposal of the framework decision into national law."
"I make this request because the new dates proposed by the rapporteur would mean that 31 December 2002 would be the deadline for the Member States to transpose this framework decision into their own national legislation."
"Lastly, with regard to the issue of reasons for refusing criminal judicial cooperation that are laid down in Article 18 of the 1990 Convention, we agree that they should be revised in order to limit even further the conditions in which Member States can refuse to provide judicial cooperation, as referred to in the report by Mrs Roure, but I shall go into this issue in a few minutes' time. Similarly, I wish to thank Mrs Roure for her report on the French Presidency' s initiative for a Convention on improving mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, specifically in the fight against organised crime."
"I also wish to remind you that this Convention must be linked, by means of close coordination, with the draft Directive that is currently under discussion in the Economy and Finance Council, revising the Directive of 10 June 1991 on money laundering. The Convention must also be linked with the discussion already started by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, with a view to removing the right not to breach tax and banking confidentiality in criminal cases to prevent judicial cooperation in the fight against money laundering."
"For the Commission' s part, and we await Parliament' s opinion on this, we feel that the decisions not to allow tax and banking confidentiality to be invoked if this impedes the prosecution of money-laundering crimes are essential instruments to guaranteeing the success of this legislation at European level."
"With regard to Mrs Roure' s proposal, I would ask her to consider this point: I think it would be more effective to say that any refusal to cooperate in judicial matters by the Member State which has been asked to do so must be communicated to the petitioning State immediately, rather than imposing a deadline of two months."
"As I understand it, 'immediately' makes the requirement more pressing than setting a deadline of two months for a refusal to cooperate."
"By the same token, I wish to say that I am aware of the sensitiveness of the issue raised by various Members about the conditions in which the confidentiality of the legal professions may constitute a justified refusal to cooperate in the fight against money laundering."
"As you know, this issue does not fall within the competence of the Justice and Home Affairs Council but within that of the Economy and Finance Council. I must add that I am still waiting for the European Parliament' s opinion on this matter."
"What I would like to stress here today, from my own point of view, is that this opinion must not only enshrine clear, unambiguous legislation on guarantees to protect defendants and on the conditions in which the confidentiality of the legal professions - and of lawyers in particular- may be legitimately exercised. Above all, what needs to be stressed is the fact that the same definition should apply to all judicial instruments."
"In other words, the definition that has just been adopted by this Parliament in its opinion on the Directive on money laundering should encompass the same judicial solution that has just been adopted here with regard to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. I say this because having different formulas in the two instruments would only lead to greater confusion in their interpretation and difficulties in their practical application."
"Lastly, the Commission is also pleased to note the support Parliament has given to extending Europol' s competences to cover all forms of money laundering."
"The Karamanou report, on which I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur, proposes various amendments with regard to improving the democratic and judicial control of Europol."
"You all know how important I consider the issue of such control to be."
"To be frank, however, I do not think that this initiative is the appropriate occasion to be adopting decisions in this field."
"In fact, the Commission, in the course of the work laid down in the assessment panel for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, known as the 'scoreboard' , is currently studying the best way to adopt a judicial instrument that will facilitate the communitisation of Europol and not just the adoption of piecemeal measures under the Europol Convention."
"The best way of strengthening Parliamentary control of Europol is to fully integrate the Europol Convention into the European Union' s' judicial framework."
"In the same way, I doubt that it is good policy to resort to the mechanism referred to in Article 34(2)(d) of the Treaty for the entry into force of this amendment on the Europol Convention."
"We feel that extending Europol' s competences should be carried out at the same time in all Member States and not in a staggered way, which could lead to greater confusion."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament feels able to support these three initiatives, which, in fact, all have an important role in strengthening an action plan for combating money laundering. We also hope that the Member States will match these initiatives by adopting them rapidly in the Council, but, above all, by ratifying the conventions in question with all speed so that they can enter into force in their respective national legal systems."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit"
"The next item is the report (A5-0317/2000) by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on an initiative of the Portuguese Republic, the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to adopting a Council Decision setting up a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit [10356/2000 - C5-0395/2000 - 2000/0816(CNS)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, part of the price of freedom is that the democratic state under the rule of law frequently chases wrongdoers from quite some distance when it wishes to prosecute them."
"This is especially true of serious, very serious and cross-border crimes."
"Organised crime is particularly difficult to bring under control because the odds are stacked unevenly."
"The perpetrators are ruthless and know nothing of borders, restrictions or rules."
"Their pursuers are, for good reason, bound by the procedures of the rule of law."
"I may paint a gloomy picture, but we do have reason for hope."
"The European Union is making progress in the fight against serious crime."
"It has a good chance of catching up with many wrongdoers and meting out to them the punishments which they deserve."
"The public can demand this; above all it expects it in an increasingly homogeneous area of law and freedom, which also offers them protection and security for their material property."
"A step in the right direction, for which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time now, is the creation of a provisional unit for judicial cooperation."
"In my opinion, the adjective 'provisional' should disappear as soon as possible and make way for Eurojust as an effective European prosecution body."
"The German Justice Minister initiated this; it was at her suggestion that the Tampere Summit decided to establish Eurojust over a year ago."
"Since then, Portugal, France, Sweden and Belgium have driven the project forward with their initiative to establish a provisional unit for judicial cooperation."
"The Tampere mandate is to reinforce, through Eurojust, the Member States' cooperation in the fight against organised crime."
"Prosecutors, magistrates and police officers seconded from the Member States should work in a cross-border capacity to coordinate the national public prosecution services and assist criminal investigations in cases of organised crime."
"The unit is expected to cooperate closely with Europol and the European Judicial Network."
"As rapporteur, I actually only had one additional request."
"Cooperation should not be limited only to organised crime."
"In the interests of the public it must cover the entire spectrum of serious and cross-border crime."
"That is why I have proposed to extend the legal base by adding Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The committee responsible has gone along with me on this and I am pleased to say that the signals coming from the Council are also positive."
"We should be in agreement in one further respect too."
"The provisional unit, which we are now debating, can only be the first step on a road which leads via Eurojust to a genuine European public prosecution service."
"This is not only necessary from an organisational point of view so as to ensure that we are able to tackle serious crime together."
"It is also necessary to uphold the rule of law."
"Overall the task is so great and so important that it cannot be overseen by the Council alone."
"In addition to the Council' s decision in Tampere, we need the expertise and experience of the Commission and the political will of the European Parliament."
"If the Council, the Commission and Parliament act in unison, the end result will be considerable added value in terms of law and security for the people of Europe."
"I believe that the Tampere decision and the initiative of the four Member States constitute a good starting point."
"Let us continue to work together on this basis."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I should like to warmly congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the way in which she has drawn up this report and also to reiterate something she has said: we hope the word 'provisional' can soon be dropped from the name of this Eurojust unit."
"Mr President, if I may link this debate to the previous one, we obviously have here another example of how this area of freedom, security and justice has grown lopsided."
"Area of freedom, but the freedoms, the guarantees for citizens are practically unheard of."
"The area of security is much more developed, with the growth of Europol over the years, to which we have today added the fight against organised crime; but this is the repressive function of the State."
"We have yet to develop the justice aspect - and this is now urgent - for it is the only way of counterbalancing this repressive function of the State with the function of administering justice or, as Mrs Gebhardt has so rightly said, of giving European citizens fundamental judicial security."
"The Gebhardt report places special emphasis on these three points."
"It sets out greater guarantees, that is, it goes towards creating this area of freedoms, as shown by Amendment No 3 or Amendment No 5, which ensure that the personal details of citizens, of the accused, of defendants are protected with the greatest care; and Amendment No 10, which ensures that only where the legislation of a Member State so permits may a police officer form part of this initial unit."
"This is the sense of the guarantees: to push forward this aspect of freedoms."
"But Mrs Gebhardt' s amendments also go towards improving effectiveness: being more effective, more reasonably effective."
"One example is her Amendment No 9, which moves that, in future, this initiative should be taken into account in the final decisions made on the Eurojust unit."
"Lastly, I believe there is an intention that we should be more consistent with this call to create an area of freedom, security and justice."
"This idea comes across quite clearly in the Gebhardt report."
"Thus, there are changes that will seem to many to be simply a matter of appearance, but in which the words betray what lies behind them: instead of contributing within the framework of respect there is an insistence on close collaboration; instead of coordination, there is talk of joint action: the report goes that one step further."
"Mr President, we come back again to the previous debate."
"If we are to develop this area we have to establish or strengthen that mutual trust between the States which allowed us to lay down common rules in the internal market."
"This mutual trust now has to take a further leap, and I realise it is a qualitative leap from the viewpoint of national cultures."
"This mutual trust has to reach this area of justice and go on from there to mutual recognition."
"There cannot be mutual recognition if there is no mutual trust between States on which to found it."
"In the previous debate a moment ago, Commissioner Vitorino highlighted it very well by calling it by its name: reasons of State."
"Countries must not exclude cooperation within the European Union by invoking reasons of State; they will have to treat each other equally."
"Moreover, this is the purpose of extrapolating the principles that have served to construct the internal market: no discrimination on grounds of nationality."
"If, according to the state of which we are nationals we give certain information to a national judge, then clearly if we want to be consistent with the idea of developing this area of freedom, security and justice we must also give it to a judge in the European Union when we are asked for it, because this is the only way we are going to mould this mutual trust between the States in a manner that reaches the citizens."
"Mr President, in conclusion, I believe this is one step, a timid step, which we hope will soon be consolidated in the Eurojust network; we hope it will soon no longer be provisional but will become a permanent network."
"Ladies and gentlemen, although the need for a future European public prosecution service would not seem to pose a problem in the long run, that of harmonising our policies on the protection of citizens' rights and establishing a criminal procedure par excellence would seem to be more than essential."
"Indeed, how can one possibly set up a European public prosecution service when there is not even a European civil code or, what is more, a European criminal code?"
"Even if this circumstance presents no direct obstacle to the initiative on the creation of Eurojust, there is in fact one institution over which the European Parliament exercises no control and over which judicial control by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, pursuant to Article 35 of the Treaty, is not applied."
"How could one possibly consider setting up Eurojust when Europol is already operating as a free agent?"
"Two things must be borne in mind: we cannot contemplate any tangible improvement in judicial cooperation between the Member States without this clearly being conditional on the protection of the rights of the defence in legal proceedings involving more than one State."
"This is the aim of our amendments."
"It follows that citizens' rights must be reinforced by adopting an effective instrument and recognising the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, not least with regard to its right of interpretation and its power to decide on a case or not."
"Moreover, the flaws in the new efforts to combat organised crime can be attributed to the division of competences between Europol and Eurojust, and these have not been clearly addressed in any case or at any point."
"Well, as you know, the issue of competence and the limits on this competence are central to this Community harmonisation aimed at improving the justice system."
"The clear allocation of fields of intervention to either judicial cooperation or police cooperation is not only needed to prevent any conflict of responsibilities, but is also fundamental in terms of guaranteeing observance of the democratic rules that form the bedrock of the rule of law."
"The Member States of the European Community subscribe to these on the basis of their existing legislative, executive and legal systems, in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values."
"Eurojust must therefore slot into the relationship between judicial cooperation and police cooperation."
"The European Parliament is the supranational Community body that can determine this relationship, and I therefore propose that you support its validity by showing support for our rapporteur."
"Mr President, I would like to join my other colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on her work even though I may not give full agreement or support to what has been proposed."
"We in the European Union have been moving more and more towards closer cooperation and coordination, as Mrs Palacio has already stated, in areas such as the single market and environment."
"However, there have been difficulties in the whole area of police and judicial affairs, in particular because of fear or lack of trust with regard to the efficiency or the ability of individual police forces or individual judicial networks to deal with the volume of crime which is now being highlighted at a cross-border level. Therefore, one of the proposals coming forward from the Tampere Summit was the establishment of Eurojust."
"While I have no difficulty whatsoever in allowing our judges and legal experts in Member States to exchange information, to cooperate, to meet and to understand each other' s practices, I have difficulty with the final conclusion of this whole debate which will be the appointment of a European public prosecutor."
"Even though we are assured that a European public prosecutor' s remit will be limited, that does not mean that would be the end of the story, because we have differing legal systems within the European Union."
"For instance, in Ireland and the UK our criminal code is based on the common law system whereas it is the old Roman law or civil law code in most other European countries."
"There are huge differences there which are exemplified on a daily basis in Europol and Interpol where there is a lack of certainty and difficulties between the Member State police forces with regard to what can be done and what can be achieved."
"There are also worries within Member States as I know from an Irish point of view: I have dealt with sixteen cases of people who have been detained in Spain."
"We could not get any action from Europol or from Interpol operators in that country and there was a lack of understanding of the necessity for somebody to be brought to trial as quickly as possible."
"Therefore, whilst I support more cooperation and coordination, I think making this a legislative system would be wrong and we would oppose it."
"Mr President, over this part-session we are going to be called upon to express our opinions on a number of proposals regarding the creation of an area of security and justice."
"I omit the word 'freedom' in consideration of the attitude of the Council and the Member States - I repeat, of the Council and the Member States - in strengthening Europe' s repressive framework, aided and abetted by Parliament which, lacking the due dignity of an institution elected by the citizens, is willing to endorse these proposals."
"In this regard, the Members of the Bonino List do not wish to support the Council' s strategy which continues to be hidden behind proposals which appear to be minimalist but which lay the foundations for a genuine European legal, criminal and procedural system, but a system which is also a police system, a system of European repression: a system built on Eurojust and the European public prosecutor, the European legal network, Europol and the task force of the heads of police, the corpus juris, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the conventions of mutual legal assistance, Enfopol etc., in this infinite bureaucratic web which is in itself antidemocratic."
"Like Mrs Palacio, we hope that the provisional unit for judicial cooperation will soon cease to be provisional, but we Radical Members are not prepared to repeat our experience with Europol, when the establishment of the drugs unit led to the creation of a continually changing and expanding superbody which was out of the democratic control of national and European parliaments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, are you sure that the European citizens, the national parliaments and you yourselves wish to pursue a functionalist strategy in the areas of justice and security, one of the pillars of democracy? Are you not afraid that, when all is said and done, Europe will trample upon the freedoms and rights of the citizens rather than guaranteeing and increasing them?"
"We have tabled a single amendment to this report, calling upon the Council to define more clearly the European area of justice which it intends to develop and, in particular, the level of harmonisation of the rules of criminal and procedural law which it intends to achieve, the institutions and bodies which it intends to create and their powers and responsibilities and the type of cooperation to be established between them, the democratic control to be provided for and, finally, the rights and freedoms which will be guaranteed to citizens."
"Only when the institutional model and the rules governing the European area of justice are clearly defined will it be possible for citizens and Parliament to express their opinions on the individual measures proposed by the Council."
"Unless a course is set towards a specific objective which is clear for all, in our opinion, the Union is destined to go adrift both institutionally and democratically."
"In view of these considerations, we Members of the Emma Bonino List, in the name of European liberal and democratic federalist values, will vote against this proposal and the related report."
"We will also be voting against a number of other proposals and reports over the course of this part-session."
"Mr President, I shall side with the small number of dissidents in warning against the ideas, plans and projects in this stream of reports on legal policy which are up for debate today, including Mrs Gebhardt' s report."
"The explanatory statement is very precise in describing what is happening at the moment, namely that judicial cooperation is being institutionalised or, to put it more accurately, that there is a trend towards supranationalism in this area."
"It is, as the report says very precisely, ""a forerunner of a future European public prosecution service designed to strengthen the European Union' s judicial dimension in relation to criminal law"" , and reference is made to the drafting of EU criminal law with attendant institutions, police service, prosecution service, administration of justice, etc. which, for example, were adopted in connection with Mr Wiebenga' s report in 1999."
"In two areas, however, crucial mistakes are being made, first of all when it comes to the very process of making criminal law into a supranational affair."
"Systems of criminal law are, of course, among the clearest cultural expressions of a society."
"What we have here is a conflict of legal cultures, for there is not just one European criminal law and not just one European ideology relating to crime policy."
"There are fifteen of them. By incorporating - or institutionalising - these projects into the European Union' s various bureaucracies, an élite and non-transparent system arises which is, on many points, in conflict with elementary ideals relating to democracy and legal rights."
"The second point is also interesting, of course."
"A number of very crucial initiatives are undoubtedly being taken towards establishing a United States of Europe."
"Interestingly enough, the heading reads: ""The establishment of Eurojust as a means of upholding the rule of law."""
"What rule of law is being talked about here?"
"Has the EU become a State?"
"Yes, it is on the way to becoming one, for the ambition, as expressed so clearly in the last paragraph of the first part of the explanatory statement, is precisely that the European Union must establish ""independent legislative, executive and judiciary"" bodies ""with counterbalancing powers"" , that is to say the hallmarks of a State."
"For both these reasons, my own group cannot be expected to cooperate."
"Mr President, the world' s largest common legal area is on the way to becoming a reality."
"It must be founded upon common values and have broad political support."
"The proposal to set up an initial provisional Eurojust unit is largely to be welcomed."
"In this way, the Council has taken a first step towards institutionalising the process of judicial cooperation, something which the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats has been demanding for a long time."
"It is essential, if the rule of law is to be upheld, for judicial cooperation in criminal matters to be developed in line with the competences of Europol."
"By strengthening the fight against serious organised crime, Eurojust is therefore a logical step in the efforts to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The provisional unit' s main tasks ought to be that of ensuring better coordination between the national prosecution authorities and that of supporting criminal investigations in cases involving organised crime."
"In view of the proposed unit' s remit, there must be close and clearly regulated cooperation with Europol in order to avoid duplication of effort and conflicts over the respective responsibilities of those involved."
"Setting up the provisional unit is only a first step."
"The rapporteur appreciates that setting up the second stage Eurojust ought to be that much easier in the light of the experience gained, which is a view I share."
"Moving subsequently towards setting up a European public prosecution authority is another question to discuss."
"I see the role of a future European public prosecutor as being precisely and solely that of combating fraud affecting the EU' s financial interests."
"In view of the subsidiarity principle, I am therefore opposed to a common catalogue of criminal law and to the EU as a common judicial body in all criminal law - if anyone should happen to see any such development as being of topical relevance right now."
"What Parliament has to adopt a position on today is vigorous judicial cooperation for the purpose of combating serious organised crime."
"This is a positive development, and it is therefore gratifying that there should be so much support for it in Parliament."
"I am particularly pleased about the initiative to strengthen the protection of personal data."
"I would congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on a good piece of work."
"I want to conclude by pointing out something I think we ought not to forget."
"Without a certain degree of cooperation, it is simply not possible for us to uphold a law-governed society in an EU with freedom of movement."
"If we wish to see crime combated more efficiently, then we must also strengthen the protection of human rights, something which must be founded upon our common legal principles."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gebhardt deserves our congratulations on the excellent report she has presented, dealing with one of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council."
"Her criticism that, considering the development of police cooperation, the issue of judicial cooperation should have been tackled earlier on is fair, particularly bearing in mind the enormous scale that organised and cross-border crime have reached and that this requires rapid, joint, concerted action."
"The creation of Eurojust is part of the European action for fighting organised crime which seeks to strengthen and guarantee the balanced development of police and judicial cooperation in the European Union."
"The proposal that we have before us today, that a provisional unit for judicial cooperation should be established, must therefore be considered to be the first stage in the process of creating Eurojust."
"Its actions will have to improve positive and close cooperation between the competent national authorities for investigating and instituting legal proceedings when two or more Member States are involved and when the case requires joint action. The national legislation of each Member State will be respected throughout."
"The experience gained in running this provisional unit will serve as a basis for the drafting of the decision that will lead to the creation of Eurojust."
"With regard to the increase in Europol' s powers that we all wish to see, Parliament has drawn attention to the need to ensure that democratic control is exercised."
"Eurojust must work, on this point too, with greater jurisdictional control."
"Commissioner Vitorino ended the previous debate by drawing attention to the initiative that is now underway for a measure seeking to communitise EUROPOL: we look forward most keenly to the presentation of this proposal so that we can state our opinion."
"Mr President, I would very quickly like to begin by thanking Mrs Gebhardt for her excellent report and by saying that the Commission endorses almost all of the points that have fuelled her reflections."
"I will take the opportunity - since several Members have raised very delicate issues - to tell you quite frankly that, as Mr Coelho has just said, we primarily view this initiative as an opening initiative that demonstrates the political will of the Council to make up the ground lost in the field of judicial cooperation in comparison to police cooperation."
"I say to you quite candidly that I fail to understand how this initiative for judicial cooperation at the level of Eurojust can be seen as an attack on, or a threat to, the guaranteeing and protection of fundamental rights."
"It has to be said that either we subscribe to the democratic model with which we are familiar, one based on the division of powers, and one which recognises that the courts have supreme authority when it comes to guaranteeing individual rights, and we acknowledge that European judicial cooperation in criminal matters consists precisely of reinforcing coordination between European courts in their capacity of protectors of fundamental rights - and this is the model to which I personally subscribe - or we can choose not to subscribe to this model and, in that case, I fail to understand how one can see this initiative for developing a common judicial area as posing any threat to guarantees on fundamental rights."
"Let us be quite clear about this."
"We are not in the process of harmonising European criminal law with a sledgehammer."
"What the Tampere Summit required us to do was to adopt, with a view to combating cross-border crime, transnational rules in areas where it is recognised that the transnationality, or if you like the supranationality, of legal instruments constitutes added value in terms of combating illegal and criminal acts that are supranational by nature."
"Criminals must be left in no doubt as to this supranationality."
"That is why when we were asked at Tampere for common rules in the field of indictment and penalties for crimes against the environment, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, child pornography, terrorism or Internet crime, it was because it was recognised that these were types of supranational criminal activities which had to be dealt with using supranational instruments."
"However, since with Eurojust we are talking about the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges in order to combat all forms of serious crime - and on this point I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur - this concept is being enlarged: we are no longer talking solely about cooperation on purely transnational crimes, but also about cooperating to counteract criminal activities."
"Such would be the case, for example, with a criminal who commits a crime in one Member State and then seeks refuge in another Member State, as their crime has been a serious one."
"We are therefore entering the realms of the fight against legal insecurity in global terms, but are doing so with respect not only for substantive laws, but also for national procedural laws."
"That implies the actions taken by every judge being in line with their national legal systems and jurisdiction for acting against and combating this type of crime falling within the national legal framework of each Member State."
"It is for this reason that I fail to see in this the advent of a 'Big Brother' -style European judicial system."
"I do not even see in it - unfortunately, I might add - the advent of a European public prosecutor, because as you know, the Commission has proposed creating the office of European public prosecutor, but not in this context or to deal with these matters."
"The Commission' s proposal was highly targeted and was submitted to the appropriate body: the Intergovernmental Conference."
"What was it that the Commission proposed?"
"The creation of the office of European public prosecutor in order to guarantee protection of the European Community' s financial interests."
"In this area we can indeed talk of a European public prosecutor."
"But as concerns Eurojust, this is a network for coordinating the actions of national judges and public prosecutors with the objective of enhancing capabilities for combating types of serious crime at European level."
"And this is why I also see in this an important tool for ensuring judicial control of Europol."
"It was, in fact, made quite clear at Tampere that Eurojust would be Europol' s judicial counterpart."
"That means that investigations and criminal proceedings that can count on the involvement of Europol must be flanked and followed up by Eurojust, acting as a network of judges and public prosecutors at European level."
"It is for this reason that the mutual relationships between Eurojust, Europol and OLAF, in its role as a specialist body for combating fraud, and the existing European judicial network must be clearly defined."
"The Commission welcomes your report, Mrs Gebhardt."
"I hope that Parliament will adopt it."
"We will have the opportunity to make our commitment to this provisional unit from 1 January 2001, but the Commission wants to sustain the debate on the form that the definitive Eurojust unit will take."
"That is why we will be presenting to the Council and European Parliament a proposal for a Communication on the definitive judicial cooperation unit, in order to have as swiftly as possible an outline, a foretaste, of what the definitive version of the Eurojust network will look like."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"FAIR Programme"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0310/2000) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Special Report No 9/99 concerning research activities in the field of agriculture and fisheries (FAIR Programme - Fisheries, Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Research), together with the Commission' s replies [C5-0227/2000 - 2000/2133(COS)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner, in two days' time in this House we will be addressing another weighty matter, the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors on the 1999 budget year, the first budget which covers, at least in part, the term of office of the new Commission."
"While, with this annual report, the new Commission will quite clearly be held accountable and will need to be reminded of its duty, the FAIR Programme is, as it were, unfinished business from a bygone era."
"The FAIR Programme - Fisheries, Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Research - was part of the fourth Framework Programme which ran from 1994 to 1998."
"In that time, a total of EUR 660 million of Community funds was spent on the FAIR Programme, admittedly a small amount when compared with the overall budget of the fourth Framework Programme of over EUR 11.8 billion, but an amount which is, nonetheless, worthy of investigation."
"I mentioned that the FAIR Programme investigated in the Court of Auditors' special report was unfinished business from the past."
"One could argue that there was no need at all for Parliament to deal with these outdated issues any more, because - so people say - the new Commission is of course doing everything better in any case."
"However, I cannot accept such an argument."
"After all, as representatives of the people of Europe, we have a supervisory role which we must exercise so as to remain credible."
"Part of this is, of course, also ex post evaluation, even if, in this case, it has definitely come rather late."
"When I was drawing up my report, I held numerous conversations with both the Court of Auditors and the Commission, and I also brought all the parties together around one table."
"At this - what I would call - mini 'trialogue' there was an open and fair discussion."
"My questions were answered satisfactorily."
"All sides gave their honest opinions - in my view - without falling back on inflexible opposing positions."
"I observed a constructive atmosphere with the transparency and flexibility which is so often called for, and in no sense was it reminiscent of two armoured tortoises facing each other without saying a word."
"I believe that it is certainly possible to speak of a new culture of cooperation which was put into practice here for the first time."
"I would expressly thank the Court of Auditors and the Commission for this."
"The attitude of those being inspected towards their inspectors has taken a turn for the better."
"Inspections are, of course, not carried out for their own sake either, but to achieve an improvement."
"I would say that, at the end of the day, we are, of course, all acting in unison, the inspectors and those being inspected, and why?"
"So as to ensure that European money is better deployed in the future."
"Overall then, this is a balanced and fairly argued report."
"Nevertheless, there are some points which are mentioned which I must criticise."
"However, at the same time, I would express the hope that the Commission will respect its commitments and that it has made the appropriate improvements in the fifth Framework Programme."
"What are my main criticisms?"
"Firstly, the length of the overall inspection procedure."
"As it stands at the moment it is unacceptable."
"I say this quite clearly and you are aware of this."
"It is simply impossible that two full years should go by between the investigation beginning and the report being submitted to Parliament."
"Surely some relevance to the present situation has to be retained."
"This has nothing to do with carrying out the controls themselves, they take time, but it is to do with the contradictory procedure and possibly also with publication."
"There is therefore a need for action to be taken."
"A procedure urgently needs to be identified which will allow the special report to be published within a reasonable period of time."
"My question to the Commission in this regard highlighted some possibilities, but unfortunately no usable result has yet emerged."
"Given the importance of the research programme for agriculture and fisheries, it is regrettable that some problems were identified in connection with the organisation of the programme."
"For example, the descriptions of the selection criteria remain unclear and their application inconsistent, with the result that it was sometimes impossible to understand why projects had been selected for funding."
"In addition, there were mistakes in the certified expenditure and insufficient sanctions, as well as links between experts and some of the organisations involved in the research proposals which, in my view, need to be queried."
"Above all, however, it must be pointed out that the cooperation between the Directorates-General involved - Fisheries, Agriculture and Research - was unsatisfactory and needs to be more efficiently structured in the future."
"I nonetheless assume, not least with a view to my hobbyhorse of fisheries, that we will put pressure on all three of them together so that we can guarantee positive developments in the future."
"Mr President, the Fisheries Committee report was rather brief, in any case."
"The problems that arose in spending were not of too much concern to the Fisheries Committee; other areas were of greater concern."
"The Court of Auditors produced a constructive and reasonable report, but when we had the discussion in committee and teased out the problems and heard the explanations we were a bit more satisfied that the problems that arose were not foreseeable and were correctable."
"I remember that there was a very large number of projects involved."
"The amount of money is not insignificant - EUR 600 million - but, nevertheless, there were around 600 projects involved which spread the money quite thin and made it quite difficult for the limited staff and resources that the Commission had at the time to monitor carefully exactly what was going on."
"Like so many other sections of the budget, something like 80% of the entire spending involved public bodies of one sort or another within the Member States."
"This money was not just being thrown out to industry, although some of it was."
"A lot of this spending was supervised by Member States."
"We welcome the fact that there is a change in the policy under the new programme, moving from giving the money into the care of the policy-making Directorate-General to giving it to people who are engaged in research."
"We can expect a more constructive approach to research when it is done by people interested in research rather than by people who administer the policies, as in the case of agriculture."
"Generally speaking, we thank the rapporteur for drawing attention to the problems involved and look forward to the re-organised programme being more effective and more satisfactory."
"Mr President, I welcome this report by Mrs Langenhagen, the contents of which I am very happy to endorse."
"The Court of Auditors' report on the FAIR Programme, from which the rapporteur' s report arises, was only published in March this year even though the sector letters regarding the audit were first sent to the Commission in December 1998 and February 1999."
"As the rapporteur suggested, this is simply unacceptable."
"It is too long a delay and undermines the relevance of Parliament' s work in considering such reports."
"This delay results from the contradictory procedure between the Court and the Commission which precedes the publication of every Court of Auditors' report, whereby the Commission has the right to have its reply published at the same time as the report."
"As a result of the delay in this case the rapporteur quite rightly questions the continuation of the contradictory procedure in its current form."
"This is something I will certainly be exploring in the report I will be bringing to Parliament in December."
"It is sufficient to suggest that we need to look at the whole procedure again, not just in terms of the Court' s annual report which will be published tomorrow, but also in terms of special reports such as this one."
"The Court of Auditors' report found a number of significant problems with the management of the FAIR Programme during 1994 to 1998, including a lack of quantified objectives for the programme, making it difficult to fully measure the results, insufficient transparency in selection and evaluation procedures and the management of measures under the programme by three DGs."
"This meant that the management of the programme lacked clarity and homogeneity."
"We hope that as a result of the reform of the Commission currently taking place we will see a huge correction of this in future."
"That we do not have clear targets, that we cannot measure output, is really unacceptable and would not happen in any other institution."
"This is very old hat."
"We know the change is coming, but we want to see it very quickly."
"One problem which remains is the EUR 3.4 million still to be recovered, 92% of which is accounted for by three files which have been under examination by the Commission' s legal services since July 1996 and August 1997 and whose due dates have expired."
"It is vital that the Commission follows that and gets its money back."
"We will be following this report' s recommendations in future so we encourage the Commission to put things right as soon as possible, otherwise you will see reference to this and other special reports within discharge procedure reports."
"Mr President, I should very much like to congratulate Mrs Langenhagen on her report."
"I think that, in every way, Mrs Langenhagen has provided a clear description of the very major problems there have been in putting the FAIR Programmes into effect and, at the same time, in also checking up on how the programmes were operating."
"In that connection, I should like to make it clear that, in view of the very great degree of expertise possessed by the Commission, we cannot accept that so many of the things we adopted in the decisions have not been implemented."
"On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I should like to call attention to a fairly small number of points."
"Before new programmes are put into effect, the previous programmes ought to be assessed."
"With the help of the scientific research which is, of course, an important part of our policies - in this case, fisheries policy - a prior assessment needs to be carried out of what is wanted and of how the resources are used, so that existing resources can continually be adapted to catch techniques and catch opportunities."
"Against the background of what has happened, those of us in the Committee on Fisheries also believe that, whenever three Directorates-General are to coordinate and direct actions, it ought to be completely clear which Directorate-General is ultimately in control, with responsibility for putting matters into effect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur very warmly on this report."
"I believe that it is very fair and very restrained and has turned out to be very balanced, and accordingly it did, of course, also receive the unanimous support of the Committee."
"I should just like to touch on a few points which are, in my opinion, decisive for the future work of monitoring research in general."
"In this regard, it seems to me important to listen to what our draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries said, which was that, at the end of the day, it is impossible to carry out a clear inspection in the interests of the taxpayers whom we represent and to monitor efficiency if no clear objectives are defined beforehand."
"This seems to me to be one of the main criticisms made in the Court of Auditors' report."
"Quite simply, this makes it difficult to measure the efficiency of the programme."
"My second point concerns the hierarchy of staff with powers of authorisation. Here, Commissioner, overlaps which are actually unacceptable have occurred."
"In Paragraph 59 in the Court of Auditors' report, this is illustrated relatively clearly."
"If someone who is entitled to authorise payments and who has allocated 98% of the appropriations available in 1996 is made subordinate to the dossier manager, then this leads to an impossible situation."
"The Commission' s official reply to this in the file, that there was another Director-General involved, is extremely lame."
"After all, I do not believe that anyone who has anything to do with financial management and also with financial control would be able to accept an answer of this kind."
"I hope, Commissioner, that where the reform of the Commission is concerned, to which Mrs Morgan has already referred, we will not only attach importance to reforming the Financial Regulation, but also, and above all, to implementing the existing Financial Regulation in full."
"The Financial Regulation is very wisely conceived and it provides for everything to be kept wonderfully separate, but in practice they must not be mixed up, and this seems to have been the case here."
"Commissioner, in the near future - and then also with the work of the new Commission in mind - we will have to deal with further Court of Auditors' reports or audit reports, such as the one on the Joint Research Centre, which has turned out to be very critical, but also the special audit report on a very unusual contract with a consultancy firm."
"I hope that we will then also see a desire to actually make improvements in the areas mentioned by Mrs Langenhagen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the importance that you have attached to the Court of Auditors' special report on the FAIR Programme."
"I would particularly like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her very constructive report, along with the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and of the Committee on Fisheries and notably the rapporteur, Mr Busk."
"You have underscored, and I would thank you for this, the spirit underlying this report, in your dialogue with the Court of Auditors and the Commission' s services and in the value you attached to it."
"As you have also said, the FAIR Programme formed part of the Fourth Framework Programme."
"It had come to an end by the time I took up my duties as Commissioner, but it is the responsibility of the present Commission, and my responsibility as Commissioner, to ensure that the lessons learned from your work are turned to good account and to respond to the Court of Auditors' recommendations on this issue."
"The report will play its part in the appraisal of the way the situation is developing and of working practices."
"I must nevertheless emphasise that no instances of fraud or misappropriation have been detected."
"It is important to point this out, as these things can sometimes be misinterpreted."
"It is important to express ourselves clearly vis-à-vis the outside world."
"As you have emphasised, the FAIR Programme is financed to the tune of 739 million euros."
"It has given rise to over 3 300 proposals, more than 600 of which have received funding."
"The FAIR Programme was also swiftly called into action at the start of the 'mad cow' crisis and a European action plan on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies was launched in the very same year following a call for proposals."
"My point is that it has played a beneficial role in addressing a number of issues."
"What were the questions asked, and what improvements have already been made?"
"I would like to highlight some of the latter, which have already been incorporated into the Fifth Framework Programme, in line with the Court' s recommendations."
"First of all, you should know that responsibility for managing agricultural research has been transferred to the Agriculture DG and the Research DG, following the reorganisation of the Commission' s services, which has resulted in a degree of uniformity in the Agriculture DG' s research procedures."
"The same may not apply to research in the field of fisheries, but it has been the case with agriculture."
"Next, to ensure smooth coordination, a management group has been set up to ensure better coordination between the implementation of research programmes and the relevant Directorates-General with responsibility for other policies."
"Thirdly, the Commission has adopted a common procedure for the evaluation of research proposals applicable to all the specific programmes, which can be consulted by the public in the common manual of evaluation procedures."
"A common, transparent database of experts has been established to evaluate proposals and special efforts have been made to ensure the independence of experts in respect of the evaluation of proposals."
"A common research database has been established."
"The new type of research contract now sets out in detail all the financial and administrative considerations, with more clearly-defined responsibilities for participants and a better-documented negotiation procedure."
"The Commission has also significantly increased the number of audits conducted, with this number rising by 25% annually over recent years."
"These are the measures that have been envisaged under the Fifth Framework Programme and which are to be implemented."
"However, as soon as I took up office, I also took an initiative to set up an informal working party which looked into the issue of simplifying and improving procedures, and I have already had an opportunity to talk about this before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"This shows that the Commission has not been idle and that it is acting on the comments that you have made."
"One has to be aware of the way the situation is developing, and remain vigilant, because it is difficult to attain perfection in this matter."
"This is all the more true given that the report brought to light a number of issues that called for improvements, as you have emphasised."
"I will take up on some of these issues, and let you have our opinion on these."
"With regard to the annual monitoring of research programmes, which provides an independent opinion on the stage reached in, and the quality of, the implementation of our programmes, we have developed several measures aimed at improvement: an analysis of research management practices within the context of national and European Union programmes, with a view to exchanges of good practices and the promotion of mutual learning; the financing of studies aimed at assessing the socio-economic impact of the framework programme and the launching of pilot schemes aimed at evaluating the impact of completed projects, as you have, moreover, just emphasised in speaking of the need to gauge this impact."
"Like the Commission, Parliament is of the opinion that joint responsibility for the implementation of the projects is closely akin to a joint financial responsibility."
"I would nevertheless like to stress one thing, which is that joint financial responsibility cannot, in a strict sense, be envisaged within the context of the framework programme, the aim of which is to set up consortia composed of various bodies, universities, SMEs, large companies, and public or private research institutes."
"These entities will not be able to take adequate financial precautions from among their own ranks, and in the case of the SMEs cannot necessarily be held liable for the insolvency of other members of the consortium."
"It is clear that this consortium approach does not establish a duality in terms of joint financial responsibility."
"This is a complex matter and one of the issues for which we must clearly find a way of ensuring greater security, but we must avoid this resulting in the exclusion from the framework programme of SMEs and public institutions who are fearful of having to accept responsibilities that they are unable to assume."
"We thus need not only to strike the right balance in terms of joint financial responsibility but also, furthermore, to avoid scaring off potential partners in a consortium, the only participants in which will therefore be established bodies, when what we want is to foster the participation of small and medium-sized businesses."
"On the other hand, I share your views entirely on the need to minimise the risk of double financing."
"In this regard, you should know that in connection with point 74 of the White Paper on Reform, the Commission' s services are already in the process of introducing a central register of contracts concluded by the Commission, which will subsequently be linked to all the Commission' s financial information systems."
"You have evidently raised other issues too, including the problem that Mrs Langenhagen referred to in her introduction: the time that has elapsed between the sector letters being sent and the report being debated in Parliament, the length of which can be attributed to the working relations between the Commission and the Court of Auditors."
"As you have emphasised, all this happened several years ago, but it is clear that lessons must be learned from this exercise."
"Since that time, measures have been taken regarding the internal organisation of our services in order to speed up, within the limits of the possible, the Court' s sector letter procedure."
"It is perfectly clear that these dialogues are necessary and there is clearly a joint responsibility here; it is also up to the Court to enter into these dialogues, but I can, in any case, assure you that both the Court and the Commission' s services, along with Parliament, share the same commitment to progress in terms of resolving these problems."
"I will now turn to the question that Mrs Morgan asked concerning the recovery of amounts."
"There are a total of 3.4 million euros outstanding. This may seem a substantial sum, but it in fact only represents 0.3% of total financing under the programme."
"This does not mean, of course, that this sum should not be recovered, and we must strive to do so."
"I can tell you, in this respect, that the Commission' s services have done everything within their power to recover the amounts in question, but the services responsible embarked on the appropriate legal procedures two years ago."
"Legal proceedings have now begun concerning two of the three files examined by the Commission' s legal service, since these have been referred to the national courts."
"The process is therefore under way, but we are now entering the domain of Member State jurisdiction and cannot always dictate how long things will take."
"I would nevertheless stress that the three files that I have just mentioned represent 92% of the total amount."
"We have therefore worked very hard to recover the 3.4 million euros, and one could say that we are over 90% of the way there."
"Turning to the question concerning fisheries, and the person responsible for their control, I have just been given an answer."
"It has been assigned to the most appropriate level."
"As far as the Agriculture DG is concerned, the problem has been resolved by transferring the relevant team to the Directorate-General for Research."
"This has made for a smoother coordination of policies."
"These are the answers to your questions."
"There are still some new applications to put into practice, and I would like to take this opportunity to outline the guidelines on Community research that we would like to develop for the next framework programme, and which the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has already examined, since I sent a policy paper to this Parliamentary Committee on 4 October, and it is to draw up a report."
"There are several factors in these broad guidelines that will make for a considerable lightening of bureaucratic burdens: the switch from a project-based approach to a programme-based approach, the setting of minimum sizes for projects, the externalisation of a number of activities, such as exploratory premiums for small and medium-sized enterprises, mobility grants and, in general terms, a simplification of these procedures."
"Substantial changes must also be introduced into the next framework programme."
"We will see what the impact of the modifications made to the fifth Framework Programme has been and I would like to thank you for showing such commitment to improvement."
"The Commission shares this commitment, and I would like to hope that we can work in the best possible atmosphere to carry through this research programme, which is essential at European level, but which must be implemented in conformity with the most stringent of rules on efficiency and on financial control."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.00 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, this is a small amendment to the Minutes."
"In the modification of the agenda for Thursday the subject of the British submarine in Gibraltar was discussed and there were three speakers."
"The speeches by Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo are faithfully recorded in the Minutes, showing that one requested and the other granted the political agreement from the Group of the Europe People' s Party for it to be included in the agenda for December."
"But there was a third speech, by Mr Galeote Quecedo, which does not feature in the Minutes. Only his name is given."
"Allow me to give an explanation. This omission reflects fears, which in our opinion are unjustified, about anyone objectively reading the motion for a resolution that we are tabling, and this makes us fear that there could be further concealment in December."
"But, this is just an explanation."
"What I am asking for, with all due respect, is for Mr Galeote Quecedo' s speech to feature in the minutes."
"Thank you, Mr Aparicio Sánchez."
"We shall add Mr Galeote Quecedo' s statement to the Minutes."
"Madam President, some of us expected an announcement from the chair yesterday about the Sakharov Prize - to whom it had been awarded, what the voting figures were and when it would be presented in plenary."
"Could you give us some information about that, either today or as soon as possible?"
"Mr Bethell, your point has nothing to do with the approval of the Minutes but I can, however, readily inform you that the Conference of Presidents voted to give this year' s Sakharov Prize to the 'Basta Ya' association."
"The prize will be awarded to the 'Basta Ya' association in the course of the December part-session."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Charter of Fundamental Rights"
"The next item is the recommendation by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (A5-0325/00)."
"Madam President, as a member of the European Parliament from Salzburg, allow me to start by thanking you for your words of acknowledgement and comfort yesterday."
"When the memorial service of what was the worst disaster to befall my country over recent years is held in Salzburg Cathedral on Friday, I know that this Parliament will be among the mourners and I thank you for your words of sympathy and comfort for the relatives."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months' work and a long struggle for consensus, we now have a draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Today is the day we have to say 'yes' or 'no' to this Charter and your rapporteurs recommend that plenary adopt and vote in favour of this Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This recommendation is born of a firm conviction."
"Like many of you, I too regret that we are only allowed to say yes or no and are unable to send the Council any other political message which might have been called for in this context in order to express the critical support of this House for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is but a first step and is still a far cry from what Parliament demanded of this political project in March of this year."
"What we must also remember here is what gives this Charter its value, assuming that it is adopted."
"I think that it grants one initial fundamental right, one unwritten fundamental right and that is people's right to know their rights."
"This fundamental right has now been granted."
"Vague formulations and legal principles have given way to a clear system of fundamental rights which is binding on all the EU institutions and whenever European law is applied by the Member States."
"The value of this Charter is that it has transformed rights vested in international law - vested but not binding, vested but not enforceable, vested but not guaranteed - into legal principles, nay into the constitutional principles of the Union itself, setting up a dynamic process which will surely end one day with a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"What has revolutionised the debate and the history of fundamental and human rights is that, for the first time, social rights have been listed in this Charter on a par with traditional human rights and traditional principles; no Member State has ever done that in its list of fundamental rights."
"This Charter is also the expression of a common set of basic values for all the candidate countries, for all the countries wishing to join the European Union, and it is precisely in the area of social rights that it sends candidate countries a clear message that they must comply with these social standards."
"It marks - and I am firmly convinced of this, even if many Heads of State and Government prefer not to admit it - the beginning of the constitutional process which this Parliament has called for so often and with such persistence."
"I am certain that, with this Charter of Fundamental Rights, we have laid the foundation stone for a future European constitution and constitutional process."
"I think that is reason enough for us to adopt this Charter, even though there are points at which it may be hard to accept that many rights, many basic rights which Parliament demanded for the people of Europe, and with good cause, have been left out of the Charter."
"It is hard to see why the right to a fair wage has been left out and why we came up against insurmountable resistance when it came to the right to a decent minimum standard of living, the right to work and the right to housing."
"This Charter will, I think, need to be supplemented in the future, if it is to become the foundation stone of a European constitution."
"But that should not deter us from taking this first decisive step."
"I hope that, even though it can only say yes to this Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament will clearly apprise the Council of its demand for this Charter to be made legally binding over coming weeks, so that it can open the way to the European Court of Justice for the citizens of Europe."
"I hope that this House will emphasise these demands by a large majority in its resolution on Nice."
"That is all I have to say."
"I should just like, if you will allow, firstly to thank my co-rapporteur for his committed approach and the vast amount of remarkable work which he carried out and secondly, to thank you for your support."
"Madam President, whatever one felt about the mandate from the Cologne European Council, it was fairly surprising that the convention set up to draft the Charter fully succeeded in achieving the mandate."
"We faced an extraordinarily complex task for the inscription of fundamental rights and freedoms found inside the constitutional traditions of Member States and also within the general principles of Union law."
"In my opinion the convention managed to strike a sound balance between self-restraint and aspiration."
"We refrained from superseding the Treaties but maximised their impact by making the relationship between the citizen and the Union for the first time clear and visible."
"Some people will be disappointed that the Charter was unable to go further but it is of course a compromise forged in the crucible of the convention and it represents a balance between competing political tendencies, nationalities and cultures."
"That balance commanded a broad consensus inside the convention and should do so too inside the European Parliament."
"Parliament played a strong part is formulating the Charter."
"We profited from participating strongly in the process and the citizens we represent will profit from its solemn proclamation especially as Article 52.3 says the Union can then proceed to grant more extensive protection of European fundamental rights as European integration proceeds."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to join the European Parliament in expressing the Presidency' s sympathies on the occasion of the accident which occurred near Salzburg in Austria, and say that we fully share in the sorrow of the families of the victims of this most serious accident."
"I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to address the House as part of an in-depth debate on this fine project to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union before Parliament adopts its final position on this text."
"Admittedly, we have already exchanged views on this matter on two occasions, firstly on 3 October, following an oral question from the Chairman of your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Giorgio Napolitano, and then on 24 October, when I came to Parliament to present the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October, where, indeed, the Charter was one of the major items on the agenda."
