"Text"
"It would also mean that society would be less vulnerable to catastrophes and errors as we would no longer be dependent on one source of energy."
"I personally think that the EU must set an ambitious goal."
"At the very least, we must increase the use of renewable energy sources as a proportion of total energy use by at least 30-35 percent before the year 2010."
"I think that the 15 percent level proposed in the report is too cautious."
"If we are to live up to the goals of the Rio conference and create an ecologically sustainable society we must act decisively and vigorously."
"A substantial investment in renewable energy sources is essential for a long term sustainable society."
"This report is a first, but all too small, step towards this."
"We also need a draft treaty in which non-sustainable energy sources such as nuclear power and fossil fuels are replaced with bio-energy and other renewable energy sources."
"Research and development resources must be transferred from nuclear power and fossil fuels to bio energy and other renewable energy sources."
"The EU can contribute to this development by abolishing the Euratom Treaty and introducing a new treaty on renewable energy resources."
"The report hardly mentions the large renewable energy sources in the Scandinavian Countries, for example various forms of bio-energy, the forest, woodchips, pellets, peat and so on. But the report is move in the right direction so I have voted in favour of it."
"Having had to choose one of the reports on energy policy for my contribution, I opted for the Soulier report. But I have to mention, in passing, the importance that I attach to the Rothe report, too, given its global view and the pragmatism of the measures contained in it."
"I should like to pick out: tax breaks for developing these energies, the use of the structural funds, the importance attached to the harmonization of statistics on consumption trends, the internationalization of secondary costs of non-renewable energy sources and the quantification of an objective defined for the year 2000."
"In Finland renewable forms of energy now represent 32.5 % of total energy consumption."
"However, the objective of the report to increase the proportion generally throughout the EU is justified."
"This requires an enormous investment in research, which is something that should be taken account of in the EU's research programmes."
"In the review of regional policy, too, support should be given to the production of renewable energy."
"In spite of its achievements, the report has one shortcoming."
"It fails to refer to peat as a renewable source of energy."
"In Finland, for example, the proportion of peat in energy consumption as a whole is already 5.4 %, though the proportion of peat bogs in production is only 0.5 %."
"Peat bogs grow peat at the same rate annually as forests grow wood."
"After the peat has been lifted the peat bog becomes green again and begins to produce new peat."
"I hope that the Commission will include peat as a renewable natural resource in the White Paper it is to prepare."
"Community energy objectives"
"The next item is the report (A4-0142/97) by Mr Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the organization of cooperation around agreed Community energy objectives (COM(96)0431 - C4-0046/97-96/0218(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, cooperation around agreed Community energy objectives is a controversial subject in this House, in the Council and probably also in the Commission."
"The Commission chose Article 130(3) as the legal basis, i.e., the 'industry' title of the Treaty."
"Since there is not or not yet a chapter on energy in the Treaty, even though energy policy is in the common interest of us all, the legal basis must be the one that relates most closely to the subject concerned."
"In Article 1 the Commission proposal lists as objectives of the decision: protecting the environment, promoting the rational and efficient use of energy resources and new and renewable energy and promoting international energy cooperation."
"The first of these objectives come under the Community's environmental policy."
"That is why the legal basis should be Article 130s."
"It defines rational utilization of natural resources, protection of the environment and the promotion of international measures to protect the environment as the objective of European policy."
"We have called for this amendment of the Treaty basis and had it checked by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"After hesitating, that committee agreed with us."
"Of course energy policy has effects both on industry and on the environment."
"But I think one thing is clear: in the matter of cooperation to achieve agreed energy objectives we also need a cooperation procedure between the legislative institutions."
"In relation to the energy policy objectives we should formulate a policy that anticipates the future."
"In future, however, we will make no progress without an energy chapter in the Treaty."
"I hope the participants in the intergovernmental conference will agree and finally set out definite rules."
"The Commission proposal we are debating today restricts the Commission's role to information and supervisory rights and to a coordinating function."
"It gives it no powers for energy policy actions."
"This makes me suspect that this is the first stage in the abandonment of a common energy policy."
"It all fits together."
"In recent budgetary procedures the Council sought considerable cuts in energy policy sectors."
"THERMIE II has been frozen for years, SAVE II was reduced to one third."
"But to revert to national energy policies is quite simply wrong."
"On the one hand we create transeuropean networks for energy."
"We create an internal market for gas and electricity."
"Yet we cannot agree on a basic energy policy!"
"Why, for instance, as Mrs McNally said earlier during the debate on Mrs Rothe's good report, can we not conclude a separate Treaty to promote renewable energy sources?"
"What was possible 40 years ago to promote nuclear energy should also be possible today for renewable energy!"
"We need to make a leap, we need a leap forward."
"Our words must finally be followed by deeds!"
"In this context let me also point out that I think it is important to take up a proposal made by Rolf Linkohr, calling for a world climate agency to monitor the results of the world climate summit."
"To return to the Commission's proposal, the annex to it contains the agreed energy policy objectives."
"As they stand they are contradictory."
"First it calls for 'undistorted' energy prices and then proposes supportive measures for renewable energy resources."
"Untrammelled competition and market deregulation are not, however, a universal panacea."
"The Commission should show courage and acknowledge openly measures which affect competition between energy sources."
"Only then will it be able to achieve the objective of sustainable development in the framework of integration of energy policy and environmental protection objectives."
"Otherwise it will only be paying it lip service."
"What we need is an integrated energy harmonization programme with a timescale and not least, as I keep pointing out, we must finally agree on an EC-wide energy consumption tax."
"These are just a few of the aspects on which we must cooperate closely for the sake of the future."
"I look forward to the debate, despite the poor attendance today."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has already dealt quite often in the past, as it is doing today in particular, with the question of how the European Union can assume its responsibilities in energy policy in the long term and take the appropriate measures, which are of course urgently necessary to create the framework conditions in a liberalized internal market."
"In that respect, there are no differences of view between the EPP Group and the other groups regarding the basic structure and the line to be followed."
"At the same time we have to consider even at this point what we really want to achieve in terms of a common energy policy and a shopping list like the one the Commission has proposed and which Parliament will probably extend tomorrow does nobody any service."
"Of course our objective is to reduce CO2 emissions in the EU."
"We have all just been discussing that in relation to the Rothe report and also adopted it."
"But the freedom to decide which energy sources will be used to achieve this objective remains with the Member States so long as we have no other legal basis."
"That question also arose this morning and at noon when we voted on the Soulier report."
"We come now to the crucial point."
"It may indeed be possible to change the legal basis - I would not exclude it, but I am an engineer and not a lawyer - and that may also give Parliament more influence because there will be cooperation and we can work with the chosen legal basis."
"But we would achieve nothing at the final count because this is more likely to lead the Council to withdraw the existing legal bases from us again when it notices that other things can be done via the back door instead of us obtaining the new legal bases we want and have just decided on."
"The EPP Group will therefore reject any amendment of the legal basis and the report as a whole if this amendment is adopted by a majority."
"Moreover, we must of course ask ourselves what the Union's priority tasks are in the field of energy."
"We consider it crucial to harmonize the framework conditions, an aspect for which the Commission made no provision at all in its proposal but which the EPP Group proposed in committee and which was fortunately incorporated. That is the crucial point."
"Here the Commission already has competences and Parliament supports this because it can be done through the internal market legislation."
"The last point I want to raise is that we really ought to have a basic debate on this whole question of taxes one day."
"There is no point in Parliament starting to bring in fiscal law questions again. In any case we would then be moving towards another legal basis again, Article 130 would not apply."
"We should leave things where they belong."
"I do not want to go into this further today."
"But we should not put too much strain on the Council here if we really want to achieve anything."
"That is the line the EPP takes; otherwise we will support most of the amendments."
"Mr President, some things are repeated again and again."
"For instance, it is said again here that nuclear energy is safe and that safe final storage sites do exists."
"Whenever we hear such statements, we have to contradict them, and let me say in advance that there are no safe final storage sites."
"I think the rapporteur has managed something very difficult."
"An energy programme that is unsure of itself from the outset, that is very weak from the outset, that tries to ignore very concrete statistics and findings, is incredibly difficult to correct. The rapporteur has tried in all honesty to do so."
"We have long known that we will make much more headway in the medium term with CO2 -free renewable energy technology than with nuclear technology."
"What are you saying?"
"(Interjection: nuclear energy is CO-free!)"
"That is disputable nor is it scientifically tenable as it stands, but we discussed that this morning."
"In the proposal before us now it looks as though nobody had considered what we discussed here this morning and what we voted on a short while ago."
"Of course the question of an energy tax concerns future technological development and it is also significant that the anthropogenic greenhouse effect was excluded."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think that this Council decision is very timely because, if we go down the way that we are going down, I have serious doubts that there can be a common energy policy, perhaps it is very difficult because there are fifteen countries with very different energy systems - and the countries which are going to be incorporated into the Union have different ones again."
"But it is possible to make considerable progress with common objectives and you have very well planned this brief communication which contains the decision."
"Furthermore, I am pleased that the main priority is supply security."
"In both the Green Paper and the White Paper on Energy you spoke first of all of competitiveness, of prices, but I think it is more important to concentrate on supply security, which is beginning to be not so clear, Commissioner."
"Then, of course, we should look at competitiveness, environmental protection, coordination, the possibility of having a presence in other markets."
"However, it seems to me that you tend to insist on having better statistics, that we have the statistics beforehand - Eurostat statistics arrive very late because of the means we have or because countries fail to give information."
"Every year the Commission should carry out a far-reaching examination of the energy policy of three countries, so that in five years we will have an analysis of all fifteen."
"That is what the OECD does and, without a treaty and without more complications, this is extremely efficient. I think that is what is missing in the European Union."
"Reference is made to imposing taxes."
"More than those on petrol."
"Now there is a new communication on tariffs and duties on energy."
"I am sure that they are going to be raised."
"Even electricity is going to have new taxes."
"These taxes are already before Parliament but have come out of the Commission (not from Commissioner Papoutsis or from Commissioner Monti) with an objective which seems to me to be laudable: we must create jobs, which is a major problem for the Union, and we must reduce the burdens on businessmen in terms of energy."
"This is a considerable task and I congratulate you, Commissioner."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this important report."
"We have heard already today how important it is to have a legal base in energy with reference to renewable energies."
"But we have run into difficulties on the THERMIE project and indeed, on SYNERGIE as well because of the lack of a legal base; and because - as has been said here today - we really do not have a common energy policy or even a working energy policy that we are harmonizing."
"I refer you particularly to the importance of the SAVE programme."
"Saving energy is like motherhood: it is always admired but seldom supported."
"If we cannot agree a common energy policy, a common legal base, then we will be doing the same."
"We will be paying lip service to renewables and saving energy but we will not actually be doing anything concrete to support it."
"I would also like to stress the importance of the EURATOM Treaty and a review or replacement of that Treaty as part of a common energy policy."
"Mr President, the proposal we are considering is particularly important because it aims to improve cooperation between the Member States in matters related to energy policy."
"First of all, however, let me thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, for his excellent work on the report we are debating today."
"This proposal is based on the three fundamental aims defined by the White Paper on energy policy, in other words to increase competitiveness, secure reliability of supply, and of course protect the environment."
"The continually increasing dependence on imported energy, climate change, but at the same time world-wide competition, are challenges that we will be called upon to address today and in the future, challenges which make it urgently necessary to adopt a more coordinated energy policy."
"On this opportunity, let me turn your attention to the recent statement by the Commission concerning an overall review of energy policy: that statement points out the serious challenges faced by the European Union in the energy sector and we await the European Parliament's opinion with interest."
"Now, let me comment one by one on the amendments proposed."
"Amendment No 1 concerns the legal basis of the proposal."
"Following the recommendations of the European Commission's Legal Service, the Commission proposes Article 130(3), while Parliament's Legal Committee recommends that Article 130(1) should be used."
"Acceptance of this amendment would mean in practice that cooperation in matters related to energy policy would be subject to environmental policy and to the legal basis on which the latter is founded."
"Of course, I agree completely with the aim of protecting the environment and believe that this aim and environmental protection should be an important aspiration in the energy sector."
"In the Commission's view, however, it is an exaggerated approach to base energy policy entirely on the legal basis provided for environmental protection, because in that way appropriate importance is not attributed to other equally important aims of energy policy, such as the securing of reliable supplies, the increase of competitiveness, and international cooperation."
"For those reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 1."
"I now come to Amendment No 2, which proposes to focus research and technological development on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources."
"It also proposes that research and technological development should be focused on the objective of nuclear energy with safe technologies for the final storage of nuclear waste."
"I do not oppose that amendment, mainly because it does not restrict the provision of credits for research and technological development in those sectors."
"However, exact priorities will be defined during the debates we have on the fifth framework programme."
"Now, as for Amendment No 3, Article 1, I think its first part concerning the additional aim of avoiding surplus capacity is unnecessary."
"I do not object to that amendment, but I do not think it really necessary."
"The second part of Amendment 3 can be accepted in principle."
"However, I would like to point out that there seems to be a small problem with that amendment because it refers in particular to initiatives taken at national level, while the beginning of the Article already covers that point with its reference to actions taken in the Member States."
"However, I agree that it is important to include the promotion of sustainable energy technologies in this list of aims."
"I also unreservedly accept the last part of Amendment 3 under Article 1."
"The rapporteur Mr Stockmann proposes two amendments under Article 2."
"The rapporteur correctly points out in Amendment No 4 the very serious issue of climate change."
"This is a subject which very greatly influences our energy policy, and one to which I too attribute great importance."
"Indeed, I would like to tell Parliament that just yesterday afternoon, the Commission adopted a related statement and the Council on Energy will debate the subject in detail at the end of May."
"I think you will agree with me that decisions concerning this important subject must be taken within a framework broader than that of energy."
"Moreover, the geographical coverage should be broader than the European Union."
"The amendment proposed has far-reaching political and legal consequences since, in fact, it constitutes a decision to found an organization for climate change."
"If that is our purpose, I do not think this is the right way to achieve it."
"The foundation of such a body, which may not be a bad idea, in my opinion merits more careful study and consequently, I am not disposed to accept Amendment No 4, at least at the present stage."
"I can accept Amendment No 12, which concerns the study and imposition of taxation or subsidy systems."
"Indeed, the Commission recently submitted for discussion a new proposed directive for the taxation of all energy products, which is already a step in that direction."
"I can also accept Amendment No 5 concerning the Commission's ability to propose actions or projects for the achievement of these aims."
"Indeed, I think that amendment clarifies the existing text even more."
"Mr President, I now come to Amendment No 6, which concerns Article 3."
"In my opinion, its first part is too restrictive and does not permit the necessary flexibility."
"I could indeed propose a new wording."
"For example, I could certainly propose the compromise wording: ' The Commission will prepare a report whenever this is deemed appropriate, but at least every two years' ."
"The second part gives a picture of the content of that report, and I can of course accept it."
"Those were my comments on the amendments proposed for the Articles."
"I will now go on to the amendments proposed for the Annex."
"With Amendment No 7, the rapporteur proposes a substantial change to the first paragraph of the Annex."
"The Commission's proposal is based on the aim defined by the Green and White Papers, which were ratified both by the European Parliament and by the Council."
"This amendment lists the three basic aims, and the energy-related ones are ranked first among them."
"However, the basic aims constitute an organic whole. For that reason, I cannot accept the specific amendment, though that of course does not mean that protection of the environment is not of fundamental importance and is not a basic aim of the organic whole we have all agreed about."
"Amendments Nos 8 and 9 concern energy prices."
"In Amendment No 8, the rapporteur proposes to delete the words 'and undistorted' and to add a reference to fair competition."
"After this, the rapporteur introduces the internalization of external costs."
"This amendment is acceptable."
"The Commission holds firmly to its position favouring the principle of cost internalization, but I consider it premature to refer, as in Amendment No 9, to a standardized calculation method."
"Granted that the principle of cost internalization is already mentioned in the text of the Commission's proposal, with regret I cannot accept Amendment No 9."
"I agree absolutely with Amendment No 10."
"Concerning Amendment No 11, which relates to the means proposed, I consider that the list provided is not complete, something which is in any case indicated by the wording itself and more specifically the word 'especially' used."
"I am aware that not all the means available to us are listed and that others can be added."
"I see the harmonization of a framework of prerequisites more as a secondary aim that affects competitive markets, but am willing to accept that addition."
"I think the request to propose an energy consumption tax requires a great deal more thought, it needs more preparation, and of course, it will entail many and I am afraid to say difficult internal deliberations."
"As you know, a short while ago the Commission tabled a related proposal."
"However, I think that we should await the Council's reactions, and of course, we also await your reactions - the reactions of the European Parliament - before asking for yet another proposal on energy tax."
"Consequently, this amendment is too specialized and certainly premature."
"I have no problem at all with the third part of Amendment No 11, which concerns the addition of environmental means."
"And I now come to the last part of Amendment No 11 concerning the incorporation into the Treaty of a chapter devoted to energy, in any case something which as you know I warmly support."
"With a chapter on energy we will have at our disposal a clear, transparent and consistent legal basis for the implementation of energy policy."
"A policy which in today's situation is more than necessary."
"For that reason, I am particularly glad that Parliament continues to support the incorporation of a chapter on energy into the Treaty."
"Now, as for Amendments Nos 13 to 17, the Commission cannot accept them, since they go beyond the present scope of the proposal and I am afraid that they disturb its balance."
"Mr President, I think that I have answered in detail all the proposed amendments, and as you see, we can accept some of them, which I believe are the more important ones."
"In the other cases, we have no intense objections about the amendments, but I believe that we should preserve the appropriate balance in our energy policy and aims, at least at the present stage and under the present conditions."
"I thank you very much, and would like once more to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Europe-Asia co-operation strategy for energy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0134/97) by Mr Holm, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on a communication from the Commission: ' Europe-Asia co-operation strategy for energy' (COM(96)0308 - C4-0495/96)."
"Mr President, the background to the Commission's strategy document is that the Council of Ministers has on several occasions stated the EU's intention to strengthen co-operation with the countries and organisations in this region."
"The Council has also urged the Commission to put forward concrete proposals in this sphere."
"Together with my committee, I naturally support this document and see this as a very important initiative."
"We also place great weight on the fact that this dialogue should benefit both EU Member States and Asian states."
"This is why it is also important that the EU produce a basic analysis and strategy."
"Unfortunately there appear to be a number of shortcomings in the Commission's communication which I have been forced to comment upon."
"For example, the communication does not include many concrete initiatives despite the fact that this was what the Council asked for."
"I assume that the Commission will come back to this issue a little later on."
"Furthermore, the Commission must co-ordinate its policy between the various Directorates-General."
"Responsibility is currently split across several which makes it difficult to gain a concise view of EU opportunities and resources."
"The analysis which the Commission has made contains shortcomings in the section covering the current energy situation in the Asian States."
"When drawing up a strategy we need to start from conditions as they are today otherwise it is very difficult to develop a strategy for tomorrow."
"In order to include the Asian point of view the various existing conditions need to be studied."
"Asia is very different from Europe in terms of climate, gross national product, democratic aspects, the level of industrialisation and particularly in terms of the current conditions in the energy sector."
"It is also very difficult to establish a common strategy for the whole region."
"Different solutions are required for different countries."
"Whereas solar energy could be a solution in one region it is less viable in another, where perhaps water power or bio- energy would be more appropriate."
"The Commission's communication instead is almost entirely written from a European point of view, i.e. from the opportunities which we might have on the Asian market."
"Regional aspects in Asia are only touched upon."
"But we must be conscious of the fact that if we are to succeed with a strategy in an area such as this it is important to gain the support of local and regional actors and to ensure that they are involved in the planning process from the start."
"We have chosen to highlight two points in this report. These are environmental issues with the emphasis on well known dam projects in Asia and the sphere of nuclear energy."
"There are currently several large energy programmes underway in Asia which are having an acknowledged negative impact on the environment. These include the building of large dams which are causing significant environmental and social problems."
"The European Parliament has, in several urgent resolutions, adopted a position that these large dams projects including those in India, China and Malaysia risk damaging valuable environments and contributing to the disappearance of the native people's culture and way of life."
"It is therefore extremely important that we adopt a very cautious position on these issues."
"The Commission also acknowledges in its strategy document that these large dam projects have not been very successful and proposes in the document that smaller dam projects should be given priority which is something which we in committee have also pointed out."
"Let me add that there is an amendment proposal, No. 4, which takes up this point and where the Commission is urged among other things to advise firms against investing in the building of the Bakun dam in Malaysia."
"I intend to add an oral amendment proposal during the vote tomorrow when I will remove this last phrase in Bakun, Malaysia, as I believe it is foolish to highlight a particular project in a resolution."
"Instead it is important to point out that it is the large dam projects which we are criticising as there are unfortunately many large dam projects underway in Asia."
"I hope that this assembly can support this even with such an amendment."
"The other point concerned the fact that the EU has started to involve itself in nuclear energy in Asia."
"This concerns the now infamous KEDO project in Korea."
"KEDO, I have been told, should be viewed as a political project to gain an insight into nuclear energy issues in an area which was until recently closed."
"But the Commission has not informed either the European Parliament or the committee responsible of these plans."
"I do not think that I exaggerate when I say that everyone in the committee is critical of the Commission's handling of this matter since even the committee itself has not been informed."
"I would take this opportunity to ask the Commission why there has been so much secrecy surrounding this plan and why Parliament was not informed."
"Personally I am of the opinion that the EU should not participate in this project."
"The project is based on the building of two new nuclear power stations which are to be financed by the EU to the tune of 75 million ECUs."
"As KEDO is concerned with energy development work, it would have been better to have invested in the introduction of renewable energy sources."
"Finally I would like to point out that I am in favour of all the amendment proposals, particularly no 7 which takes up an important section which is missing from this document."
"It is about supporting the development of railways and goods traffic to prevent the use of more and more cars in the region which is also an energy problem in view of the increased carbon dioxide emissions."
"For this reason I also hope that amendment No. 7 is passed."
"Mr President, we are going to vote in favour of this report because, as it was drafted in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, it is perfectly in order."
"We are tabling a good many amendments - fifteen - and most of them were approved in committee and incorporated into the report."
"The result is a sensible document clearly focusing the priority on environmental protection, the security of energy supplies and participation in Asian energy industry markets."
"It includes the peaceful use of nuclear energy in respect of maximum security standards."
"On this score, I should like to take this opportunity to inform the Commission of the need to take management initiatives in order to gauge the level of that security in the southern part of the Asian continent."
"We were also especially satisfied by the approval of our proposal to call on the Commission to bring out a Green Paper on Energy Cooperation in Asia, extending it to the Central Asian countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan, Uzbekhistan, Tazhikhistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia."
"We have just paid an official visit to some of those countries and had an opportunity to examine the importance of this Green Paper on the spot."
"We should not forget that this is a geographical area with considerable energy resources, especially natural gas and petroleum, but that it also needs Western technology and business experience."
"The United States, Japan and other world trading powers have already realised the mutual benefit, for the European Union and Central Asia, that could come from cooperation such as we are proposing."
"We hope that the institutions of the European Union will also realise the need for such cooperation."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Holm on his report."
"The recommendations in Mr Holm's report are indeed very topical."
"With your report and with what I hope will be the Council for Energy's positive attitude on 27 May concerning this statement, the Commission will be in a strong position to implement the first initiative of policy in the sector with countries in Asia."
"To facilitate the implementation of this policy, I am due to meet the Ministers for Energy of the ASEAN states in Manila at the beginning of July, to whom I will explain our priorities."
"On this visit to the ASEAN countries I will be accompanied by representatives of Europe's energy industry."
"This will give us a special opportunity to examine new initiatives concerning professional training, research and the export of energy technologies to that area."
"In the statement which the European Commission issued last year, it proposed the three main aims of this cooperation."
"And I remind you of those aims: first, to improve security of supply in Asia and Europe, secondly, participation in Asian energy markets, and thirdly, protection of the environment on our planet."
"And I am particularly glad that in his report Mr Holm applauds the dialogue on energy policy that the Commission intends to establish with the countries in Asia, a dialogue which we not only seek, but wish to make continual efforts to broaden."
"The European energy market has essentially become saturated, since for the next 15 years its development is expected to fluctuate between approximately 1 % and 2 % per year."
"For energy agencies and European industrial enterprises, greater penetration into Asian markets is very important."
"However, we should not forget that the sector employs more than 2 million people and possesses appreciable surplus capacity in both personnel and production units."
"The Commission will try to make things easier for the private sector in Europe, and at this time we are considering how we could contribute towards a closer approach to the private energy sector in Asia and Europe."
"I cannot, however, agree with criticisms relating to inadequate analysis of the situation in the energy sector in Asian countries."
"The statement you are aware of, does not in itself constitute a document for outlining policy."
"Analyses have been prepared for countries or groups of states, which take account of all the economic and energy indexes."
"The European Commission also uses analyses by international bodies."
"And all these data build a healthy basis for the development of our strategy on cooperation between Europe and Asia."
"I would also like to point out that this strategy mainly concerns both the European Union as a whole, and its Member States."
"Yet, the overall approach takes into account countries that are likely to become members of the European Union in coming years. It also takes account of other neighbouring countries, which will be affected environmentally and in terms of security of supply."
"The report by Mr Holm also mentions that for energy cooperation with Asia to succeed, it must be developed in a mutually beneficial way."
"From a strategic standpoint, both Asia and Europe are increasingly becoming energy importers."
"The establishment of closer dialogue in the area of energy policy should therefore constitute a priority, and at the same time, it will have to be shown in practice to be mutually beneficial."
"One of the main points raised by Mr Holm's report concerns the relation between the various aspects of the energy sector and the environment."
"I believe we are in full agreement with the priority given to the support of rational environmental alternative energy possibilities."
"It is commonly accepted that development of the energy sector in Asia has so far had negative effects on the environment, at national and regional level and for the planet as a whole."
"For example, it is difficult to understand how a huge increase in the use of coal planned for the foreseeable future in those countries can be compatible with the positions adopted at Conferences and in international agreements concerning climate change."
"Unless serious efforts are made, the increase of carbon dioxide, acid rain and pollution by suspended particles threatens to eliminate or put at serious risk efforts to restrict pollutant emissions on our planet."
"In parallel, large-scale deforestation exacerbates pressures on the environment of certain countries."
"That aspect often reflects to the cost of the poorer population levels, especially children and women who are forced to traverse large distances in order to cover their basic energy needs."
"We also agree that increased use of new and renewable energy sources for the production of energy in agricultural regions must be a priority."
"The Community will continue encouraging the development of small hydroelectric stations within the scope of rural development projects."
"Besides, other priorities for cooperation in the energy sector are the modernization of electrical power supply, the promotion of natural gas, and of course, the improvement of energy efficiency."
"We will also back international activity to ensure nuclear safety."
"And as for nuclear energy, concerning the reservations and fears that exist about the way that technology is moving, I should like to say that the European Union gives it backing to all international efforts to ensure the greatest possible safety in the peaceful use of nuclear energy."
"The Commission's position in this respect is firm, and our actions in the sector always strive towards the same objectives, in other words to ensure first the spread of peaceful uses for nuclear energy, and secondly substantial and great stringency in relation to restrictions and conditions for nuclear safety."
"Now, as for the particular question raised by Mr Holm concerning the Korean Energy Development Organization (KEDO), I would like to remind you that the European Parliament has already adopted a positive position on participation by EURATOM in that, granted that the related budgetary items for 1996 and 1997 have been approved."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would like once more to thank the rapporteur and the speakers who addressed us today and on the Committee on Energy, during the debate on the substance of the issue, for their comments, ones which we will take seriously into account when developing our policy."
"I would also like to assure you that we will continue to cooperate with you and keep you informed, so that we may continue our joint action for the achievement of our aims."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Social legislation on road transport"
"The next item is the report (A4-0106/97) by Mr Schlechter, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the report from the Commission on the implementation in 1991-1992 of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 on the harmonization of certain social legislation relating to road transport (17th report by the Commission on the implementation of the social legislation relating to road transport) (COM(95)0713 - C4-0065/96)."
"Mr President, this report appears to be quite technical but, in essence, it can be summed up in three words: safety, safety and safety."
"I need to stress the importance of resolving the issue of working time in excluded sectors like road transport."
"In other transport sectors, agreements between the social partners at European level on working time have largely been reached."
"Indeed, in the road transport sector, agreement has been reached for the inclusion of all non-mobile workers."
"So far, however, the employers' organizations have consistently refused to discuss the inclusion of drivers."
"This situation has now persisted for over five years and, despite Commission promises for action on the excluded sectors, we actually have nothing."
"Regulations on driving time and rest periods are important, because of the number of serious coach and lorry accidents caused by driver fatigue."
"If these regulations are properly implemented they could also prevent distortion of the rules of competition between the various modes of transport."
"I hope that this report will not only be approved but that the Commission will act on its contents."
"As I have tried to stress, the overriding issue is safety, and not only the safety of the drivers of the lorries and coaches but of the people carried in those coaches and of all other road users."
"I urge the Commission to listen and to implement everything in this report."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party I must first congratulate Mr Schlechter on his report and say that we will vote for it, even though we are not in full agreement with some of the resolution's orders."
"I should say that there is a regulation dating from 1985, Regulation No 3820."
"To show you how the Community has addressed the issue essentially of safety on Europe's roads, and as the last speaker also commented, the Commission is now, in 1997, submitting for the first time a report on the implementation of that regulation only for the years 1991-1992."
"The subject of working and rest hours for drivers of lorries, buses, and coaches, which are nowadays inundating Europe, does not seem to have been taken seriously."
"We are now talking of the loss of 50, 000 people per year in Europe."
"As all of us here know, 50, 000 people are killed in road accidents, and a significant cause of those accidents is that the drivers of lorries and buses have to work exhaustingly long shifts, to bring down transport costs."
"I say all this because in that respect as well there is unfair competition in road transport, to the cost of rail transport and transport by sea."
"It is unacceptable that the Community has still not intervened and the Council of Ministers has done nothing about specifying working hours for drivers."
"It is time to realise that there are countries like Germany and France, which are at the centre of Europe and are full of lorries."
"The lorries have to serve large ports such as Rotterdam or Antwerp in small countries, but then have to cover hundreds of kilometers to get to the Community's large, central countries, and we have not yet reacted to that situation."
"I say all this because both the time devoted to debating this report, and the time when we are to vote on it, namely tomorrow, Friday, when only 150 members will be here, indicate the level of interest we attribute to it."
"We have not grasped the size of the problem."
"But there must come a time when we think what to do with the dead, whose numbers far exceed the casualties of the battles we see on television every evening."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's report, although the reasons behind it are highly topical, as we are all aware comes before this House rather late in the day - when I say 'rather late' I am talking about five or six years - and is therefore at some risk of obsolescence, in its efficacy as well as in its reference data."
"The premises are still valid, in that the safety of those working on the roads relies on the existence of and compliance with clear social legislation; it is to be regretted, however, that the problem is considered virtually exclusively in terms of one of its most obvious manifestations, such as observance of driving times, without taking account of a huge range of other risk factors which are ever-present in all the collateral forms of this activity."
"The problem is widespread, most of all because of the size of the workforce - some 3 million people throughout Europe."
"To arrive at a social as well as economic dimension, this workforce should be multiplied by three or four to give a global framework for the sector."
"Hence the need to consider carefully the measures to be taken in the event of violations, in the hope that these can be harmonized as quickly as possible and, in particular, that this harmonization will bring a similar harmonization of penalties."
"Furthermore, swift and realistic action needs to be taken to check the tendency to make the carriers bear the full weight of new social and political trends - apart from the sacrosanct safety regulations for the employees and for other road users, the carriers are now being expected to bear the environmental cost, together with the external costs that are being internalized."
"The danger is overburdening the carriers with economic charges which would result in the destruction of smaller businesses - a phenomenon that already and clearly exists throughout Europe - with an immediate knock-on effect on employment levels, especially since the danger of social dumping by countries with lower labour costs, lower overheads and more relaxed safety standards, is becoming more and more real as the taxes for the adhesion of the CEECs are finalized."
"Finally, there is the intermodal aspect: we are all agreed that there is an urgent need to switch from road to rail - but where are the rails?"
"From the Brenner to Fréjus there are plenty of good intentions, but there is a serious financial crisis which means that such projects are still a long way from fruition."
"Mr President, may I first of all congratulate the former minister of transport, Mr Schlechter, on his excellent report."
"But, Mr President, I must say that in fact I am terribly disappointed in the Commission."
"I think that what is happening here mars the Commission's image."
"Here we are in 1997, as Mr Sarlis has already said, getting figures from 1991 and 1992."
"We were originally promised that the 1993 and 1994 figures could be taken at the same time."
"But halfway through 1997 they are still not available."
"We were told that we would meet the Commissioner of Social Affairs on the maintenance of driving and rest times."
"Then we were told that no, it was not necessary because Commissioner Kinnock is responsible for that."
"And what do we have here? Here we have the commissioner responsible for the self-employed, Mr Papoutsis, and Mr Kinnock again is not present to defend himself against the criticism which, Mr President, is far from gentle."
"Now what has the Commission done?"
"New proposals have been tabled in the meantime on monitoring, whereas certain countries, including yours, Mr President, and Mr Santini's, have not implemented the present regulation."
"They are not doing anything."
"They are not producing any figures."
"They are not producing anything."
"Everyone is just saying: oh well, let us just come up with new proposals and then we will move one step farther instead of implementing what we now have."
"The Commission promised us new proposals on driving and rest times."
"The Commission has done nothing."
"The Commission would be well advised to go home."
"Mr President, we are far from the harmonised implementation of the driving and rest times prescribed in regulation 3820/85."
"That is the clear message from the Commission report on the period 199192."
"If I correctly understand the figures in this report, one out of six vehicles checked did not satisfy the regulations."
"This confirms the conclusions reached by the group of experts who reported in 1994 that failure to respect the regulations was one of the major problems facing road transport."
"The report also indicates that there serious differences between Member States in the frequency and implementation of checks and in penalties imposed."
"All this not merely distorts competition between Member States but is particularly dangerous to road safety."
"It is quite scandalous that in May 1997 we must discuss the situation of five to six years ago, apparently because some Member States are negligent or incomplete in their reporting and refuse to take the problems of neglect seriously."
"Mr President, I wish to ask the Commissioner if he can confirm Mr Wijsenbeek's question that the statistics on 1993 and 1994, which ought to have been available by 30 September 1995 under the regulation, are still not to hand."
"Mr President, on behalf of everyone concerned about the unacceptably high level of coach and lorry accidents throughout Europe, I welcome the report by the Commission and, indeed, the work of the rapporteur."
"However, all of this must be looked at in the context of a recent publication by the Commission into its action for road safety proposals."
"Obviously there is some inconsistency here: the Commission quite rightly is planning to tackle the appalling toll of road accidents across our continent - 50, 000 lives are lost each year - and yet at the same time the powers we already have to prevent accidents involving coaches, lorries and buses are clearly not being enforced throughout the European Union."
"We are also concerned about the fact that this is a rapidly expanding sector so we are likely to see the number of people killed and injured on our roads increase year upon year because the basic rules are being ignored and not being enforced."
"We learn from the Commission document of poor compliance and in some cases the total lack of compliance by Member States, the widespread flouting of legislation which is the cause, as we all know, of all too many accidents."
"There is no such thing as fair competition in the single market, while Member States refuse to comply properly with our rules and regulations."
"The industry is a big one."
"As mentioned earlier, three million people work in the industry."
"It is vital to the competitiveness of Europe as a whole that this industry should be a success."
"Therefore, we welcome the Commission proposals: doubling the checks, coordinating the calculations, improving driver training and modernizing the tachograph."
"But we need to see more safeguards for drivers and working time."
"I hope the Commissioner can today comment on how many prosecutions there have been so far of Member States which are refusing to comply with these rules and regulation and how many are planned."
"Until we take Member States to court, they will continue to ignore our rules."
"Mr President, I too believe that the social provisions in question relate first and foremost to driving times and rest periods, and if we remember the two figures that were just cited, three million drivers and about 50 000 lives lost, we realise that this is not a minor report that could perhaps be briefly discussed on a Friday morning but a report that needs to be considered by the Committee on Transport, the Committee on Social Affairs and by all the MEPS and people who really are seriously concerned about safety on the roads of Europe and elsewhere."
"We also know that this regulation is more than necessary given the pressure of competition and also of the trend towards 'just-in-time' deliveries and that if it is not respected, competition will be pursued at the cost of safety and of elementary working conditions."
"If Parliament is now evaluating the situation, I would simply summarize it under three headings which, in my view, are also the cornerstones of efficient implementation: uniform application, uniform checks, uniform fines."
"If we deviate from these principles at all, then we will continue to have competition at the cost of safety, even at the cost of deaths in Europe."
"In my view these are important points, which can also be supported by technological development."
"I believe that we must call for the rapid introduction of inviolable electronic chronotachographs and Parliament would welcome initiatives of this kind."
"Of course we also regret the late consideration of this report, although we know that the statistics it quotes have worsened rather than improved in the meantime."
"We congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and hope the Commission will pay it the attention it deserves."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Schlechter on his report."
"The report very rightly points out that the statistics provided by the Member States are still incomplete and have not been submitted in a form which enables comparison."
"It is also a sad fact that the Commission's reports have been delayed because figures were submitted late and in some cases not at all."
"The Commission therefore decided to go ahead and publish the report for 1993-1994 without waiting any longer."
"I would also like to point out that in Mr Schlechter's report it was possible to draw conclusions on the various levels of checks carried out in the Member States concerning differences in the sanctions imposed, and also concerning their impact on competition."
"The increased importance of the road transport branch within the Union, which was indeed enhanced by the internal market but also by changes in the general practice of labour relations, stresses - and I think this is clear - the need to achieve balance in freedom of movement."
"It also underlines the need to increase competition by means of social safeguards."
"Hence, the regulation on the restriction of driving times."
"Mr Schlechter very rightly points out that the branch involves a large number of working people, whose working conditions depend on the rational implementation of the regulation's orders."
"For that reason, we will examine the conclusion expressed in the report, in depth."
"I refer more specifically to the need to increase the minimum level of checks to 2 %, granted that most Member States have already achieved the present level of 1 %."
"The recommendation to create a framework allowing better coordination of the activity of the authority responsible for implementing this regulation, will also be examined."
"The report also recommends that other aspects of drivers' work should be included in the field covered by the existing regulation."
"However, as my colleague Mr Kinnock told the Committee on Transport in March, he has already asked the Commission's services to examine ways of extending Regulation 3820/85, to include in its field of application other activities that are also relevant to the safety of the public."
"That possibility will be examined in even greater detail during the consultations on the forthcoming White Paper on working hours, which is being prepared by my colleague Mr Flynn."
"It will also form part of the continuing dialogue between the Commission and the Member States to clarify the different interpretations placed by the Member States on the meaning of working time in that branch."
"The report also recommends further review of Regulation 3820/85 with the aim of reducing upper limits for driving time, and supports the need to investigate alternative control and sanction measures."
"The idea of replacing fines by introducing the practice of immobilizing the vehicle was in fact proposed by the European Commission's Committee on the Monitoring of Road Transport. It was also given due attention within the scope of the procedure for reviewing the regulation."
"But that review will relate to all aspects of the regulation."
"I am particularly pleased that in its last paragraph, the report recommends the rapid introduction of fully electronic tachographs."
"The Commission considers that this is a basic method to improve the uniform implementation of the regulation, and that it will also make it more easy for the responsible authorities in each Member State to carry out a larger number of checks."
"Granted the restrictions that nowadays characterize the budgets of the Member States, we consider that this innovation is essential to maintain and improve the appropriate checks in coming years."
"Finally, Mr President, I would once more like to thank Parliament for this report and assure you that my colleague Mr Kinnock and the Commission as a whole will take serious note of your views and comments."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I was almost sure that Mr Wijsenbeek had asked for the floor, but I am also almost sure that it was not for a point of order!"
"No, Mr President, I put a number of specific questions to the Commission and have not received any reply to them."
"I asked the Commission: when are we going to get the 1993-1994 figures?"
"I asked: when are we going to get the proposals on the amendment to driving and rest times?"
"And what does the Commissioner say to us: words, words, words."
"We are keeping a careful watch, we shall have to do something."
"When oh when are we going..."
"(The speaker is interrupted by the President)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.02 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, on reviewing the Minutes I note that under Item 7 'Defence-related industries' it is stated under Amendment No 1 that Mr Provan, Mr Spencer and Mr Cassidy voted in favour of integrating the WEU into the European Union."
"I would like confirmation that this was accurate or has Conservative policy on that changed?"
"I invited Members to comment on the Minutes, not to conduct a debate."
"Mr President, I should like to say a word about a question raised by Mr Provan on Wednesday at the beginning of the sitting."
"It concerns the dates of our next mission to Israel; Mr Provan seemed to be worrying about a slight modification which had been made."
"I can assure you, Mr Provan, that there is no cause for concern, since the only change is that the mission is to begin twenty hours later."
"I hardly think a delay of twenty hours warrants a question to the House."
"In fact we still have the same date."
"The programme has not changed. It has been negotiated with our Israeli partners."
"The point is, Mr Provan that the date of 1 June coincides with the organization of elections in France, which was not known when the programme was settled."
"I suppose you have not, for your part, chosen the date of 1 May for a mission and been absent..."
"(General commotion)"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, yesterday we welcomed a number of unemployed people into the Parliament who were walking from Switzerland to Amsterdam."
"Next week we have a very prestigious meeting in Brussels where we anticipate between 800 and 1, 000 unemployed people attending our Parliament in Brussels."
"They will have at their disposal two interpreters in one room for 15 languages."
"Can I appeal to the President that especially since..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Morris, this problem has already been discussed by the Bureau, on the basis of an official request submitted by a number of Members, and there has already been an official reply from the Bureau."
"Mr President, yesterday morning at the beginning of business - I was not here at the time - Mr Titley made reference to me and criticized me for my statement on the Titley report."
"I would just like to point out that Mr Titley himself has a lot of questions to answer."
"For example, last year he went to the Farnborough air show in the UK, paid for by British Aerospace."
"British Aerospace is responsible for arming the Indonesians..."
"(The President cut the speaker off )"
"Mrs McKenna, I must ask Members to be calm and patient."
"The debate on the Titley report has already taken place, and so has the vote."
"Mr President, I have the feeling that I am the first with a genuine point to raise on yesterday's Minutes."
"In connection with the topical and urgent debate on Turkey, yesterday's Minutes state that McMillan-Scott, Habsburg-Lothringen and Lenz withdrew their signatures from the amendments on behalf of the PPE Group."
"I am anxious to point out that I never signed those amendments."
"I had nothing to do with the motion."
"I did not sign it."
"I signed another motion, and my signature must somehow have found its way onto this motion."
"I consider it important to have that recorded in the Minutes."
"You are the first speaker to confine your remarks to the Minutes, and I am most grateful."
"Mr President, we hear that Spanish lorry drivers, particularly those delivering vegetables, are still being attacked in the south of France."
"We must again condemn these acts and ask the Presidency and the House to insist that the French authorities take appropriate measures to ensure freedom of movement..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Thank you, Mr Camisón Asensio, but once again that has nothing to do with the Minutes."
"Mr President, I would just like to thank Mr Caudron for his clarification of the situation because it was difficult for members of the Israeli delegation to find out what was actually happening."
"The dates have been confirmed since I raised the matter in the House this week."
"I am delighted that the situation is now settled."
"It is unfortunate, perhaps, that in certain circumstances the president of a delegation has to change the dates of the delegation to suit himself rather than the delegation as a whole, when there are vice-presidents and the Bureau who could have stood in for the 24 hours that was necessary."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes.)"
"Votes"
"Mr President, I am sorry to interrupt the debate, but twice now the voting has been changed by just one vote."
"My button is clearly not working."
"Twice I voted in favour and twice it registered against."
"Mr Castagnède, these were not roll-call votes but electronic votes."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"As I stated in the debate yesterday I would like to make an oral amendment proposal by removing the end of amendment proposal no. 4, that is the words Bakun, Malaysia, so that we do not pinpoint one particular project."
"Instead this should apply to all large hydroelectric power projects."
"The text now reads '... from investing in large hydroelectric power projects' ."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"The Danish social democrats have voted in favour of the report by Mr Stockmann."
"We are sympathetic towards energy policy cooperation, and we are also very pleased with the environmental approach which Mr Stockmann takes in his report."
"We wish to make it clear that nuclear power is not a sustainable energy source, and that nuclear energy does not form part of the Community's policy."
"The Danish social democrats are in favour of the EU playing an active role with a view to reducing pollution."
"The EU should also be actively involved in environment and energy policy issues."
"However, it should not concern itself with fiscal policy."
"That is and should remain a national matter."
"The International Energy Agency and other international organizations are currently carrying out a number of valuable studies of their member countries' energy policy."
"It is important that the Commission is not given or does not take on any tasks which are already being performed by others."
"It is also important that the Commission - should it have to be given new areas of work - does not embark on extensive inquiries which create bureaucracy for national authorities."
"Schlechter report (A4-106/97)"
"I welcome my colleague Schlechter's report calling for new legislation to reduce the maximum limits on driving time."
"Despite legislation covering road transport used for both commercial and private use, Europe still has a frighteningly high rate of road mortality - resulting in horrendous suffering for the victims and families of those involved."
"The disturbing number of serious coach and lorry accidents and the ensuing loss of life, are all too often caused by human error, which is frequently the consequence of extreme tiredness and unhealthy working conditions."
"Data from across Europe have demonstrated the obvious link between road safety and compliance with legislation concerning driving times and rest periods for commercial drivers."
"I would like to offer my full support for the conclusions of this report which call on the Commission to work towards:"
"reducing the maximum limits of driving time-creating uniform competitive standards for drivers across the Member Statesand, most importantly, making Europe's roads safer for us all."
"Provision of information for technical standards and regulations"
"The next item is the report (A4-0147/97) by Mr Hendrick, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending for the third time Directive 83/189/EEC laying down the procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (COM(96)0392 - C4-0466/96-96/0220(COD))."
"Mr President, the development of the information society services promises profound changes socially, culturally and economically in Europe."
"Distance ceases to be a factor."
"A new economic sector comes into being and there is a powerful driving force to handle the development of information networks and technologies within the European Union."
"The frontier-free area of the internal market is critical to the success of these services."
"It is essential that this be safeguarded and developed with a mechanism which will coordinate future action by Member States in regulated information society services."
"Society is now reaching the point where opportunities are available for consumers to obtain goods and services electronically."
"These opportunities for cross-border trade must be realized to draw out the benefits of stronger productivity, growth and competitiveness which are the driving forces behind the creation of jobs in Europe."
"At the same time we must ensure that new forms of social exclusion are not encouraged by the increased importance of new information and communication technologies."
"The regulatory environment is an important factor in that sense and innovation and technological progress are priorities in this sector."
"They must be allowed to develop under a flexible and consistent regulatory framework."
"The introduction of contradictory or inconsistent regulations by Member States presents very real problems and a danger that competitors in Europe will possibly damage the internal market by restricting the free movement of goods and services."
"Mr President, our opinion is favourable because extending the rules of the product society to cover the information society, as proposed by the directive, is indeed important."
"Of course, we cannot stop there."
"That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs calls upon the Commission to consider the advisability of extending the rules, and hence also extending the procedure whereby the Member States inform and notify the European Union - the co-operation procedure - with a view to eliminating any obstacles to the freedom of the internal market, in a field as difficult as information technology and the advent of a whole new society, like the Internet, with the primary objective of safeguarding the central importance of the human individual."
"That is why, in our view, there are a number of particularly significant recitals: precisely because of the pressure to extend not only the administrative rules but the technical rules, too, in other words all the standardization produced so far, to include bodies which, though in the private sector, have a strong impact on the market."
"Another aspect which the Legal Affairs Committee wanted to bring out was the matter of access - freedom of access, and non-discrimination with regard to access by the consumer."
"One of the features of this proposal is that it relates not only to services provided electronically and at a distance but also to consumer interactivity."
"This is a service provided on demand, and the most innovative feature of this proposal is that, for the first time, it takes into account direct participation by the consumer - the subscriber, the citizen. Hence, it is very important that there should be real freedom of access and, at the same time, the possibility of controls."
"One final, brief comment: an important point was introduced as a new amendment and proposed once again in this House relating to the case law of the Court of Justice, an essential guide in this sector to the interpretation of certain rules relating to services."
"We know that Community law is strongly rooted in precedent, and I therefore feel it is important for this amendment to be adopted."
"Mr President, procedures for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations have an enormous impact on the competitiveness of European industry."
"Now that we have decided to develop common strategies in the domains covered by the trans-European networks, namely energy, transport and telecommunications, the aim of which is to promote prosperity and job security in Europe, I believe that this regulatory mechanism will give us a distinct advantage in international competition."
"The consequences are not only social and cultural; they also directly affect economic activity."
"This technology itself can create entirely new jobs."
"We need only consider the example of electronically controlled online shopping, which enables the customer to order goods and services personally at a distance."
"In other words, the customer obtains direct access to a wide range of providers and can avail himself of their services."
"That is why it is important that we in the countries of Europe should seek to make all our developments in this domain as transparent as possible, so that we can ensure that the advantages offered by one country will be of benefit to others."
"It is also a matter of enumerating the precise areas in the domains of hardware, software and 'manware' in which we are making progress, in other words where training and technical harmonization have been improved."
"These three domains are often intertwined."
"Our success in making this field transparent will be of enormous importance to the European Community."
"Broad freedom of access to these new opportunities is quite simply a fundamental right of our citizens and constitutes another step towards full implementation of the Treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hendrick, and the Committee draftsmen - Mr Ferri for the Legal Affairs Committee and Mr Whitehead for the Culture Committee - for their excellent work."
"The rapid adoption of this proposal for a directive is, in the Commission's view, one of the basic prerequisites for guaranteeing the balanced development of information society services in Europe."
"The new services represent a genuinely unique opportunity for the competitiveness of the European economy and the diffusion of European culture, and an opportunity to take full advantage of the diversity of European society."
"These services open up wide-ranging prospects for the growth of our industry and for innovation, investment, the creation of new jobs in Europe and consumer choice."
"In order for these benefits to come about, though, it is necessary that the new services - which, by their very nature, are designed to cross geographical boundaries - can benefit to the full from the dimensions of a Europe without frontiers."
"In other words, we must avoid the risk of refragmentation at national level of the unified regulatory framework provided by the internal market."
"The proposal for a directive defining a transparency mechanism for the information society services is specifically intended to eliminate this risk by establishing a preventive legislative information procedure and a system of administrative co-operation between the national and Community authorities."
"Such a mechanism will enable us to prevent the formation of new barriers to freedom of movement and, at the same time, to study and agree upon appropriate ways of providing more effective protection, at European level, for those fundamental interests that deserve to be safeguarded, such as the protection of consumers and minors, or the objectives of cultural policy in Europe."
"The Commission particularly welcomes the fact that the parliamentary debate that has taken place so far has fully recognized the importance of this proposal for a directive and given unambiguous support to what it contains."
"Indeed, I note with satisfaction that the majority of the amendments are specifically designed to strengthen the proposal or clarify the detail of its content, so that the Commission is highly favourable to them."
"I refer to Amendments Nos 2, subject to rewording, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 in the Italian version, 14 in part, 15, 17, 19 and 20."
"On the other hand, though not challenging the intention behind them, the Commission is unable to endorse those amendments which are not really intrinsic to the context of the proposal or which would have the effect of impairing the present functioning of Directive 83/189."
"The point is that the purpose of the present initiative is that the procedure which currently applies to goods should be extended to include the new services sector, but with no changes of any kind, since this is a procedure of proven value."
"For these reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 16 and 18."
"Finally, Mr President, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 21, believing as it does that transparency must be applicable to all the services provided on the information highway, without exception."
"After all, this directive - which, I would remind you, considers procedural regulations only, not only refrains from prejudging the problems specific to any individual sector, and especially in the cultural sphere, but will also be able to make a valuable contribution to thoughts on the future action necessary in that sphere."
"Essentially, we felt that this was such a new and evolutionary field that no one is yet in a position to lay down a complete and definitive regulatory framework."
"It seems better, then, to implement a flexible but effective procedure."
"In conclusion, I must express my sincere thanks to the European Parliament for the way it has so far supported the rapid progress of this initiative, which is so important for the development of the information society in Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"After the vote on Amendments Nos 17 and 18:"
"Mr President, you must ask for votes against."
"You are asking only for votes in favour and not against."
"I am sorry..."
"I am not doing the translation."
"This is not a problem of interpretation!"
"The fact is that when I see such a large number of hands raised after asking for those in favour, since this is not a roll-call vote there is no point in wasting time on asking how many are against."
"It is the case, Mr President, that even if we are in the minority sometimes, we still want to register the fact that we have voted against something."
"So you must also ask the question, who is against, so that we who are against can register our opposition, even if there are only a few of us."
"Otherwise we cannot do this."
"Mr Cars, you are undoubtedly right."
"I would do the same, even if - I say again - it is only apparent at the time a hand is raised."
"Nothing appears in the Minutes!"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Regional policy in Austria, Finland and Sweden"
"The next item is the report (A4-0114/97) by Mr Rack, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the communication from the Commission on the implementation of European Union regional policies in Austria, Finland and Sweden (COM(96)0316 - C4-0533/96)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the implementation of EU regional policies in the three new member countries of Austria, Sweden and Finland is largely uncontroversial."
"That, however, does not make it unimportant."
"It is not unimportant to the countries concerned, it is not unimportant to the European Union as a whole, and to a certain extent it is also of interest and importance to future candidates for accession to the Union."
"The report itself relates primarily to the first year and a half from the date of accession."
"In several oral contributions in committee, the Commission kept providing us with updates and in that respect has ensured that the report actually reflects the current state of play."
"The subject of the report is the Commission Communication, which deals with the implementation of programmes worth more than seven billion ECU, with 1.6bn for Austria, 1.7bn for Finland and 1.4bn for Sweden."
"The report focuses on Objectives 1, 2, 5b and 6, but it also contains a number of cross-references with statements relating to the other objectives, which is something we pursued in some detail in committee."
"In its communication the Commission certainly awards very high marks to the three new Member States, in terms of both the extent to which the programmes have been implemented and the extent to which the relevant funds have been used."
"All three countries have made more or less equal progress."
"They are spending their money as planned and are also achieving quite a lot with it."
"From that point of view, the report shows that even economically advanced countries - all three are net contributors - can derive additional benefits from participation in the system of European regional policy."
"Some aspects of this added value are referred to explicitly."
"The main point, really, is that all three countries were quick to signal their willingness to become involved in regional policy and have proved astute in implementing it, having prepared the ground effectively before allocating the available funds on the basis of their planned programmes."
"It is also quite possible to identify a learning curve, which is beginning to bear fruit at the present time."
"The Commission has rightly called for an evaluation of the extent to which the allocated funds actually achieve their purposes."
"Here we all have a lot to learn."
"This also applies to the domain of transparency."
"In this respect some countries, among them Sweden and Finland, have an exemplary track record on the basis of their own traditions."
"The others can learn from these two countries."
"Lessons for the Member States - the old just as much as the new ones -are also observable in relation to the concept of partnership and the 'bottom-up' principle."
"This is an approach to regional policy which creates genuine popular involvement."
"For this very reason we expressly included in our committee's discussions a factfinding session with regional representatives from the three new Member States, who certainly found it to be a useful exercise."
"What continues to be important about the implementation of regional policy in the three new Member States is that it really has broken new ground, not only in form but in substance too."
"Especially in the domains of environmental policy, the pursuit of equal treatment and programmes for the promotion of women, but also with regard to the use of new information technology, the three States, practising the values which underlie their own political systems, have undoubtedly lent welcome new momentum not only to their own regional policies but also to European regional policy as a whole."
"Another important lesson referred to in this report, as well as in parallel reports, has been the fact that the three new Member States, particularly Austria and Finland in their external border position, have been demonstrating a great many good practices, especially in the field of interregional and cross-border cooperation, and this sort of development is also of interest to prospective members of the European Union."
"Some useful work is being done here in terms of establishing a conceptual basis for a preaccession strategy."
"Finally, explicit reference should be made to one more lesson, because it is also very important."
"We can learn from mistakes as well as from good example."
"Mistakes have been and are still being made."
"The implementation of regional policy as a whole, both at European and national levels, is still plagued by too much bureaucracy and too little information."
"We should endeavour to reverse that situation."
"Let me conclude by thanking the Commission for the very cooperative manner in which they invariably agreed to provide us with the various updated figures, and may I finally thank everyone who helped with this report, including Members of this House."
"I hope that we shall obtain the broadest possible consensus behind this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur has said, this report is a document that we can all endorse."
"I should also like to congratulate him on this inventory of structural policy in the three new Member States."
"Our group will surely vote for this report."
"This inventory will undoubtedly be of importance to the three new Member States, since they will shortly be sitting round the table for the first time at discussions on the reform of structural policy."
"That is why it is also very important for the Union to allow precisely these fresh experiences, these unspent experiences, if you like, of the new Member States to play a significant part in its deliberations on the reform of structural policy."
"At the same time, these three new Member States - and I am partly qualified to speak here on the basis of my experience of the internal political discussion in my own country of Austria - must also prepare very thoroughly for this debate."
"There must be no more of the assertions we have occasionally heard in the debate on structural policy that two and two can make five."
"We have the Freedom Party of Austria, for example, trying on the one hand to have our membership contributions reduced but on the other hand to obtain Objective 1 status for each of our federal states."
"I therefore believe that such a report is a very important means of encouraging a realistic debate on the potential of the structural-policy regime and structural funds of the Union."
"It will also be important to conduct the debate on the future of the structural funds in the light of the evidence which suggests that neither the older Member States nor the new Member States - net contributors, as the rapporteur indicated - are prepared to end up paying more into the European budget."
"That means we shall have to begin with very detailed discussions in each Member State, including the new ones, on where the real priorities should lie."
"I see them very clearly in the need to create more employment again in the European Union."
"Mr President, the Commission's communication and Mr Rackin's excellent report on the implementation of the EU's regional policy in the new Member States brings out very clearly the good sides and critical points."
"In the initial stages of implementation in the Member States there are time lags, problems with information and inefficiencies of management."
"The reports, like the Member States and assessments, quite rightly points out the need for simplifying administration."
"The structure of funding, which is fragmented and concentrated on central government, should be decentralized to local authorities."
"The special problems of Finland partly also Sweden which distinguish them from the other EU countries are long distances, low population density and exceptionally cold climatic conditions."
"The areas needing to be developed by the structural funds are situated in these countries thousands of kilometres from the Central European market areas, near the Russian border."
"The main livelihood in these areas, agriculture, has undergone a rapid structural upheaval with EU membership, Open markets have led to a situation in which, because of the short growing season, it is impossible to compete without continual production costs subsidies."
"I may say in this connection, ladies and gentlemen, that there is still about a metre of snow lying in Northern Finland."
"Finland is Europe's most rural country, in which stresses the need for a rural policy which supports the wide variety of businesses."
"Finland is currently suffering from the second highest unemployment rate in the Union."
"The development of regional economies in the 1990s has been weak as a result of the record slump."
"Now that economic growth is beginning the remote areas are losing out, because young people are moving out of them to the more densely populated centres of southern Finland."
"In other words, irrespective of support and investment, the regional differences are growing, although the objective is quite rightly the independent and varied development of the regions."
"In my opinion the experience obtained so far in the objective programmes shows very clearly that the responsibility for putting the programmes into practice should be transferred to the Member States and their local authorities, to the regions themselves."
"We must move away from the single structure of a programme as a bundle of measures, it must be made continually more flexible."
"The programmes are, however, absolutely essential for these areas."
"They have clearly brought with them useful projects, new types of cooperation and targeted planning."
"Thus in the review of the EU structural funds the continuing support for the EU's northern regions must be protected."
"(FI ) Mr President, both the Commission communication and Mr Rack's report constitute a very interesting record of the experiences obtained with the implementation of regional policy in the three new Member States."
"Thanks and congratulations to Mr Rack and the Commission."
"These documents have highlighted many important points."
"For example, they state that the implementation of EU regional policy has taken an unreasonably long time."
"In Finland, and as far as I know, in Sweden too, the regional and local authorities have strongly criticized the fact that it has taken and is still taking far too much time to put the administrative procedures in place - time which should have been used implementing the policy itself and in the discussion of its objectives and means."
"Reference is also quite rightly made to the problems which have arisen in view of the administrative bureaucracy and lack of internal coordination among the Commission's units."
"In order to simplify and promote the activities of the structural funds it is absolutely essential to simplify the administrative procedure and develop the internal coordination of the Commission's units."
"The Commission's relevant directorate general should interpret and apply the rules in the same way."
"In applying regional policy stress has been placed on the participation of regional and local authorities and interest groups in the planning and realization of regional policy."
"Experience so far shows, however, that the role of those involved at local level has not been anything like sufficient."
"For example in Finland the EU funding is being channelled through the state budget."
"This practice has increased the bureaucracy involved in distributing the resources and resulted in the central government's own objectives being given priority over regional objectives."
"In Finland the regional and local authorities in fact hope that the decision-making power on EU funds will be transferred to local authorities."
"In future the Commission should ensure that regional and local authorities are given full decision-making power in the adoption and implementation of programmes."
"In spite of the problems it must be stressed that the activities of the structural funds have clearly brought new energy and enthusiasm into regional activities."
"Accordingly, the international outlook and the level of awareness about the European Union have also increased."
"Mr President, as a Swede I welcome both the Commission's communication and Mr Rack's report."
"Both are largely in agreement with the conclusions which the Regional Committee came to at their meeting on 15 January 1997."
"I would like to emphasise strongly the great paucity of information made available to those concerned, particularly to small and medium sized companies in Sweden."
"The extensive administration and bureaucracy both in the EU and nationally and the lack of standardised rules have actively contributed to making implementation of regional policy difficult."
"The criticism levelled against centralised government, particularly in Sweden, is also quite justified."
"As all three countries are net contributors to the EU it is important psychologically that there is a proper and quantitative return to these countries in the form of regional aid and that this can be used simply, quickly and effectively."
"So maintaining and developing the Objective 6-region is extremely important."
"The Commission in its Report on Cohesion and Environment pointed especially to the fact that non governmental organisations must be more involved in regional politics."
"The committee also agreed with this and adopted our amendment proposal."
"To my great disappointment I now see that Mr Rack in amendment proposal no. 4 wants to go against both the Commission and the committee by removing the NGO's participation."
"It ought to be generally accepted that non-governmental organisations, NGOs, are an asset."
"They have the local knowledge and acceptance which public authorities unfortunately often lack."
"What is more important is that they are not driven by profit or the need for power."
"So I urge Parliament to vote against amendment proposal no 4 in favour of the original text."
"In all other respects we will be voting for the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anyone who is familiar, within his own country or elsewhere, with the administration of EU projects will no doubt recognize the criticisms made in this report."
"These criticisms can be summed up under two headings - too much bureaucracy and not enough transparency in regional promotion measures."
"As long as these defects are not remedied, many a citizen of our highly developed member countries will regard this as further grounds for Euroscepticism."
"As an Austrian Member, however, I find it extremely important that EU assistance should henceforth be used primarily to fight unemployment and indeed that the creation of jobs be made our foremost priority."
"Jobs, however, are not created by supporting a few multinational giants, which will often strike sail at the first signs of an economic headwind, leaving their massive redundant crews to take to the lifeboats; on the contrary, jobs are created by promoting small and medium-sized businesses, which, after all, are the largest overall employers of manpower, not only in Austria."
"What I should like to see being avoided in future might best be defined by means of an example."
"Burgenland has been granted Objective 1 status and is to receive a total of 160m ECU from 1995 to 1999."
"This money is to lead to the creation of 7, 300 new jobs."
"If we consider, however, the way in which this assistance has been administered, it emerges that only 70 out of 9, 000 businesses are receiving support."
"The largest slice of the cake, ECU 10m, has gone to the Lenzing company; this represents 30 % of a year's promotion funds."
"This company has used the money to create only 120 jobs, which are already under threat because the parent group is reporting nine-figure losses."
"I believe it is essential to prevent any such effects in future."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Rack for his thorough and effective work in assessing regional policy in the three new Member States."
"It is of course the central principle of the EU's regional policy to narrow the differences between the regions."
"However, this has not as yet been successful."
"Even in the new Member States it is noticeable that the differences between the regions are growing rather than shrinking."
"The EU's newest Member states are different in many ways from the 'old Member States'."
"Finland and Sweden, for example, have an entirely new objective area, the Objective 6 area, and we have no Objective 1 areas at all."
"In the Objective 6 area account is taken of the distinctive features typical of the Nordic countries such as low population density and long distances."
"In shaping the EU's regional policy in future these factors must be included either by continuing with the Objective 6 programme or by including these features typical of the Nordic countries in other programmes."
"The problem with the present Objective 6 programme is however that the regional development funds include support for agriculture."
"There are some areas in which two-thirds of the resources are directed towards farms and only one third remains for the structural development of the region."
"However, the most important structural policy objective for Finland and for the EU as a whole, apart from the cohesion objective, is to focus on employment and on overcoming the unemployment problem."
"Mr Rack has also described very well the problems relating to the situation in the new Member States."
"We have a reasonably good administrative culture and the EU's structural programmes have involved increased bureaucracy."
"This problem is described very well and it is to be hoped that we will get over this problem in the review of the regional policy programmes."
"One positive aspect from Finland's point of view, as has been stated, is that many new things have been happening and there has been enthusiastic cooperation."
"Mr President, I think that the report we are discussing is, for the most part, a good one and it describes the situation accurately."
"There are also parts of the EU's regional aid which have worked quite well in practice."
"This applies in particular to Objective 4 and Objective 3."
"But there is a lot which, if we are to be honest about it, does not work particularly well."
"One problem which crops up continually when you are out looking at real projects is the enormous amount of bureaucracy you come up against when you make an application for funds and when you submit a report on these projects; all this creates immense difficulties."
"There are also several problems which are particularly connected with the Objective 6-Region in Sweden which deals with aid to sparsely populated areas."
"One of the problems is that there is very little participation on the part of private businesses, which is almost certainly due to the bureaucracy involved."
"Another problem is that only a small part of the aid has been paid; in Sweden less than 10 percent of funds have been paid out and actually used."
"It is also true to say that many municipalities are currently in such a bad state financially that they do not have the means to use EU aid, they quite simply do not have the means to get hold of it."
"What is currently happening is that municipalities and regional authorities are closing down perfectly healthy businesses in order to take on temporary EU projects, which is not a particularly positive development."
"This is why Objective 6 aid must be changed in the future to make it more effective and work better as it is in the sparsely populated regions that the big regional political problems can be found."
"Taking an overall view, I am prepared to say that it would have been considerably better to keep the money in Sweden and never allow it to go via the EU but to allow Sweden themselves to determine how the funds should be used."
"This is the truth about this aid."
"It is also important to view regional policy as a whole and to look at the effect EU membership has had."
"The fact is that the key to the regional balance which has existed in Sweden, where there has been a very even regional standard, is a strong public sector and public transfer system."
"As part of the EMU process there are currently large cutbacks in these which is having a considerable effect on the regional balance."
"In addition, most of the funds returned to Sweden go into agriculture, particularly agriculture in Southern Sweden, and this has a significant negative impact from a regional political point of view."
"The EU is also moving towards serious intervention in national regional policy, for example in our transport aid, which is a very effective form of regional political aid."
"So, unfortunately, I must state that on the whole membership of the EU has had a negative effect on the regional balance in Sweden."
"Mr President, to create equal conditions for all people, no matter where they live, is one of our most important tasks as elected representatives and to ensure that everyone has access to work, education, care and communication regardless of whether they live in a city, a small town or a rural area."
"The regions in the North of Sweden and Finland are extremely sparsely populated with as few as two inhabitants per square kilometre."
"An active regional policy which allows the whole of Sweden to prosper is therefore an important component of Swedish domestic policy, for which Objective 6 is absolutely crucial and must naturally be maintained."
"That the whole of Europe should prosper ought to be the aim of the EU's regional policy."
"It is a good heading for regional policy which we ought to introduce into the Union."
"Sweden pays 20 billion kronor per year in Membership dues to the EU."
"Out of this 5 billion goes back into agriculture, 4 billion to regional politics."
"In order to use this 4 billion we must also contribute the same amount of money ourselves from the Swedish purse."
"This may seem in order but my question is whether this merry-go-round of money which flies off to Brussels and then comes back round again is a good model."
"The money which is returned is also loaded with a mass of rules and administration."
"We cannot resolve this huge issue now but it must be included when we evaluate the Structural Funds after 1999."
"This report also takes up the issue of existing bureaucracy and delays, particularly the length of time from a decision being made to when the money is finally paid out."
"This must be made more efficient."
"Mr President, fewer Objectives, fewer funds and community initiatives, better co-ordination between the EU's regional policy and that of the Member State's, increased regional and local influence in decision making, planning, implementation and supervision of EU projects, putting all our efforts into doing something about the high unemployment in Northern Sweden and in Northern Finland along with some proposals for a better environment and a border region co-operation are some of the proposals which could further improve regional policy both for the Member States and for the EU."
"These are proposals which could make regional policy more effective."
"Approve Mr Rack's report, Mr President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission and in particular on behalf of Mrs Wulf-Mathies, the Commissioner responsible for one of the main sectors of regional policy, I should like to thank Mr Rack for his report and for the motion for a resolution."
"The report arrives at - and I quote - a 'definitely positive verdict regarding the implementation to date of the Structural Fund programmes in the three Member States' ."
"This result is not solely, or even primarily, a credit to the Commission but is attributable to the professionalism with which the three Member States in question have approached their task."
"We can certainly feel well satisfied at the progress made, but satisfaction must never be allowed to slide into complacency."
"The report makes a number of constructive criticisms, many of which will appear on the agenda during the discussions on the reform of the Structural Funds launched by the recent forum on cohesion."
"Before replying to these points, I should like to highlight a number of passages in the report which express certain principles of regional development policy which should always be taken as reference parameters for the debate on reform."
"First, a relatively advanced level of national economic development does not exclude the existence of specific regional development problems and disparities which call for intervention by the Structural Funds."
"I would also remind Honourable Members, in particular, that the per capita gross domestic product in Sweden and Finland is still below the Community mean."
"Secondly, the principles of multi-annual planning, partnership, subsidiarity, additionality and concentration have proved to be essential components of the Union's regional policy."
"Partnership between the Commission and the Member States, and within the Member States, is confronted by the challenge posed by excessive complexity."
"But it is a principle that we mean to defend, trying at the same time to reduce bureaucracy so far as is compatible with the sound and efficient administration of the Funds."
"Thirdly, the promotion of employment, technological modernization, equality of opportunity and the environment must remain priorities of the new Structural Funds."
"Cross-border and inter-regional co-operation is another sector that enhances the value of the Union's structural interventions and must be promoted."
"Local initiatives, especially those to promote employment, are another field that holds out encouraging prospects for the future."
"On this point, I would refer you to the current programme of territorial pacts for employment - the Commission strongly supports this programme and agrees with its approach."
"It takes the principle of partnership back to basics, involving the public, private and voluntary sectors in joint action to boost employment."
"The Leader II programme has already achieved good results in this area."
"Moving onto the criticisms, I believe that our administration and distribution mechanisms can, and therefore must, be improved."
"As the report rightly emphasizes, excessive bureaucracy is particularly unpopular in the three new Member States."
"Within the Commission there is a broad consensus on many of the proposed improvements: reducing the number of Community-initiative programmes and the administrative burden they involve, improving co-ordination and harmonization of rules between the various Funds and the Directorates-General, and so on."
"Many of these improvements, though, will have to await the major reform of the Structural Funds for the new programming period."
"Among the reforms, there will have to be better use made of modern financing mechanisms, including start-up and risk capital."
"Regarding the recent reprogramming exercise for the Objective 2 regions in Finland, that was indeed a protracted and laborious procedure."
"I would however call your attention to the secondary advantages, especially the possibility of simplifying and redefining the programme and bringing forward the intermediate assessment."
"With regard to the other objectives, the intermediate assessment has not yet been completed and, despite our efforts, progress is slow."
"The report reproaches us for having neglected the rural areas and Objective 5B."
"That does not mean that the Commission underestimates the problems of rural areas: indeed, as emphasized in Mr Rack's report, a very significant proportion of the available resources has been used specifically for schemes to benefit the rural areas and to benefit farmers in the Nordic and Alpine regions."
"Finally, Mr President, Mr Rack, ladies and gentlemen, I extend my congratulations and those of the Commission on this report, and thank you for the critical and constructive comments you have put forward."
"I see this as another outstanding example of collaboration between our institutions."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I should just like to raise a point of order, for which I apologize."
"There were two roll-call votes yesterday, namely on the Titley report and the WTO bananas, in which I wanted to abstain rather than voting in favour."
"I asked for that to be minuted."
"However, it was not mentioned in the Minutes of these roll-call votes."
"I should just like you to establish the reason for that, if you please."
"It is pointless for us to make corrections if they are not recorded."
"Thank you Mrs Mann, but the discussion of the Minutes ended over an hour ago."
"However, we shall take account of your request."
"Cross-border and inter-regional co-operation"
"The next item is the report (A4-0161/97) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on cross-border and inter-regional co-operation."
"Mr President, cross-border and inter-regional cooperation is a fundamental part of the work of the European Union."
"Europe's present boundaries were created by a series of wars which sapped Europe's energies and resources, at enormous human cost."
"The European Union was founded partly as a means of resolving conflicts through negotiation and with the aid of common legislation."
"Nations are still divided by borders."
"The creation of the internal market has reduced internal border problems but not, unfortunately, eliminated them altogether."
"One function of cross-border cooperation across the EU's internal borders is to implement fully freedom of movement for persons, goods and services."
"The aim should be to ensure that citizens' everyday affairs run more smoothly."
"Borders must not impede the provision or use of services of an acceptable standard, for example."
"Local authorities in border areas may also save substantial amounts of the taxpayers' money by setting up joint services and common infrastructure in border areas."
"In places, considerable progress has of course already been made in this direction."
"Good examples are to be found in Germany, Holland, Luxembourg and France."
"Another noteworthy example comes from the border between Finland and Sweden, where the towns of Haaparanta and Tornio are cooperating."
"It must be said that the cooperation between these two neighbouring towns is much closer and more significant in terms of results than that elsewhere."
"However, there are very few problems with regard to cooperation at the internal borders if one compares the situation with that between EU Member States and third countries."
"Despite all the difficulties, though, strong foundations exist for the development of such cooperation."
"The end of the division of the continent into two camps has created new opportunities for the development of the whole of Europe."
"In order to exploit them, however, care must be taken to avoid new walls being erected which divide peoples within Europe."
"Cross-border and interregional cooperation strengthens neighbourliness and solidarity between the regions of Europe, creating and renewing arrangements for cooperation in the best possible way."
"Europe is characterized by a stress on regionalization."
"The Interreg II C programme was developed to promote regional cooperation."
"By means of this and other programmes, the EU must improve exploitation of the regions' own resources through joint activity."
"At the EU level, Mediterranean cooperation has already been institutionalized."
"The development of the Mediterranean programme and the stepping up of measures in that region is important from the point of view of the whole Union."
"However, in the north of the Union - in the Baltic and Barents Sea regions - regional cooperation is also developing."
"Two of the EU's new Member States and Norway, which rejected EU membership in its referendum, meet there, together with Russia, which has enormous social problems."
"Environmental concerns and efforts to increase regional stability are, in particular, key issues which should be stressed in cooperation between the EU and third countries, whether in the south, east or north."
"A third important aspect of cross-border and inter-regional cooperation is the development of effective and practical cooperation between associated countries and EU Member States."
"Cross-border cooperation, in particular, should be seen as part of associated countries' pre-accession strategy, by means of which practical measures can be taken, to the benefit of both sides, to improve the conditions in which people in border areas live."
"However, there are still many problems with regard to cooperation between EU Member States and third countries which hamper the development of genuine cross-border projects."
"A particular problem lies in the fact that cooperation programmes between EU Member States and third countries are based on separate, differing legislation."
"Programmes in the Member States are administered by the Directorate-General responsible for regional policy, while programmes in third countries are administered by that responsible for external relations."
"Third country programmes are not sufficiently long-term and systematic in their planning."
"In my opinion a possible solution to these differences in the length of programmes and in how they are regulated might be to set up a single common fund for cross-border cooperation with third countries, which could be used to fund and administer joint projects."
"I believe that the Commission should consider this recommendation very carefully, because it could reduce bureaucracy, improve the implementation of these programmes and enable genuine cross-border cooperation to be achieved with third countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by congratulating my colleague Riitta Myller on a truly outstanding report."
"It analyses the present situation very well, shows where reforms are needed and makes proposals for the future."
"Cross-border and interregional cooperation in Europe, I believe, is one the kernels, one of the centrepieces and one of the flagship activities of this European Union, because it puts into practice our ideal of an increasingly integrated Europe, our belief that integration is far more than a mere catchword and that economic and social cohesion must be pursued in earnest."
"Interregional and cross-border cooperation means looking beyond our own four walls, taking advantage of the spinoffs from such cooperation and, where frontiers previously created obstacles and made the joint use of facilities difficult, whether for infrastructural, social or simply interpersonal reasons, dismantling such frontiers."
"This phenomenon can already be experienced in many parts of the European Union."
"Anyone who, like me, comes from a region in which four European countries meet - Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Germany - can see that this is a highly desirable development."
"But you can also see that its organizational implementation, especially in the administrative domain, still poses problems, even today."
"Everyone knows that four different administrative structures come into contact there, with different levels of government having to act together."
"That does not make it easy, but the people on the spot, the administrative bodies, are trying to find answers, some of them on the basis of structural assistance from the European Union."
"I believe that is important."
"However, I must also say that future interregional and cross-border cooperation should entail no moves to create, or to demand the creation of, any additional tiers of administration."
"Political responsibility for this work, within the bounds we have set, must be entrusted to the bodies with the democratic mandate to shoulder that responsibility."
"It is their task to carry it out."
"But we in the European Union do not only have internal borders to dismantle; we also have external borders."
"My colleague Riitta Myller stated that very clearly."
"I refer you to her report, which I fully endorse."
"As far as we in the European Union are concerned, our external borders currently touch on the regions where the greatest upheavals have been occurring."
"It is at those borders that the widest prosperity gaps are to be found, and it is there that the bulk of our work will have to be done."
"The third aspect, which we introduced in the past within the INTERREG framework and which I regard as very important, is that Europe should be seen from the perspective of regional planning in the wider sense."
"It should no longer be considered as a collection of nation States or individual regions within those States; we must focus on entire geographical areas and their problems - by which I mean the Baltic region, the Mediterranean Basin, etc. and act accordingly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, structural reform is on the agenda for the coming weeks and months."
"Personally speaking, I believe that interregional cooperation and the structural funds of the European Union dedicated to that purpose, in other words INTERREG, are one of the main assets that must be preserved, even after a reform, because this is the most European of all the work we can undertake."
"Cooperation is an important point."
"When we talk about concentrating the structural funds and improving their efficiency, that means concentrating especially on the things that are very good and very important and reinforcing them."
"My appeal is that due prominence be accorded to the INTERREG resource in the forthcoming structural reform."
"Cross-border and interregional cooperation form one of the main pillars of the European edifice."
"I sincerely congratulate my colleague Riitta Myller on her outstanding report, to which I pledge my support."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PPE Group I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report and to express my thanks for the constructive cooperation that marked the deliberations in committee, where we were able to add what we regard as essential points, which are now included in the report."
"In our eyes too, cross-border and interregional cooperation is one of the pillars of the European integration process."
"As the rapporteur said, there are two aspects involved: cooperation within Europe and cooperation with third countries, where this type of cooperation can pay important dividends both now and in the future."
"At the same time, these efforts should not be entirely focused on social and economic cohesion but must also take account of the security dimension."
"By comparison with other projects, I too would say that interregional and cross-border cooperation has a greater impact on people's daily lives, one reason being that the projects involved are often born of popular initiatives."
"They merit greater attention, because these projects highlight the obstacles and difficulties that hinder cooperation, problems of which people become more keenly aware in this context."
"Interregional cooperation must take more account of economic aspects, of social, environmental and planning policies, because people in border areas find it hard to understand why good health care is available on their side of the border but not on the other side, why the planners, for example, have designated their side of the border as an economic development area, whereas on the other side, perhaps little more than half a mile away, the land may be designated as a green belt with strict measures to protect the natural environment."
"These are European integration problems, and that is why such projects deserve special attention."
"This report must serve first and foremost as the basis for future projects, for the next programme."
"Secondly, interregional and cross-border cooperation must be better coordinated with the other structural funds and the other forms of structural assistance."
"Thirdly, procedures should be simplified."
"If we want individual citizens or even citizens' initiatives to become involved in this domain, we cannot confront them with time-consuming and cumbersome administrative procedures that result in their having to wait up to a year and a half before receiving a definitive response to their applications."
"Moreover, these programmes are a means of taking account of the specific nature of the individual regions of Europe."
"As someone who lives in a border region, I can assure you that you will find convinced but critical Europeans in these regions."
"We should not squander the opportunity to make greater use of the impetus for European integration that is generated in frontier areas."
"I certainly hope that this highly significant report will also send the right signal to the Commission."
"Madam President, while I fully endorse the praise Mrs Myller has received for this report, with its extensive coverage of Europe as a whole, I would like to take a closer look at one particular facet."
"We are concerned with major borders, new borders, external borders, but the INTERREG 1 and INTERREG 2 programmes have hitherto financed borders which are now being defined as internal but which have become internal precisely because of the effect of those programmes."
"I refer to the thirty or so Euroregions, as they are called in the Treaty, which are still operative and whose problems have not been fully covered simply because we are now dealing with other regions with a greater eastward exposure."
"I agree with a number of points, especially in the motion for a resolution, which do to some extent refer to the root of this kind of attention cultivated by the European Union - especially where reference is made, in paragraph 2, to clear guidelines for co-operation policy."
"In this type of activity, there is such a range, such a free interpretation, that at times there seems to be a danger of wandering away from the point, diverging from the lines laid down in the Treaty and elsewhere."
"Clear guidelines, then, spring from three fundamental activities."
"The first is the activity that favours the exchange of information: understanding each other in order to know each other."
"The second is the activity that derives full value from affinities and smooths over any aspects that are not common to all sides."
"And the third is the activity that focuses on joint programmes directed towards what is the main objective of this type of intervention, which is to eliminate or at any rate reduce regional disparities."
"Paragraph 6 of the motion mentions the role of the regions situated on the internal borders, and this is where my main interest lies, since other Members have concerned themselves with the new borders."
"The main objective - as also stated in paragraph 11 of the motion for a resolution - is to enhance economic and social development."
"Significantly, the two sides of industry are expressly called upon to participate."
"So we are not talking about a European Union mandate to regional or national political organizations or institutions - the social partners are to participate."
"Not only that, but paragraph 23 explicitly refers to the involvement and specific participation of the private sector: the public are to be the proposers of the activities, the interpreters of the regulations and hence, clearly, the beneficiaries of the activities."
"I say all this because we are seeing the birth of other, foreign Euroregions, unfortunately supported by Community funds."
"I refer specifically to them not just because they represent an internal policy problem but because we are talking about forms of Community financing - and this is the recommendation I would like to put to this House - which in my opinion should also be a matter of interest to the European Commission."
"I refer to a Euroregion which goes by the name of the 'Tyrolese Euregio' , which is still progressing despite the widespread opposition that followed its creation, both within Italy and within Austria."
"The two governments concerned, those of Italy and Austria, have clearly denied the logical justification for this Euroregion, which is outside those envisaged by the Treaty."
"And yet this 'Euregio of Trentino and Tyrol' is still progressing, proposing programmes, using Community funds, with an objective very different from that proposed by the Euroregions as we understand them, which tend to weaken if not actually eliminate the internal borders."
"This Euroregion is eliminating the previous borders, true, but with the objective of creating an unacceptable political institution, defining a new border, a thick red line chalked around what is now being defined as 'the Union of Tyrol' - North Tyrol, South Tyrol and a hypothetical and historically unjustifiable Trentino Tyrol."
"I ask you, Commissioner, to be on your guard against allowing any such distortions to occur and, above all, to ensure that they are not financed from Community funds."
"Madam President, in the context of eastward enlargement, this report has a very special significance."
"It is an expression of the urgency of change in the funding of both cross-border and interregional cooperation in the Baltic and Mediterranean regions."
"The situation in the Euroregions, the fact that money earmarked for cross-border cooperation can practically only be spent on assistance to immediate frontier zones on our side of the border, is intolerable."
"Trust that has been painstakingly built up and successes that have been wrung from a vast number of joint talks on the development of projects are all in vain if the projects cannot be financed from one fund."
"That is why the jewel in the crown of this report is that it provides for the possibility of financing from a common fund not only joint interregional cooperation projects but also those in the domain of cross-border cooperation."
"We have agreed that the Greens will withdraw their amendment, because point 4 is an adequate means of presenting this request to the Commission."
"Speed is now of the essence if the hopes of the regions are not to be dashed."
"The Commission acts and implements these things."
"It could already be promoting pilot schemes during the current programming period to test a joint financing and evaluation system."
"The 1994 Schroedter report gives it scope to do that, and I hope the Commission will respond very rapidly."
"Our perennial problem is that money flows indirectly into the coffers of the central authorities."
"This call for a common fund offers a means of ensuring that the money can really be administered in the Euroregions from now on."
"Clear steps are being taken here to foil and preclude attempts by central administrations to misappropriate funds for their own purposes."
"The Commission is also called upon to ensure that this abuse is not continued in the current programmes."
"It is truly a matter of creating cross-border links between villages and towns, overcoming divisive factors and restoring bridges destroyed during the wars."
"Nowhere is the idea of a 'fortress Europe' so tangible as at the external borders."
"The Schengen rules are a huge obstacle to cooperation in the Euroregions."
"It is down to the courage of local authorities that projects are nevertheless possible."
"The theatre island in Guben, on the River Neisse, had not been used for 50 years until a concrete bridge enabled the inhabitants of Guben and Gubin to hold a Festival of Europe there together."
"These are opportunities for Europe."
"Above all, an open Europe requires political will at all levels."
"Mr President, there are some exciting new developments in the whole idea of cross-border and interregional cooperation, in particular for people like myself who live in a coastal community in Scotland."
"We tend to think we are out on the periphery, that we do not have borders to the east."
"But, in fact, we do because the North Sea provides a common border and historically Scotland was very closely linked to the Netherlands, to Flanders, to the Baltic countries, to Germany and so on. These links are now being re-established and I very much welcome the extension of the concept explicitly to the North Sea and the idea that the coastal people also form part of an interregion."
"As president of the North Sea Intergroup, I am involved in some very exciting developments which are being proposed for the whole of the North Sea region."
"In some respects the North Sea region is fortunate in that it has many advantages, for example in education."
"My own constituency of North-East Scotland has no less than four universities."
"That is replicated across many parts of the North Sea region."
"We have fishing grounds which are extremely important to Europe and very important to the fishing communities."
"We have tremendously important historic and cultural aspects which are capable of development."
"On the other hand, we suffer from peripherality and, in particular, from the perception from London that we are very far away from anywhere."
"I am glad to see that Brussels is somewhat more sympathetic than London on occasion."
"We also suffer from problems such as pollution and the need for coastal development and coastal preservation."
"This is even more accentuated when you look at other parts of the North Sea such as the east coast of England and parts of the Dutch and Danish coasts."
"In all this, there is a tremendous potential."
"In the resolution Mrs Myller has put forward - and I commend her wholeheartedly on the whole of it - there is a very interesting point 5 about cultural identities and minorities and I can see, for example, that not only the Scots but the Friesians too could benefit from emphasis on their particular language and history."
"There is potential for the development of the information society and for the protection of coastal communities."
"I should like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur for this report and to the Commission for being so innovative and thinking in terms of INTERREG IIc. I am very happy to support it."
"Madam President, it is good to see proposals for increased cooperation between regions both within and outside the EU."
"It is important that the EU does not turn in on itself."
"I also support the idea of survival strategies for peripheral regions."
"However, I do not have the same favourable attitude towards the call for the creation of a formalized 'Europe of the regions and municipalities' ."
"As the proposal stands, it contains the seeds of a Europe without frontiers, divided into regions."
"The nation states still have a monopoly in terms of taxes, but with greater funding of regional cooperation, it will increasingly be the EU which distributes Member States' tax revenues to the regions."
"Increased funding and politicization of regional cooperation will strengthen the position of the EU and the regions, at the expense of the nation states and local autonomy."
"Already, too many decisions are being taken in the EU and implemented at district and county level."
"At present, a very intensive debate is taking place concerning one of these cross-border initiatives, namely the cooperation across the frontier between Germany and Denmark in what is known as the 'Euroregion Schleswig/Slesvig' ."
"In this border area, the 'Euroregion Slesvig' has been strongly criticized, because of fears of undue dominance of the area by both the Federal Republic and the EU."
"Since the Euroregion is meant to operate as a single unit in the European context, many people in the border area see the Euroregion as an EU state created through the back-door - and there is absolutely no question of any kind of anti-German feeling here, as has been suggested."
"I share this scepticism."
"In Denmark, it is the parliament and government which decide on external policy, and not the individual counties."
"The county of South Jutland, which forms the Danish part of the border area, is not an EU municipality, but a county of Denmark."
"We ourselves have chosen that this should be so."
"In historical terms, there has been a great deal of conflict over the Danish-German border."
"Today, the border is accepted on both sides, and we have an excellent relationship between Danes and Germans in the border area, a relationship which has been a model for many other places."
"We are good neighbours who have a low fence with many openings, but we take our own decisions for ourselves, and respect those taken by the other side."
"And this is what people have been demonstrating for at the border, that things should continue in this way, and German opponents of the removal of the border have also taken part in the demonstrations against the Euroregion."
"We believe that cross-border cooperation can only be successful if there is complete acceptance that such cooperation requires agreement between the two parties."
"For two sides to agree, however, it is not necessary to build up complicated institutions."
"It is sufficient for them to meet and work out their agreement."
"I have nothing at all against cooperation, but I do object to cooperation having to be regulated through EU projects."
"People call this decentralization, and say they want to bring EU cooperation closer to the people."
"But if they wish to bring EU powers down to local level, it must be done through real decentralization, in other words by handing legislative powers back to the national parliaments."
"Cross-border cooperation is, in my view, both important and necessary, and extremely exciting and challenging."
"But I do not believe that we shall have a better or more democratic form of government by drawing down the curtain on the nation states."
"I believe in a Europe with a variety of different countries, not a new European superpower."
"It is important to preserve the nation states, above all because they are the best foundation for democracy and a sense of community and common purpose."
"If borders go, they will not simply be removed - they will have to be torn away."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cross-border cooperation now has two quite distinct aspects. That is reflected in Mrs Myller's report."
"On the one hand there is cross-border cooperation between the countries of the European Union and on the other cross-border cooperation with countries outside the European Union."
"The first type of cooperation, principally effected through Interreg-IIA, is showing very positive results."
"For the period 1995/1999 ECU 2 400 million are being mobilized for Interreg A, ECU 500 million for Interreg B and ECU 415 million for Interreg C."
"In our opinion it would be a good idea to set up an Interreg D instrument to finance linguistic cooperation in these cross-border regions."
"Such linguistic cooperation is currently under-funded and I think greater emphasis should be placed on improving that type of cooperation."
"The resolution does indeed, in points 5 and 20, stress the importance of multi-lingualism, but for the moment that remains essentially a vain hope."
"We note moreover a shift of interest towards the outermost regions of the European Union - perhaps in slightly too exclusive a manner."
"The project for developing the Mediterranean economic area is already mobilizing ECU 4 865 million, that is twice as much as Interreg-IIA, and ECU 8 million has been allocated for the Atlantis project."
"Of course we welcome this financial contribution for the respective regions, but we fear that at this rate crossborder cooperation in the heart of Europe will become the poor relation and anyone elected to represent Alsace, as I am, can only feel concerned about such trends."
"That is exacerbated, moreover, by the objective of social cohesion if that is interpreted as an obligation to keep the European Union's money for the less-developed regions only."
"Other criteria need to be taken into consideration for cross-border cooperation."
"That is why I want to say here that Franco-German cooperation as well as trilateral cooperation between Switzerland, Germany and France around Basel also need funding and must not be sacrificed on the altar of these new priorities."
"I should also like to see credit amounts released more clearly in order to strengthen bilingualism in my region - Alsace - and to see that more inhabitants of Alsace are represented in the French media."
"That is partly a financial question."
"It is quite clear that bilingualism is of great economic interest - even above actual cultural attachment proper - and it makes it possible to reduce local unemployment by a not inconsiderable amount, as may currently be seen in the Rhine Basin."
"Despite all these omissions which I am sorry to note in this report, which places great emphasis on the outermost regions but rather neglects inter-regional cooperation at the very heart of the continent, I shall of course be voting for the report, since we support the general principles and inter-regional cross-border cooperation is still an altogether positive principle."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Myller report is indeed an integrated and well documented proposal on the improvement of cross-border and interregional cooperation."
"Yet, besides the economic dimension of the issue and the clear need to achieve the aim of economic and social cohesion and, above all increased employment, cross-border cooperation can serve in a very genuine and effective way another equally important aim, that of approach and cooperation between peoples, the elimination of prejudices and stereotypes, and the discouragement of mentalities that favour and foment isolation, xenophobia, nationalism, enmity and violence."
"Consequently, if our policy to reinforce cross-border and interregional cooperation is to be effective, it must include a broad range of statutory measures and significant resources aiming both to improve the economic and social conditions of the weaker regions in the European Union, and to create a climate and conditions of equal democratic, peaceful and creative coexistence between peoples, without distinctions of sex, race, national origin or religion."
"Such a policy must also go together with a range of programmes to ensure the accession and incorporation of weaker groups, immigrants and minorities, into social, political and economic life in the European Union, in a balanced and natural way."
"The role of the media remains of course important, in that they contribute to the suppression of prejudice, by emphasizing the beauty of the variety, polychromism and multi-cultural character of modern society."
"As for the south-eastern borders of Europe, there has indeed been some delay in the promotion of cross-border cooperation, as the Myller report points out."
"That, however, is due to the well known peculiarities and serious problems of the area, problems to which the European Union should pay special attention in the context of regional policy, which call for the application of programmes appropriately adapted to the particular features of the region, and which above all require the provision of substantial resources and at the same time a trimming down of bureaucratic procedures."
"Today, with the emerging settlement of crises and the stabilization of the situation, the prerequisites are being created for cooperation between the Balkan countries at many levels."
"As you have seen, Greece now plays a positive part in solving the problems, in the effective implementation of a policy of interregional and cross-border cooperation, and in the peaceful settlement of any differences in that difficult area of south-eastern Europe, which is nevertheless very important for European integration."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller."
"I represent one of those townships, País Vasco, which through circumstances of history, was divided between two states either side of a frontier - a frontier which has long made communication difficult between two entities which share the same language and culture, in addition to forming a unit suited to cooperation in other fields such as the social and economic field."
"Fortunately these frontiers, these scars of history, are beginning to fade and we are again finding ways of creating bonds with the other part of our town within a European context."
"We must take the European area as a joint horizon for various peoples to live together without internal frontiers but with respect for our respective identities, our self determination and diversity."
"In this context cross-border cooperation is fundamentally an instrument for the creation of this joint Europe and is, similarly, the way to take to remove frontiers, not only physical ones, which make it difficult to build the planned coexistence which the European Union represents."
"Frontiers are in many cases artificial and have divided some peoples internally or have separated them from their neighbours."
"Robert Schuman hailed from Lorraine, a frontier region, De Gasperi from the alpine region of Trentino, Adenauer was from the Rhineland."
"It is not by chance that the founding fathers of this Europe should come from frontier regions."
"We must bring Europe closer to the citizens and if there is one place where our citizens can see that Europe exists, it is in the border regions."
"The effort which the Union is making in this matter will be the best catalyst for a process of political union, a union of citizens and peoples."
"Nowadays Biarritz and San Sebastián are not regarded as separate items on offer for tourists within international tourism."
"It would not seem logical if the Austrian Tyrol and the South Tyrol, Alto Adige, did not cooperate on the joint promotion of economic or tourist projects."
"It is absurd that a worker in Irún, the Basque country, working in Hendaye on the other side of the border, should not have access to coordinated services within the fields of health and social security; we see shades of Kafka when he telephones from his home to his workplace and has to pay for an international call."
"We must build Euro-regions where citizens find their natural community in a Europe without frontiers."
"Finally, Madam President, I should like to underscore the importance of the report approved in this committee, which not only launches proposals, but also demands that the framework for cross-border cooperation should be binding on the Member States."
"This Parliament asked as much of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In conclusion I hope that the Member States have the courage to resolutely pursue this cooperation."
"If they do they will be demonstrating that they are not afraid of a United Europe as a pluralistic area."
"If they do not do so or do not support this in realistic everyday terms, the citizens, the towns and the natural communities will continue building this Europe as a space for coexistence and diversity."
"The geo-political upheavals which Europe has experienced have brought in their wake strong movements in favour of integration."
"Mrs Myller's report is particularly interesting on this subject since it considers all the problems and questions raised by inter-regional and cross-border Union policy."
"It would indeed be appropriate to classify and coordinate all the initiatives which are sometimes developed in too disorganized a manner often without control or expert guidance."
"Thus when cross-border areas of activity are to be exploited a common financing and guidance fund should be set up, checks should be made to ensure that legal and tax rules are compatible, job creation should be encouraged and the environment should be effectively protected."
"In this regard I should like to mention a region not considered by the rapporteur - the Alpine region - although European Union/Swiss negotiations are at a standstill, the associations of the Chamonix valley have for their part managed to cooperate with their Piémont and Le Valais counterparts as needed to fight pollution."
"The building of Europe will also involve the citizens, the towns and the regions."
"Madam President, my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"The aim of a united, socially and economically harmonized and permanently peaceful Europe is far less likely to be achieved by centralist strong-arm tactics than by sustained, far-reaching voluntary cross-border and interregional cooperation."
"In this sense I should like to highlight a particular type of project which affects my immediate home area and which, I believe, merits respect on account of its uniqueness and its innovative and audacious character and should be supported by the European Union."
"I refer to the joint bid by three States - Italy, Slovenia and Austria - to host the Winter Olympics."
"These Olympics would be staged jointly by the federal state of Carinthia in Austria, the autonomous region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia in Italy and the Republic of Slovenia."
"This would be the first time since the revival of the Olympic Games that any Olympics had been held in a region covering several States."
"This region is trilingual, multicultural and multinational, but despite this - or perhaps precisely because of it - has decided to mount a joint bid to carry out this important cooperative project."
"This mega-event, which would attract enormous media attention, could be a flagship pilot project in the realm of interregional cooperation, a project in the true European spirit with an inestimable symbolic value."
"Madam President, there is no doubt that cross-border and interregional co-operation is a very important aspect of the European Union's policies, since it can contribute significantly to European integration and to a real approach between the populations and regions of Europe."
"Such co-operation can contribute effectively to the abolition of political and economic, but mainly of national frontiers, and I would add, to that of ill-considered cultural and religious frontiers, and it can of course contribute to reducing the corresponding gulfs and making the populations of areas that take advantage of it, one could say somewhat more 'European' ."
"Our impartial moral and substantial support is therefore needed for the better organization, the more successful implementation and maximization of its positive results in the future, since it involves programmes with added European value."
"I think the report by Mrs Myller is a step in the right direction."
"For my part, however, I would like to say that special note should be taken of a number of points which are included in the report, but which in my view are particularly important."
"The first, is that besides internal interregional and cross-border co-operation, particular emphasis should be placed on external co-operation, in other words co-operation with third countries, which in light of the Union's enlargement, can contribute significantly to the preparation of those countries."
"In that connection, and I want to stress this, the legislative framework should be simplified."
"In the INTERREG-2A Programme we have today the strange situation that on either side of the borders, that programme's projects are implemented as something separate, as if different programmes were involved."
"This creates difficulties both for the coordination and the progress of the work, and I think that the issue will have to be solved in due course."
"Secondly, interregional co-operation could prove particularly useful for the Union's coastal and island areas, especially for improved communications between the islands, but also to improve their contacts with national and Community centres."
"Thirdly, it goes without saying that an initiative of this kind must involve increased participation by local and regional authorities, and by the social partners, both in the planning and in the implementation of the related programmes."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cross-border interregional cooperation is undoubtedly of prime importance to the people of border regions."
"It serves to guarantee peace, freedom and respect for human rights."
"The key objectives of economic development, employment promotion, social and cultural cooperation, environmental protection and greater democracy are central elements of this cooperation."
"In addition, mechanisms for the support of minorities must be established and developed."
"I am afraid I can only agree with the rapporteur's criticism that there is no adequate strategy for interregional cooperation and that the funding instruments are too fragmentary."
"What is certain is that the subsidiarity principle will have to be more rigorously applied in this domain too."
"Greater responsibility for planning, administration, execution and funding must be devolved to the regional and local authorities than has hitherto been the case."
"At the same time, however, decisions on cooperative measures must be a matter for democratically elected bodies."
"An evaluation of the results is necessary, so that tax revenue is not squandered and wasted on irrelevant projects."
"This presupposes a good control system."
"Efficiency of performance must not be hampered by excessive bureaucracy and daunting administrative hurdles."
"Considerable simplification is needed, along with timely advice and guidance from the Commission."
"Support for less-developed regions, promotion of rural development and improvement of the necessary infrastructure must take priority if we are to avoid further migration from border areas."
"The Member States in the frontier regions must press on with their cooperative ventures."
"Emotional barriers must be dismantled."
"The importance of this is demonstrated by the unfortunate occurrences in southern Denmark in connection with the creation of a Euroregion."
"The Commission would do well to start with our colleague Mrs Sandbæk and try to dismantle her emotional barriers too."
"It is my hope and wish that the development of cooperation in the border regions of Member States and third countries will be successfully expedited - irrespective of whether the countries in question want to become EU members one day - for the benefit of the people living in those regions."
"That is an important precondition for the preservation of peace, freedom and democracy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, on the quality of her motion for a resolution on cross-border and inter-regional co-operation."
"The subjects covered will undoubtedly give us food for thought during the coming months as we endeavour, if possible by the end of the year, to produce a Commission communication on regional policy and cross-border and interregional co-operation - a communication which will summarize what has already been achieved in an endeavour to interpret the future."
"The Commission attaches great importance to these two forms of co-operation."
"I therefore fully share your hope that the European Union's future regional policy will attach the necessary importance to cross-border and interregional co-operation."
"As far as cross-border co-operation is concerned, the Interreg programmes of the 95-99 period represent a substantial advance over those for the previous period, especially as regards borders where no co-operation existed before 1990."
"However, there is still extensive room for improvement."
"The Commission agrees with the Committee on Regional Policy in its belief that co-operation must not only allow regional and local authorities to assume greater responsibility for the preparation and implementation of programmes but also step up those measures which tend to promote co-operation among the operators on the ground."
"The Commission will be working in two ways to eliminate the shortcomings that exist."
"First, through individual programmes requiring, both at the contracting stage and subsequently in the work of the steering committees, that co-operation is organized more effectively and that more emphasis is placed on measures calculated to promote genuine partnership. Secondly, offering the regional and local authorities, within the framework of a scheme to be known as LACE TAP - ' link and assistance in co-operation for the European border regions - technical assistance and promotion' , conducted by the association of cross-border regions and financed by the European Regional Development Fund, the possibility of organizing exchanges of experience and skills between the border areas."
"You are proposing the creation of a single European fund to implement more complex forms of co-operation on both the internal and the external borders."
"The establishment of a single fund is not possible at present, not among the associate states of Central Europe, given the present status of the Treaty - Article 130c - and the differences arising in procedural matters and in the financing of programmes, depending on whether the State concerned is a Member State or a third country."
"However, significant advances are possible even without a single fund."
"With regard to the internal borders, the INTERREG programmes implemented on some borders demonstrate that the Structural Funds are capable of promoting in-depth co-operation, with a single programme on both sides of the border, a steering committee and working groups that mobilize a wide-ranging partnership, and a single common fund for the financing of the projects."
"Unfortunately, the situation is not so advantageous on all the internal borders because, even if the Community resources originate from a single fund, it only needs the procedures for administering the appropriations to be different on the two sides of the border to make it difficult to finance common projects in both border regions."
"The Commission shares your wish to see the administration and financing of INTERREG simplified."
"The situation regarding the external borders is rather more complex, given that the cross-border co-operation procedures under PHARE and TACIS, programmes that are external to the Union, are different from those of the structural funds which are internal bodies."
"Of course, the Commission's services responsible for INTERREG and PHARE CBC have already worked together to bring the PHARE CBC regulations and procedures as close as possible to those of the structural funds, and we are taking steps to encourage even greater harmonization and simplification of the procedures."
"Finally, as regards inter-regional co-operation, the last two calls for proposals, addressed to the territorial entities in conjunction with other bodies operating at territorial level, place the emphasis on the development of partnership, on innovation and on the exchange of knowledge and skills."
"Madam President, I realize that, although I have exceeded my time, I have not dealt with all the points raised in the motion for a resolution but have confined myself to a few of them."
"The Commission will of course review all the ideas and proposals put forward, and will reach a decision on every one of them."
"This of course will not be possible until around the end of the year, when the studies and decisions that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks will be available."
"In the meantime, I can assure you that the Commission will continue to favour a frank and constructive debate between Parliament and the Commission on cross-border and inter-regional co-operation."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"'We are not uniting any States; we are bringing people together.' These are the words of Jean Monnet, author of the Schuman Declaration of 1950."
"Policies, ladies and gentlemen, are made by people, and only if people know and understand each other, implement joint projects and share responsibility for them can sound European policies materialize."
"Europe is open, with a free single market and freedom of movement, and yet each of its national frontiers still makes its presence felt, even without customs checks and barriers."
"Cross-border and interregional cooperation is an essential means of bringing people together and solving problems by consensus."
"The motion for a resolution before us deals with cross-border cooperation in the Union."
"All regions in Europe continue to need European Community initiatives."
"Cooperation at internal borders must enable people to go about their everyday business without any problems."
"The aim is a Europe without frontiers, where communal services are available at the most convenient places."
"It is a matter of developing cross-border areas with homogeneous social and economic conditions."
"Part of this involves the creation of legal and fiscal conditions for the operation of cross-border enterprise zones, the coordination of instruments designed to promote regions and their economies on both sides of borders and crossborder social cooperation."
"This means that it should be possible to make the best possible cross-border use of facilities in order to avoid duplication of investments."
"Why must I wait for the emergency services from another part of my own country when there are emergency vehicles free just across the border? Or if the hospital across the border has a consultant who specializes in my illness, why can I only be admitted to the county hospital on my own side of the border?"
"The Myller report deals with many detailed issues."
"It highlights good points and problem areas."
"In the quest for more common ground in Europe, these problem areas must be eliminated."
"There are many positive features in this report, but also some areas where we should proceed with caution."
"The call for 'the creation of legal and fiscal preconditions for the operation of cross-border business areas' is simply likely to clash with the national rules in this sector."
"For example, we cannot introduce cross-border tax and legal rules in one part of southern Denmark, just because it is a border area."
"For this reason, I shall abstain from voting."
"I would also point out that regions consisting of parts of more than one country should be established taking full account of local circumstances."
"There are different backgrounds - political, historical and cultural."
"We therefore cannot lay down standard models for regional cooperation."
"In Denmark, we have this problem close to home in the Danish-German border area, where even the title given to the cooperation has created difficulties."
"It seems neither natural nor easy on the ear to call this the 'Euroregion Schleswig/Slesvig' ."
"Here too, the subsidiarity principle must be applied."
"The way to succeed is to create a psychological and popular climate which encourages cross-border cooperation, and then to give this a name which suits local conditions."

"The next item is the debate on the oral question (B4-0166/97-0-0053/97) to the Commission, tabled by Mr Arias Cañete on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on an integrated policy for the specific situation of the insular regions in the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, deputizing for the Chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, I have been asked on behalf of our Committee to deal with a question to which we attach particular importance."
"It is the question of islands and the position they occupy, or rather ought to occupy, within the framework of the European Union's various policies."
"Having myself been born and grown up on a Mediterranean island, Crete, I know very well and at first hand all the vital problems faced by an island, precisely because of its insular character. I know very well the difficulties created by isolation, first and foremost among which is the dependence of the island and its dwellers for their economic development, social survival and medical care, on often uncertain and usually inadequate sea and air transport."
"I know very well the problems of survival faced by island businesses, by far the majority of them SMEs or small companies, in their everyday efforts to compete successfully against similar businesses in mainland areas."
"The cost of importing their raw materials and exporting their products and services is much higher, and the procedures involved generally much more time-consuming."
"The necessary area for their development does not exist, and as a rule qualified personnel is lacking."
"Technological equipment and infrastructure for communications and transport are usually deficient."
"Finally, I well know the daily but important problems faced by the residents due to water shortage and the difficulty of supplying energy, inadequacies of infrastructure for health, education and culture, and the employment problems faced by young people in particular, which lead them to abandon the islands and seek their fortunes elsewhere."
"Problems and difficulties which, as is natural, ultimately bring the islands to a state of economic and social stagnation, isolation, developmental backwardness and more general downgrading."
"Besides, it is no matter of chance that islands, with very few exceptions, number among the European Union's most poor areas, as emerges clearly from a series of reports by the European Commission, from your own reports, Commissioner."
"It is also worth noting that despite the particular features of each island, the basic problems they face have much in common in all the Union's island areas, whether in the North, or in the West, or in the South, and whether we are speaking of Crete and the Aegean islands, or of the Isle of Wight, or of Sicily, or of the Balearics and the Canary Islands."
"Finally, this is no trivial issue, but one which involves a by no means insignificant number of European Union residents."
"Taking as a base the classical definition that we accept in the European Union concerning what an island is: in other words, of course, an area of land surrounded by sea, with no continuous connection to the mainland and on which the capital of the corresponding country is not located, then the European Union today comprises a total of 22 island regions making up 4.5 % of its territory and being home to 4 % of its population."
"Based on these facts, the following picture emerges: the Union's island regions constitute a significant part of its territory and are the home of a by no means negligible proportion of its population."
"Notwithstanding their respective particular features, they face in common a range of very important problems that stem precisely from their insular character and which result in their economic and social downgrading."
"In the view of our Committee, Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, this constitutes good reason for the adoption of an integrated special policy for islands within the scope of the Union's regional and other policies, aiming precisely to help them overcome their inherent difficulties by giving them equal opportunities for development with those of the Union's mainland areas."
"Besides, such a policy has been called for consistently for many years by all the European Union's island regions, and the need for it has been recognized from time to time and under various circumstances, by all the Union's institutional bodies."
"It is also a policy which safeguards free competition in practice, since it aims precisely to help islands cope with the additional disadvantages they face following the creation of the single internal market, which we should admit, often works to the disadvantage of islands."
"On that basis, then, could the Commission tell us how it views the idea of starting to give greater importance to the peculiar character of island regions?"
"Specifically, does it intend in the future to attach greater importance to improving infrastructures on islands, particularly sea and air transport?"
"Does it intend to contribute to the promotion of the sectors of agriculture, forestry and fishing, and that of alternative cultural and ecological tourism for the islands?"
"Will it take all necessary steps to enable businesses on islands to compete with mainland businesses under equal conditions?"
"Mainly, however, Commissioner, how does the Commission react to the idea of including in the revised treaty that will emerge from the Intergovernmental Conference, an order recognizing the particular nature of island regions, and the problems they face in common, which could in the future constitute the legal base for the implementation of an integrated Community policy that is essential if islands are to escape isolation, overcome their structural difficulties and claim a better future within the framework of United Europe."
"In the hope of a positive reply from the Commission to all these questions by our Committee, which are at the same time called for by Europe's island regions, I thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, the Commission recalls that in 1994 it published a document on the island regions which made it possible, simultaneously, to uncover the wealth represented by the diversity of the islands within the Community and to gain a better understanding of their socio-economic situation."
"That document sets out, for each Member State, a complete list of islands, with maps and statistics, a description of the level NAZ 2 and NAZ 3 island regions, and a brief analysis of the territory and of the economic situation of all the other islands."
"With regard to the Community appropriations currently allocated to the islands within the Union, I must emphasize that the majority of the large islands within the Community are eligible for Structural Funds subsidies, mainly under Objective 1."
"This applies to the seven outermost regions - the Canaries, the Azores, Madeira, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion - and also to Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and all the Greek islands."
"Under this heading, cofinancing is possible for investments in sea and air transport infrastructures."
"The Cohesion Fund can also cofinance transport infrastructures in the islands of the eligible Member States."
"The island regions can thus benefit from the investments in the trans-European networks."
"For the new planning period, the Commission shortly expects to present the document 'Agenda 2000' , which will include the future financial perspectives (Santer package), the broad guidelines for the future reform of the Structural Funds and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and the opinions on the CEECs which are candidates for accession."
"For the island regions, as for the other regions of the Union, the aim is to guarantee the sustainable development of those regions in which sufficient convergence has not been achieved."
"In order to stem the tide of depopulation and to prevent the desertification of the island regions, and of all rural areas, the Commission intends not only to sustain and promote agriculture, forestry, fishing and aquaculture but also, on the basis of an integrated approach, to promote economic diversification, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and rural services, the management of natural resources, improved services relating to the environment, and the valorization of the cultural heritage, tourism and recreational activities."
"The Commission agrees about the need to combat the excessive burden placed on natural resources by certain forms of tourism, in the island regions and elsewhere."
"The proposal for a decision on a first multi-annual programme in favour of European tourism - PHILOXENIA - takes the promotion of sustainable tourism and of alternative forms of tourism as one of its primary themes."
"The Commission hopes that the Council will be able to make rapid progress towards adopting the decision to which I have referred."
"On the other hand, tourism is also referred to in the fifth programme for the environment, 1992-2000, as one of the five key sectors not only at the regulatory level but also in terms of self-regulation by the public, operators and public authorities, by means of instruments to encourage sustainable tourism."
"Finally, several projects - LIFE, NATURE - encompass measures to promote ecological tourism."
"The Commission understands the desire of the island regions to enjoy the benefits of a consistent approach; in the Commission's view, their specific nature should be pointed out to the Community legislator whenever necessary."
"This, in any case, is the line which the Commission pursues in its proposals."
"Finally, as regards the present Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission is supporting the possibility of adding a declaration on the island regions to the revised Treaty."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my satisfaction at the Commissioner's statement that he understands the particular nature of island regions and supports the inclusion in the new Treaty of a statement which will constitute the correct legal basis for the establishment and implementation of a special policy of support and development in island regions."
"We are convinced that conditions have really matured and that everybody understands the need to adopt an integrated European policy and development strategy for the European Union's island regions."
"A policy that will deal effectively with structural inequalities between the Union's island and mainland regions."
"As one who comes from Greece, a country comprising 42 % of the total number of inhabited islands in the European Union - 167 inhabited islands among a total of 400 in the Union - I am in a position to know how urgent it is that measures should be adopted to curb the negative trends created by the isolation of island regions and their abandonment by the Union."
"Of course, the problems differ from one island to another, and in many cases those differences are both great and critical."
"Yet, for a large number of islands, mainly those of small and medium size, the economic and demographic base has been weakened, I would say, to desperate levels."
"Important constituents of an integrated policy for island regions and of a strategy for sustainable development must include improved transport infrastructure, the development of advanced telecommunication networks, measures to support SMEs and to boost employment, combined developmental choices to encourage local production and the local economy with interventions on behalf of agriculture and tourism, the correct management of natural and in particular water resources, the promotion of special measures to increase investment and favourable taxation measures for permanent residents, modernization and in exceptional cases coverage of the needs of local administration with trained personnel, integrated interventions in social infrastructure, especially education and health, and the creation of networks of small islands, with action on the protection of the environment."
"We also need a broad programme of legislative intervention and special projects to make the most of and to protect the natural beauty and cultural wealth of our islands, the refurbishment of traditional housing, the protection of the sea, the management of water, sewage and wastes, and the creation of conditions leading to democratic recovery and steady development."
"Today, the European Parliament is called upon to transmit a message of solidarity by its practical recognition of the need for direct promotion of a policy for the survival of our islands."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am an elected representative of the two largest islands in the Union which are not home to a European capital city - Sicily and Sardinia - and I must therefore express my continuing regret at the lamentable absence of any integrated Community policy or specific instruments for the European island regions, confronted as they are by an extremely wide range of problems which continue to act as a permanent obstacle to their development."
"I therefore repeat once again, in this House today, my hope that in future, and starting with the forthcoming Amsterdam summit, the Council will turn over a new leaf and consider the specific problems of the Union's islands from a new standpoint, a more considered and specific standpoint, as indeed I understand the Commission also wishes to do when considering the matter of the reform of the Structural Funds."
"I am glad to take the opportunity offered by Commissioner Monti's presence to emphasize the fact that a new common policy for the benefit of the island regions should also be designed to give these disadvantaged territories a genuine opportunity to complete the internal market and the process of integration, beginning with full implementation of the fundamental principle of freedom of movement for individuals and goods; this is something that has not yet been given concrete form, so much so that, despite the fact that Article 129b of the Treaty stresses the need to link the island regions to the central regions of the Community, we have yet to see any concrete measures taken to ease the problems that island status creates with regard to transport."
"The European Union cannot impose its own policies - transport, fiscal harmonization, the agricultural policy itself, fisheries - in a uniform manner that also includes the islands and island groups that experience extremely difficult economic development situations because of their limited agricultural and water resources and the limited availability of skilled labour."
"Instead, it should implement ad hoc systems and measures tailored to the specific features typical of, and shared by, the island regions of the European Union."
"What is needed, therefore, is a global Community policy for the islands, taking into account all the aspects of island status."
"The objective of a European policy for the islands should be both to establish a general framework of compensation for the adverse effects that Community policy often has on the island regions, and secondly, more generally, to establish a new way of thinking that recognizes the right of islands and island groups to diversity."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the principal objectives of Community policy and in particular of regional policy is economic and social cohesion within the European Community."
"This aim, based on the fundamental principle of solidarity, entails taking into consideration the specific features noted at the levels and in the models for development of the European regions."
"Thus certain areas of the Community territory have their limitations which lead to imbalances affecting their development."
"That is the case with island regions."
"These regions are well and truly an integral part of the European Union."
"They represent approximately 14 million European citizens, that is a population greater than that of certain Member States."
"The Europe of the islands is not merely a theory, but rather a human, cultural, economic and social reality."
"We must then ask ourselves whether the concept of the single European area is relevant for the islands which, as they are isolated and out of touch, inevitably labour under manifold spatial and human limitations."
"That explains why numerous rules of economics designed within and for the great continental units cannot in fairness be applied to the island regions without corrective mechanisms."
"Widely varying conditions are of course found throughout the islands of the European Union and yet however, above and beyond that diversity, how can we avoid noticing a great similarity within development problems, such as the narrowness of the economic market, environmental conservation and transport costs, even within the social conditions of the peoples linked to the concept of being cut off and limited in space."
"How can we think of regional planning in purely continental terms?"
"The island regions need research into appropriate differentiated treatments."
"Their future depends upon it, but so too does the future of Europe."
"For several years past the Union's island regions have been trying to make their voice heard ever more clearly and with greater solidarity."
"Let us mention the Committee on the Islands - CRAM 6, the European Parliament's Eurisles group, the Imedoc Protocol, the Baltic island group, to name but a few."
"Faced with that the European Union has not to date come up with any global approach to the problems underscored by the island regions."
"The REGIS programme has of course been set up and in this connection."
"We must repeat that taking account of the problems of island regions is not an alternative to the search for solutions to the problems of the outermost regions."
"Quite the reverse."
"The two processes are perfectly complementary."
"It would be fitting to set up a truly integrated policy for the island regions with the collaboration of the Member States and the regional authorities on the principle of partnership."
"That will have to be based on the laying of a legal foundation, that is the inclusion in the Treaty of Union of an appended clause or statement recognising the special features and the need to tackle them by means of tailored policies and provisions."
"The island regions are a good illustration of the challenge facing the whole of Europe - moving towards a stronger Community with more harmonious development and greater solidarity."
"That certainly entails, over and above the legal and economic aspects, a political type of imperative."
"I could not end, Mr Commissioner, without expressing my pleasure on hearing your proposals a few moments ago in which you expressed the view of the Commission which would, you mentioned, support the inclusion in the annex to the new treaty of a specific statement on the arrangements for island regions."
"That would constitute a legal basis for the setting up of an integrated policy having regard to the actual specific features of these regions which are very dear to our hearts."
"We are grateful to you."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the last plenary session in Brussels the European Parliament agreed that it was necessary to incorporate the status of outermost region with full legal backing in the future treaty."
"The manifold and permanent handicaps of the outermost regions arise from their island status but are exacerbated by their remoteness from other regions of continental Europe and, similarly, other island regions."
"Although we cannot and must not confuse this with the actual situation of the outermost island regions, there is in the European Union, and particularly in the Mediterranean, a different type of island reality which we are dealing with today, much less pronounced because inter alia it is significantly alleviated by much shorter distance and isolation - often a great deal less, frequently not very significant."
"This is a matter of a different reality fundamentally resulting from being cut off and the scarcity of certain resources and that naturally presents a specific joint framework warranting an integrated and differentiated approach on the part of the European Union."
"An integrated and differentiated approach is needed for the island problem as a whole, without detracting from the essential attention to the widely varying stages of development seen throughout the island territories, because the European Union must provide specific responses to the different situations which occur within its territory."
"Therefore, in support of the principle of economic and social cohesion, we uphold and support the motion for a political resolution which this House will no doubt approve."
"Madam President, I, like previous speakers, welcomed what Mr Monti said, pointing out that as long ago as 1994 the Commission presented a document on the islands. He mentioned, moreover, a whole series of programmes which dealt with the islands, above all the Agenda 2000 of the Filoxenia Programme to enable these regions to develop for the purposes of tourism."
"Most interesting I find Mr Monti's statement that it would be appropriate to include, provided the Commission were in favour, a statement by the Intergovernmental Conference on the subject of the islands in general."
"The Commissioner has heard what previous speakers have said, for example Mr Baggioni, Mr Viola and Mr Karamanou, and I should simply like to take this opportunity to point out to him that there are two possible approaches to the problems bound up with island status."
"What I would call the 'incrementalist' approach which consists in the analysis of given programmes or activities, and then, as Mr Baggioni mentioned, an approach which places the accent upon a certain political imperative which is linked to the fundamental geographical reality of the islands."
"The Commissioner will realise that some of the poorest regions in the Union, such as Corsica or the Azores are indeed island regions."
"The only island region among the relatively rich regions is the Balearic Islands, Spain, which come close to the Community average with 98 % of the average income, but there are not in fact any island regions which are highly developed."
"This is because, from the point of view of the economic structure, the whole concept of the European Union is based on a continental idea, that is the model for the building of Europe is the North American continental model like a kind of great rectangle over which there is uninterrupted territorial continuity. This continental territory lends itself to the establishment of a series of lines of communication based for example on the train, great motorways and of course on the elimination of all barriers to trade."
"But there is one barrier - one customs due - which must be paid if the sea needs to be crossed."
"I am not of course referring to large islands such as the United Kingdom or Ireland, but in general to the rest of the island regions and Mr Commissioner Monti will actually agree with me that Sardinia and Sicily in his country are the poorest regions precisely because they are islands and without that continental continuity there is a whole range of structural elements standing in the way of definitive integration in the common market."
"That is, the continental concept of the common market as a continuous territory which is a prerequisite for example for banning transport aid in order to put everyone on an equal footing, means that unless islands receive some kind of transport aid they are placed at a disadvantage from the point of view of competition."
"Island regions have specific needs and the Commissioner, who is a cultivated man, will recall how in Greek literature there are two basic fundamental great works the Iliad telling of the conquest of Troy and the Odyssey describing Ulysses's efforts to get back home and in practical terms, the tasks facing Ulysses are greater than those required to conquer Troy."
"That is, the island context presents certain specific difficulties which cannot be overcome."
"I agree with Mr Monti that the appropriate sphere for launching an in-depth debate on the islands which is not merely an 'incrementalist' debate dealing with little bits of aid here and there, is precisely a statement by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I think that the Intergovernmental Conference should face the European Union and the Community institutions with a debate on the role of the islands."
"I know that Mr Monti is concerned about one matter and I should like to quote it as an example, since I think it is the best example of what might happen - we are moving towards Economic and Monetary Union, internal frontiers are disappearing, from 1999 there will be no barriers to prevent a French citizen or a German citizen from putting his savings in a Luxembourg bank where there is no tax on savings."
"That is relevant for anyone living on the continent of Europe who can simply get into a car or hitch hike to take his savings to a Luxembourg bank, but I do not think anyone will feel inclined - unless he has many millions - to take an aeroplane for example from a regions such as the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe or Martinique to place modest savings in a Luxembourg bank."
"That is when all is said and done a great disincentive."
"That brings me, Mr Commissioner, on to one last aspect;"
"I think that within the context of treatment for the islands, although basically the islands have aspects in common, they are different one from another."
"I mentioned earlier the example of the Balearic Islands, currently the richest region in Spain and an island region."
"Both the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands have for centuries formed part of the same political entity - Spain."
"Whereas the Balearic Islands have developed to a considerable extent, the Canary Islands have rather lagged behind, because there is one additional aspect: in the European Union there are, in addition to what might be termed the nearby islands which form part of the immediate environment, the unusual aspect of some very distant island regions - the French overseas departments and territories, the Portuguese archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Island of La Réunion, which are so remote from the Community umbrella that unless they are given quite different legal treatment there can be no possibility of economic development."
"As regards these outermost regions, Madam President, Mr Commissioner, it is not enough for the IGC merely to make a statement as it did for the last Maastricht Conference."
"I think a highly specialized regime is called for and it is currently being drawn up thanks on the one hand to the POSEI programmes, to Protocol No 2 annexed to the Treaty of Accession to the European Union of Spain and Portugal and to a whole series of Community legal standards which have considered this special situation of the outermost regions."
"I think that the European Union should now consider for these island regions with additional difficulties a legal system which is not based on secondary legislation of simple regulations or directives which are then open to challenge before the Court of Justice, but on constitutional treatment in the Treaty establishing the Union."
"It must be remembered that France already envisaged such constitutional treatment when the first European Union Treaties were signed - the Treaty of Rome 1957 - since there is a specific reference to the French overseas territories."
"Although Spain and Portugal joined later and could not therefore include the point in the original Treaty, the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal did envisage this specific point in a document which we might regard as constitutional from our point of view - and that is Protocol No 2 and other articles in the Act of Accession of spain and Portugal to the European Union."
"I therefore hope, Madam President, Mr Commissioner, that today's debate will serve on the one hand to establish the need to consider the subject of the islands in its global perspective and on the other and in a very special way, to stress the effort needed in this final stage of the Intergovernmental Conference, so that the outermost regions of the European Union receive different legal treatment so that they may be regarded as a special case."
"I stress for example the tax aspect."
"The harmonization of Community taxation, which is important and essential, does not necessarily need to be extended to outermost regions of the Union."
"(ES) Madam President, I fully concur with what Mr Medina Ortega said and I shall not go further into those matters for reasons of time."
"But as regards what Mr Monti said in his speech, I should like to mention two matters:"
"On the one hand I am glad to hear that the Commission is supporting a statement in favour of the islands and, on the other hand, I should like to point out that, despite its statements about the Cohesion Fund as an instrument for helping the islands, the Cohesion Fund is not being implemented; there is practically zero implementation in the 22 island regions of the Union."
"The islands are part of the European heritage."
"European culture and history would not be the same without the contribution of its islands."
"For continental Europe island is synonymous with holidays, but behind an attractive exterior, which is a shop window for a tourist attraction, islands have a series of problems common to them all, as has been mentioned here."
"In this Parliament's Joint Group on the Islands which I have the honour to chair, Members from all nations and of all shades of political opinion have had no difficulty in establishing arrangements for diagnosing joint problems affecting us caused by the sea."
"The sea is a bond for peoples only as far as poets are concerned."
"We island dwellers know very well that the sea separates and causes a multitude of problems: transport, communications, energy delicacy of the region with specific environmental problems, added business expenses, delicate economy."
"It is not by chance that almost all European island regions are Objective 1."
"The only fundamental obsessions which I have heard in the Commission for a specific policy for the islands are budgetary and no doubt very important ones."
"But the islands cannot benefit on an equal footing from the advantages of the great internal market nor take part in most of the projects in the great trans-European networks."
"It would therefore be fitting if such comments as Mr Monti's were to give rise to a new Union vision of the problems facing island regions."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Madeira, Porto Santo and the Azores are island regions which particularly feel the lack of a special scheme and specific support mechanisms within the framework of the European Union."
"But they are also for Community purposes outermost regions."
"We want to obtain the best possible treatment for these islands in order to offset the disadvantages caused by their island status and to promote equality of opportunity for their inhabitants."
"But we do not accept that the Community concept of outermost region should become diluted in the concept of island region. The fact is that the outermost island regions, because of their remoteness from the continent of Europe, are faced with more disadvantages than islands in general."
"We shall not therefore accept any compromising of the progress already made as regards the guaranteeing of special treatment for the outermost regions by the lumping together in the the IGC, in the future Treaty and in the resultant decision-making process, of all islands even if they are close to mainland Europe and more prosperous than many continental regions."
"I should therefore like first to register the strongest protest against the Netherlands Presidency's proposal (made within the IGC) on the outermost regions, since it does not provide guarantees for the special situation of these exceptional European regions in its clear attempt to exclude the French overseas dominions and territories; secondly to insist that the IGC should follow the European Parliament's position on the IGC based on the Weggen report, in particular the twelfth paragraph of point 3 in which Parliament demands that the Treaty should expressly include a provision conceding special and specific treatment for outermost regions; thirdly to ask for the recognition and effective support for problems arising out of island status which are felt particularly in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores which are outermost regions."
"Thus, as already indicated, I have no alternative but to vote against this motion for a resolution in order to avoid supporting the attempt to dilute the outermost regions with island regions as a whole."
"Madam President, the text of the resolution makes it clear that the insular regions of Europe, be they in north or south, are facing great environmental and economic challenges, and that is why the European Union must do more to ensure that these areas are not left alone to deal with their problems."
"Above all, the island regions must be incorporated into the sort of physical planning strategy that is currently being developed within the EU."
"The adoption of a European regional planning strategy in Noordwijk in June 1997 will constitute a major step in this direction."
"We shall then see whether the responsible parties in the Commission, and above all in the national governments, are capable of incorporating the reality of island life into this European planning strategy."
"Pie in the sky, many will say, and probably with some justification, for it would require more action in the domain of structural policy in particular than we have seen so far."
"The European Union needs to do more in three core areas while strictly observing the principle of subsidiarity."
"Maritime borders have hitherto played a minor role in the promotion of cross-border cooperation."
"Only Sardinia and Corsica and the Danish island of Bornholm were part of Interreg I. That is why it is gratifying that the Commission has included considerably more programmes in Interreg II which affect maritime borders and islands."
"Keep it up!"
"Interregional cooperation programmes such as Recite are also very important to the islands."
"In addition to fostering normal neighbourly relations, they also serve as a means of sharing experiences that are relevant to other island communities."
"The creation of networks enables island communities to discuss common problems and to come up with ways of solving them."
"That must also be encouraged in the framework of other policies."
"I am thinking particularly of the information society, from which the islands must not be excluded, since modern communication technology is the very thing that can help them to overcome their peripheral situation."
"For that reason, I commend the idea that the House should compile a report on coastal and island regions on its own initiative and that the report - or both reports, if we treat each type of region separately - should be tabled for discussion by the House as quickly as possible."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too represent an island region - the Balearic Islands - which although Mr Medina has said on various occasions have a high average income, do have the disadvantage of being dependent solely on tourism, which is very dangerous for future sustainability; they are also in a critical geographical situation in a none-too-stable Mediterranean."
"Nevertheless, despite the great diversity which exists between the 22 European island regions, they all have features in common because they are surrounded by the sea and they will be particularly affected by globalization and the process of European integration."
"They therefore need special attention to enable them to become integrated not so much homogeneously as in a balanced way."
"The extra effort which these island regions need to make is a millstone round their necks and round the necks of their businesses which, in an ever more competitive and global context see their survival and the opportunities for job creation under threat."
"The limited amount of space requires great pains to protect the natural environment and makes these regions susceptible to phenomena such as variations in air and sea transport, an interruption in the supply of essential products, provision of drinking water, water treatment and the management and recycling of solid waste."
"Recognition of island status in the new Treaty would be an advantage for a framework for cooperation between the European islands for the drawing up of an integrated policy, pilot projects and specific actions for the sustainable development of the islands."
"A strengthening of the information systems and networks on the islands would break down barriers to education and training."
"As regards tourism as an economic alternative for the islands, as rapporteur for the Filoxenia programme, I ask you, Mr Commissioner, to intimate to the Council the need to unblock this programme - an essential point for the drawing up of a strategy for tourism in the medium term."
"The island regions also need the progress of the information society for their qualitative growth and progress with renewable energy sources to make them less dependent on traditional energy sources."
"And although the natural and cultural heritage is important for the whole of Europe, for the islands it is the sole asset for their development, for recovering and maintaining their countryside."
"It is an essential for survival."
"Recognition of island status in the Treaty would be the basis for putting right the structural disadvantages of some regions which are different, of promoting their sustainable growth, of maintaining and encouraging local selfdevelopment and finally, without prejudice to the continental regions, of achieving an equilibrium between economic efficiency, social equality and environmental conservation."
"Madam President, I just wanted to say how interesting I have found this debate on the island regions and the outermost regions of the Community."
"I have noted what seemed to me to be positive reactions to my statement; and I have also appreciated the considerations linking this subject to the single market and to economic and monetary union, and the idea just advanced that the development of the information society, which we were discussing earlier this morning, can in turn do something to overcome the disadvantages of the island and outermost regions."
"Finally, with reference to the comment that has been made on the fact that very little use is made of the Cohesion Funds to benefit the island regions, I must remind the House that this is one of those instances in which the attitude of the Member States is of crucial importance, so that, as regards many aspects of the problem, we are in their hands in this respect."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Joint motion for a resolution on an integrated policy adapted to the special situation of island regions in the European Union."
"The reason for the resolution is to put pressure on the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce a special clause into the Treaty which will require special treatment and greater flexibility for islands compared with other regions so far as the introduction of EU policy is concerned."
"The Committee for Regional Policy will very shortly be developing in earnest a report on the development problems of islands."
"We agree that there is a need for a flexible approach and a regional application of EU policy; but that it should be enacted only when urgently needed and under specific conditions, for example in the island regions: but we also have mountainous regions, arctic regions and regions on the very periphery of the EU."
"Why should islands be considered more sensitive to the negative effects of EU policy and be given special legal status?"
"How are we going to decide on the size of island regions?"
"Are we also to have a special legal status for Ireland, Aspö and Pantelleria?"
"We ought to concentrate on the real problem and realise that EU policy often prevents social and financial development."
"To approve a special status to just a few regions is a bad way of keeping an unsuccessful EU policy alive."
"The EU's vision of unrealistic social and financial development could cause an unjustified increase in expectation and rivalry between other regions."
"We therefore cannot vote for this resolution which requests special legal status solely for islands."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"International Registration of Marks"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0090/97, tabled by Mr Medina Ortega on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0372 - C4-0651/96-96/0198(CNS)) amending Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trade mark to give effect to the accession of the European Community to the Protocol relating to the Madrid Agreement concerning the International Registration of Marks, adopted at Madrid on 27 June 1989.-A4-0092/97, tabled by Mr Medina Ortega on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a Council Decision (COM(96)0367 - C4-0554/96-96/0190(CNS)) approving the accession of the European Community to the Protocol relating to the Madrid Agreement concerning the International Registration of Marks, adopted at Madrid on 27 June 1989."
"Madam President, there is no difficulty as regard the content of this report."
"But this Parliament has the obligation to keep public opinion and the citizens informed about what we are doing."
"Specifically I think that both the proposal for a Council decision and the proposal for a Council regulation on the Community system for trademarks and, to be more specific, getting involved with the system for international marks, is of considerable legal interest."
"Unlike other legal institutions which date back to Roman times or to the Code Napoléon, the system of intellectual and industrial property rights developed at a great rate at the end of the nineteenth century and then, following the Paris Convention for the protection of industrial property rights, one aspect of industrial property rights became the protection of trademarks, governed by the 1991 Madrid Agreement."
"Account had perhaps not been taken when the Madrid Agreement was approved of the economic consequences which it would entail."
"But at the moment the various aspects of intellectual property rights ranging from copyright to the plastic arts and the performing arts to industrial property rights proper - that is the system of patents - I would say that in economic terms, in this age of mass production and the information society, the system for protecting an intangible right such as a right to a trademark has is of paramount importance."
"Let us think only of Coca Cola."
"Whatever may be in the Coca Cola bottle, the mere mark Coca Cola has inestimable economic value."
"That is to say that nowadays a mark alone may have earning potential and take on its on underlying importance, since the mark has developed and acquired its own strength, its own significance and constitutes a point of reference for legal aspects."
"Trademark law has been developing very slowly, since marks were not regarded as a very worthy subject for detailed study, although with the development of industrial society it became more important as the mark itself gained importance."
"At the moment, ever since the 1980s, there has been a kind of competition between the European Community and International Law in general."
"To be specific, the European Community in its first Community directive on the approximation of trademark law - Directive No 89104 of 21 December 1988 - paved the way for the setting up of Community trademark law and was complemented by Regulation 4094 of 20 December 1993 setting up the Community mark."
"That is, it presupposes Community intervention in an area of private law with the recognition of an actual legal title which is granted in return for inscription in a Community register; this Community register has already been in operation since 1 April 1996 - the Office for the Harmonization of the Internal Market - in the Spanish town of Alicante."
"That means that the here the Community has not followed the path of a certain general harmonization, but has moved into substantive Community law."
"At the same time there were developments taking place in the international system for marks with the setting up on the one hand of the Stockholm Agreement, which amended the Madrid Agreement above all by setting up the World Industrial Property Organization with its head office in Geneva with a number of registration offices allowing for a certain degree of international collaboration and a certain efficiency in international mechanisms which did not exist previously."
"Along these very lines, again in Madrid in 1995, a protocol was adopted making it easier for international organizations of a regional nature and with their own system, such as is the case with the European Union, as opposed to signatory States, to accede to the Madrid Agreement."
"This 1995 Madrid Protocol also enabled international organizations to take part in the international system for the protection of marks."
"It must be pointed out that there is one fundamental difference - that is that the Community citizen who registers his mark in the European Union through the Office for Harmonization of the Internal Market obtains a substantive right, whereas the international agreement, the Madrid Agreement merely sets in motion a procedure under which, by means of registration with the World Intellectual Property Organization, the registration is automatically made in a series of national offices, so there is no need to go from place to place."
"In any event it would be in the Community's interests to link the two systems."
"That is to say that had the Madrid Agreement not been amended by the 1995 Madrid Protocol, anyone holding a Community mark would have had to go to the national system and then to the international system, but as a result of the Madrid Protocol, international coverage can be obtained for the mark by going through the Community office rather than on some peregrination."
"At the present time all the Member States of the European Community are party to the Madrid Protocol and are of course governed by the Rule of Community Law and they are not the only ones; in addition many more countries who are hoping to join the European Union or who form part of the European economic area have also acceded to the Madrid Protocol."
"This produces very positive results which will be exceptionally helpful to the development of the Community mark."
"The approval mechanism might appear a little complicated since on the one hand we have the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation 4094 to make it possible to interlink the two systems - the Community system and the international system - and on the other hand the Council decision approving Community accession. That is accession of the Council and of the European Community to the Madrid Protocol and subsequently, as a result of this accession to the Madrid Protocol, Community law in force will be amended by a regulation in order to resolve the whole matter."
"There is one small problem from the point of view of languages, since more languages are used in the Office for Harmonization of the Internal Market in Alicante than in the Madrid Agreement. To be precise the Madrid Agreement uses only English and French."
"This raises a few minor problems of a technical nature which will not, however, make any difficulties for harmonization."
"It is a subject which will probably require subsequent legal adjustment since experience tells us that all these legal matters, especially those with such important economic consequences, always prove to have different aspects and difficulties which have to be put right."
"I therefore think that the rapporteur, having considered both the regulation and the proposal for a regulation and the proposal for a Council decision in detail, finds once again that the Community institutions are operating correctly."
"May this prove to be to the advantage of the Community's citizens, and as a result of the harmonization may the Community mark be better protected on the international scene than hitherto."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these proposals will mean that enterprises, by submitting a single application, will obtain protection for their trademark as a Community trademark, not only in the Community but in all States which are party to the Madrid Protocol."
"The Madrid Protocol provides for the international registration of trademarks to be effected by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva."
"So if the European Community accedes to the Madrid Protocol, which we should welcome, applicants for and holders of Community trademarks will be able to apply for international protection of their trademarks by submitting an international application in accordance with the provisions of the Madrid Protocol, and holders of trademarks which have been internationally registered on the basis of the Madrid Protocol will be able to apply for registration of their marks as Community trademarks."
"Consequently, these two systems are mutually complementary and will result in simplification on the basis of two systems becoming one."
"I should also like to subscribe to this idea of making two into one."
"We do not need two speeches on this subject."
"I can associate myself entirely with what Mr Medina Ortega has already said, so I shall spare the House the other two minutes of speaking time, which will be my gift to the House as a contribution to the quality of life here and as a foretaste of the working of the Holy Spirit this coming Pentecost Sunday."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I offer my warmest congratulations and thanks to Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee, and especially to Mr Medina Ortega as the rapporteur, for the quality of the reports presented here today."
"I am very glad to note that all the efforts that have led up to this sitting have demonstrated, through the broad consensus achieved, that the various institutions have understood the importance of supporting the Commissions's proposals that are now under discussion, proposals that have been adopted virtually unanimously and without amendment by the Legal Affairs Committee, the Committee on External Economic Relations and the Economic and Social Committee, and that have also been broadly supported by the Council's working group, and have enjoyed the support of the Community's industries."
"On the other hand, the two proposals on which Parliament has been consulted today are not the subject of conflict, in so far as they are confined to the establishment of a link between the Community trade mark system and the international registration system set up by the Madrid protocol; two systems which, in essence, pursue the same objectives, though by different means, two systems which need to be harmonized and made compatible."
"The Commission has no doubt that, unless such a link with the Madrid protocol can be established, the Community trade mark, adopted in December 1993 and operational - as the rapporteur recalled - since April 1996, would become less attractive both to European enterprises and to those in third countries."
"They might prefer either the international system, which is less favourable, or the national systems with all the attendant risks of fragmentation of the internal market."
"Apart from being a setback for the completion of the internal market, this would constitute a serious problem for European industry."
"I therefore thank Parliament in advance for the support it intends to offer for these two closely linked proposals, and I once again congratulate Mr Medina Ortega for the skilful contribution he has, once again, made in a matter that is so important for the legal system, the economy and, ultimately, the citizens of the European Union."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(In successive votes Parliament adopted the legislative resolutions.)"
"Madam President, perhaps this is outrageous cheek but I want to place on record that at the beginning of the week I raised the matter of a Belgian Government report which looked at religious sects."
"I want to add two points which are not related to this Parliament but are related to my constituency."
"One of the groups named in the report is an organization called Operation Mobilization, the headquarters of which are in Shropshire, which is part of my constituency."
"I want to assure the House that, contrary to the Belgian Government report, it is a respectable missionary organization."
"I would also like to say a word about a group called Youth with a Mission."
"My wife was a missionary for this group before I came here."
"That too is a respectable organization."
"Both these organizations are deeply distressed that the Belgian Government report contains malicious lies about their operation."
"Thank you, Mr Hallam."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting closed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 16 May 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the previous part-session have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I regret that I have to protest again to the plenary - as I also had to do last time, in Strasbourg - at the burning, in Montpellier, yesterday, of a lorry from Murcia, bound for Russia, with a load of chewing gum."
"What is occurring is very serious and I would like you to intervene to restore the freedom of circulation of goods."
"Thank you, Mr Marset, we shall take note of this protest and, of course, it will be passed on at once."
"Mr President, the first item on the order of business is a communication from the Commission on urgent political matters of major importance."
"I wish to raise a matter which has been excluded from the agenda, namely the question of Norwegian salmon dumping and the salmon subsidy."
"The Norwegians have been proved guilty and the penalty should be notified by the end of this week."
"I want to the Commissioner to tell us what is happening."
"We have heard nothing."
"Apparently certain committees of this House are able to place certain topics on the agenda under this item which means that ordinary Members cannot raise others."
"Mr Macartney, you know perfectly well what the rules are on the procedure for asking questions of this type."
"Mr President, you will recall that since Christmas this House has taken a special interest in the case of Roisín McAliskey who was incarcerated in Holloway Prison in England."
"She has now given birth to her baby and is out on temporary bail."
"Following the visit by Mrs d'Ancona on a personal basis, I would ask you to intervene with the new British Home Secretary to give her bail so that she can return home with her child, as evidence of the compassion that Tony Blair and the Socialists promised in this particular case during the election."
"Mr Andrews, this is not the time or way for expressing your opinions on the subject."
"I repeat that I want to know if there are any comments about the minutes of the previous part-session."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Arising from what Mr Macartney raised concerning the Norwegian salmon deal and taking into account its serious implications right across the EU, could you explain to me how, as Members, we could raise that matter and sound the alarm in this House."
"What Rule do we use?"
"How is it done?"
"Mr Killilea, you are a veteran parliamentarian and you know the rules governing the way in which you should ask questions of this kind - and this is not a point of order at this moment in time."
"However, it is not for me to have to tell you - you know the rules sufficiently well."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"I have been informed that Council commitments prevent it from being present before 5 p.m.."
"I therefore propose that we begin with the joint debate on the Christodoulou and Randzio-Plath reports at 4 p.m., and adjourn it for the debate on the European Council of 23 May 1997, and then resume it once that debate is over, i.e. between 6 and 6.30 p.m."
"Are there any objections?"
"(Parliament agreed to this proposal)"
"The Union for Europe Group and Group of the European People's Party have asked for the Tomlinson report, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament and the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the Ombudsman for the 1998 financial year, to be postponed to the June II part-session pursuant to Rule 131."
"Although they could have put their request when the debate began, I thought it more correct to consider it now, as there are more members present."
"I give the floor to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, to move the request."
"Mr President, I should like to propose on the basis of Rule 96 that you should take the Tomlinson report off today's agenda and reschedule it for the second June part-session."
"The reason for this - and I understand that Mr Pasty has tabled a similar proposal - is that it deals with a number of highly sensitive issues that were voted through in the Committee on Budgets, but which we know only ever receive a very small majority in Parliament."
"Our groups are not entirely happy with the outcome of the votes on these issues in the committee."
"Let me give you a few examples."
"Take the funding system for the political parties."
"I had understood that the group chairmen had reached agreement on a number of points which are unfortunately not included in the Tomlinson report, and we would like the chairmen and indeed the groups themselves to have the chance to discuss these in detail."
"Then there is also the proposal on the Strasbourg part-sessions, which is something we really should leave well alone, it is such a sensitive issue."
"Thirdly, and this is something else we have to consider, there is the letter we have all received from the Staff Committee, which says that the Committee on Budgets' proposals on fringe benefits could have serious consequences for staff."
"We should at least have the chance to discuss this in the groups."
"I also note that the Bureau did not vote today."
"For some reason, it was not able to."
"The coordination with the group leaders on all the proposals has also not been as it should be."
"This, together with the fact that so many of our French and Irish colleagues are not here today, is why we would urge you to postpone the report to the second part-session in June."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Group for a Europe of Nations, I should like to support this joint request."
"In addition to the reasons just given by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I should give this one: the budgetary texts are usually discussed during Strasbourg part-sessions."
"We are being asked to discuss the budgetary guideline or provisional reports here in Brussels."
"I think that we should also mention the fact that the Intergovernmental Conference is due to take a decision on the headquarters issue and we should not anticipate that decision but continue to discuss budgetary questions in Strasbourg."
"That is why my group supports this motion."
"Mr President, as you would quite rightly assume, I am going to speak against the suggestion from Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"The reasons she gave are quite spurious."
"This has been on the agenda now for some time."
"It went through the Committee on Budgets with quite a substantial majority."
"There were no problems then."
"We discovered there was a problem at 12.30 p.m. today."
"This is not the way for the House to run its business."
"(Applause from the PSE Group) As for the problems, the sensitive issues which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten talks about will still be there in June."
"I would suggest that we leave it on our agenda."
"If there are any points in that report which she disagrees with, her group can vote against them there and then and that will resolve the issue."
"(Applause from the PSE Group)"
"I put this motion to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Urgent political matters"
"The next item is the communication by the Commission on urgent political matters of major importance."
"There are two subjects: the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Turkey-Iraq relations."
"Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo"
"With the change of power in Kinshasa, the moment has come to turn back to the broader picture of the Great Lakes region and Central Africa, since none of the many crises in the region has been durably settled."
"There is a continued inter-dependence of political instability, caused by population movements, cross-border alliances and an ethnic pattern which transcends national borders."
"A daunting potential for further violent conflict and humanitarian disasters still prevails in the new Democratic Republic Congo and its nine neighbours."
"The fact that the alliance has been sucked into a political vacuum enabled the rebellion to undertake a breathtaking military campaign, but it left the alliance with a number of poorly trained and ill-disciplined new recruits and a few very loosely controlled contingents with specific ethnic characteristics, be it Banyamulenge or an independent historic origin, as the descendants of the so-called gendarmes Katangais ."
"The sharp contrasts of Kabila's humanitarian commitments on the one side, and the continuing persecution of Rwandan refugees and harassment of international aid workers on the other, show a clear lack of cohesion or a lack of communication within the alliance, notably between the top political leadership and local military commanders."
"In the present crucial phase of political reorganization in the Democratic Republic Congo, this lack of control over the armed forces can cause serious difficulties."
"Furthermore, the spill-over of the Zaire conflict into neighbouring countries could have long-term consequences, notably in Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic, where the arrival of former Rwandan soldiers risks upsetting a precarious political and military balance."
"In Congo-Brazzaville it could also jeopardize the forthcoming presidential elections if the 'armed refugees' from Rwanda and former Zaire spark off a violent campaign between the main candidates."
"In Angola the possible return of 'mercenaries' of MPLA or UNITA origin may jeopardize the peace process which has already been aborted once before by an escalation of violence in the aftermath of the 1992 elections."
"As regards Sudan, the dismantling of the rear bases of the anti-MUSEVENI opposition movements in the eastern part of former Zaire has given the Ugandan army and its Southern Sudanese allies a strategic advantage which is likely to lead to intensified fighting and increasing pressure on the regime in Khartoum."
"Thus, this conflict which has been smouldering for several decades could enter into a decisive phase and produce unexpected geo-political changes."
"In Rwanda infiltrations across the border or under the cover of refugee repatriation have led to widespread insecurity."
"In some regions close to the Congolese frontier there are daily confrontations between government troops and heavily armed guerilla groups."
"If the situation deteriorates further, it could approach low-key ethnic warfare as in the case of Burundi."
"A new and preoccupying element is the reported alliance between militias Babembe and the armed Burundi opposition, the CNDD, in South Kivu."
"It corresponds to the declared ideological aim of the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide and their Burundian sympathizers, that is to say the launching of a regional military campaign of 'Bantu' people of the Great Lakes against the presumed 'hamitic' invaders."
"In view of the critical demographic pressure in the region, the combination of this genocidal ideology and the advanced militarization of society creates an explosive political mixture."
"In the new Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Kabila announced the formation of a new government within a presidential framework."
"We had hoped for a broad-based government, including all the main political forces, presumably excluding so-called Mobutees."
"The fact that one of the main leaders of the opposition to Mobutu, Etienne Tshisekedi, has been left out, despite good arguments, has been perceived as somewhat self-defeating."
"The fact that Mr Kabila promised to produce a new constitution and hold elections within two years is quite understandable, bearing in mind that his organization is a loose organization and time is required to stabilize the country, organize it, give it a government and finally have free and fair elections."
"It is better to wait and have a good electoral process, rather than rush and have some kind of unfair and corrupt electoral process."
"Let me conclude by saying that we are extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in the region, mainly because the lack of communication between the head of the alliance and some of the military commanders in the field has led to massacres of unarmed refugees."
"That is absolutely unacceptable and the European Union has made that quite clear not only in its communique but in a recent meeting held between our envoys and the Laurent Kabila's foreign minister."
"Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro."
"You have the floor, Mr Robles Piquer."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if this explanation - which was very reasonable and balanced - has been adequately conveyed to the Council."
"I also think it is scandalous that the Council should be absent today and I think that that scandal should make us think more about the other scandal, that of the absence of Europe in the development of the drama in Central Africa."
"I should like to know whether those same arguments and description have been transmitted, with enough conviction and force, as this is a truly dramatic situation, so that, as the competent body for these matters, the Council might take appropriate measures in due time."
"It seems to me that there has been a total European vacuum here and once again that vacuum has been occupied by the US initiative."
"I should like to refer to the declaration made on 22 May 1997 by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union in which many of these elements were contained."
"I should also like to emphasize the fact that a European troika yesterday met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the new Democratic Republic of Congo and that the message sent was exactly along the lines of the statement I have just made."
"I should also like to add, for the information of the European Parliament, that this afternoon I had the opportunity to talk to President Julius Nyerere about the situation in the Great Lakes and that the Commission today held a two-hour meeting with President Nyerere to hear his wise counsel and hear the experience of someone who knows the region well."
"What steps has the Commissioner taken to freeze the assets of Mr Mobutu which are held in Member States?"
"Will the Commission take legal action in these Member States to try to recover the assets looted from that country so that they can be used for the reconstruction of the new Democratic Republic of Congo?"
"I would also ask that the Commission take note of the fact that the European people would welcome Mr Mobutu as much as they would the greatest criminal."
"He should not be given refuge in the European Union under any circumstances."
"I am afraid the Commission has not the power to do so."
"Personally, I fully agree with your sentiments."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner two questions."
"Is he not encouraged by the axis of African Governments which has been formed and is led by Uganda at this time, sharing similar political, economic and military approaches to the Great Lakes area and the problems he has described?"
"Which way does the Commission think it should best work with this axis?"
"Secondly, is the Commissioner aware that President Mandela has urged the West not to demonize Mr Kabila in Kinshasa and impressed on us that it would be suicidal for us to suggest that political parties, for instance, should be formed in Zaire at this time?"
"Does the Commissioner intend to take President Mandela's advice and agree that it is not wise for us in the West at this time to give too much advice to Mr Kabila as he tries to restore law and order in that country?"
"One must realize that in the former Zaire there were more than 100 parties and that did not contribute to democracy."
"So, I tend to agree with President Mandela and President Nyerere when they say that the top priority is law and order and stabilization."
"But, having said that, we must be sure that we are not running from a dictator into an autocratic system."
"Therefore, it is very important that a clear calendar of commitment to the constitutional process and free and fair elections should be established as soon as possible."
"We think that two years is the upper limit and we are prepared to work with the authorities there in order to make sure that all the conditions for free and fair elections are met in due time."
"Commissioner, the United States was instrumental in bringing Laurent Kabila to power in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Is the Commission planning to coordinate its own action with that of the USA, or alternatively to protest if such action were to hamper the real - and not merely nominal - process of democratization in the Congo, which we are all hoping for and which, I understand you to be saying, still hangs in the balance?"
"The role which the United States played in all the phases of the situation until Kabila took power has not been fully appreciated."
"My personal opinion is that our partners on the other side of the Atlantic helped to let the genie out of the bottle and afterwards tried somehow to put it back."
"But they did not manage."
"It was not a campaign of conquer."
"As I said in my statement, Laurent Kabila was sucked into the power vacuum which existed in former Zaire."
"Having said that, I have been keeping in contact with the United States about how it sees the situation and how we can best cooperate in order to have law, order and a democratic country."
"The European Union has already expressed its point of view and its willingness to help in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the new Democratic Republic Congo."
"But let there be no misunderstandings."
"There are some preconditions which have to be met."
"I am not prepared to sign a blank cheque."
"Commissioner, a few days ago your colleague Mrs Bonino stated that the humanitarian organizations were still unable to get to a number of places in Kivu where there were problems."
"Have there been any developments on this?"
"Secondly, you quite rightly referred to the need to restore law and order, but it must also be borne in mind that if there are problems, such as have already occurred in Kivu, for example, where the Association for the Protection of Human Rights has already had to step in, there must always be the possibility of taking action if human rights are being violated."
"What measures is the Commission planning to take here?"
"The only reason why I did not go into detail with regard to the humanitarian situation was because I had already gone three minutes over my time."
"But Emma Bonino was absolutely right in pinpointing the humanitarian problem as a dramatic one."
"We are not overstating it."
"The numbers of refugees and displaced persons, be it in Tanzania, in South Zaire or in neighbouring countries is above 600, 000 at least."
"We are talking about a number equivalent to the population of Brussels, so it is a dramatic situation."
"We were very disappointed when the local military rulers did not allow the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and other agencies to send a fact-finding mission on humanitarian needs because the conditions imposed were such that it could not be accepted."
"From the contacts we had with our special envoy who met the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo yesterday, it would seem that the difficulties have been overcome and we hope that in the very near future a fact-finding mission on the humanitarian situation and of the needs to respond to quickly will be made inside the Democratic Republic Congo."
"The financial support into the whole of the Great Lakes region over recent years has been very considerable."
"In view of change, and since much of the money was going into the refugee camps over that period of time, I would like to ask the Commissioner how he sees development in the future and where the financial aid is going to be directed?"
"Some programmes have continued, for instance in humanitarian assistance or in health programmes."
"They have continued despite the difficulties throughout the former Zaire."
"Our intention now, as I explained to this House a few months ago, is that once some peace and stability is achieved, the Commission is prepared to implement a global plan of reconstruction and rehabilitation in the Great Lakes region."
"We hope to provide a coherent plan which responds to the needs of that region."
"In the meantime we have made known to our special envoy and to the Council and now to this House that we are ready to mobilize ECU 90m in order to help the immediate needs of the Democratic Republic of Congo, providing those conditions which I mentioned earlier are met."
"I sincerely hope that before the summer this will be clarified."
"The needs are urgent and we cannot wait for the normal procedures in order to commit and disburse this money."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he will try to find out from the IMF or the World Bank about the scandalous loans granted to Mobutu, in full knowledge of the fact that they would not be properly used, because they had relevant files about the matter going back to 1988."
"Nonetheless, not only did these international bodies continue to lend him money but they even increased their loans."
"I think that we have the legal powers to carry out an inquiry because money belonging to European taxpayers also went into Mobutu's pockets."
"I would like to emphasize that the Commission is not represented in the World Bank or the IMF but Member States are."
"So I hope that our Member States will act according to your suggestion because past history should teach us some lessons for the future - I refer to lending."
"And I do not mean only to dictators but also to heavily indebted countries which have no chance of paying back the debt in a normal way."
"I gather, Commissioner - and could I please ask you to confirm - that your approach is based on one consideration and two conditions."
"The consideration is the following: clearly, in a situation such as that in the former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, where - as has been pointed out here - a major power is conspicuously present, Europe must avoid being sidelined and excluded from the relations which that country and its new government will establish in the future."
"And the two conditions being laid down - with which I agree, but which I should like you to confirm - are as follows: firstly, regardless of the timing of the elections, the process of democratization must get off to a very clear start, so that there is no need to ban political activity and parties in order to maintain law and order; and, secondly, the problem of access to areas where refugees are located must be resolved immediately, and light must obviously be shed on the massacres."
"That would appear to be the position, Commissioner."
"Apart from the fact that you did not mention the idea of having a broad-based government, you put it much better than me."
"Mr President, reference has already been made to the way in which President Mobutu's regime embezzled funds from development cooperation budgets and other sources."
"Will the Commission investigate how much European development aid funding has disappeared in Zaire?"
"Is it prepared to bring proceedings against President Mobutu if necessary in order to recover those funds from the huge assets apparently held in Switzerland, so that they can once again be made available to the people of Zaire?"
"Let me repeat - because it is important that this House knows - that the identified corruption cases, connected with Commission cooperation, are virtually nil."
"The reason is simple. The money is kept in such a way that it pays for services or work done or projects but is not fed into the beneficiaries' accounts."
"Where it happens - for instance with STABEX - there is such close control that it is virtually impossible for significant cases of corruption to take place."
"Nevertheless, we have asked our services to look at the situation closely to make sure that the money allocated to us was properly used and did not help to swell Mr Mobutu's bank accounts."
"Turkey-Iraq relations"
"Mr President, the next subject is the situation in northern Iraq."
"On 16 May this year, the European Union issued a statement about the activities of the Turkish army in northern Iraq which made it clear that, although we can understand Turkey's desire to take action against groups planning or carrying out terrorist activities, in the final analysis the only possible solution to the Kurdish problem is a political one."
"It urgently called on Turkey to demonstrate the utmost restraint, to respect human rights and to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq as soon as possible."
"The Turkish authorities indicated that it was not their intention to establish a permanent military presence in northern Iraq, and that everything had been done to spare the civilian population."
"Of course it remains to be seen whether they actually keep to their word."
"The current situation in northern Iraq is seriously hampering the humanitarian assistance that the Commission is providing for the area through the ECHO programme."
"A total of some ECU 10 million has been allocated in 1997 for projects mostly run by non-governmental organizations, often under difficult circumstances."
"This is why it is clearly essential for the Turkish army to withdraw as quickly as possible."
"It is quite clear that the situation is deteriorating in Turkey and we must all deeply regret the action the military have taken."
"Indeed, in September 1996 the European Court of Human Rights found the military guilty of a series of transgressions and only three days later Parliament tabled and adopted its famous resolution which declared that democracy and human rights activities need to be supported in Turkey."
"Alongside Piet Dankert we have been working to try to make sure that takes place."
"Given the deteriorating situation in Ankara and the possibility that the military are moving into a position towards a possible coup d'etat , what would be the position of the European Union in that event?"
"I do not know whether it is very sensible to talk here about a coup d'etat in Turkey, or to speculate on what our position would be towards it."
"Let us be quite clear about this."
"A country such as Turkey, which has tried its best in recent months to demonstrate that it qualifies, albeit in the long term, for membership of the European Union, is hardly likely to solve its internal political problems through a coup d'etat , and nor, I have to say, do I expect it to do so."
"However, this does not mean that its internal political tensions are not clearly visible from outside."
"But just as I called for a political solution to the Kurdish problem, so I would hope there is all the more reason to call for a political rather than a military solution to Turkey's internal political tensions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you know that many Members of the House made their approval of the customs union with Turkey contingent on compliance with the call for an immediate Turkish withdrawal from northern Iraq."
"The previous operation in 1995 involved 30 000 troops and around 50 tanks."
"As you are well aware, the present operation is on a much bigger scale, with the deployment of 50 000 troops, 250 tanks, F14 and F16 bombers and Cobra helicopters."
"There is no reason to expect a withdrawal in the foreseeable future."
"I should like to ask, Commissioner, whether you consider such an intervention to be compatible with international law."
"What practical steps does the Commission intend to take to compel the Turkish armed forces to withdraw? And could you please explain what you mean by saying that Turkey has been asked to exercise restraint?"
"What do you mean by restraint?"
"And how, in your opinion, can the human rights of the civilian population be effectively guaranteed?"
"As we know, this invasion of northern Iraq is not Turkey's first military action against the north of that country, where there is currently a power vacuum in the absence of any sort of normal government, where different Kurdish groups are fighting for supremacy amongst themselves and one Kurdish group, so Turkey claims, has called on Turkey to come and help it to defend itself against the PKK."
"We witnessed a similar situation a few years ago."
"Then as now, the European Union made it clear that we categorically rejected any form of terrorist action by the PKK or other groups, and that we also recognized Turkey's right to protect its own people against terrorism."
"However, in taking any such action it must abide by the rules and principles of the constitutional state and the fundamental principles of human rights and, especially where military action is involved, it must refrain from using excessive violence to achieve its objectives."
"Finally, we insisted that work must start on finding a political solution to the problem that lies at the heart of this situation, the unresolved Kurdish problem, since we do not believe in military solutions."
"I would point out to the honourable Member that there is little that we can actually force Turkey to do, but what we can do is to make it clear that the European Union and the international community are closely monitoring how this conflict is being handled, particularly as it concerns a country with which we have been holding talks on this very issue for such a long time, and which is hoping for closer relations and even further integration with the European Union."
"I hope that Turkey's ambitions in this respect will make it heed our concern about its military intervention and bring it to an end as soon as possible."
"A few weeks ago I led a delegation from my group to Ankara where we met with General Cevic Bir the deputy chief of staff of the Turkish armed forces."
"At that meeting General Cevic Bir said to us that as far as he was concerned the military had done everything they could in the Kurdish lands."
"What was needed now was a political initiative to deal with some of the problems the Kurdish people living in those areas had."
"Now just a few weeks later we see 50, 000 Turkish troops invading Northern Iraq to deal with what they claim to be the PKK terrorism in those lands."
"This reminds me of the promises we received from somebody called Tansu Ciller, then Prime Minister, now Foreign Minister of Turkey, that she was the bulwark against an Islamic Government in Turkey."
"She is now in government with an Islamic Prime Minister in Turkey."
"Would the Commissioner agree with me that this House and that the Commission and the Council have been manipulated by the Turkish military and civilian authorities and that it is incumbent on us to expose the duplicity of the Turkish Government and military for the Turkish people?"
"I think that there is little more that the European Union needs to spell out to the Turkish Government."
"Our position could not be more clear: we categorically reject any acts of terrorism by the PKK, but at the same time we will not accept the excessive use of force or systematic human rights violations in combating terrorism."
"Mrs Green mentioned the figure of 50 000 troops, but quite honestly I do not think the number is so important."
"Other independent sources talk about 30 000, while the Turkish authorities have not given any figures."
"The fact remains that this was a military incursion into neighbouring territory which is not under the control of the central authorities in Iraq."
"All I can promise is that in our regular contacts and dialogue with Turkey, we will continue to urge it to accept Parliament's position, which is that the continuing threat of PKK terrorism should be proof of the need to start talks on a political solution."
"This would also, ultimately, resolve the issue of Turkey's military intervention, which we utterly condemn."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he thinks that Turkey's activity in Iraq is an isolated, if repeated, incident or whether it is part of a general aggressive strategy by Turkey outside its borders."
"Is it just pure chance that every five or six months Turkey invades or attacks Iraq?"
"Is it pure chance that part of the Cypriot Republic has been occupied by Turkish troops for more than 20 years?"
"Is it pure chance that Greece, Turkey's neighbour, has had its territorial integrity threatened by that country?"
"Given the more general aggressiveness shown by Turkey, what are the European Union's reactions, intentions or precautions?"
"With particular reference to the Kurdish problem, the Commissioner has already referred to the terrorism carried out by the PKK but I should like to ask him whether the European Union is ready, as it did in Chechenya and Yugoslavia, to make proposals for a political solution to solve the Kurdish problem on both sides?"
"Turkey has never, either now or in the past, expressed any territorial ambitions with regard to Iraq."
"There is also no reason to assume that it has such ambitions, since these would be totally indefensible under international law."
"I prefer to assume that Turkey is simply doing what it feels it must, and using means which it feels are justified to defend itself against an undeniable PKK terrorist threat, or at least to tackle it at the root."
"The fact that it is doing this on neighbouring territory is actually only possible because of the unusual situation in Iraq, where the lack of government and central control from Baghdad since the early 1980s when the Iran-Iraq conflict began has made the northern part of the country the only place where this could happen."
"All we can really do for the Kurds and the Kurdish problem is to bring pressure to bear on the Turkish Government to start talks with the representatives of the various groups to see whether a political solution can be found."
"You know that constant efforts are being made outside Turkey to bring the groups together to consider and discuss this question."
"If I am not mistaken, another of these seminars involving various representatives is to be held in the Netherlands shortly."
"I consider the Commissioner's response to be far too weak."
"We have entered into a custom's union with Turkey."
"As part of that agreement Turkey has committed itself to fulfilling certain democratic requirements which we have stipulated."
"Since concluding the custom's union, the situation in Turkey has progressively worsened."
"We have discussed the issue time and time again and have received unsatisfactory answers from the Commissioner."
"I think it is time that we adopted a hard line towards a partner which attacks its own people in its own country and all we do is sit back and listen month after month."
"My question is: is the Commission prepared to issue a final date by which time the Turks must end their aggressive war against the Kurds?"
"If not, is the Commission prepared in such circumstances to break off the custom's union with Turkey?"
"If the honourable Member is asking us to give an ultimatum threatening to abolish the customs union, we have to ask whether this would represent any kind of real pressure, given that the European Union currently enjoys an enormous trade surplus with Turkey precisely because of the customs union."
"But quite apart from that argument, I thought the House was aware of how carefully the Commission has been evaluating and monitoring relations with Turkey over the last few years, and how it has made a number of recommendations for a multi-faceted and carefully constructed policy."
"Parliament has also expressed the wish in our discussions that all forms of financial aid or instruments should be provisionally frozen if they are not being used directly or indirectly to improve the human rights situation in Turkey."
"I therefore think it would be fairly senseless and also less effective to start hitting out wildly and threatening Turkey with even stricter sanctions if it does not end its action against the PKK terrorists within a certain period."
"However, this does not affect the political statements which the Union made earlier, or our promise to Parliament that we will continue our efforts to bring about an improvement in the situation."
"The Commissioner has just repeated what the Council of Ministers said: that there has to be a political solution to the Kurdish problem."
"However, this was flatly rejected by Mrs Ciller at the Association Council before the invasion of Iraq."
"There is currently the threat of a government crisis in Turkey, and at the same time the Commission is telling us that there are various initiatives in progress that we would certainly support, which I quite agree with."
"We are monitoring the situation very carefully."
"But when I put the Kurdish problems together with the impending problems in Turkey's internal situation, I cannot help wondering, Commissioner, whether we need some rather more drastic measures, either from the EU or from NATO, than those which are currently being taken?"
"Mr President, with all due respect to the Commissioner, Mr van den Broek, I must confess that I cannot understand how such a serious violation of international law, a violation of borders, an invasion of another country, can be excused because the Iraqi government is unable to control that part of the country."
"In the past my country has suffered from an influx of revolutionary elements from a foreign country, so to speak, but at no point was there any possibility that we could have upset the international order by ignoring frontiers."
"But if this violation by Turkey, together with its threats towards other countries, is accepted just because the Kurds have been carrying out terrorist attacks, that is giving Turkey carte blanche and I think it is an insult to the European Parliament to suggest that violations of this kind can be acceptable."
"I hope that Parliament still agrees that no matter how justified the political claims are, we cannot in any way support the PKK's separatism, although we could support some kind of recognition of cultural identity."
"However, even where such claims are justified, we will continue to reject categorically and absolutely the use of terrorism in the pursuit of them, and it must be generally recognized now that the PKK is guilty of this."
"People in Parliament ask me what else we can do to bring pressure to bear on Turkey."
"Both Mr Dankert and Mr Lambrias know that tremendous diplomatic and political pressure is being applied in talks with Turkey at present to try to find a breakthrough in the troubled relations between Greece and Turkey and to resolve the disputes in the Aegean Sea."
"A huge political and diplomatic offensive is being carried out to try to persuade the two communities on Cyprus, or at least the Cyprus Government and the Turkish Cypriots, to come to the negotiating table by the middle of this year to start talks on a political solution for Cyprus."
"Thirdly, in our discussions with Turkey, we are constantly trying to ensure that the new legislation on the promotion and protection of human rights which Turkey promised would be introduced is actually enacted and adopted by the Turkish parliament."
"I hope, therefore, that the honourable Members will believe me when I say that we are already stepping up pressure on Turkey to bring about improvements in all these areas."
"I would simply point out that when it comes to the Kurdish problem, which I freely admit to Mr Dankert is not really viewed as a problem by the Turks, who see the terrorism as the problem, but not the Kurdish issue which lies behind it, we are not at present in a position to force through a solution."
"None of this changes what I said in my earlier replies about signalling to Turkey that this military action needs to be ended as quickly as possible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Excessive deficits and economic policies"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0181/97 by Mr Christodoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on: I. the recommendation for second reading on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (C4-0174/97-96/0247(SYN)) and II. the report on the proposal for a Council regulation on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (6931/2/97 - C4-0577/96-96/0248(CNS)) and - A4-0184/97 by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the economic policy of the Member States of the Community (COM(97)0168 - C4-0190/97)"
"Mr President, on 28 November 1996, the European Parliament adopted, at second reading, resolutions on the Stability Pact concerning two proposals for regulations."
"The first was on the strengthening of surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies on the basis of the cooperation procedure, and the second was on speeding up and clarifying implementation of the excessive deficit procedure on the basis of the negotiation procedures."
"As you know, at the Dublin European Council, on 13-14 December 1994, a political agreement was reached on the general principles and main elements of the Stability Pact."
"The European Council also called for the preparation of a draft resolution on the Stability Pact to be adopted, recording the commitments of the Member States, the Commission and the Council to a strict application of the Treaty and the legal provisions of the Stability Pact."
"At the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council, in Noordwijk, the texts of the two proposals for regulations and the draft resolution were agreed and the common position on the first of those proposals was forwarded to the European Parliament and was adopted in first reading, while it requested to be consulted again on the latter proposal."
"In the preparation of the amendments, as part of the relevant examination, the following elements were taken into account:"
"First of all, the political will expressed at the Dublin Summit."
"Secondly, the European Council's decision to opt for a strict application of the Stability Pact and, at the same time, the fact that the Council changed its name to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Unfortunately, this qualitative improvement, as expressed by the new title, is not reflected in the texts which have been sent to us from the ECOFIN Council."
"The title has changed but the content has remained more or less the same."
"The inclusion in the regulation of surveillance for the Member States not participating in stage three of EMU is an important new element."
"Whereas the original proposal by the Commission foresaw only the submission of convergence programmes by those Member States participating in stage three of EMU, there is now a separate section on the submission of convergence programmes by Member States not participating in it."
"We have tabled an amendment on this which I shall analyze for you later."
"We think that the Stability Pact has to be effective."
"That effectiveness will depend upon its ability to be implemented and the confidence in it."
"Any changes made will have to be made in that direction."
"The relative inflexibility of the provisions and the generally automatic and mechanistic character of those provisions fails to take into account the dynamic nature of economics and of monetary phenomena which restricts the implementation of these provisions and as a consequence will undermine the confidence in those provisions and the Pact itself."
"Finally, the proposal for a regulation for the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure foresees the imposition of the penalty of a deposit which could be turned into a fine."
"Here we have a very serious problem in that the original Commission proposal foresaw that the product of the fine and interest generated would constitute revenue for the Community budget but the new proposal, although not yet finalised, is that it should be distributed among the Member States which do not have an excessive budget and this seems to be the overriding opinion in the Council."
"The result of this imposition is a paradoxical phenomenon and I shall not criticize it now, but I should just point out that, until now, no legal basis or clear procedure for implementing this idea put forward by the Council have been found."
"However, although this has not yet been finalized by the Council, we must vote for the corresponding amendment that we have tabled, which has come out of the Committee on Budgets, because that would express the European Parliament's will to maintain the principle of budgetary unity, an elementary basic notion, and something which must be maintained come what may."
"Given the difficulties which the Council is facing in finding a legal basis, it is very likely - and here I am hazarding a guess, of course - that these amounts will be inscribed in the budget and that they will be shared out subsequently according to political commitments and perhaps a subsequent amendment to the relevant budgetary provision."
"However, that is no reason for us not to vote for this amendment, even though it refers to a text which has yet to take its definitive form."
"Therefore, our amendments are aimed at improving the Pact in its main points."
"In particular:"
"First of all, they lend the draft resolution of the European Council its rightful dimensions, on the basis of Article D of the common provisions of the Treaty."
"This draft resolution will then be seen to be setting political guidelines for the subsequent and opportune implementation of the Stability Pact, but that it is not part of the articles and has no legal content."
"It is simply a political guideline."
"Secondly, these amendments define the public investment expenditure which are a decisive factor for economic growth and development."
"We would, therefore, be giving substantial content to the meaning of 'development' added to the Pact by the Dublin Council."
"I am pleased to tell you, Mr President, that this has been accepted by the Council and the Commission and will be included in the articles of the regulations."
"Thirdly, the provisions for the convergence programmes are made more realistic and bring into the regulation on surveillance a sense of strengthening those Member States not participating in stage three of EMU, by protecting them from profit making in the framework of the new exchange rate mechanism, i.e. protection by the European Union's bodies from profit-making attacks."
"Special circumstances are also planned for, such as not regarding as a budget deficit any expenditure connected with protecting the territorial integrity of Member States."
"Fourthly, without easing up on the strictness of application by any means - and I must emphasize this, Mr President - the amendments allow a certain flexibility, which is necessary if the Stability Pact is to function properly and if it is to be both applicable and reliable."
"In many cases, absolute inflexibility means a lack of feasibility and confidence suffers as a result."
"Finally, they reinforce a basic principle of budgets, as I referred to earlier, by retaining within the Community budget the fines imposed and interest generated on them."
"These are the basic principles underlying the amendments we have tabled and which we have brought before the European Parliament for its vote."
"They are included in one text and all of them have been approved by the Committee on Budgets."
"Taking into account developments so far, the need for a stable euro and the need for sustainable provisions, we have made an attempt to avoid an excessive number of amendments so that those elements which we believe to be absolutely necessary can be stressed."
"Therefore, we are not bringing before the plenary for voting those amendments which were not approved by the Economics Committee, apart from amendments on a technical matter, which I have just mentioned and on which I shall give my opinion later on."
"To conclude, I propose, as rapporteur, an amendment to the common position on the regulation on surveillance and an opinion on the regulation on deficits, in accordance with the amendments adopted by our Committee, thereby concluding the second reading."
"To finish, I would like to emphasize the importance of this matter from both the political and economic points of view and to stress that, if we were to reject these proposals, we would be sending the wrong signal to the outside and the European Parliament would then be excluded from the taking of important decisions."
"Therefore, I hope that the opinions expressed in this text will be given your resounding support."
"However, we think that it is vital for the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately are not present at this moment in time, to pledge that at the next Councils, due to take place shortly, they will adopt the proposals which have been accepted, in other words relating to the draft regulation, on the issues of development and public investment, and the other elements which have been accepted during the three-day negotiations and subsequent communications which we had with the Council and the Commission."
"In all good faith, we are proposing that both of these regulations be voted for."
"I would like to hope, or rather I am sure, that the Commission and the Council will promise to honour their obligations due to us."
"Madam President, the economic trends in the European Union, and above all the employment policy trends, must be viewed with grave concern, and for that reason the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Community are particularly important."
"As I see it, we have failed in previous years to make sufficient use of these guidelines to actually achieve a greater degree of concertation and coherence in European economic policy, affecting measures in both the public and private sectors."
"This year, therefore - one year before we have to decide who is to participate in monetary union - we must give particular attention to how these guidelines are drawn up."
"I very much regret that the Commission's thinking hinges on the idea that, simply by pursuing and respecting the objectives of monetary stability and budgetary consolidation, we shall more or less automatically achieve the increased investment and growth that we require, and that this will also halve unemployment by the year 2000."
"In my view, this is not enough; in fact, it is far from enough to ensure the implementation of all the political initiatives that have been expressed in Parliament's resolutions - initiatives on which we are united."
"Broad guidelines for economic policy must therefore be based on more than a mere restatement of the convergence criteria."
"I do welcome the fact that the Commission is seeking to direct public expenditure towards productive investment; this is something which Parliament has also called for, and in this respect the Commission is going a step further than in last year's annual economic report."
"I believe that we must concentrate on promoting investment to a much greater degree than has previously been the case in the guidelines."
"We need a system of benchmarking for investments, because when we consider that in Germany alone, investments fell last year from 18 billion to 1.1 bn, we realize just how vulnerable our situation is, and it is only by pulling together that we shall be able to escape from the hole that we are in."
"I should like to emphasize one point in particular: precisely because it is important for us to act together at Community level, the guidelines will have to be much more binding, so that they can actually be applied and implemented in practice."
"It is therefore important that we should take an approach which makes employment policy a defining element in all other policies."
"This means that the broad guidelines for economic and employment policy must be woven together, as it were, so that we can do more to promote economic policy with a view to creating new jobs."
"I feel that this is genuinely important, because people are the raw material of the European Union, and any kind of investment in people - whether in terms of providing them with qualifications, further training or lifelong learning, or through accompanying measures such as research and development and support for innovation - will help us to make real progress within the European Union."
"We have to keep on reminding ourselves that the decisions which were taken at summits from Essen to Dublin are still awaiting implementation."
"That is why we must create a new set of circumstances, although it is quite clear that, far from turning our backs on the pursuit of monetary stability and budgetary consolidation, these must continue to be our objectives."
"The House should be able to agree on a number of demands: we need to channel public funds more directly into productive investment; private companies must be more strongly reminded of their duty in terms of promoting the economy and jobs; and we need better coordination of economic policies and stronger links between the policies of the Member States and the Community."
"At the same time, we should not forget that national economies have become increasingly interdependent - to a degree that was previously unimaginable - and of course this means that any measure taken in one Member State is bound to affect the measures in others."
"I think it is also important for the political players to speak out more clearly, since it is only by conveying a clear sense of political direction and letting it be known unequivocally that the monetary union will begin on 1 January 1999 that we shall regain the confidence of economic operators."
"What we need is not only increased investment and the confidence of the business community, but also the confidence of the population at large."
"Rates of saving in the European Union are at record levels, without historical parallel, but the people who have money are not consuming, while those who have no money are unable to consume."
"This is an indication of how essential it is to raise the level of demand and increase purchasing power."
"I would reiterate just how important it is that we should ultimately reduce the tax burden on the labour factor, because that is the way to increase purchasing power in real terms."
"I attach particular importance to this, specifically in terms of the measures which need to be taken to create the right overall framework."
"I would also urge once again that we in the European Union should work towards integrating our policies and directing them towards achieving a high level of employment."
"We must make a real effort, through our policies, to bring about the kind of synergy effects which can no longer be achieved by an individual country for the benefit of its own economy and people."
"I therefore believe that it is extremely important to direct the measures which affect economic policy towards a single goal, and to integrate our structural and financial policies."
"For their part, the Member States must finally fulfil their commitments by actually making the resources available to complement the structural funds that are earmarked for promoting employment policy objectives."
"Otherwise, there is little point in having a European policy."
"Commitments must be honoured both at Community level and by the Member States of the European Union."
"Madam President, with too little time but with great interest we have analyzed, in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, the regulations which are the subject of today's debate."
"We have done so in the light of our great concern, which could be none other than the effects on employment, on our social model, of the measures to be adopted in the framework of both of these regulations to supervise the economic policies of Member States and introduce surveillance over public deficits in the run-up to this exciting event for the European Union which is now nearly upon us."
"On the other hand, these regulations reflect the need for the economic policies of the Member States of the European Union to advance in tandem in order to strengthen monetary union, since there can be no talk of a single currency with divergent economies as that could not guarantee stable prices or growth."
"Therefore, it is obvious that only if we have a stable and controlled budgetary situation and if our economies are converging can we coordinate efficient, job-creating employment policies."
"Therefore, I also think that - apart from the need for the Council to take into account the unemployment rate and the rate of job-creation when examining the stability and convergence programmes - in order to adjust its objectives, it must also analyze not only the size of deficits but also the type and, therefore, to pay particular attention to public expenditure, in particular, on education, training, investment and infrastructures, which have beneficial effects on Europe's regions, especially in times of crisis."
"This by no means contradicts the fact that a healthy budgetary situation is fundamental if we are to respond rapidly to adverse economic situations and, at the same time, to control the public deficit. After all these are basic elements for economic growth and subsequent job growth."
"It is for this reason that we have tabled amendments in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment to these regulations."
"We must also contemplate the overall situation of a country before imposing sanctions on it as heavy as those foreseen in the regulation on excessive deficits and, at the same time, it seems to me a good procedure to help to add to the credibility and confidence in the future European monetary union."
"On the other hand, in relation to the economic guidelines for 1997, nobody doubts that the European Union is, at this moment in time, facing a challenge which can only be compared with its very birth."
"Europeans, especially those governing their destinies, have committed themselves to the adventure of uniting their economic, human and social potential in order to confront an undeniable need: working and subsisting in an increasingly globalized market, an increasingly technical market, an increasingly interdependent market."
"Monetary Union is just one more step towards joining forces."
"Unemployment, the European Union's most serious problem, cannot only be measured in figures, because above all it is the young, women, elderly, disabled, citizens who will blame us if we do not achieve our main objective in this adventure of ours, that of creating jobs."
"In front of the European Parliament, today, the workers of Europe have been calling for a special clause, in the future Treaty, referring to employment."
"To turn a deaf ear to them would be doing the European Union a disservice."
"We must show our sympathy and solidarity with them."
"On the other hand, workers harming other workers, as has recently occurred in the case of attacks on Spanish lorry drivers, imbalances and injustices in the social security systems or an excessively rigid labour market in Europe are factors that seriously hinder progress towards our European project."
"Therefore, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, while recognizing the Commission's efforts in the form of these major economic guidelines which we are debating, once again wishes to voice its concern at the high level of unemployment in the European Union."
"In order to combat unemployment we must have growth, we must compete and we must invest, but we must also increase domestic demand and that will only happen if we generate confidence, and people have confidence when investment is productive, when employment and social security systems are effective and when workers, women or men, receive a fair and adequate wage."
"Fortunately economic policy and employment policy do seem to be going hand in hand and the Commission document has set aside a special paragraph for using structural reforms to favour job growth."
"That is not enough."
"We must make better use of the European Union's instruments, such as the Committee on Employment and the labour market or the multiannual programmes in order to improve coordination of economic and employment policies, so that we can also make it easier for both sides of industry to discuss matters at European level."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets focused its attention on the methods to be used for recording and applying the sanctions laid down for Member States violating the 3 % rule in future."
"We agreed with Mr Christodoulou that the procedure itself should not be called into question."
"We feel that the stability pact forms part of the overall concept of a single currency and we therefore wish to approach it constructively, which is why we held informal three-way talks at which we were able to put our views to the Council."
"However, I have to say that we are still faced with a procedural problem that is difficult to accept in democratic terms: establishing whether the Council thinks there is a legal basis for the method it wishes to use for channelling the revenue to the participating members which are not in breach of the rules, in other words excluding the opting-out countries and the countries paying the deposits or fines."
"We in the Committee on Budgets consider that this would be impossible to implement and would set an unacceptable precedent."
"We would refer here to other existing sanctions such as in the agricultural sector or the Structural Funds, where the revenue from the sanctions is pooled in the Community budget."
"This is not to be the case here, and we fear that this precedent will throw the budget into turmoil, especially if there is to be flexibility in various sectors in the future."
"For this reason, we would urge the House to consider our amendment to Article 16, and we would also urge that a definitive answer should be obtained from the Council as soon as possible - preferably before tomorrow's vote - on the legal basis it intends to use, which is by no means clear at the moment."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate offers yet another possibility for examining the Stability and Growth Pact and the main thrust of economic policy. This is a timely moment, because the Commission wishes to implement them and also show the coherence attached to the conditions of achieving and operating Economic and Monetary Union."
"The Pact and the coordination of economic policies will ensure sustainable stability, growth and employment in Europe."
"First of all, I should like to specify a number of points on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"First of all, I wish to thank personally, on behalf of the Commission, Mr Christodoulou, for the quality of his work, his sense of responsibility and his extremely useful contribution to the definition of this Pact."
"Following the informal 'trilogue' held on 6 May 1997, the Commission expressed two major preoccupations which it shares with your rapporteur, and it has not failed to be the ardent defender, in this respect, of the European Parliament's view in the Council."
"Those preoccupations are, first of all, the definition of an improved interinstitutional balance within the Pact and, secondly, strengthening the role of public investment."
"Therefore, the Commission is in a position to accept most of the amendments tabled by your rapporteur, namely Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, on the resolution of the European Council, Amendment No 4, first part, Amendments Nos 5 and 8 on public investment and expenditure, and Amendments Nos 6, part 2, and 9, part 2, on the regulation based on Article 103.5."
"Similarly, the Commission is willing to accept Amendments 1, 2, and 4, part 2, to Regulation 104.C."
"A word on the fines, in other words Amendment 5 to the regulations."
"I recall that, although there has been no Council decision, the European Parliament can of course vote on an amendment on this text concerning fines."
"I recall that the European Parliament is delivering its opinion on the modified proposal of the Commission."
"On this score, the Commission maintains its initial proposal for complete budgetization."
"It cannot accept the European Parliament's amendment, because it must maintain its room for negotiation and play its role as the debates in the Council evolve."
"That said, I can assure you that the Commission will do all that is necessary for all of the European Parliament's budgetary prerogatives to be honoured and for a transparent solution to be found."
"I now come to the main guidelines of economic policy which are an essential instrument for improving the coordination of economic policy in Europe."
"This year they confirm that the macro-economic strategy is bearing its fruit because recovery is now showing."
"On the basis of this encouraging fact, the Commission recalls that only a strict respect of the convergence criteria can enable us to pursue the 'policy mix' and thereby contribute to a sustainable improvement in growth, and in turn lead to the creation of employment and productive investment in Europe."
"In this framework, the main guidelines are intended, as your Assembly demanded in its resolution on the annual economic report, to give a further boost to the European Union's economic strategy."
"It is first and foremost a strategy in favour of employment."
"The Commission cannot accept the criticism that its recommendation would not sufficiently develop the conditions for growth and employment because it is perfectly aware of the seriousness of the scourge of unemployment in Europe."
"On this score, I must make two comments."
"First of all, employment cannot be 'decreed away' ."
"The creation of employment results from strong, sustainable and balanced growth."
"The positive results in terms of convergence make it possible to pursue the policy mix which serves both growth and employment."
"Secondly, like the European Parliament, the Commission is well aware of the essential role played by demand in the growth process."
"If demand grows at a faster rate than supply, or if demand is artificially stimulated, new imbalances will be created. Corrections will then be necessary and that would threaten the current policy mix, i.e. growth and employment."
"I think that I should be able to reassure Mrs Randzio-Plath, whom I found a little too pessimistic, personally, because demand, consumer demand in particular, is improving in Europe: + 1.9 % in 1997, + 2.4 % in 1998, but investment demand is also growing: investment in equipment, for which we are taking the figure of + 4.8 % in 1997 and + 6.3 % in 1998."
"In order to stimulate the net creation of jobs, the Commission is therefore recommending this year an improved coordination of the economic policies of Member States, including those related to employment matters."
"I must recall that, at its initiative, surveillance over employment was set up back in 1995."
"On the basis of the programmes presented every year by the Member States, a joint report by the ECOFIN Council and the Social Affairs Council was adopted by the European Council at the December meeting."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, the following major lines of action, in macro-economic matters, should be pursued. First of all, we must promote innovation, research and development and improve systems of education and vocational training."
"Secondly, we must improve the functioning of the goods and services markets."
"For this purpose, the Commission will be presenting the European Council in Amsterdam with an action plan on the internal market."
"Thirdly, reforms of the labour market must be pursued and, in the Commission's view, that must not lead to lower salaries but a reasonable overhaul of the salary structure, in line with differences in productivity."
"In other words, a strategy for employment but also a strategy which liberates investment is our recommendation."
"Like you, in the European Parliament, the Commission has found the state of affairs rather disappointing but the last figures which I gave show that this pessimism should nonetheless be tempered."
"Indeed, current surveys already show growing confidence among producers, and investment profitability in the European Union is at its highest level since the 1960s."
"The Commission also notes that employees have contributed to a healthier macro-economic framework through wage moderation."
"It, therefore, thinks it is vital that employers should now seize the opportunity provided by the excellent economic conditions, and their own financial situation in most cases, to relaunch job-creative investment."
"Any relaunch of investment should concern private investment - 85 % of the total, may I recall - as a priority, and in all forms: physical, immaterial and human investment."
"But the Commission also recommends maintaining public investment and expenditure, especially on the trans-European networks."
"As you know, this expenditure is vital if the European Union is to be given a sustainable growth potential in the medium term."
"It is investment for the future of society as a whole."
"By way of conclusion, I would first of all very quickly like to say that, concerning the Stability and Growth Pact, and with those of your amendments which the Commission accepts, i.e. most of them in terms of substance and many of them in terms of quantity, we have now, I think, reached a balanced compromise."
"This compromise should enable the European Parliament to assert its point of view on the adoption of this essential text. Now, we must conclude, because we have no more time if we are to meet the deadline."
"Please allow me, also in conclusion, to respond to the suggestion made by your rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath, on the main guidelines concerning an inter-institutional agreement for implementing Article 103 of the Treaty."
"For its part the Commission has always shown willingness to set up such an agreement, as long as the Council can take it on board."
"The Commission has not sat idly by in recent times but has worked to bring the European Parliament more into the multilateral surveillance process."
"I think that today's debate bears witness to that."
"Therefore, to conclude, I wish to emphasize the need for both of our institutions to pool our efforts to implement this Pact and the recommendations in order to accompany as well as we can the introduction of the euro within the framework of the conditions and calendar scheduled by the Treaty."
"I did not entirely understand the Commissioner, and I should like to know if he would be prepared to include Parliament's proposals in his draft for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community."
"Mr Christodoulou and Mrs Randzio-Plath, the Commissioner will have the floor again at the end of the debate to answer your questions."
"For the moment, we shall proceed with the debate."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their reports to which I shall make some brief references later."
"First, however I should like to say to the Commissioner that the whole conduct of the procedure for the Pact for Stability and Growth has been a very sad series of incidents where attempts were made time and time again to exclude this Parliament from participation in this debate."
"It is only due to this House's resilience that we are now at a stage where the Commission is recommending that it accepts some of our amendments."
"I hope that in the future we will have a better relationship when we deal with these extremely important economic and monetary questions."
"There is a paradox in the Commissioner's presentation today."
"On the one hand he talked about the broad economic guidelines, the fact that the Commission has as its goal increased research and development, increased growth and better systems of education."
"On the other hand, he presents to us a Pact for Stability which has the word 'growth' attached to it, although there is nothing in the Pact related to growth, only to stability, which potentially undermines any measures we can take to boost research and development, systems of education or growth."
"As the Commissioner knows, wrongly used the Stability Pact could be highly deflationary, reduce growth and add to unemployment."
"That is why I insist that the Commission exercises its responsibility under the Treaty of European Union so that this Stability Pact is not used by those forces in the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers that want to undermine the development of employment within the European Union."
"If we want to have growth and stability in the European Union, we have to boost investment."
"At the moment investment represents 19 % of GDP."
"The Commissioner's own economists suggest that investment must rise to 25 % of GDP."
"How do we square the circle of the Pact for Stability and Growth and bearing down on borrowing and budget deficits with the need to increase investment in the European Union."
"Even Mr Ciampi in his report on competitiveness said that public investment has a key role in stimulating private investment in Europe's economy."
"Therefore, it is the responsibility of this Commission to make sure that we promote public investment, that we do not impede it, so that it leads to wider private investment and greater growth opportunities within the European economy."
"I say to the Commissioner that we will be watching very carefully the role of the Commission and the role of organizations such as the Monetary Committee which has no transparency, no democratic legitimacy."
"Will the Commissioner stand up to the Monetary Committee?"
"Will he exercise his responsibilities under the Treaty of European Union?"
"I shall conclude with a comment on employment."
"The Commissioner has stressed the need to boost employment in the European Union."
"We will now put in place the Pact for Stability and Growth."
"We are putting in place the final instruments for the management of monetary policy."
"We must activate the European Investment Fund and the borrowing requirement at a European level to compensate for the borrowing that Member States themselves are not able to introduce."
"That is why I would ask you, Commissioner, between now and next year's annual economic report and broad economic guidelines to fight to defend what the Commission and the Essen summit agreed, namely to support the Delors and Santer initiatives on borrowing at European level to help boost investment levels."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the stability pact is undoubtedly one of the major steps on the road to European monetary union, and the question of whether it can be approved, on schedule, in Amsterdam is crucial."
"As you have heard in the debate, certain differences of opinion exist - between Parliament and the Commission, but in particular between Parliament and the Council - concerning the stability pact."
"That is why we have engaged in negotiations with the Council, and we had a very constructive exchange of views with Mr Zalm, the Dutch Finance Minister and President-in-Office of the Council."
"Our discussions centred on three issues: firstly, the essentially institutional question of cross-referencing between the proposal for a Council decision and the two directives; secondly, the question of including in the stability pact the golden rule, with which you are familiar, which requires that the level of investment provided for in a budget must be higher than that of new borrowing; and the third point concerns the budget, and has been dealt with very fully and clearly by Mr Willockx."
"In our view, no special budget can be created for fines to be paid into; if fines are paid, they must go into the budget of the European Community."
"Those were the points at issue in the negotiations."
"I think I can say that the negotiations indicated that the Council might be prepared to move some way towards us on two points: cross-referencing and the question of the golden rule."
"As regards the budget, I am not yet sure what the position is."
"However, it is my belief that we have the law on our side, since the Council's legal advisors are still searching, somewhat desperately, for a legal basis on which to resolve the issue, and I think they could end up by falling in with our proposals."
"Finally, I should like to stress one point: it is absolutely essential that we should not at this stage think of postponing the report or delaying it, but should decide now to take a vote on it tomorrow and deliver our opinion."
"I have heard - and I find this quite incomprehensible - that there was talk in the Socialist Group of postponement or referral back to committee."
"I would regard any such move as highly dangerous, and I think that it should not be allowed under any circumstances."
"We must vote on the Christodoulou report tomorrow."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is vital, on such an important subject, first of all to recall some very simple principles."
"The greatest challenge that we have to face in most of our countries is that of unemployment."
"Yet the improvement of the labour market depends on more growth and that is something which cannot be decreed."
"It results from healthy parameters."
"Public deficits have never created jobs, otherwise we would have too many jobs now."
"You only need to look at the situation in the United States and in Holland."
"Similarly, growth must, in the medium term, be encouraged by demand and sustained by judicious investment coming mostly from competitive companies, at the rate of 85 %."
"We see that, in Europe today, demand is recovering on a healthy basis, which ought to stimulate investment."
"Finally, it is increased productivity which leads to growth and we should remain very attentive to developments in wages and deficits."
"All of these reasons are such that the texts that we are discussing today are of capital importance for the future of Economic and Monetary Union."
"By the same token, the informal Council meeting held in April, which was a success, only represented, if I may say so, the legal 'setting to music' of decisions already taken at the Dublin European Council in December."
"We are also convinced that the adoption, as soon as possible, by the European Parliament of the text proposed to us concerning excessive deficits and strengthening the surveillance and coordination of budgetary policies is absolutely vital if we are to have the text finalized in time for the Amsterdam Summit."
"With this in mind, all of the texts of interest to us, i.e. those concerning the EMS Mark II, the Stability Pact, and those concerning Articles 103(5) and 104.C, also naturally receive our approval, as does Mr Christodoulou's high quality report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also note, with regard to the fight against excessive deficits, that the system proposed is meant essentially to be preventive and dissuasive."
"It does not seem to be an approach which puts emphasis on sanctions."
"Finally, today we wish to congratulate the Commission which has succeeded in making sure that budgetary surveillance is exercised in the future not only on a country-by-country basis but also in the European Union as a whole."
"This is a major achievement if we are to have a budgetary overview of the European Union and will be particularly useful for us in the multilateral macro-economic dialogue to be conducted with the European Union's main partners."
"Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Liberal Group on the Christodoulou reports."
"In effect, I could give a very short speech because I agree entirely with what was said by Mr von Wogau."
"On the question of cross-references between a Council political declaration and the regulations, the Liberal Group agrees that those references should be minimal."
"On the question of the so-called golden rule on investment, we can support references to Article 104(c) in the relevant paragraphs within the multilateral surveillance proposition."
"On the Stability Pact, the Liberal Group welcomes the emphasis placed by Parliament on the need for interest on deposits and on fines which arise under this pact to be, in principle, assigned to own resources."
"Finally, I agree entirely with Mr von Wogau."
"Under no circumstances, having secured additional commitments from the Council and recognizing the critical importance of the Stability and Growth Pact to EMU, will my group be prepared to postpone the vote tomorrow."
"The debate is adjourned."
"It will be resumed after the debate on the European Council meeting of 23 May 1997."
"European Council of 23 May 1997"
"The next item is the Council report and Commission statement on the results of the European Council meeting of 23 May 1997."
"Mr President, I am most grateful to you for allowing me to come here today."
"This is the first time that I have spoken in your new building, and I only hope that the future of the European Union looks as flourishing as your accommodation!"
"I should like to give you a brief report on the informal meeting of the European Council held in Noordwijk on 23 May."
"The only subject on the agenda was the Intergovernmental Conference, and in view of the informal nature of the meeting there were no official documents for discussion and no conclusions were reached."
"However, this does not mean that no preparations were made."
"A week or so before the meeting in Noordwijk, the presidency issued a kind of summary working document which had no official status, but simply gave the presidency's view of how the negotiations had gone so far and clearly indicated to the contracting parties where we stood and how we were to proceed on the basis of the presidency's proposals."
"The text, and indeed the overall situation in the negotiations, were discussed in advance at an informal meeting of the group of personal representatives which was held in Houthem near Maastricht on 16 and 17 May."
"Representatives of the European Parliament also attended much of the meeting."
"On Tuesday, 20 May the Ministers of Foreign Affairs met to discuss the subject, and I was delighted that you too were able to attend and put forward your ideas."
"I should like to congratulate you on the very communicative and constructive approach which you and your representatives maintained with the presidency and the negotiating conference at every level, not least in informal contacts, and I shall be returning to this later in my speech."
"In Noordwijk, there was the usual meeting with yourself as President of the European Parliament, followed by a short discussion."
"I wished to mention this specifically because it is one of the permanent features of the European Council."
"As we saw in Noordwijk, there are still a number of difficult issues to be resolved before we get to Amsterdam, which is where we still expect to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference."
"However, generally speaking the Heads of Government felt that the Conference had made excellent progress, and the round-table discussions looked at a number of different subjects."
"Among these was the review, which covered the inclusion of more specific provisions on human rights in the Treaty, the introduction of the principle of non-discrimination, a chapter on employment, the reintroduction and consolidation of the social protocol and the removal of the United Kingdom's opt-out, a new legal basis for openness and transparency, the consolidation of the European Parliament's legislative role and the simplification of procedures, the extension of the powers of the Court of Justice - particularly under the third pillar, and the combating of fraud."
"These are all areas where the presidency has the impression, especially having heard what was said at Noordwijk, that the Conference is largely in agreement."
"This is not to say, of course, that there is not still a good deal of fine-tuning going on, but this is what you would expect when the time comes for the politicians to hand their work over to others, particularly lawyers."
"I would point out that it also became clear at Noordwijk that agreement has yet to be reached on a number of issues, particularly the communitization of the free movement of persons, the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union, and flexibility."
"There is as yet no political agreement on any of these issues."
"Nevertheless, it appeared from the general assessment made by the Heads of Government at Noordwijk that there was a clear political will, already seen at the conference at The Hague on 20 May and now confirmed in Noordwijk on 23 May, to bring the IGC to a successful conclusion with an Amsterdam Treaty at the Amsterdam summit."
"It was also clearly stated, much to our appreciation, that thanks to the documents put forward by the presidency, there was also a very real prospect of actually producing this Treaty."
"Apart from this general round-up, there were also a number of other issues, particularly institutional questions, on the agenda at Noordwijk."
"These are areas where the presidency has always hesitated to spell its ideas out in specific provisions or proposals, because we could only ever really guess at what the eventual consensus might be."
"The first of these issues was the effectiveness and composition of the European Commission, on which it was clear from the discussions in Amsterdam that there had been a definite political shift, which the presidency was delighted to see."
"There was total agreement that it was essential for the President of the European Commission to be given a much stronger role in the political and other management of this important institution if the Commission was to become more effective and to be given greater legitimacy, particularly as the number of Member States increases in the next century."
"In particular, it was decided - leaving it up to the lawyers to consider the finer details - that the European Council will appoint the President of the Commission in a four- or five-phase procedure, subject to confirmation and approval by the European Parliament."
"Then there will be a phase where Member States appoint their Commissioners, in agreement - I say agreement, but I cannot think of the precise legal term - with the President."
"So there will be consultation and agreement on the appointment of Commissioners."
"Subject to the Member States' powers of nomination, the entire Commission must then appear once again, figuratively at least, before the European Parliament to obtain its seal of approval."
"The European Council also clearly wants the internal organization of the Commission to be rationalized in future, though this has yet to be fleshed out."
"The broad outlines have already been developed by the current Commission and have met with general approval at the IGC, particularly the idea that the President should have more say in the allocation and distribution of portfolios."
"We also need to examine, though this has not yet been discussed in detail, whether he should be given some kind of rights in this respect, but this is not clear at the moment."
"What is less clear is what exactly should be done about the size and composition of the Commission."
"There has been a very frank discussion on how to contain the political risk which this represents, since it has grown to become the most politically sensitive issue for the Member States at the IGC."
"The possibility raised during the discussion that some Member States might no longer be represented on the Commission in future, but would have to take part in rotation, met with considerable opposition from a number of them."
"It became clear that this issue presented a considerable threat to the entire outcome of the IGC if it was not handled very carefully and resolved to the satisfaction of all the Member States."
"The indication at Noordwijk was that this issue should not be pushed too far, which may imply that the decision on the size and composition of the Commission will be left until the time comes in the accession procedure when it has to be settled."
"The real problem comes if three, five or six countries are admitted and they all want their own Commissioner, and it is clearly seen as an option to defer the decision until that time."
"A great deal of time, within the constraints that very busy people always face, was spent discussing the issue of reweighting votes and the qualified majority."
"It was clear that a considerable number of Heads of Government regard it as extremely important to find a fair and acceptable solution to this question, bearing in mind that the majorities to be obtained must be seen to be legitimate."
"Agreement has yet to be reached on the method to be used."
"Some Member States are in favour of a double weighting or ratio, while others support a reweighting of the votes within the Council."
"There are all sorts of variations, on which no decision has been taken."
"However, the one issue that needs to be closely examined in the context of institutional relations and which is particularly sensitive is the extension of the qualified majority under the third pillar."
"Finally, Mr President, there is something that is not directly connected to the European Council but follows on from what you said at the beginning of your address to the Council of Ministers three weeks ago."
"You proposed that the Intergovernmental Conference should not make foreign policy spending compulsory expenditure, and you offered to enter into an interinstitutional agreement on behalf of Parliament to regulate relations on this issue."
"The offer was taken up by the President of the IGC, Mr van Mierlo, who was authorized by his colleagues to negotiate on this."
"What I would like to tell you now is that this is still the intention of the high contracting parties at the IGC, and that as far as I am concerned, the results of the first exploratory talks that you and I have held have been extremely encouraging."
"I would like to thank you once again for the initiative you took three weeks ago in the Council of Ministers."
"Thank you very much, Mr Patijn."
"You have the floor, Mr Oreja."
"Thank you very much, Mr Oreja, for such an informative statement. I again thank Mr Patijn for his informative report."
"I give the floor to Mrs Green."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking both the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Oreja for their contributions today."
"It was in accord with his positive and sunny nature that the President-in-Office of the Council gave us his usual optimistic version of what he thinks is going on in the IGC."
"Commissioner Oreja was just a bit more realistic, if not to say a bit more honest in his assessment of the way in which we think it is going."
"In this Parliament I hope there are none - certainly in my group - who wish to be negative, difficult, or awkward."
"We want a positive outcome to the Amsterdam Summit."
"We are determined there will be if we can have any influence on that process because it is crucial for the development of the Union into the next millennium that we have a positive outcome."
"But, if we listen to the President-in-Office's report, it is indicative of the fears and anxieties of the people of the European Union."
"He made clear that the major politically-sensitive issues are those concerned with the institutional questions."
"I would rather he had said that the major politically-sensitive issues were about how we could really strengthen employment creation and the social dimension, move forward on creating a better environment, better consumer protection, better public health."
"My anxiety about what he said is that those issues are already the process of a large consensus which means that they are already decided and there is not much in them."
"That is why it is so easy to find political consensus on them."
"It is important that we make politically clear that the citizens of the European Union are concerned about job creation."
"If we are serious about a chapter in the Treaty that deals with job creation, our citizens do not just want pious words."
"They want at least the Treaty to give us the right to start to coordinate our macro-economic policies to generate job creation at European Union level."
"That is the only way that the employment chapter will have any meaning."
"Similarly, on the social dimension, I am delighted that the social protocol will be integrated into the Treaty of European Union and delighted that 1 May, Labour Day, saw the election of a Labour Government in Britain that will allow that to happen."
"But we want to see some strengthening of that social protocol as well."
"We also want to see a move forward on gender equality and on an anti-discrimination clause with some real meaning."
"And we want to see these dealt with by qualified majority voting and co-decision and not by unanimity which I suspect we may see, certainly on the anti-discrimination clause."
"These are the things which affect people in the Union."
"These are the things which should be driving the last few days of the IGC, to make these things stronger, to make the message clear to our people."
"Commissioner Oreja made a very telling statement when he said that what we have is the minimum that public opinion could accept - the minimum!"
"And that worries me and my group very much."
"We want to see the Union moving forward but its first priority must be to deal with those issues that have so destabilized public opinion in the European Union countries themselves about the value of the European Union to them and their families."
"Let us see a real drive forward, not just pious rhetoric about these issues but a real step forward in the Treaty."
"My group will be assessing the Treaty on whether it meets the aspirations of the people of the Union."
"It must also make the Union ready for enlargement and that means institutional changes."
"We could have hoped that our heads of government could have understood that in order to have an effective and efficient Union we must have institutional changes."
"They should be automatic if we are going to see the enlargement of the Union to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"So there really is an imperative to prepare the Union for enlargement by dealing firstly with the institutional situation that needs to be remedied."
"For instance, we need to reduce the Union's decision-making procedures to three and we want to see that happen."
"It has been the demand of this Parliament for a long time and we hope it will happen."
"And of course we want to see the extension of qualified majority voting and co-decision."
"We want to see all those things that will ensure that this Parliament's rights are maintained."
"We cannot and will not accept the diminution of any of the present rights of this Parliament - either its budgetary or legislative rights - in any field."
"I hope that will be taken back very clearly to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to extend my special thanks to the Presidentin-Office of the Council and to Commissioner Oreja, not only for their words to us today, but also because I have had the impression over recent months that they have both been prepared to look in detail at the arguments which Parliament has put forward, and indeed to implement a number of our proposals or contribute to their implementation."
"I should like to thank them personally for that."
"Over the years, I have listened here in the House to a number of great speeches by great Europeans, and in recent weeks I have found myself recalling two such addresses, one by former Italian President Sandro Pertini and one by Václav Havel."
"Both speakers very clearly conveyed the idea that what we need is not a Europe of technocrats, but a Europe that is geared to meeting the needs of its citizens - at the service of its citizens."
"When I see how intergovernmental negotiations work in practice, I sometimes have my doubts as to whether we actually measure up to that ideal."
"It is becoming increasingly complicated and difficult to explain European decisions to the people of Europe, to give people the opportunity of understanding who is responsible for what and monitoring who is taking good or bad decisions, and to put across the idea that people can bring their own influence to bear in order to steer things in the right direction."
"This brings me to the particular issue of the European Union's capacity for action, and the Intergovernmental Conference as a preparation for enlargement of the Union."
"Everyone talks about extending majority decisionmaking, but everyone brings to the table their own set of exceptions, courtesy of the ministries of their national governments, and it is almost impossible for those in charge of the negotiations to prevent a zero-sum outcome."
"Now, as the Intergovernmental Conference draws to an end, we should remember that the principle of unanimity is the principle of mistrust and lack of imagination."
"The principle of unanimity is being maintained because there is a lack of trust between the partners, a fear of the majority deciding in a way that goes against individual national interests."
"I think this must be seen as a painful truth, because everyone can cite their own examples of such mistrust, and I would refer to just a few points that serve to illustrate it."
"The Council presidency is in fact seeking to extend qualified-majority voting in the area of commercial policy under Article 113 to decisions on services, investments and copyright, for example. However, it is clear that the only way of making this work is by drawing up protocols and subprotocols setting out hundreds of exceptions - I exaggerate, but let us say a great many exceptions - and it is only subject to those exceptions that the members of the Council will be prepared to take decisions by a qualified majority."
"If, then, it is to be the case that every time the principle of majority decision-making is extended on a particular issue, there has to be a special preliminary agreement in the form of a protocol, the end result will be a situation which - while it may empower the Union to act - will leave it legally hamstrung and rob it of all vitality."
"And I could cite many more examples of such an outcome."
"So what is the reality?"
"There have in fact been virtually no instances of a qualified-majority decision, even with regard to internal market legislation, where any country has had to sacrifice its national interests, or lost a vote."
"Ultimately, even where decisions have been taken by qualified majority, the negotiations have still been conducted on the basis of the principle of consent."
"Why, then, can this approach not also be applied in other areas?"
"What are the implications of this situation as regards enlargement?"
"A number of Member States have not yet considered the fact that positions which, in their own national interest, they have so far unanimously supported will have dramatically different implications in an enlarged Community - not least from the point of view of national interest."
"In this context - and without going into any detail - I would mention the Structural Funds, for example."
"We are still debating the principle of sovereignty, but still only in terms of its formal aspects rather than its real substance, and ordinary people are several steps ahead of us here."
"In discussions concerning the third pillar and those aspects of the third pillar which should be brought under the Community umbrella, we often hear it said that this or that is not feasible and that national sovereignty is at stake."
"Ordinary people have not the slightest interest in this."
"My point is that they wish to see solutions to the problems we are facing, and what we need is a new form of politics, not a new form of bureaucracy."
"In order to make progress, we need a European foreign and security policy which includes decision-making procedures."
"But it must not be hedged around with so many provisos that the central idea of majority decision-making is undermined and overlayered by the principle of unanimity, thereby choking the whole apparatus."
"We wish to see an improved social policy, basic rights and greater transparency."
"The Intergovernmental Conference may be moving towards giving the European Parliament more rights, and we would like to hope that such a move would benefit not only Parliament, but the European Union as a whole."
"Thank, Mr Brok."
"I give the floor to Mr Azzolini."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall not conceal our doubts and concerns as regards the progress of the IGC's work, as revealed yet again at the recent Noordwijk summit."
"Although we appreciate the tremendous efforts of the Dutch presidency and the cooperative spirit of many Member States, for which my group is sincerely grateful, it has to be said that at Noordwijk - where, just a few days prior to the Amsterdam European Council, agreement should have been reached on extending the application of the Maastricht Treaty - what prevailed once again was the nationalism of the past."
"A good deal is at stake, of course: an increase in the European Union's powers implies a gradual abandonment of national sovereignty."
"So it hardly comes as a surprise that ideals give way to partisan interests whenever national prerogatives are called into question."
"We cannot believe that, as the eminent Spanish professor, Rafael Gómez Pérez, put it, the European ideal is now a spent force."
"Once, the idea of Europe conveyed the notion - in a cultural sense - of a common home; yet that natural feeling of 'being European' has faded with time, because Europeans have lost their sense of togetherness, and have stopped thinking about and striving for true European unity."
"But we believe that Europe has much to offer to itself, its own citizens, and the whole world."
"To do this, however, it also needs, above all, to add a political dimension to its presence on the international stage by strengthening its policies and institutions, first and foremost the European Parliament, and by fully involving its citizens."
"Such is the spirit with which, in our opinion, the IGC should be imbued, in order to rewrite a treaty which is no longer equal to the major challenges of the coming decades."
"As everyone knows, the European Community has certainly taken huge strides forward since its inception, but that is not enough."
"We want a Europe which does not betray the spirit of its founding fathers, who saw the political dimension as its true strength; we want a strong, free, democratic Europe, serving our citizens' needs and offering them prosperity."
"As the European Union's powers increase, however, a solution must be found to the serious problem of its democratic deficit: powers - and, consequently, democratic control - cannot be removed from the national parliaments merely to increase the powers of unelected decision-making bodies."
"These powers must be finely balanced. An expanding Europe, which is seeking a high-profile political presence on the world stage and aiming to become dependable and strong, must enter into a clear pact with its citizens: either their full sovereignty is recognized, through democratically elected institutions with full powers, as in any democracy, or they will feel that they inhabit not a common home, but a mere geographical entity with centrally controlled and remote supranational institutions."
"Mr President, the citizens of Europe must not be forgotten when we reform the European Union!"
"Mr President, this is the penultimate time that Parliament will be discussing the IGC before decisions are taken at Amsterdam."
"It is clear that every group has its own desiderata."
"Here are the four points on which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party will judge whether or not Amsterdam is a success."
"First, codecision."
"A great deal has been said about this."
"Codecision is essential in every field where there is legislation."
"We are concerned that where sections of the third pillar are to be transferred to the first pillar, justice and home affairs are likely to become qualified majority fields, but Parliament will not be able to exercise its rights as much as it would like."
"It is vital for the Court of Justice to have a role to play here, as the guarantee of a genuine constitutional state."
"Article H is a monstrosity in legal terms, Mr Patijn."
"Next, the qualified majority."
"There are still 35 cases where unanimity is required."
"The Community cannot function like this."
"Can the President of the Council assure us that the presidency will take new measures to try to reduce the number of cases requiring unanimity?"
"Thirdly, a common foreign and security policy will not work without the necessary instruments."
"The Western European Union needs to be integrated into the European Union if we are to have credible instruments for pursuing a foreign policy."
"Such instruments do not currently exist, and the Western European Union is appearing more and more like a NATO satellite, rather than an instrument of the European Union."
"Finally, simplification."
"I am sorry to see that the Presidency's proposal contains a token entry, as Mr Oreja mentioned."
"People will judge this treaty on whether or not there really is new simplification and new clarity."
"The fact that the present text is unclear is down not to the Dutch presidency, but to the impotence of the Council, which has actually succeeded in making the Maastricht Treaty three times as obscure."
"I wish the President-in-Office every success in his work over the next few days."
"Mr Patijn, Mr Oreja, as you can see, all of the spokesmen have thanked you for appearing before the European Parliament today and nearly all of us recognize that the Dutch Presidency has worked very well, as did the Irish Presidency before it; our representatives, Mr Brok and Mrs Guigou, have had good communications with you; the previous President of the European Parliament, Mr Hänsch and the present one, Mr Gil-Robles, have made an effort to communicate with and represent the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference, but all of us must show our concern, nonetheless."
"A Commissioner like Mr Oreja - it is impossible to find a better educated or more cautious Commissioner in the history of the European Union - has expressed his preoccupation on many occasions."
"He said so in a friendly tone, but he has shown considerable concern on behalf of the Commission, and I wish to express considerable preoccupation in the European Parliament on behalf of the ten million citizens who voted for the parties belonging to our group - and we are a small group."
"Just look, Mr Patijn, at the quantity of voters who supported the bigger groups, because this European Parliament is not an academic corporation for debating or analysing, but it is a representative body, as you well know, and respect, of European citizens."
"We know that the Intergovernmental Conference is advancing since everyone has done their duty, but what about the contents?"
"Are they up to the expectations which have been raised?"
"Will they really respond to the political problems of our time?"
"Of course, we support the notion that our fellow citizens should have work and employment, but there is also a political union structure."
"At the moment, almost ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I should like to tell you - and this is not a joke - that the European people are now at the wailing wall."
"With unemployment, anxiety, problems, and we must share those problems and try to find solutions."
"Therefore, I should like briefly to give a few examples of our concerns and reasons why we are worried."
"As far as the method is concerned it is clear: you are looking for the final stable equilibrium in the final moments and it should be of concern to those citizens that their governmental representatives are incapable of establishing the rules of the game and a code of confidence for taking such vital decisions."
"I must say that this could produce a similar situation to that when the Maastricht Treaty was drafted, in another delightful Dutch city whose name now arouses such a lack of confidence in Middle Europe, because the Maastricht Treaty was done behind the backs of public opinion and we should not repeat that situation."
"I do not want to hold Mr Patijn responsible - and he is making signs to me that he agrees that he is not responsible for the Maastricht Treaty - but we shall have to take clear decisions if we are not to reach the same situation."
"As for the content, we were meant to be taking a great step towards political union, with an institutional equilibrium, overcoming the democratic deficit."
"And that is not going to be the case and we are taking small steps; not even the European Parliament is able to produce an opinion on revision of the Treaties in the future."
"We do not think that there is going to be genuine codecision in areas as important as the budget and legislative processes."
"The European Parliament has a certain mistrust, and we have to take major steps forward towards political union."
"We are not speaking corporately of the importance of the European Parliament but we are talking here about Europe's democratic fabric."
"On the common foreign and security policy, there is no political will to take those steps and, as for promoting economic and social policies at the service of the ordinary people, we are very much afraid that we are not going to achieve this."
"There will definitely be a chapter on employment and a social protocol will be incorporated - probably better than the previous one - but the main objective is not rhetoric about employment or limited social policies of an 'assistance type' , nor creating social and economic policies which are not totally subordinate to the convergence criteria."
"I do not have enough time to talk about the lack of solutions for the problem of enlargement."
"This is a purely transitory situation but I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we should not leave everything for the Conference to the last minute and I hope that we are not going to end up with a few crumbs which will be no solution for the problems of the European Union, its peoples and its citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the issues at stake in this debate is the role that we, as the European Parliament, ascribe to ourselves."
"Are we to adopt an amicable stance towards the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam - a quiet and unassuming attitude?"
"Are we to play the part of supplicants, imploring the Council to grant us more rights?"
"Are we prepared to go to any lengths - short of rebellion - in order to win a little more or lose a little less as a reward for good behaviour?"
"Are we an extension of the national governments, hastening to show obedience by refraining from making essential demands of the Intergovernmental Conference?"
"No indeed - that is certainly not our role!"
"I am convinced that the very specific task of the European Parliament, here and now, is to do some straight talking, because what is at stake is nothing less than the ability of the European Union to face the future."
"What is at stake is the establishment of a real European democracy, a balance between political and economic integration in Europe, and the development of a common, non-military foreign policy."
"What is at stake is a total European perspective that will enable the Union to be enlarged."
"However, when I turn to consider the proposals which have been tabled so far, I really have to conclude - and I do so with a good deal of dismay and concern - that the governments of the Member States are in the process of reforming the European Union in a way that will further erode democracy, transparency and openness, replacing them with technocratic, intergovernmental procedures - supposedly in the interests of greater efficiency - and by doing so will jeopardize the original concept of developing European democracy."
"The draft treaty that has been submitted is not an adequate response to the social, environmental and democratic crisis in which the Union finds itself; not only is it inadequate in terms of reform, but it is also steering us in the wrong direction."
"Statements on human rights and non-discrimination are not worth the paper they are written on unless there are legally enforceable guarantees."
"Freedom of movement of persons - one of the greatest benefits that the European Community has to offer - is to be postponed indefinitely."
"The so-called communitization of elements of the third pillar is a pig in a poke, because the introduction of the qualified majority principle is not coupled with codecision powers for the European Parliament and competence for the European Court of Justice."
"If you look at Chapter H, you will see that the opposite is true: the remit of the Court of Justice is being reduced."
"It is planned to expand Europol and give it operational responsibilities without extending the mechanisms for democratic supervision."
"This is an erosion of the principles of government by the rule of law!"
"A common foreign policy must be a policy for peace and security, with the aim of setting up a Europe-wide security system; integration into the WEU is exactly what we do not need, and would in fact represent a step towards the militarization of the European Union, which used to be a community dedicated to promoting peace."
"Another revealing feature is the obvious purpose of the objective of full employment: the promised chapter on employment has become a piece of high-sounding political verbiage without any binding force - the height of irresponsibility, given the mass unemployment that we face."
"So it will scarcely come as a surprise that the European Parliament may not get the additional rights that were spoken of by the third great European of the week, Elmar Brok, but may in fact end up with fewer rights, for example in the budget."
"Instead of rejoicing, we ought to be on red alert, because this Maastricht Treaty Mark II will make the future of Europe less secure."
"(Applause from the Green Group)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council - as well as the chairman of the representatives negotiating the new draft treaty - whether he has noticed the rare degree of unanimity which has so far echoed around this House in our comments on what is taking place, and on the draft text which he himself has referred to in optimistic terms, unless I am mistaken."
"The reaction in the House seems to me to indicate the level of concern felt in Parliament, concern expressed likewise by the Commission, moreover."
"I know that the work is to be completed this weekend; let us hope that the draft treaty will be available in time for us to respond in detail on the individual points at our earliest opportunity, in June, prior to the Amsterdam summit."
"But let me issue a word of warning in a political vein, as other colleagues have done, Mr President-in-Office."
"Please remember: 16 and 17 June represent an important stage, of course, the stage at which you had hoped to conclude these negotiations."
"It seems to me, however, that you have reached it in the worst possible way, through a series of set-pieces, with only minimum agreement on the minimum content of a revised Maastricht Treaty."
"Without going into detail, I would merely ask you whether you think that 16 and 17 June are the sole opportunity to finalize this text, as if agreement among 15 Heads of State and Government were in itself sufficient and there were no need - as we saw with Maastricht - for as much public endorsement as possible in our Member States. What, I wonder, will the people stand to gain, if the treaty reform is to take the shape that is now emerging in a piecemeal way?"
"Never before has European foreign and cooperation policy been as negative as in recent years, since the CFSP was codified, and never before has it led to such political inertia."
"Your response to this situation is to strengthen intergovernmental mechanisms wherever possible, and even to propose that the whole affair should be managed by a middle-ranking official."
"On all the other issues, your response is not a political one: it is a technical response, a weak one which we fear will not be supported by our citizens."
"Please think this through and bear in mind that, if there is not yet sufficient substance, 17 June might perhaps not be the last opportunity to finalize the new draft treaty."
"I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Oreja will forgive me for highlighting the discrepancy between the broad optimism of the former and the deep concerns - the realism, perhaps - of the latter."
"Of the two positions, one is obviously forced, to put it mildly."
"What kind of European Union is emerging, Mr Oreja?"
"Certainly not a political union which faithfully reflects European ideals, and certainly not a social Europe which is more than a mere talking-shop, given that certain nations are still putting obstacles in the way of innovative solutions to the tragedy of growing unemployment."
"The social clause alone is not enough, and nor is the social protocol; there is little cause to be optimistic concerning the outcome of the Amsterdam European Council next month."
"There is a risk that the IGC, which it appears has to end by a certain date, come what may, might achieve very little and could fall flat after all; but why not postpone it, given the likelihood of a minimal outcome?"
"Reading between the lines of the Noordwijk summit, one realizes that the European Union might turn out to be nothing but a 'ministocracy' ."
"How else is one to interpret the fact that the people negotiating the institutional reforms - and not only those - are government representatives, unelected by the people and responsible for rampant bureaucracy?"
"And how much attention is being paid to the fears and anxieties of the 370 million EU citizens in this process?"
"Fifteen Heads of Government, plus 15 Foreign Affairs Ministers, met for five hours without clearly tackling and resolving even one of the difficulties which have been holding up treaty reform for a year."
"What kind of Europe are we building?"
"Certainly not one which interests our citizens, whose concerns lie elsewhere: the unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and violence which are afflicting all the EU countries."
"So is it really necessary to enlarge the Union before deepening it?"
"Or rather, is there not a need to make it function better and equip it to meet the challenges, both internal and external, that are now confronting it?"
"No new accession can be properly dealt with until the institutions have been thoroughly overhauled to allow for greater political integration."
"The Union must be deepened economically and politically on the basis of a strong political blueprint, otherwise that much-vaunted economic and social cohesion will become nothing but a sad, pathetic mirage and Europe, perhaps, a dream to be postponed yet again."
"Mr President, I am pleased that good progress appears to be being made."
"That is no doubt down to the skill of the Dutch presidency but I would also suggest that it has something to do with fact that in the United Kingdom there is a new government."
"This government is practising what it preached in opposition and has determinedly opened a new chapter in its relationship with the rest of the European Union."
"To date, and particularly in the so-called non-paper, there is a clear evidence of progress being made: the incorporation of a social protocol into the Treaty proper, the creation of the employment chapter, sensible extension of qualified majority voting, tougher provisions against fraud, the commitment to extend co-decision powers with Parliament, more practical arrangements for CFSP and recognition of the anti-discrimination issue as the hallmark of a democratic, free society."
"All these are positive measures and we should not underestimate their significance."
"As has been said, there are still difficult issues which need to be resolved: free movement, the future of the WEU, the number of Commissioners and the vexed issue of flexibility."
"But what is singularly impressive at this point is the genuine desire among all the Member State governments for a real agreement to be reached."
"We should celebrate that fact."
"If agreement can be reached at Amsterdam, it will give us a base to go forward and to tackle so many of the issues which the people of Europe are concerned about."
"It will give us a base to reform the common agricultural policy, a base to complete the single market and generate jobs and growth."
"It will give us a base to create a citizen's Europe and it will give a base to prepare for the process of enlargement which is the next big issue on Europe's agenda."
"However, I have to say that is not enough."
"I sincerely hope that careful note is taken of the comments from Members of this House today."
"It is not simply enough to have a Treaty on which there can be a minimalist agreement."
"We need a Treaty which inspires people, which pulls people behind it, a Treaty which can point us to a much better future and inspire hope and confidence."
"A minimalist agreement will not achieve that."
"That is why it is so very important that note is taken of the comments here."
"Let us hope that this agreement will not only be one which this Parliament can meekly accept but one for which we can be positively enthusiastic."
"Mr President, after the informal European Council meeting in Noordwijk, the Dutch presidency said that the discussions had been constructive, and that the Heads of Government were determined that there should be an Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Dutch Prime Minister subsequently announced that a decision had already been taken to strengthen the position of the President of the European Commission."
"This sounds all well and good, but there is one point I would make here, in line with the criticism voiced by Mr Brok."
"To decide that the President of the Commission should be proposed by the Council, subject to the approval of the European Parliament, and to give him the possibility of recruiting his own Commissioners is certainly putting him in a much stronger position."
"But to then immediately decide to appoint a secretary-general for foreign policy at the Council means that while the Commission President's position has been strengthened, the position of the Commission itself has been weakened."
"The Commission President has been given proper attire, while the four Commissioners responsible for foreign policy have been stripped of their clothes."
"I would remind you that Parliament has rejected the idea of having such a secretary-general at the Council on many occasions."
"It is a bureaucratic and technocratic solution to a political problem."
"We also wonder whether future Commission Presidents will be able to dismiss individual Commissioners?"
"Parliament has always proposed that it should have the right to dismiss Commissioners who fail in their duties - what is the position on this?"
"My second point concerns another subject of great interest to the House: making the Union more transparent and democratic."
"Parliament currently has the final say on around two thirds of the legislation and two thirds of the budget."
"I understand that a certain amount of progress is to be made in the area of democratic controls on legislation, but I have also heard that at least 35 to 40 subjects are to continue to require unanimity."
"This appears far too great a number to me to be talking about a breakthrough, and the situation seems even worse when I hear that although some of the police and justice policy is to be communitized, Parliament's role is not to be strengthened accordingly."
"I find this totally unacceptable, and I think we must warn the Dutch presidency that we will not tolerate another hole in the fabric of European democracy."
"The reports about Parliament's budgetary powers are even worse, indicating that there is no chance that the House will be given the final say on the compulsory section of the budget."
"This involves the agriculture budget and the EDF, a total of ECU 50 billion."
"It is quite ridiculous that such a huge amount of money should remain outside Parliament's democratic control."
"What is even more serious is the fact that the Dutch presidency also opposes the idea of Parliament having such powers, and made its views so plain that a motion was adopted in the Netherlands parliament calling the Dutch presidency to order on this point."
"Moving on to the subject of vote weighting, the current arrangements are generally regarded as satisfactory, so any reasons for changing them need to be good ones."
"We feel it would be best if we could maintain a fair balance between the large and small Member States after enlargement."
"What we do not want is for the large states to shout down the small, as happened 40 years ago."
"As the largest of the small countries, the Netherlands must stand up for them and for itself, otherwise there will be a domino effect."
"One final comment about the lack of transparency."
"I understand that documents on legislation are to be made available sooner for the general public, the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"We welcome this as an urgently needed measure."
"However, there does not seem to be any similar good news about the openness of the Council's decision-making process."
"Is it to carry on taking decisions on legislation behind closed doors, like some sort of Politburo?"
"How can we ask the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to democratize if we do not do this ourselves?"
"To sum up, Parliament will be happy to support the Council on any progress it makes in the Amsterdam Treaty, but we can never accept its failure to reduce the democratic deficit in Europe, which is even being increased in certain areas."
"I wish the Dutch presidency every success, but the question is not whether we will have an Amsterdam Treaty, but whether we will have a fair and acceptable treaty in which everyone is respected, not least by our own citizens."
"Mr President, if we are realistic, we cannot have any particularly high expectations of this review of the Maastricht Treaty."
"The Dutch presidency has never given the impression of wanting to make any over-ambitious changes, but instead seems happy to make more modest collective progress."
"It has been hampered in this by the elections in the United Kingdom and France, and the only question now is whether even modest progress is still possible."
"In my opinion, this review of the Maastricht Treaty has come too early, and has now been completely overshadowed by the significance of yesterday's NATO meeting in Paris."
"Let there be no mistake about it, this was our guarantee of stability in Europe."
"Nevertheless, we still have to ask ourselves what else the Union can do to make itself a fit place to live in for its new inhabitants, and the answer, I think, is to provide greater security."
"Countries should be more prepared to cooperate, but the question is how."
"Why are we always given technical answers to our requests, as Mr Dell'Alba said, rather than political, practical ones?"
"Why does no one ever say that we are going to clamp down on hashish coming from Morocco via Spain and France, heroine from Turkey via Germany, and cocaine from Surinam via the Netherlands?"
"The Dutch presidency recently received questions on this from Mr Donnay and Mr Pasty, but it has not responded."
"Are you not brave enough to answer, or is the Dutch presidency hiding something?"
"The Council is largely to blame for the deepening democratic deficit, and I have unfortunately not detected any signs of improvement."
"I also think, and here I totally agree with Mrs Maij-Weggen, that it is not a good sign that the Commission is to be made more efficient by giving its President greater powers."
"This is approaching it from the wrong direction."
"We are starting from the top, whereas in fact we should be cutting down on the number of Commissioners."
"Parliament sees it as a bad omen that it is not to have wider powers when it comes to legislation and the budget."
"However, I am at least confident that this presidency has firm plans to make the Union more governable in order to restore public confidence as we go into the 21st century."
"And we should not be too pessimistic: there are still three weeks to go before the Amsterdam summit, and as Commissioner Oreja said, there is still everything to play for."
"Keep up the spirit of Noordwijk, and try to ensure that the changes made are those we need for enlargement and a stronger role for Parliament."
"I wish you courage."
"Mr President, this is Parliament's last opportunity today before the June summit to say exactly what it wants, and I shall be focusing my attention on the area of justice policy."
"I have to say, looking at the documents available on this, that I have very mixed feelings."
"Fighting crime and police cooperation are not to be communitized, and I would ask the presidency to explain how you can fight crime effectively at European level without unanimity."
"Parliament's position in the area of justice policy under this pillar is also still too weak."
"The Court of Justice has fared rather better, though there are still a number of points to be criticized."
"And although the communitization of asylum and immigration policy is a good thing in itself, it does also raise certain questions."
"I feel, like Commissioner Oreja, that this is the absolute minimum that needs to be communitized, and if even this is not done, then the whole thing is likely to be a disaster."
"Mr Patijn, my fellow countryman, knows the expression 'the emperor's new clothes' : it is probably universally understood."
"He knows that in the story the people rejoiced, but in fact the emperor had no clothes on at all, and this is what he must ensure does not happen here."
"I wish him fortitude in the forthcoming negotiations."
"My thanks to you and to Hans Christian Andersen."
"Mr President, there has been quite a lot of talk about the citizens of Europe, but what we know already and what has been confirmed to us today about the evolution of the IGC negotiations leads to an inevitable conclusion: that the reservations, doubts and criticisms raised by the previous revision of the Treaties have not been taken into account."
"Worse still, it seems that we are still heading in the same direction!"
"Above all, that is clear from the refusal, as we know, to reconsider seriously the most relevant and consequential problem which, as everyone knows, is EMU itself."
"Again we hear of the possibility of including a social protocol in the Treaty and a chapter on 'employment' in the same text."
"This is something that we have asked for consistently but I should like to stress the fact that we should harbour no illusions about the effective scope of that decision, if ever it does come about."
"That is because solving social problems, especially the enormous problem of unemployment, calls, above all, for new macro-economic policies and fundamentally the abandonment of the current monetarist fixation which we are all aware of."
"And that is not being done!"
"There are reasons for apprehension in other areas, too."
"There are no prospects, for example, for filling in the democratic deficits that we are all aware of."
"Once again national parliaments are being forgotten and they will have, as we know, to ratify the revision of the Treaty."
"There are proposals on the negotiating table at other levels which also lead to serious objections."
"For example, concerning the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, and concerning proposals as to the future membership of the Commission, that would, in the long run, lose its universal character, despite being and continuing to be the only institution with the ability to initiate legislation."
"Another concerns strengthened cooperation through the definite type of exclusion which underlies it and which would reveal a trend towards setting up 'directoires' , plus the problem of integrating Schengen into the Treaty."
"Of course, we shall wait for the outcome but, at this moment in time, we cannot hide our considerable nervousness about what is likely to emerge."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Dutch presidency is reluctant to appear before the House."
"There have been numerous delays - and the situation has attracted comment again this afternoon."
"Many Members of the House entirely fail to understand and are highly critical of the presidency."
"But I understand very well - I too would be afraid to appear before the elected representatives of the people of Europe and present them with the likely results of the current Intergovernmental Conference."
"I too would fear that Parliament might recall the promises which were made after Maastricht: promises of creating a political union, of overcoming the democratic deficit in Europe, of establishing a common foreign policy, of finding a balance between economic and political integration and creating the conditions for enlargement."
"But I wonder whether the President of the Council might not be more afraid of Parliament than he needs to be."
"Looking at the motions which have been tabled, it would seem that the majority in the House is afraid that Parliament might end up cast in the role of Don Quixote in a battle of the giants between Member States, Council and Commission."
"In my opinion, there is a much greater danger of the House ending up like Sancho Panza - who was content simply to complain, to hang back eating his lunch, and to stretch himself out under the trees. And in the face of mass unemployment and the tremendous crisis of democracy and credibility in which the Union finds itself, the citizens of Europe would censure Parliament far more heavily for doing that than for taking sides in this historic argument and fighting to ensure that a historic opportunity is not gambled away - which is precisely what is happening now in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This House is not as powerless as it makes itself out to be."
"Should the Commission fail to support us - and for eighteen months it has failed to support us on these issues - then we can send it packing if we summon up the will and the resources to do so."
"We can boycott budgets, we can delay our consent for the negotiations on accession, and we can call on the national parliaments and, of course, the public to form an alliance with the European Parliament."
"But we have to begin by summoning up the necessary courage and strength."
"Whether we are prepared to do so will be the decisive question in the weeks ahead."
"Mr President, I welcome the manner in which the representatives of the newly-elected UK Government have been received by the European Council."
"It is surely clear as we enter a new millennium that Europe is not and cannot be a rigid unification but rather a rich diversification."
"For millenniums bloody wars have been fought to make it a unification."
"They have failed and are bound to fail."
"Surely the way forward is the closest possible cooperation between the European nations, not the incorporation of those nations in a European superstate."
"Europe is not a country, it is a continent and therefore no structures of any known country in the world can be imposed upon it."
"The question of safeguarding external frontiers must be a matter for sovereign states and must be diverse as suits those states in their present circumstances and challenges."
"The fact is that uniformity is not necessarily unification."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this non-paper contains a chapter which claims to deal with an effective and coherent foreign policy."
"It is quite obvious to everyone, I would think, that we are in no position to talk about coherent and effective foreign policy at the present time."
"Whether we look at Albania or at the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we see Europe - where it actually manages to do anything at all - trailing permanently behind."
"The very mention of the Democratic Republic of Congo points up one aspect in particular: at a time when Europe was still in many respects allied with the former regime, a regime which people associated with corruption and personal gain, America was already negotiating with the incoming regime for mining rights and other economic advantages."
"It is clear, therefore, just how important a common and coherent foreign policy is, and - unlike some other people - I believe that the activities of the Dutch presidency have been instrumental in achieving progress on a number of fronts."
"However, various critical observations are in order here."
"In the chapter which sets out to define foreign policy, I am sorry that not enough attention has been given to the question of prevention - how to avert crises, and the need to take appropriate measures - and that the focus is exclusively on the EU and WEU."
"It must also be clear that unity in its broadest, long-term sense cannot be allowed to mean giving the armed forces a greater say within the EU; on the contrary, I believe that civilian elements which are geared to the tasks of peace must be given appropriate weight, in relation to the EU as elsewhere."
"As for the proposals from the troika, in my view it is right to set out what are in some respects transitional measures here, and I do not think that the powers of the Commission are being reduced; on the contrary, I believe that it is also very important for the Commission to be in a position of strength."
"What has been said about the decision-making process is important too."
"However, I do have one criticism here, and I wonder how the presidency sees this point: on the one hand we have unanimity, with constructive abstention, and that is as it should be."
"Then, when we come to implementation, we have decisions by qualified majority, and here there is another opportunity for countries to block the procedure temporarily at least - for national reasons, of course."
"While I appreciate that this is a controversial area, I do not quite see how on the one hand we can have a common foreign policy, while on the other hand this same policy can be obstructed by national interest."
"It is my firm belief that, once decision-making procedures exist, it should not then be possible for individual Member States to block those procedures on grounds of national interest."
"The same is true in relation to the chapter on foreign and security policy, and in other areas too: Parliament's role is grossly undervalued."
"This House has demonstrated - not least through some very recent decisions - that it is prepared to cooperate constructively on foreign policy."
"I would therefore call on the Council to give Parliament a voice - in other words, to give the democratically elected representatives of the people a voice - on foreign policy, as on other issues."
"Mr President, the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference are coming to an end. For the last two years, the negotiators have been looking at the revision of the Treaty on European Union."
"From our point of view, that revision is not going to achieve the aims recommended by the Treaty itself."
"This is a minimalist revision."
"We very much regret this."
"It already seems impossible to reconvert some of the institutions provided for in the Treaty, apart from the fact that no progress has been made on any of the others."
"We must now confer democratic legitimacy on certain bodies with decisive powers and competencies within European Union - which do not have them now - making them more politically responsible vis-à-vis the different Member States."
"In this case, the expectations and ambitions announced in the end will be frustrated."
"The main question that we want to know is whether, since the Maastricht Treaty is complex, and has only been in existence for four years, for the most part against the voiced opinion of many citizens of the European Union's Member States, it will be reasonable to expect more of the IGC."
"Probably not!"
"But all of the consequences of that fact must be borne."
"The process of European construction, as I see it, must be coherent and consistent, in particular because it is aimed primarily at people."
"Like the constitutions of each Member State, European constitutive acts must be realistic and balanced."
"In a nutshell, they must enshrine all the values and principles which unite all European citizens."
"In no circumstances must they be the reflection or desire of a few who, while opposing the others, show that they are unable to carry out that action in practice."
"European construction must be built on the will of the peoples composing it and that same will must never be alienated."
"I should like to conclude expressing the hope that, nevertheless, we will stop speaking about Maastricht in June and that a new era in European construction will begin."
"Mr President, time is short and already a lot has been said about these matters."
"The Intergovernmental Conference raises particular questions, in general."
"Will Europe manage not to turn the allfamous convergence into a linchpin of diluting European unity and a foundation of Euroscepticism?"
"Will it manage not to make millions of jobless the victims of the logic of numbers and international competition?"
"Will it manage to maintain its social face?"
"That is the first requisite. But many other challenges for the future are no less serious."
"The European Union seems to have forgotten the dreams of its founding fathers."
"On the pretext of the imminent enlargement, an enlargement which is morally and practically necessary, planning some institutional changes which substantially undermine the European foundation and increase our democratic deficit."
"The lack of a common foreign policy and security policy will only accentuate domestic problems of insecurity and lead to questions about the famous Community solidarity, while in the international arena the European Union is often left weak and undependable."
"The united Europe of citizens and social justice, the Europe which offers equal opportunities and possibilities to women and men, the one which makes the most of its multicultural and multilingual character, with its dedication to peace and democratic values, that was the original dream."
"If all of these reforms really come about we have no right to sacrifice that Europe on the altar of a technocratic operation of doubtful effectiveness."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"Mr President, while we are still in the final phase of the negotiations, I find it rather difficult to start discussing whether expectations are too high or too low."
"What will the results be?"
"Will they turn out well or badly?"
"This is no good."
"That is no good."
"That could be better."
"I would actually prefer to put the whole issue of the results to one side and make one or two political comments instead."
"First of all, Mrs Green compared me with Commissioner Oreja, and said that while I had given an optimistic version of events, Commissioner Oreja was more realistic."
"I would point out that I was giving a report on the informal Council meeting in Noordwijk, and if I was optimistic I was simply reflecting the mood of the Heads of Government at the meeting."
"If they make optimistic noises, then it is my duty as their humble servant to pass these on faithfully to the European Parliament."
"Mrs Green also said that our agreements cannot be worth much because they have been reached too quickly."
"I think it is a pity that Mrs Green should talk like this, because the fact is that one of the reasons we have been able to reach agreement is because of the new government which the United Kingdom has had since 1 May, and a number of issues that were matters of dispute for the previous government are now no longer so."
"Let me just run through a few of these."
"There is the agreement that human rights principles should be clearly taken into consideration in the Council's political actions and in the Court of Justice's judicial practice, and the acceptance of the anti-discrimination clause."
"The employment chapter is no longer really in dispute."
"Of course, one can always argue about the finer details, but it is mainly thanks to the agreement of the new British Government that it is no longer a controversial issue."
"The incorporation of the social protocol in the Treaty and even the upgrading of its terms and scope are also no longer controversial, again partly thanks to the British Government."
"It is also now cooperating on the inclusion of the principle of openness and transparency in the Treaty, consolidating the legislative role of the European Parliament by extending codecision, a successful agreement on the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice under the third pillar, and a successful agreement on stronger anti-fraud legislation, which may even be improved further still once we have discussed certain amendments from the British Government."
"So when Mrs Green says that this does not amount to much and that it is all uncontroversial stuff, I have to tell her that it is thanks to her party and her Head of Government in London that so many of these issues are no longer in dispute."
"Let me be quite frank about this."
"In my opinion, there are really not many issues left on which the Amsterdam Treaty could come unstuck."
"But the one subject that is likely to cause real problems is the free movement of persons, the communitization of asylum, visa and immigration policy and the application of Community rules and procedures in this context, including the role of the European Parliament, codecision and the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice."
"If there is no agreement on this, it is because the British Government, whose cooperation we have welcomed on all the issues I just mentioned, simply cannot throw off the shadow of Mrs Thatcher and agree to regulate these matters in the treaty."
"It has not given any indication that it finds the presidency's approach acceptable in principle, or that it would consider amendments to take account of the special circumstances of island states or even to recognize the fact that the United Kingdom has a different tradition from the continental states when it comes to identity checks in its own country and at its borders."
"Yet we need the British Government's cooperation on the free movement of persons if a treaty is to be agreed at Amsterdam."
"Without it, I fear the worst."
"Next, job creation."
"For the presidency and the IGC, this is not just a question of having an employment chapter."
"Job creation requires 100 % joint effort from all the organs of the European Union in every area: the operation of the internal market, a liberal trade policy, effective flanking measures in the social field and on cohesion and the Structural Funds, an effective transport policy, and help in establishing trans-European infrastructure."
"These are all elements that have a role to play."
"If we wish to create the right conditions in Europe for the market and the private sector to act as the driving force in generating employment, it is absolutely vital that the impetus and drive should come from every single policy sector, and this is actually what the aim of the employment chapter is."
"It is not simply a vertical process of creating jobs, it is all about creating a horizontal approach to the whole question of our competitive position, competitiveness, economic renewal, broader economic cooperation between Member States and creating the conditions for business to achieve its aims of economic growth and job creation."
"If there is a second issue which concerns me at the IGC, and here I will take up what Mr Brok said, it is whether the Conference will be able to prepare the European Union for the 21st century, and in particular enlargement."
"As an inside observer, I have to say that I am somewhat concerned about this point."
"Institutional reform - in the Commission, in majority decision-making and in the simplification of procedures - will require greater efforts from the Conference."
"We shall have to go the extra mile for it."
"This means that the representatives at the negotiating table will always have to bear in mind, as Mr Brok said, that they are preparing for the 21st century and enlargement."
"We could quite easily carry on discussing until well into the 21st century whether each Member State should have its own Commissioner, but at a certain point, the talking has to stop and the institutions and procedures involved will have to be changed, and we need some indication of how this is to happen at Amsterdam, or even earlier."
"My third point is the issue that was raised by Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Wiebenga, fellow countrymen and soulmates."
"They are concerned about the quality of the constitutional state, as indeed we are, and this is why the Member States and the presidency in particular have insisted that the Treaty should say that the Union is a Union of democratic states determined to maintain the rule of law at a high qualitative level."
"This means that we will do our best to provide stronger legal protection for the weak, for people who suffer wrong, for people who are discriminated against on grounds of nationality, and so on."
"But we must be sure we are not throwing out the baby with the bathwater."
"Mr Brinkhorst mentioned Article H, which is indeed something of a mess. It is a question of how many of the 200 000 asylum cases handled by the courts in Europe are likely to be referred to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which currently handles 200 cases a year, each taking on average two years."
"If we assume that a certain percentage of those 200 000 cases will come to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, what this means is that the judicial process will be totally disrupted, because the cases will take far too long and the national asylum authorities will have to wait perhaps two, three or four years before they know the correct legal position for handing down their own judgments, which in turn will mean that asylum cases in the Member States will also grind to a halt."
"We have to take account of what can realistically be achieved, and this is why I do not feel directly concerned by the criticism which has been voiced about these kinds of issues."
"When it comes to the quality of the constitutional state and legal protection, I am convinced that the presidency and the IGC will make significant progress as regards the position of the Court of Justice on matters currently under the third pillar."
"I would also point out that there is almost complete agreement in the IGC that the European Parliament should have full rights of consultation on intergovernmental matters under the third pillar, whereas at present it has none."
"I occasionally had the impression during the debate that we were not talking about the same treaty, but I suppose this is understandable, since we are of course looking at things from different political perspectives."
"I would assure the House that when the treaty is ready for signature by the Heads of Government, its substance, details and coherence will have been subject to the most rigorous scrutiny."
"The presidency continues to support the proposals it has put forward, and we are delighted that most of them - and I have told you about one exception to this - have met with approval."
"The presidency will be doing everything it can, with the support of the European Parliament and the cooperation of President Santer and Commissioner Oreja, to try to prevent the outcome from being adversely affected in the final weeks of negotiation."
"Mr President, I shall stop there."
"I should like to thank you most sincerely for the time I have been able to spend with you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the speeches we have heard this afternoon, including the one we have just heard from the President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to tell you first of all that this debate has come at a very good moment."
"We are now in the run-up to the final negotiations and the final ministerial meetings were held on 20 May, and the European Council on 23 May, and at this moment in time we are constantly in negotiations."
"Consequently, this debate has been extremely enriching for me."
"I have heard from the different political groups what their concerns are."
"Resolutions have been presented and tomorrow will be put to the vote, and for us they will be a very important reference."
"You can rest assured that the Commission is going to examine the resolutions approved by the European Parliament with all due care."
"I should also like to say that, when I spoke, I did not intend to be either optimistic or pessimistic."
"I just told you how I see the situation at the moment but, above all, I wanted to draw your attention towards the risks that also exist."
"I think that the Presidency has played an important role throughout the recent months, but I should like to point out that, right now, we are on one of those levels from which it would be extremely dangerous to come down."
"That is what I wanted to draw your attention to. Not because the Presidency's document concerns me."
"What would concern me is if the level of the document presented by the Presidency were to be lowered."
"As for the speeches we have heard, I would like to begin with Mrs Green's, in which she referred to the Presidency of the Council and I would like to point out the importance of some of the chapters which Mrs Green mentioned, in particular the fight against discrimination."
"It is one of those subjects which has been dealt with in depth in recent weeks and I think that it is one of those subjects on which a satisfactory solution could be reached."
"Mr Brok referred to the fact that Europe must serve its citizens and he referred to an article which seems to me to be extremely important, namely Article 113."
"I also refer to it and there is an intention to submit it to qualified majority, as well as services and intellectual property."
"This question was not provided for in the Treaty because no problem of this type faced Europe in 1957."
"In 1957, problems affected goods not services."
"But today what is the main aim of trade?"
"Mainly services and intellectual property."
"As a consequence, it would make no sense to distinguish between goods and services and intellectual property."
"Therefore, we must unite to improve the defence of the interests of companies, citizens, Europeans, and therefore I think that it is essential - yet we have not done this so far."
"Mr Brok said that, perhaps, we should think about a protocol with exceptions and that is undoubtedly a very good approach: there should be a general rule with some exceptions, included in a protocol appended to the Treaty."
"Mr Azzolini mentioned that Europe needs a political dimension, and that is a dimension which we really must find."
"Mr Brinkhorst referred in particular to the subject of codecision and referred to one article, which shows that he is very knowledgeable about the subject which we are dealing with at the moment, namely Article H. It is precisely that which, in its current version, would prevent any presentation by the Court of Justice of appeals which would prejudice matters affecting the third pillar."
"That really would be very dangerous, because it would mean cutting off a possibility which those courts have and, if at least that possibility were left to the Supreme Court, that would be a guarantee for citizens and would give the Court of Justice a more important function."
"Mr Puerta referred to a code of confidence which is a central matter."
"What we really need to do is gain confidence."
"Someone else referred to the idea of a pact with the citizens, and that is a phrase that I like and I am particularly sensitive to it."
"I think that is something we have to aim for and I think that that will also be the result of Amsterdam, in other words that we will achieve a pact with the citizens because it is the citizens who must be at the centre of the Treaty."
"I would also like to tell Mrs Roth - who referred to the role of the European Parliament - that the Conference is aware of that and I hope that the number of decisions will be reduced and I also think that we will make progress towards codecision."
"As a consequence, I understand very well - as Mrs Roth said - that you will obviously have to put forward your requirements and insist on them and I hope that they will be accepted in the resolutions and I think that they will be on the negotiating table of the Conference."
"As Mr dell'Alba said, there has been a unanimous decision in this forum, and that is a very important fact."
"This is a fact which the Conference cannot ignore, which the States cannot ignore."
"There is unanimity and a very solid position in many areas and I think that this is something that we will take into account, in particular."
"Other speakers insisted on strengthening the European Parliament's powers and also referred to the fight against crime, the rejection of its 'communitarization' - it is not being 'communitarized' but greater powers are being given - and Mr Miranda spoke of the role of national parliaments."
"I should like to tell him that there is a formula, which is being accepted now, for the role to be played in the future by national parliaments."
"I think it is very important - and this is something mentioned by another speaker - that the European Parliament should give an opinion on modifications to the Treaty."
"This is a claim which the European Parliament has always made and which is now present before us and which I think is extremely important."
"It is very difficult to explain to the public, to the ordinary people, that the European Parliament could not give an opinion on modifications to be introduced into the European Constitutional Charter."
"You know that this is a claim which has the full support of the Commission."
"I did detect a rather excessively pessimistic tone in some of the speeches."
"I should like to say that we still have a lot of room for manoeuvre and the European Parliament must play an extremely important role as it represents national sovereignties and European sovereignty."
"It is extremely important to know what its desires and aspirations are, and that will be recognised in the resolutions as I said, and your opinions will be taken into account at the negotiating table, both by the Commission and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I hope, finally, that these uncertainties mean that we really are bent on creating a fairer, freer and more supportive Europe."
"Thank you very much, Mr Oreja."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m."
"Excessive deficits and economic policies (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the report (A4-0181/97) by Mr Christodoulou, on the recommendation for second reading (A4-0172/97 by Mr Christodoulou, and on the report (A4-0184/97) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Monetary and Economic Affairs and Industrial policy, on excessive deficits and economic policies."
"Mr President, I only have one minute to speak but I should like to thank Mr Christodoulou and Mrs Randzio-Plath for their proposals concerning upgrading the role of public investment in a period in which untrammelled profit-making and obsession with the market characterise the European Union's economic and social policies."
"Mr Christodoulou's amendments go in a positive direction compared with the Council's position and that is why we are supporting them."
"The same can be said for some of the ideas outlined by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"However, the attempts by the rapporteurs to make the notorious Stability Pact acceptable are not enough and the same is true of the general directions taken by the economic policy of the European Union."
"The very serious problems of development, the drop in productive investment, rocketing unemployment, widespread poverty and the complete paralysis of Europe's social protection system will go on growing."
"The marginalization of countries and economies and worse labour relations will be the immediate effect of the policy now being pursued by the European Union."
"It is clear, Mr President, that this social and economic model is completely contrary to workers' interests, and that is why we shall fight to overturn it."
"We shall step up this fight however we can."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is right that we should deal jointly with the stability pact and the broad economic policy guidelines."
"Already last year, the House was advocating a policy mix as a means of moving beyond the obsession with stability."
"At this very moment, Lionel Jospin is in the process of winning an election in France on a platform which includes the demand that European stability policy should be integrated into an economic regime."
"It is also high time, I believe, that the Commission abandoned its blind belief in neo-liberalism and, instead of accepting a downward spiral of competitive deflation and fiscal dumping, changed course to return to and build on the ideas of Brüning, to create a situation and a policy that would take us beyond Keynes."
"Mr Christodoulou, with his banker's intuition, rightly saw the error of the view expressed by one Member who said - not today, but in relation to these decisions - that even symbolic texts merited recognition."
"To recognize texts that were merely symbolic would be to destroy our credibility, and credibility cannot be earned through the kind of automatic, mechanistic approach that amounts to policy by numbers."
"It cannot be earned by strangling investment in the name of saving."
"I should also like to mention another aspect which is dear to Mr Christodoulou, and that is territorial integrity."
"It should be dear to us too, in the light of the increasingly bitter social divisions in our countries."
"Anyone attempting to build on a stability policy that is not rooted in consolidation of the economy, socioenvironmental development and genuine economic convergence, and which does not serve the ultimate goal of implementing Chapter 10 of the Delors White Paper, must be prepared to face opposition."
"They must be prepared to be sent packing: and, as we have heard today, there are people ready and willing to do just that."
"Mr President, the stability pact needs to put the lid on any possibility of an over-flexible budgetary policy."
"Why?"
"Primarily because the no-bail-out clause in the Treaty is going to be a paper tiger in practice."
"The European Union is clearly going to be taking a serious risk if it follows the timetable for EMU in the Treaty."
"Various Member States are currently performing gymnastics with their accounts in order to meet the EMU criteria, but this has absolutely nothing to do with genuine convergence, as we shall see once EMU is a reality."
"If there is an economic recession around 1999, many of the EMU states will go into the red, and they will do anything they can to avoid sanctions."
"As it currently stands, the Council regulation allows for the possibility of manipulating reductions in gross domestic product, and Mrs Peijs and I have tabled two technical amendments on this point."
"The Council must define in more detail the method to be used for calculating the reduction in GDP, so as to exclude deflationary creative accounting."
"It is not a good sign that the Commission failed to do anything about this when it was pointed out by statisticians after Noordwijk."
"Indeed, the way in which this regulation has been handled so far hardly inspires one with confidence."
"Could I urge the Commissioner to pay more attention to building confidence in future?"
"Eurosceptics cannot be expected to believe sales patter for the euro and EMU, and I have yet to meet a Dutchman, German or Belgian who would be prepared to trade in his currency for a soft euro."
"Mr President, the stability pact throws up a whole series of unresolved questions, ranging from the moral aspects of economic policy to institutional considerations."
"Given the need for budgetary discipline, we should support the automatic and systematic imposition of penalties in the form of non-interest-bearing deposits, and their subsequent conversion into fines."
"Too great a degree of flexibility here would open the way to all kinds of excuses, and that is not what we are seeking."
"However, what we must reject entirely is the plan to distribute sums received from a Member State which is in breach of the budgetary rules amongst those which do not have excessive deficits and which participated in the decision to impose the fine."
"Such a procedure would almost smack of sharing out the spoils."
"Instead of aggravating a country's already difficult situation, we ought to seek ways of helping it to overcome its problems, and that should also be the thinking behind the imposition of a penalty deposit."
"If monetary union is to become a reality, lasting stability is absolutely essential."
"But sanctions imposed by the Council would have no bite without some means of enforcement - and that would mean at least the possibility of bringing an action before the Court of Justice."
"On the other hand, if such measures were to go significantly beyond the coordination of economic policies which is provided for in Article 103, this would require an amendment to the Treaty, with all that such a step involves."
"It is hard to envisage achieving a stable monetary union without, at the same time, institutionalizing cooperation and coordination."
"Anyone who supports monetary union must also support the creation of the conditions for achieving and maintaining it."
"But this will require a new, interventionist element in economic and budgetary policy, an element that will involve amending primary legislation and will therefore, under the terms of Article N, have to be dealt with by the national parliaments."
"Mr President, as in the first round of discussions, I would criticize the calls from the Commission and now also the Council to promote regional differences in wages within the Union."
"I have to say that I completely fail to understand why the Commission wants this, and what its purpose is in calling for it."
"I can well imagine that Germany's problems after unification have left an impression, but I think it is going much too far to extrapolate these problems into a general European policy."
"And I find it particularly unacceptable since there is no mention in the proposals of any framework for doing this."
"Even in the discussion last time, the Commission failed to indicate which policy this was meant to be part of."
"The matter is all the more serious given that we know that after EMU we can expect that competition between the Member States, which is often much greater than people realize, will be focused on social security and wages."
"I can only assume that the Commission actually thinks that such competition should now also be encouraged between regions within Member States once EMU is in place."
"I should be extremely grateful if the Commission could explain what the thinking is behind this, and what policy it is pursuing."
"As you know, business relocations in the Union are becoming increasingly common, more so within the Union than to other countries, and many of these are associated with competition or dumping."
"Hoover moved to England because that particular area had its back to the wall and accepted below-normal wages and much poorer social conditions than in the rest of the country."
"It accepted this because it could see no other option, and it all formed part of the 'level playing field' policy."
"Such a framework is completely absent from the Commission's present approach, and Parliament has no choice but to oppose it as it stands."
"Mr President, our colleague Mr Christodoulou has drawn up a very interesting report on economic policy, most of which can readily be endorsed."
"However, there is one detail which requires closer examination."
"The report stresses strict adherence to the 3 % limit for budget deficits."
"Firstly, the 3 % figure beyond which strict penalty interest becomes payable has been selected arbitrarily."
"It could just as well be 4 %, 2 1/2 % or even zero."
"A certain flexibility is therefore called for."
"Secondly, after the third stage of EMU, national economic policy-makers will have their hands tied."
"It will no longer be possible to use exchange rate adjustments between euro currencies."
"The European Central Bank will dictate monetary policy."
"The only remaining weapon will be budgetary policy, which it should be possible to use, especially in countries with low rates of public indebtedness, to fund investment which would generate employment."
"For this reason I tabled an amendment in the Economic Affairs Committee, but it was rejected."
"It read as follows: 'Urges the Council and Commission to monitor closely the development of the various Member States' budget deficits with the aim of making it possible, in order to tackle exceptional economic problems and serious mass unemployment, to waive the 3 % deficit limit provided that the deficit does not exceed this objective throughout an economic cycle.'"
"Since similar matters will be considered later in the Fourçans report, certain of my amendments to which have been adopted, I support Mr Christodoulou's ideas."
"Although the unemployment rate is not among the convergence criteria, employment policy ought to be a central concern to us Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group agrees with the basic analysis presented by the Commission on the major thrust of the policies of the Member States and the Community as a whole, which is the subject to which I shall be referring implicitly."
"We think that we have to deepen some aspects."
"The completion of Economic and Monetary Union and the introduction of a single currency mean that we need an authentic European Union economic and monetary policy."
"The Commission has shown itself to be over reluctant and in its next proposals it will have to offer us some guidelines for a genuine European economic and monetary policy to accompnay EMU and the single currency."
"We also want to draw special attention to the need for creating favourable conditions for a more competitive productive system but we do not agree with the means proposed by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"We do not think that the right way to do this is stepping up public investment or intervention in the public sector - which would only lead to undesirably higher deficits which would make EMU impossible - or by discriminating in favour of public investment as if that would lead to an improved productive system that would be competitive internationally and create more jobs."
"On the contrary, we believe that we should head for a more open and more competitive framework, with a system which promotes private initiative, private investment and entrepreneurial initiatives."
"This is the way to create jobs and achieve greater economic progress."
"Mr President, it is a shame that the general guidelines on the economy constitute a breach of duty."
"It is the duty of the Council to admit the failure of a policy when that failure has occurred."
"The European Union's employment policy, explained most extensively in the White Paper on competitiveness, productiveness and employment, has been an utter failure."
"We were meant to have reduced unemployment to about half of the levels of 1995 by the year 2000."
"The year 2000 is nearly upon us and unemployment has not come down nor is it likely to reduce."
"The least we could have expected to be done as a result of the new guidelines would have been to sound an alarm signal and admit failure."
"Instead of that, all that has happened is they have again trotted out an apology for an excessively restrictive policy, which this Stability Pact is most likely to perpetuate."
"Obviously, we have reached a point when we have to get out of this dialogue of the deaf, Mr President."
"But when officials lose their hearing, democracy loses its dignity."
"Already one prime minister has fallen after losing his hearing and others will do so in turn, Commissioner, and then perhaps we shall reach understanding as simple citizens and not as officials."
"Mr President, following what the Commissioner has said today, I really must make the point once again that we have more than 20 million people out of work in Europe, with one in five young people unemployed and unable to find work, and I have to say that the Commission's recommendation for the broad economic policy guidelines can only be described as toothless."
"It offers no real prospects for working people in Europe."
"It is for that reason, and in order to focus attention once again on the employment issue, that the trade unions in Europe have called today's day of action."
"It is a protest and a warning which we, as parliamentarians, must take very seriously indeed if we wish to ensure social stability and social peace."
"Not without reason, the trade unions are looking to Amsterdam to make good the shortcomings of Maastricht."
"A virtually exclusive focus on monetary value, stability and consolidation is too narrow."
"If we fail to persuade the Council to make an active employment policy part of the broad guidelines for economic policy, and if we fail to create a policy mix under Article 3 so that we achieve the type of growth that generates jobs, the consequences will be a setback for Europe and a risk of conflict."
"I welcome the clear line taken by the rapporteur on this question and her call for the guidelines to be more binding - something that the Commission was obviously unable to insist upon."
"Mr President, the Commissioner, Mr de Silguy ended his speech today saying that jobs would not be created by decree."
"I should like to remind him, on the other hand, that unemployment can be created by decree and that is what we, in the Socialist Group, want to avoid."
"The Stability Pact was not foreseen in the Maastricht Treaty nor was it necessary in our opinion."
"What was written there already wisely decided how the economic situation of countries joining the single currency would have to evolve."
"For this Pact, which has no legal base, to be politically more acceptable the Council has added to the title the word 'Growth' without actually changing the content of the document."
"What we are now demanding is that the proposals put forward and which have been translated in the Christodoulou and Randzio-Plath reports, as well as greater emphasis on employment, should be accepted."
"The Stability Pact proposes sanctions and automatic fines which we regard as unacceptable."
"The institutionalization of a process of inter-institutional decision making, as proposed by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and integrating the Council, Commission and the European Parliament, will give the citizens of Europe the guarantee that rigour will be allied with growth and job-creation."
"Mr President, I shall try to answer all of the questions put to me during this debate, in two parts."
"I shall take the questions in order and I would ask members of the European Parliament to excuse me if, in the time allotted to me, I do not manage to answer with precision all of the questions put to me."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, - and here I am also answering Mr Ettl - the Commission has already taken up, in its proposal on the guidelines, much of your resolution on the annual economic report."
"I remind you that we have, at your request, proceeded to informal consultations before even presenting our proposal."
"Now the main guidelines have been defined and the recommendation is there on the table."
"The debate now is in the Council, I would say."
"And I think it is more operational and effective to go in the direction recommended by the Parliament and to support the advances made by the Commission in its recommendations in order not to run the risk, as we did last year, of seeing the Council adopt a more restrictive stance than you would want."
"Mr Christodoulou, I am going to reply to the problem of Amendment 4(2) which you have raised. I can tell you that, having looked at it again and thought further about it, during the suspension of the sitting, the Commission still cannot take on board this part of Amendment 4, as it is a subjective assessment which does not belong in a regulatory text."
"Furthermore, I would say that the notion is already contained in the wording of Recital 10."
"Finally, Mr Christodoulou, the expression 'inopportune pressure' seems to be unnecessarily provocative and I am astonished that a former eminent governor of a central bank should give in to such temptation."
"Mr Donnelly, first of all I would like to tell you that it seems to me that the Commission has done all it could to involve the European Parliament in the preparation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I have worked it out: this is the sixth time since the month of February that I have come before the European Parliament or one of your committees."
"And I would add that, as far as the trilogue is concerned, the fact that it met at all is thanks to the Commission's action."
"I would also add that the amendments accepted by the Commission, following the European Parliament's first reading, have been taken up by the Commission and accepted by the Council."
"Therefore, I do not see why the same should not be true of the second reading."
"Allow me, Mr Donnelly, to tell you that I do not share your feeling about the deflationary effect of the Stability and Growth Programme."
"The budgetary consolidation, under way, favours what in economic jargon is called 'crowding in' of investment."
"Investment in equipment will increase by 4.8 % in 1997 and 6.3 % in 1998."
"I should remind you that a 6 to 7 % investment growth per annum should make it possible to sustain medium-term growth of 3 to 3.5 %, which should create jobs at a rate of 1 to 1.5 %."
"The Stability and Growth Pact does make it possible to recover the room for manoeuvre which did not exist, and to avoid the monetary policy from becoming overburdened, which would lead to an obviously overly restrictive policy mix."
"I would add that the Stability Pact does allow budgetary flexibility in that, when structural budgets are balanced, during slow-down periods, it will be possible to play with all automatic stabilisers."
"I have just given an economics lesson but in simple terms it is a question of knowing how to finance investment, be it public or private, when today, with the level of deficits that we still have, more than half of household savings are absorbed by debt repayment."
"Yes, we are in favour of financing investment but we are also in favour of reducing public deficits which would make it possible to use that money to finance investments rather than finance state debts."
"I can assure you, Mr Donnelly, that the Commission is taking its responsibilities."
"It took them when it presented the Green Paper. It also took them when it presented regulations on the Pact on Stability and Growth."
"It also took them when it presented its regulations on the legal status."
"And it also took them in the interinstitutional dialogue in order to make sure that the European Parliament's view was heard as much as it could."
"Mr von Wogau, the golden rule for public investment, which you mentioned earlier, will be achieved in 1998."
"Judging by our predictions, public deficits, if the policy is unchanged, will be 2.5 % in 1998 and public investment growth will be between 2.5 and 2.8 %."
"I think I replied to your other three points in my introductory speech."
"Mr Giansily, I agree with your analysis on the stability and growth policy."
"I would say to Mr Cox that I also share his analysis, which is more or less the same as Mr von Wogau's. Concerning the fines, I think that I replied to your question in my introductory remarks, and the same is true of Mr Lukas."
"Mr Wolf, I think that the policy mix makes it possible to overcome what you call this 'stability fetichism' ."
"Once again a relaxed policy mix is favourable to growth and employment because it makes it possible to relax the monetary conditions."
"In a relaxed policy mix, there is no conflict between the objective of stability and budgetary and wage development."
"There is now a trend towards such a policy mix."
"As for 'economic government' - I do not have 'word fetichism' - call it what you like! What does it matter whether a cat is grey or black as long as it catches mice? - I think that what is important for us today, Mr Wolf, is that we are able to implement what we have set up."
"We have set up instruments for economic coordination. It is now for the policies to add a practical content to this and to implement what we have put into place."
"Mr Blokland, on the important point that you raised, concerning what you call accounting 'somersaults' , I would like to tell you that there are a certain number of rules. We are not governed by the law of the jungle here."
"Rules are the European system of national accounts, the SEC, SEC 79 to be exact, as well as a Directive on GDP."
"These instruments properly define GDP and there is nothing to add to the Stability and Growth Pact on that score."
"The Commission is currently backing all of the efforts by statisticians who are trying to improve GDP calculations."
"This is a very important job. But I do not think it is the place, in a debate on the Stability Pact, to refer to these findings."
"You also say that the public are not going to believe in the euro."
"I disagree and reassure you that the public do believe in the euro - at least, according to the opinion polls which we regularly hold."
"Mr van Velzem, you referred to the very interesting problem of the regional differentiation of salaries."
"I think that it is a normal economic mechanism which is contested by no economist."
"The best proof is that if regional differentiation of salaries did not take place, there would be major regional unemployment."
"I am thinking in particular of the Mezzogiorno."
"It is probably no fluke that Italian trade unions recently acknowledged regional differentiation and accepted it."
"Mr Ilaskivi, you wanted to know why the figure of 3 % was chosen."
"There are several explanations for this."
"One which comes to mind is that when there is nominal growth of 5 %, 3 % real growth, 2 % inflation, in order to maintain a 60 % GDP debt rate, the public deficit must be no greater than 3 %."
"But the figure is unimportant."
"I personally think that a 3 % public deficit is very high."
"In many of our Member States that means that the state spends 20 % more than it earns every year."
"I would challenge any company, big or small, to survive if it spent 20 % more than it earned."
"Mr Ilaskivi, you also refer to the problem of adjustment in the case of asymmetrical shocks."
"You know that the asymmetrical shocks of the last 25 years have been greatly amplified by divergent policies."
"That will no longer be possible if we have EMU."
"At cruising speed, budgetary stabilizers, political stabilizers and wage adjustment will be enough."
"Mr Gasoliba i Böhm, I cannot fully agree with your claim that growth should not be stimulated through public investment and I am not sure that that will please Mrs Randzio-Plath very much."
"I think that public investment has to be maintained and I think that we have to have the major networks."
"As I demonstrated earlier, in my introductory statement, the future of coming generations, the future of our countries, relies in certain cases on major public investment that only States could afford and to which in any case they would have to contribute."
"That said, the Commission recognizes that public investment has suffered in recent years and that is why it can only deplore the fact that the Council has rejected its proposals concerning the major networks."
"I think that I have answered nearly all of your questions."
"Allow me, in conclusion - and there I will be answering some of the concerns which have been raised, in particular at the end by Mrs Torres Marques, Mr Ettl or Mr Katiforis - first of all to say that the Stability and Growth Pact is nothing more or less than the Maastricht Treaty."
"The Commission has been particularly concerned, during the negotiations, to make sure that nothing is added to what was already foreseen in the Treaty."
"The Stability and Growth Pact brings together two regulations, one based on Article 3.5 and the other on Article 104, which are aimed at making the Treaty provisions operational and quite simply establishing the rules of procedure for the euro."
"I shall conclude by saying that the real problem today is that of unemployment."
"We are perfectly aware of that."
"But we cannot believe that it is possible to create jobs out of thin air."
"We are not going to create jobs, including jobs for the young, unless we give European once again the conditions for healthy and sustainable economic growth. For some years now, thanks to the strategy pursued we have gradually re-established that framework."
"Now we must pursue that effort, and we must crown our success with the introduction of the euro."
"The single currency will definitely provide that framework for stability and growth - words which are not mutually exclusive - and we must also be very much aware of the fact that we have to shoulder our responsibilities vis-à-vis structural unemployment. That calls for structural measures, namely research, education, training - and I think, in particular, that it is very important to lower the tax burdens imposed on labour-intensive industries."
"Thank you, Mr de Silguy."
"Mr Christodoulou has asked for the floor to make a brief comment."
"Mr President, I should like to tell the Commissioner that the Greek text referring to that amendment, which I had asked him to accept, uses the expression 'unjustifiable pressures' , on the exchange market."
"I am sure that any governor of any central bank, whether eminent or not, would use such a phrase quite often."
"The meaning of the phrase 'unjustifiable pressures' in the exchange market is extremely well-known and it is used quite frequently."
"I should also like to tell the Commissioner that the reason why we ask for certain amendments was that we wanted to facilitate implementation of the Stability Pact."
"The Stability Pact, as it stands, is so inflexible that its implementation, in my view and many others who have studied it - and they are practitioners in contact with the markets - we believe that it is not very easy to implement."
"What we tried to do, therefore, was to table certain amendments which would make it easier to implement the Pact and which would make life easier for the Commission."
"But they have not been accepted."
"I hope therefore that, tomorrow, the European Parliament will vote for the Pact so that we can try and make progress, given that it really must be accepted, even in this form."
"However, the Commissioner must remember, when we meet again some time in the future, that there is no way in which the Stability Pact as it stands at the moment can really be implemented."
"It has no political base and, therefore, it seems very difficult for it to be implemented and, as we learned from the financial, monetary and other developments of the early 1990s, in particular 1990-1991, when we have no flexibility, the result is a catastrophe."
"It seems that this lesson has not been learnt by most of those who have presented us with this text and, as a result, we have something which is inflexible and very difficult to implement."
"I hope I am wrong. But I am afraid that I am right."
"Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner once again how much the House naturally appreciates the fact that informal dialogue has been possible with the Commission on issues including the broad economic policy guidelines."
"It would be good to see the Commission supporting the concept of negotiations with Parliament."
"Both the Monetary Committee and the ECOFIN Council have already indicated that they are prepared to give the idea their backing."
"It would mean that it should be possible to include some form of negotiation with Parliament in the process of reporting on and drafting the guidelines, because there is no doubt that, even without specific provision in the Treaty for trialogue instruments, it is still possible for the three institutions to agree on essential policy guidelines, in the interests of tackling mass unemployment effectively."
"It would be helpful if you too were prepared to support this idea, Commissioner."
"In conclusion, I should be grateful to our President if he could ensure that the decisions which we take tomorrow, on matters including the broad economic policy guidelines, are conveyed as quickly as possible to both the Monetary Committee and the Dutch presidency, so that there is enough time for the issue to be referred to and discussed at a dialogue or trialogue meeting."
"Mr President, very quickly I wish to thank Mr Christodoulou and Mrs Randzio-Plath for the excellent cooperation and the work carried out together on these two extremely important documents."
"I hope, while warmly thanking Mr Christodoulou for his efforts, that he will also understand that we have taken on board and had accepted by the Council as many of the amendments as it was possible to have accepted."
"I now think that the compromise on the table is a balanced one and that that should be recognised legally."
"I also think, Mr Christodoulou, that it is sufficiently supple. I recall that, nonetheless, at the basis of the Stability Pact lie the Commission's proposal and initiative and the entire capacity of the Council's decision-making."
"There is also a framework."
"It is now for the politicians to bring it into life."
"Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath, for your remarks."
"I am still open to suggestion and to see in fact how it is possible to involve the European Parliament even more in work on the main guidelines of economic policy."
"I think that we have made a breakthrough this year."
"I think also, when debating the annual economic report, one of your colleagues, Mr Donnelly, made some proposals to improve the procedure. We are thinking about that."
"I shall do so in a constructive spirit, because I think that strengthening dialogue, with greater transparency, is a vital condition now in Europe if we are to have our economic policies accepted by our fellow citizens."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"EU tax systems"
"The next item is the report (A4-0169/97) by Mr Secchi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the report from the Commission on taxation in the European Union: report on the development of tax systems (COM(96)0546 - C4-0054/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to present this report on a topic which I regard as extremely important."
"I should like to say first of all how glad I am that the European Parliament is debating EU tax policy and the development of national taxation systems just two weeks or so before the Amsterdam European Council, since this allows the people's representatives to express their authoritative opinion on a topic which should receive maximum attention on that occasion and, hopefully, be the subject of innovative decisions giving fresh impetus to a policy area which has been stagnating for far too long."
"The Amsterdam European Council will in fact be addressing itself to the action plan for the single market, the purpose of which is to establish the timing and mechanisms for all the measures needed to complete a real single market sufficiently in advance of the transition to monetary union, and before the launch of negotiations on further EU enlargement."
"Naturally, the House endorses this objective and hopes that the results achieved at Amsterdam will live up to the expectations of Europe's citizens and economic operators."
"Fiscal matters are particularly important in this context, in that without better coordination and harmonization in all the areas that are crucial to the smooth functioning of the single market, not only will this market be quite incapable of operating satisfactorily, but the success of monetary union will be jeopardized at the same time."
"This does not in any way mean denying the role of subsidiarity in fiscal matters: serious thought must be devoted to preventing the application of this principle from conflicting with the basic reasons for which it was quite rightly incorporated in the Treaties."
"The Commission's studies and analyses, which were welcomed and examined carefully by Parliament, reveal on the one hand that the situation has gradually degenerated into one of damaging tax competition and, on the other, that a fresh approach is needed, without prejudice to the ultimate objective of abandoning the principle of unanimity for Council decisions in this area, as called for on many occasions by this House."
"In particular, excessive fiscal competition has had - and is continuing to have - adverse effects on the smooth functioning of the internal market, because of the distortions affecting flows of goods, services, capital and business activity; on levels of employment, because of the increased tax burden on the labour factor, as against a substantial reduction of the burden on income from capital; and, finally, on the development of the Member States' tax bases, because of heightened fiscal competition, the net result of which - given the growing international mobility of economic flows and of certain other factors - is to aggravate the situation."
"The analysis of existing taxation systems in the EU has thus revealed that, as a result of the gradual process of completing the single market, no individual Member State is capable nowadays of abolishing all by itself the remaining fiscal barriers hampering the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, nor is it capable of combating fiscal erosion."
"Moreover, in the context of monetary union, where monetary policy will be supranational, independent and targeted at price stability, it will be necessary, in terms of fiscal policy, to reconcile the prerequisites for the smooth functioning of Europe's system of production and its single market with the need for the Member States to maintain a degree of control over fiscal policy in order to preserve income redistribution policies and, more generally speaking, the role of the welfare state. The room for manoeuvre here, even following the Growth and Stability Pact, is very limited indeed."
"Consequently, the only viable solution is to bring tax policies in the sensitive fiscal areas outlined earlier within the auspices of the Community, thereby rectifying the prevailing 'excess of subsidiarity' , which is harmful both to our common interests and those of the Member States."
"However, given that the Member States appear unwilling to change the unanimity rule, one temporary solution to the problem could be, for example, a voluntary restraint agreement in certain specific, clearly defined fiscal areas."
"This is the purpose of the code of conduct laying down a set of common rules guaranteeing forms of coordination between national taxation systems: the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing to the House that certain specific elements for such a code should be drawn to the attention of the Commission and the Council."
"To save time, I shall refrain from reading out these elements. I hope, in conclusion, that the European Parliament will seize this opportunity to convey a clear and convincing opinion in what is a sensitive and complex field, but one which, unless further progress is made, will prevent us from achieving greater economic and social cohesion."
"Mr President, let me say straight away that I am delighted to be here, today, to talk about tax policy: here, because I believe that the European Parliament can play an increasingly prominent and supportive role in this area, and Mr Secchi's report and comprehensive motion for a resolution inspire confidence that this House really can help us to move forward; and today, a day when the problem of unemployment in Europe is at the forefront of our minds, is a particularly appropriate time to discuss taxation."
"Indeed, the link between uncoordinated fiscal policies in the European Union and its serious unemployment situation is becoming increasingly apparent."
"And when we speak of economic management, tax policy - besides the monetary aspects - is undoubtedly a key element."
"The highly divergent trends occurring in Europe as a result of asymmetrical fiscal competition are well known, and Mr Secchi has already referred to them: a fall in taxation on income from capital and a rise in tax on income from labour, the exact opposite of what would help to create employment."
"Once the single currency comes into being, the lack of coordinated taxation on capital income will become even more noticeable."
"The Commission has discussed these issues, over the past year in particular, with the Member States and with Parliament."
"I would remind you of the establishment of the Fiscal Policy Group, which consists of the personal representatives of the Ministers of Finance."
"In fact, leaving aside the difficulties concerning unanimity, the reason why limited progress on fiscal matters has been made in the past is partly, in the Commission's view, that the various proposals were always considered in isolation."
"Therefore, in order to obtain their approval for decisions, it appears necessary to draw the attention of the Finance Ministers to the need for a more overall approach to taxation."
"Alongside the Fiscal Policy Group, consisting of the Finance Ministers' personal representatives, the Commission has also been able to involve the European Parliament in its reflections - and I am very grateful to you for that."
"Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in particular, we have explored fiscal matters on several occasions."
"I regard Mr Secchi's report in particular as a major contribution to our thinking and to the drawing-up of a fiscal action plan aimed at completing the single market and making it truly operational."
"The deliberations which are taking place within both Parliament and the Council have enabled us to produce a blueprint which we hope will lead to tangible results."
"Several ideas contained in the Secchi report have in fact been incorporated into the draft action plan for the single market, adopted by the Commission."
"The elements currently under consideration in the single market action plan are: measures to guarantee proper taxation of cross-border capital flows; measures to abolish taxation in the form of deductions at source of interest payments and royalties between associated companies; a code of conduct designed to limit damaging fiscal competition which impinges on the Member States' tax-raising powers - the points for inclusion in the code, as listed in the Secchi report, will be a valuable contribution here; and measures to eliminate competitive distortions deriving from a lack of harmonization in indirect taxation systems."
"We realize that it will not be easy to reach a consensus in the Council on all these proposals, but I am convinced that this approach should be pursued if we really do wish to make progress on tax policy."
"A coordinated approach is essential, and we shall carry it forward."
"The draft single market action plan also refers to the need to create a common VAT system and to review the Community rules on energy taxation."
"Finally, another point on which I should like to comment, since it is covered in the resolution, is Community action to combat tax evasion and fraud."
"As we all know, international fraud and its perpetrators recognize neither national borders nor tax jurisdictions."
"It is therefore worth stressing the need to improve cooperation between the Member States and to step up our anti-fraud activities."
"In order to give fresh impetus to these actions, the Commission has proposed an ambitious programme known as FISCALIS, which is intended to help the national administrations cooperate with one another by equipping them with the appropriate tools."
"Cooperation, which is already vital now, will become increasingly so with the new VAT system proposed by the Commission."
"FISCALIS will certainly improve the existing VAT systems right away; however, I fear that these improvements will not make up for the shortcomings in the present system."
"These gaps will only be filled by means of the radical overhaul of the system which we have proposed."
"Thank you for having given me an opportunity to give you a brief overview of the development of EU tax systems."
"I assure you that I am very keen indeed to cooperate further with Parliament on this issue."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"Mr President, after Commissioner Monti's good words, approving the work by Mr Secchi on our task to make taxation an element for fostering the creation of jobs and wealth, I would like to emphasize and attach due importance to the fact that the Commission itself suggests that any proposal for Community intervention in taxation matters must be fully in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity."
"It is obvious that taxation sovereignty is shared not only among the 15 Member States but that there are also States, such as Spain, with autonomous communities, such as Navarre, and others, which also have their own ability to decide on taxation policy without any interference with the internal market."
"Furthermore, as the Commissioner knows, once we enter stage three of EMU, the requisite not to exceed 3 % deficits vis-à-vis GDP will oblige all States and all taxation administrations to match spending and revenue."
"In other words, whereas administrations with the ability to spend are free to decide the level of expenditure, they must also have the freedom to decide what type of fiscal revenue they want and how to collect that revenue."
"I fully support the creation of a code of conduct avoiding malpractice in terms of taxation sovereignty but it is not for the European Parliament nor is it the right time to discuss whether the principle of subsidiarity should govern Community action, and we must base ourselves on the current respect for taxation powers."
"It is obvious that, in the future, we must think that only if intervention by the Community genuinely respects the subsidiarity principle can we achieve respectability and applicability of the measures emerging from the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, everyone knows that social employment and budgetary policies are inextricably linked to taxation."
"Tax fraud and evasion, complex systems, no machinery for exchanging information, the increased tax burden on the labour market, the proliferation of 'offshore' areas and more favourable tax regimes and impediments to the circulation of capital as a consequence of different rules for determining taxable objects and tax rates, inter alia, royalties and savings, are all obviously factors which explain the phenomenon of taxation competition."
"Effectively solving all of these problems is something demanded by all those, including myself, who think that the single market, which is both free and fair, also requires fiscal systems that are fair, balanced and neutral."
"How it might be possible to overcome these difficulties was the response which we thought we would be able to find in this report."
"However, we think that this is not quite the case."
"Indeed, we note that, in this context, the Treaty on European Union has gone no further but it already contains solutions which, if put into practice, could solve some of the problems arising from tax erosion, which Community institutions so far seem not to have succeeded in overcoming."
"We are referring to the Directive in Article 220 on the rule for reaching a bilateral agreement on taxation matters."
"As you know, these treaties deal with all categories of income, aimed to eliminate dual taxation, bilaterally harmonizing effective taxation rates at source and in the place of residence and avoiding tax invasion."
"It seems that this analysis has not been carried out and, in particular, assessment of the adoption and application of these treaties in the Community area."
"I am surprised at this, and I am also surprised at the approach to mechanisms, such as those for changing the rule on unanimity over taxation matters, virtually without testing the political and practical consequences of the agreements referred to."
"The Community has gone no further at this moment than a Directive on dividends, on acts of concentrating businesses and on the prices of transfers between associated undertakings."
"Harmonization of taxation on interest has been held up for a long time now in the corridors of politics."
"Therefore, I think that the proposals already tested, but without proven success, should now be renewed."
"This is not, from my point of view, an appropriate response."
"In these circumstances, the effective creation of a single market, the fight against unemployment, the improvement in social conditions and the elimination of impediments to free circulation will be achieved through a concerted policy and incentives to reaching bilateral agreements on taxation matters."
"When, as in this case, fiscal sovereignty is at stake, consultation and consensus - from my point of view - should prevail."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like firstly to say that we welcome the Secchi report and we congratulate the rapporteur."
"That said, the report is extremely ambitious."
"It is good to be ambitious but the Liberal Group, while not necessarily against everything that is in the report, has not yet arrived at a level of reflection which allows us to be for everything in the report."
"Specifically, I will concentrate my remarks on two things."
"The first is in paragraph 3, the reference to extending the powers of the Union in respect of fiscal harmonization, to include not only indirect but also direct fiscal harmonization for company tax, tax on capital and so. We have a huge amount of unfinished business in that area of competence which is greatly developed but still not finished, namely the harmonization or the further approximation, to be more exact, of indirect taxation, like VAT and excise."
"That requires more urgency before we move on to the direct tax agenda."
"My second general point concerns the voting rules."
"We have some concern about whether enough reflection has been given by Parliament - and certainly not enough in our own group - to say that we want to see majority voting in Council also for the area of direct taxation."
"We have brought ourselves to the point of accepting that, although it may not come out of the IGC, for indirect tax, but not yet for direct tax."
"So, we will stop short of fully engaging in all the ambitions of this report, while at the same time not necessarily objecting to the evolution of thinking in that general direction."
"But not right now, not on the eve of the IGC."
"We do not think it is on."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Secchi most warmly on a very fine report, and to thank Commissioner Monti for allowing members of the Economic Affairs Committee to participate in close consultations on taxation."
"In my opinion taxation is precisely one of the issues which calls for action from the European Union."
"The people expect this too."
"Ultimately it could be said that the whole of the European welfare state model depends on how we succeed in adjusting taxation."
"At the moment we are very worried about the level of public expenditure, but we ought to be equally concerned about declining revenues in various Member States."
"I congratulate the Commission on its analysis of the dramatic changes which have occurred in taxation in recent years."
"The central message is that the more mobile production factors move to lower-tax areas, with the result that human labour, which is less mobile, is crippled by an unreasonable tax burden."
"Things cannot go on like this if we wish to eliminate unemployment."
"The more mobile a production factor is, the greater the need for harmonization."
"Capital, for example bank deposits, is one of the most mobile production factors, and taxation of it must be harmonized."
"One of the Commission's touchstones is how successful it will be in securing the introduction of a common energy tax."
"I believe that the European Parliament will do all it can to support the Commission's efforts."
"Mr President, since tax is a pecuniary requirement, imposed by an authority, on individuals or corporations, mainly to meet public expenditure requirements, there is no doubt that taxes, be it in the choice of the type of revenue - direct taxes, indirect taxes, income tax or capital tax, or in that of expenditure, are one of the main instruments of economic intervention by the State."
"On that score, and like monetary or social policy, a prerogative of this type belongs to national sovereignty."
"But what do we see?"
"Not content to impose the respect of arbitrary criteria which have become incoherent in a period of quasi-recession in the name of the convergence pact, which has effectively dictated a strict monetarist economic policy depriving us of the budgetary instrument, Brussels is now attacking the fiscal instrument."
"The role of the economy is to serve society and not the other way around."
"My group is opposed to the confiscation of the fiscal instrument under the cover of harmonization or coordination."
"In this way, rather than an association of sovereign nations making up a single market favouring internal free trade, the Commission is asking the States to give up their prerogatives in order to submit them to the growing control of centralizing and authoritarian European institutions."
"Besides, how can the aberrations in the Commission report be ignored?"
"Allow me to remind you of a few striking examples: How is it possible to coordinate tax systems as varied and different as these without calling into question the balance of each national tax system which is the result of a slow and progressive evolution?"
"How is it possible to reconcile analytical taxes and synthetic taxes, distribution taxes and progressive taxes, declaratory taxes and pay-as-you-earn taxes, taxes on capital and taxes on labour?"
"Why and how is it possible to harmonize 15 national tax systems when specific bilateral tax agreements already pragmatically solve most of the questions?"
"Why do we need to speak of such large disparities when they create unfair tax competition between Member States?"
"To my knowledge none of the 15 Member States of the European Union is a tax haven."
"The reason for expatriation is not so much to seek favourable tax legislation but to seek more interesting employment situations in terms of wages and living standards."
"How can we fight tax fraud at European level without creating a mega-file, when all we need to do is gather together and centralize information gathered in national tax files?"
"What balance can be struck between the necessary decrease in compulsory deductions, in particular for small companies, in order to face up economically to the United States and developing countries, while maintaining budgetary receipts that can enable us to respect the criteria of convergence to which we are subjected?"
"How can compulsory deduction systems be harmonized without calling into question certain social systems, because deductions are taxes but they are also social contributions, by employees and employers alike?"
"To conclude, I should say that, once again, I have a feeling that the idea is to reduce further the small number of national prerogatives remaining for the Member States of this economic union, i.e. the particularly sensitive field of taxation."
"It is very easy to raise the spectre of limited tax pressure in order to get people to swallow tax harmonization."
"But when will what remains of our national sovereignty stop shrinking away?"
"Mr President, quite frankly I have little to add to what the rapporteur and the Commissioner have said."
"But I feel that it is my duty, and a great pleasure, to comment on what has been said by two such illustrious persons, both of whom lecture at Italy's most prestigious economic university."
"I shall therefore attempt to make a brief comment, and am honoured to be able to do so."
"Mr Secchi's report reaches one important conclusion which merits further consideration."
"It says: ' As a result of the gradual process of completing the single market, no individual Member State is capable nowadays of abolishing all by itself the remaining fiscal barriers hampering the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, nor is it capable of combating the effects of tax erosion.'"
"And the rapporteur adds that, if it exceeds certain limits, ' tax competition risks increasing the overall level of fiscal erosion owing to the free movement of capital and the opportunities for fraud and tax avoidance' ."
"The lack of harmonization in tax systems and the resulting fiscal competition are exacerbated by the processes of completing the single market and creating the single currency."
"In taking these steps to complete the internal market, I believe that various requirements need to be reconciled: firstly, national taxation systems must allow economic activity to flourish within the different EU Member States."
"As Mr Monti has just said, the development of tax systems which penalize the labour factor was in fact referred to in the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, and I would draw this crucial aspect to the attention of both the rapporteur and the Commission."
"Mr President, the European Commission was right to remind us in its strategy paper that fiscal policy in the European Union needs to be reorganized."
"In my view, the single market and the free movement of capital, rather than monetary union, are the factors that require us to think harder about tax harmonization, and ultimately to adopt measures that will promote it."
"I am very glad to see that the strategy paper deals with all the areas in which short- and medium-term solutions are required."
"What is needed here is improved cooperation on tax-related matters, a new approach to harmonizing company taxation, and the harmonization of tax on capital income."
"The important point in this context is that we should avoid unfair competition within the single European market between countries seeking to attract inward investment, and that we should help to ensure that tax systems in the European Union are genuinely fair."
"On the other hand, however, we must put a stop to the zero-sum game which is made possible by the existence of tax havens, by the distortion of competition for inward investment on the basis of unfair tax incentives, and by other distortions which, I am sorry to say, are possible under the various systems of taxation."
"In the field of company taxation, we need to agree on definitions and bases for calculating tax."
"In my opinion, we should make an urgent start on the implementation of the Ruding committee recommendations."
"Another requirement in this area is to make a distinction between the taxation of profits that are withdrawn and profits that are reinvested."
"We need to take action on these matters urgently."
"The taxation of capital income has already been discussed many times in the House, and we have proposed various solutions."
"It is very important to recognize that state subsidies are not the only factor to be considered when it comes to measuring competitiveness."
"The destructive tax competition which we are currently experiencing in the European Union can be just as damaging, and it is therefore high time that the European Parliament got to grips with the issues in the Commission's strategy paper and, with the help of the Secchi report, defined a clear position on these topics once again."
"Mr President, the Secchi report displays expertise, as does the Commission's analysis."
"An effective internal market requires effective structures."
"Tax systems must become more equitable in the interests of employment and balance."
"Under a single currency system, the public finances of all Member States will be subject to precise individual supervision."
"Why should taxation not be subject to the same supervision?"
"The greatest problem is the increasing concentration of the burden of taxation on labour."
"For some reason it is imagined that businesses which provide employment are wealthier, as they are taxed disproportionately in comparison, for example, with business which go in for automation."
"In developing tax systems, the distorted way in which tax is levied should be corrected without delay."
"The minimum requirement is that businesses which provide employment should be placed on an equal footing with businesses using automation."
"Otherwise our society will wither away because of automation designed to avoid taxation."
"Allow me in these few short moments to explain why the Swedish party group cannot vote for this report."
"Our objections are primarily concerned with point 4 which states that decisions on taxation will no longer be taken unanimously in the Council, and point 9 which states that taxes in the Union may not be raised."
"We think that the right to determine the level of State income and expenditure is a fundamental democratic right for each nation in the Union."
"If the people in one particular country democratically decide to raise or lower their taxes we should not be able to prevent them from doing so."
"Mr President, to uphold each country's democratic right to determine its own taxes we are voting against Mr Secchi's report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to come back very briefly, both to assure you that the Commission will take full account of all your comments and to provide some reassurance in the light of the concern you have expressed with regard to subsidiarity."
"Subsidiarity is at the very heart of the Commission's approach, but as things stand the Member States, though believing that they still have complete fiscal sovereignty, have in fact lost it - and are losing it more and more as the market becomes integrated and opens up: by helping them to coordinate more closely, we are in effect helping the Member States to achieve their own national objectives."
"Finally, it is true that more has been achieved as far as indirect taxation is concerned, but it is also vital to make progress on direct taxation too - and to make it soon in respect of capital movements in particular, as several Members have pointed out."
"This is necessary already for the functioning of the single market, and will be all the more so with the advent of the single currency when, once all the other distorting factors have been eliminated - such as transfer costs and exchange risks - fiscal differences alone will determine capital movements."
"And this is not an efficient way to allocate resources; that is why the single currency is a further incentive to introduce at least some coordination of taxation on capital."
"A very difficult job lies ahead of us all, but if Parliament's attitude is to be as indicated in the Secchi report and motion for a resolution, our work will be greatly assisted by your support."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Impact and effectiveness of the Single Market"
"The next item is the report (A4-0160/97) by Mr Harrison, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission's communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled 'The Impact and Effectiveness of the Single Market' (COM(96)0520 - C4-0655/96) and on the Commission Staff Working Paper: ' The 1996 Single Market Review' (SEC(96)2378 - C4-0007/97)."
"Madam President, today has been the ETUC Day of Action in favour of jobs and Europe is rightly crying out for jobs for its 30 million unemployed."
"But the quickest way for the EU to secure those jobs is by the strict completion of Europe's biggest enterprise, the single European market of 370 million people and by implementing all those important auxiliary measures which substantiate and supplement that market, of which EMU and the single currency is the prime example."
"Indeed, my report suggests that associating the completion of the market with one of EMU's significant dates could be the goal and ambition which could breathe new life into the European Union on the threshold of a new century."
"This year's report on the single market is unusual and promising for a very important reason."
"For the first time ever we have some real proof of the rewards that result from the bedding down of the single market."
"Commissioner Monti's excellent series of essays and investigations tabulate well the effect of having a market on various sectors in Europe and of how Europe's competitiveness is being sharpened up to enable us to challenge and succeed on the world stage."
"Just look at the figures revealed by Mr Monti's thirty-nine articles."
"Some 900, 000 jobs have been created directly attributable to the market."
"EU GDP income rose between 1987 and 1993 by 1 1/2 %."
"Inflation rates across the EU have been lowered by some 1 1/2 %."
"Economic convergence and cohesion between regions has been deepened whilst peripheral cohesion countries have strengthened so that now we describe Ireland as an Atlantic tiger economy."
"The single market programme of more than 280 directives has cut reams of red tape."
"100, 000 national standards and labelling laws, 60 million customs and tax formalities have been shredded and binned."
"But if that is the good news, there is still much to be done and richer prizes to be garnered."
"The 'black holes' , as Commissioner Monti describes them, of public procurement and state aid still have to be tackled."
"The creation of single markets in energy, private pensions and the media industry has yet to be achieved."
"Labour mobility, aided and abetted by fundamental education and training programmes remains unrealized."
"SMEs are still the Cinderellas of the market which was made principally with big business in mind."
"Indeed, only 56 % of the 1985 measures have been implemented by all Member States."
"And here lies the source of the problem."
"It is the Member States who have hypocritically supported the principle of the market but who have been most guilty of failing to implement, monitor and ensure compliance with single market rules."
"Just look at the case of technical regulations."
"Some 450 new national technical rules are introduced annually."
"Sometimes Member States do not even bother to notify the Commission of these national variations, the effect of which is to undermine the market."
"My plea, and that of Parliament, to Mr Monti is to name and blame those countries which blatantly transgress agreed rules and I am pleased that the Commission's draft action plan to complete the market recognizes these points."
"However, observing market rules alone is not enough."
"Active policies, like realizing the TENs for telecommunication, energy and transport are essential struts in the European infrastructure."
"Member States must be supporters, not blockers, of these wise flanking measures."
"But above all should be Member States' concern for the citizen in the street, including shoppers and consumers who have the right to expect effective protection."
"Moreover 120 million consumers - in other words, Europe's children - have a right to demand the market to work in their favour."
"Open borders favour not only business people but also child molesters."
"Finally, I am pleased that Tony Blair, Britain's new Prime Minister, has declared that his presidency of the European Union in 1998 will see the completion of the market as a first target."
"Truly a new market for a new Europe and a new hope for all our people."
"Madam President, in its opinion on the communication from the Commission, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights also expressed its disappointment that the single market has not fulfilled all the expectations which it raised."
"As we have already noted critically in other reports, the Member States are still very much dragging their feet over transposition of the directives that have been adopted since the 1985 White Paper; in many cases, our citizens and the economy are suffering from the fact that directives have not yet actually been applied."
"The legal means that are currently available to the Commission are plainly inadequate to enable it to play its full role as guardian of the Treaties."
"That is why we support any proposal which strengthens the hand of the Commission and the public in seeking legal remedies where the rules of the single market are being contravened."
"In some areas, it is scarcely appropriate to talk of a single market at all."
"We have spent a great deal of time today discussing taxes, and I should like to refer to one example which concerns differences between rates of VAT."
"In the case of pesticides, it is no secret that it is still possible for one country to impose a VAT rate of 3 % while another imposes a rate of 20 %, all perfectly in accordance with the relevant EU directive."
"It is easy to see that this kind of distortion destroys companies' faith in the single market and, in this case, has led to detrimental effects on the environment."
"We are therefore calling for the completion of the single market programme, and in particular for harmonization in the areas of VAT and company taxation."
"The point also has to be made that some other effects of the single market - about which the Commission has been quite frank - should actually give us pause for thought."
"The impact on employment can so far only be described as extremely meagre."
"It is clear from the figure of no more than 300 000 to 900 000 new jobs - which is a cumulative figure for a number of years - that the single market alone cannot solve the problem of unemployment."
"And the increased volume of traffic may result in the EU being unable to meet its international obligations as regards the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"For these reasons, we support the Commission in taking any steps that will help it to be more effective in this area, and we would call on the Member States not to deprive themselves and their citizens of the positive effects of the single market."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Harrison on his excellent report: it gives us ample food for thought, now that we have reached the stage of preparing a final version of the action plan for the single market."
"In fact, Mr Harrison, we have already incorporated into the plan many of the points raised in your report."
"I hope I can take this as a sign that the Commission will be strongly supported by Parliament in carrying out the plan itself."
"The origin of the single market action plan, to be presented to the Amsterdam European Council in June, was the analysis contained in the communication on the impact and effectiveness of the single market, which is the subject of the report before the House today."
"Our plan sets out the measures to be adopted as a matter of priority, so that the single market can underpin the transition to the single currency that will begin on 1 January 1999."
"We all agree on the need for a new degree of political commitment to secure a single market that will meet our social requirements and achieve its full potential, which it has not yet done completely in terms of employment, growth and competitiveness."
"In this major political initiative - the action plan - we are proposing that the European institutions and the Member States undertake a very serious task."
"It is just 18 months from now until 1 January 1999: we realize that agreement will not be reached on everything in such a short space of time."
"But we must focus on certain priorities and seek to achieve practical results, so as to launch a dynamic process in which a truly operational single market is the cornerstone of the Union's development."
"I should like to take this opportunity to explain how the approach outlined by the rapporteur, Mr Harrison, fed into our action plan."
"I shall do so by touching briefly on four points: the first concerns the need to improve the efficiency of the existing single market rules."
"This is a crucial element if we wish to increase business confidence in the market, which requires better and prompter implementation of Community law in the Member States."
"Our second priority objective is to combat the main distortions of the market, which result from fiscal barriers and anti-competitive behaviour."
"Only more coherent and better coordinated fiscal conditions will ensure that European companies really do regard the single market as a large national market."
"That is still a long way off."
"One key element of a fiscal package should be a code of conduct whereby the Member States undertake to act in a more transparent and coordinated way, in order to avoid excessive fiscal competition."
"A more rigorous approach to competition policy is also crucial for ensuring that the dynamic of the single market is not hampered by anticompetitive behaviour on the part of firms, or by state aids."
"The third objective of the action plan is to dispense with the remaining sectoral obstacles to market integration."
"We wish to limit the adoption of new legislative measures to a bare minimum, in a policy geared to simplifying existing legislation, rather than creating new laws."
"In certain specific cases, however - such as financial services and teleshopping - a legislative framework could prove necessary. Similarly, decisions are needed on proposals which are still pending, such as those on biotechnology and company law - a sector where the Commission will consider how best to adapt the proposal on the Statute for the European Company in the light of the recommendations put forward by the Davignon group, at the initiative of Commissioner Flynn and myself."
"Finally, there is the fourth but equally important point, which I am pleased to mention in the presence of Mr Flynn himself: the action plan will contain proposals designed to consolidate the social dimension of the single market in two major sectors: the protection of workers' rights and the development of mobility within the Union."
"The Commission is convinced that industrial restructuring, which is also assisted by market integration, is necessary and beneficial for the Union, but we appreciate that it can have damaging social effects."
"Full compliance with existing Community rules on the consultation of workers is absolutely vital to ensure unswerving political support for the single market."
"In its action plan, the Commission calls on Parliament and the Council to examine the legislative proposals contained in it as a matter of priority, so that the best possible results can be achieved within the tight timeframe - 18 months, as I said - set out in the document."
"I can assure you, on the other hand, that the Commission is thinking not so much of a formal interinstitutional agreement as of a political commitment to examine the legislative measures with the utmost urgency."
"Priority treatment should therefore be given in this case both to the proposals which are already before Parliament - biotechnology, the liberalization of gas supplies and the transparency mechanism for the information society - and to those which the Commission will present shortly as part of the action plan."
"I am most grateful for the attention which the House has given to the communication on the impact and effectiveness of the single market, and I would compliment Mr Harrison once again on the high quality of his report."
"The Commission is looking forward to cooperating closely with you in implementing the action plan, and in this context I should be happy if the European Parliament could signal its agreement that the action plan, which I have outlined to you this evening, is indeed the instrument best suited to achieving our intended objectives - an indication that you agree with our chosen objectives and will support the process we have devised to put these into effect, as well as agreeing to attach the necessary priority to dealing with the legislative proposals which the plan contains. I am asking a good deal of the House, but I know how keen you are to see the single market fully completed."
"Madam President, I should also like to congratulate Lyndon Harrison for a very comprehensive and searching report which seeks to complete the single market."
"I would like to pick up three of the issues addressed which are vitally important."
"The first concerns small and medium-sized enterprises which he rightly describes as the backbone of the European economy."
"They still find themselves thwarted by excessive directives, red tape, and literally hundreds of pieces of legislation which make their burden intolerable."
"This burden, as the Commissioner has just said, must be reduced and the procedures simplified."
"Secondly, I should like to endorse the call in the Harrison report to complete the trans-European networks."
"Energy, transport and telecommunications are crucial to create the platform for economic success in Europe."
"Success equals jobs and on a day when thousands of workers demonstrated outside our Parliament their rightful demand for jobs, this is a positive way to redress the balance and the answer to their demands."
"More than that, transEuropean networks provide a proper basis for universal service for public services for all our citizens of Europe, making their lives better and building a better future."
"Finally, I am sure that Commissioner Monti will not be surprised that I support Lyndon Harrison's proposals for labour mobility and a common European employment policy."
"As I speak, French ski instructors and authorities have prevented a single British ski instructor from working in the French Alps."
"And that is despite the assurances given by the Commissioner six months ago that not only was it illegal but that he would instruct the French ski instructors to act accordingly."
"This report goes a very long way to sharpening up legislative procedures in the EU and therefore I welcome it."
"Madam President, my congratulations go to our rapporteur Mr Harrison, who has produced an excellent report on an extremely important issue."
"The application of the single market has caused a revolution in the Member States of the European Union."
"Even if the rather unrealistic expectations set out in the Cecchini reports have not always come to fruition, such as the millions of extra jobs, at least investment has increased, inflation has fallen, between 300 000 and 900 000 new jobs have been created, and the economies of the Member States have become closely interwoven."
"But there is still much that needs to be done."
"Look at public contracts, for example."
"France and Germany are making a complete hash of the directives in this area, and this is something that needs to be looked into very carefully."
"Then there are financial services and insurance, where we still do not have a single market within the Union and a great deal more needs to be done."
"A considerable number of measures have still not been implemented by the Member States, and in order to give fresh impetus to the completion of the single market, the Commission is to put an action plan before the European Council in Amsterdam in June."
"It is urgently needed."
"Member States are either too late with their implementation, or else they introduce so much legislation that you cannot see the wood for the trees."
"Even Parliament, to be honest, is sometimes guilty of this."
"The target date for harmonization is long past, yet the barriers still remain."
"Next, small and medium-sized businesses."
"As the Commission also notes in its working document 'The 1996 Single Market Review' , small and medium-sized businesses have benefited less from the single market than large firms, and my group would like to join Mr Harrison in expressing our concern about this through his resolution."
"The completion of the single market must be made more profitable for SMEs by increasing their exports, for example, which is where the euro and its associated payment systems will help."
"The costs of complying with the new administrative, technical and fiscal single market legislation also present a major problem for small and medium-sized firms, and I would urge the Commissioner to listen very carefully to what these firms have to say about the problems they are facing."
"Simpler and clearer legislation would help them more than all sorts of different subsidies that are difficult to obtain."
"What do small and medium-sized firms actually want?"
"They want better consultation procedures in all kinds of fields such as economic dialogue, trade dialogue, social dialogue, perhaps even fiscal dialogue."
"They want improvements in the collective research and development programmes for SMEs, and they want them to be made more accessible."
"Thirdly, there is the reduction in the financial burden for firms operating across borders and in the costs of international bank transactions."
"The directive on this is to come into force at the same time as the euro."
"I think we do not have any further problems with this, and I hope that the action plan will work."
"The single market is one of the European Union's most important achievements, but without this fresh impetus, we can only expect its benefits to be diluted by enlargement."
"Strict management and discipline are required from the Member States if the single market is to be preserved."
"Madam President, I too should like to thank Mr Harrison for his report and in particular for including various amendments."
"I would urge Mr Monti and possibly also Mr Flynn, who is here today, to give closer attention to two aspects of the single market: taxation and, as Mrs Peijs said, insurance."
"If we look at what Mrs Berger's report has to say, for example, about how pension funds are not allowed to operate in certain Member States and cannot offer their services or invest there, it is clear that this is the other side of the single market."
"The same applies to certain banking services."
"I can give you examples of dealings between my country, the Netherlands, and Belgium, say, where a mortgage offered by a bank in the Netherlands for a house in Belgium cannot be exempted from tax."
"I know that things have changed since the Bachman judgment, but it does not take us very much further forward."
"I would therefore urgently call on both Commissioners to give particular attention to these aspects of the single market, which directly affect citizens wishing to use services provided in one country where they are working, for example, but which have to be processed fiscally or otherwise in a second country."
"This issue is dealt with in the Berger report and is also covered in Amendment No 12."
"I would finally also ask for attention to be given to the Statute for the European Company."
"I hope that the Commission will succeed in getting this issue on the agenda for Amsterdam in June."
"Madam President, I must congratulate the Commission, in particular Commissioner Monti, and Mr Harrison on the documents which have been presented, which are a timely assessment of the experience of the formation of the single European market."
"There can be no doubt about the positive role of initiatives taken in the 1980s, beginning with the 1985 White Paper, followed by the setting of a date and simplification of the legislative process through the single European act."
"That positive role cannot be called into doubt given the developments which have fallen below the predictions in the Cecchini report, which were excessively optimistic, but back then it was impossible to predict the fall of the Berlin Wall and the recession of the early 1990s."
"It is somehow significant that, according to the figures already divulged and analyzed on the basis of various models, the single market which began in 1993 has led to 300 to 900, 000 extra jobs and a 1.1 to 1.5 increase in the European GDP, as well as a 1.1 to 1.5 reduction in the inflation rate."
"However, we cannot limit ourselves to observation of these figures, and it is important to know whether, in face of difficulties which have arisen, we would have been better off if this initiative had not been taken, and the answer to that is a resounding 'no!' , since the current problems would probably have been even worse - e.g. unemployment, a result fundamentally of a technological evolutions which we could not have avoided unless we wanted to put our future irremediably in danger."
"Since this has been a positive experience, it is not enough now just to top it up or make a few adjustments."
"Together with the introduction of the euro, we must now take a global and ambitious initiative, through a coherent set of projects which, apart from immediate aims to be achieved, would mobilize enthusiasm and involvement by all Europeans."
"That is the only way of meeting the challenges of creating stable jobs in competitive sectors worldwide."
"That is the desire that I wanted to express in my short speech."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Members for helping us, through this debate, to finalize the Commission's action plan."
"Without commenting on all the contributions, I would single out the emphasis you have placed on SMEs - which are at the very heart of our action plan, especially in terms of legislative simplification; the attention which you have all drawn to proper compliance with the rules of the single market; and also the problem of enforcement, using the appropriate instruments to ensure more swiftly and effectively that the single market rules are indeed being complied with."
"I shall not go into any other points, in spite of their importance - from the Statute for the European Company to financial services - and will end with the following remark: it seems to me that, at a time when so much attention is being devoted to the single currency and the timetable for it, we must not forget that economic and monetary union does indeed mean the single currency, but it means economic union as well."
"The single market is the central pillar of economic union, and therefore all our joint efforts to complete the single market should be seen in this framework: one of full support for growth and employment in Europe."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Non-conventional medicines"
"The next item is the report (A4-0075/97) by Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the status of non-conventional medicines."
"Madam President, I think it could be said, without risk of error, that the harmonization of national legislation concerning the medical profession and medicines is a process which is now virtually completed in the European Union."
"As far as non-conventional medicines are concerned, i.e. therapeutic approaches not recognized by the medical order, this is far from being so."
"In fact, in the European Union, the diversity of legislative approaches is quite extraordinary."
"We also live in a system of incoherence. It is my opinion that we should put an end to this state of affairs as quickly as possible."
"When I say difference of legislations I can give a few examples."
"In Germany, for example, homeopathic medicines are included in the national pharmacopoeia."
"In Great Britain, osteopaths and chiropractors are legally recognized professions, with normal surgeries, and the same goes for chiropractors in the Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Denmark, Finland."
"Those are clear examples whereas in other European countries all of these professions are illegal and the practice of these therapeutic approaches if not banned at best are tolerated - but sometimes also prosecuted."
"I think it is time, as I said, to bring an end to these incoherencies and meet increasing demand from patients."
"The obvious cannot be denied: increasing numbers of European people want to be treated by means of these so-called non-conventional therapies."
"Surveys carried out by the Commission itself have come up with striking figures, with as many as 50 % of those surveyed calling for access to these therapies."
"What is the meaning behind the report which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is proposing?"
"It is precisely to embark on a process of recognizing these non-conventional therapies, obviously on the basis of existing achievements, particularly what has already been achieved in countries where those therapies have already been recognized, on the basis of vital studies which show the effectiveness of therapies to be legalized, on the basis of the requirement of high-level training for practitioners - diplomas and recognition should not be given away - and last but not least on the basis of organized dialogue between allopathic medicine and non-conventional medicine, so that this dialogue can lead to a harmony, making it possible to apply these approaches in complementarity."
"That is the main spirit and content of the report which the committee is proposing to us and which I hope the majority of this parliament will support tomorrow."
"I would like to make the most of the time remaining to refute some claims which I think are prejudicial."
"Contrary to some of these claims, we are not trying to open the door to charlatans, to recognize anything whatsoever, to lead to mayhem in health care."
"On the contrary, I think that the only way of protecting serious practitioners against charlatans and protecting patients is to adopt appropriate legislation."
"Burying our heads in the sand, despite the fact that a large number of people are already resorting to non-conventional medicines, would not be a responsible political attitude."
"It is a conservative attitude which, in any case, sooner or later, will collapse in view of the facts."
"I should like also to take this opportunity to quote the Indian Health Minister who recently addressed the 50th session of the WHO Assembly in Geneva, which he chaired."
"He said that it was also necessary to recognise the role played by traditional systems of which many countries were rightly proud."
"He added that it was impossible to ignore these systems in a zealous attempt to subscribe exclusively to modern science and technology."
"He mentioned his own country, India, which alone had contributed to the creation of three medical systems, offering a wealth of scientific knowledge and a very rich literature which had enabled an effective response to be made to certain illnesses."
"The answer to all illnesses could not be found but certainly to some."
"He continued by saying that, in order to meet the requirements of the modern world, these approaches had been given a legal framework in India and an organised structure."
"Standardization had been carried out and welldevised training courses existed, leading to a practitioners' register."
"It might be interesting to organize an international conference on the subject of traditional medicine systems, in order to find out what their potential was, to dispel misunderstandings and to decide on positive recommendations so that they could be adopted more widely."
"Those were the words of the Indian Health Minister."
"I propose that we draw inspiration from what he said, not only about traditional medicines, but also for the more modern approaches which also have their part to play and which I think should be officially recognized."
"The European Parliament is certainly the most appropriate place to set that process in motion."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was the task of the Committee on Legal Affairs to determine whether the European Union has the power to regulate the field of non-conventional medicine in the first instance."
"We concluded that it has."
"It is a fact that a great many articles of the Treaty - Articles 3(o) and (s), 36, 56, 100a(3), 129 and so on - refer to health and health protection. And it is also a fact that none of these articles provides for Community legislation."
"However, it can be concluded from these repeated references to health that health protection has to be an important component of European policy."
"The cross-border dimension of this question concerns in particular freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, which also extends to non-conventional medical practitioners, as well as trade in goods - the relevant medicinal products - and services - such as the right of patients to choose their doctors across borders."
"We felt that Articles 54, 63 and 100a in particular could be considered for the legal basis."
"The fact is, however, that Article 57(3) seems to provide the most appropriate legal basis, because of the specific reference there to 'medical and allied professions' - a comprehensive term. This wording is so general that it can be applied to nonconventional as well as to conventional medicine."
"Article 57(2) is concerned with powers of harmonization."
"It could be argued, however, that no - or only some - Member States possess legislation in this field, and that it is impossible to harmonize something that does not yet exist."
"Nevertheless, we believe that the Community does have competence in this field, since on the one hand there is a danger that the great variety of national rules could give rise to legal uncertainty and, on the other hand, national sovereignty - or the principle of subsidiarity as we now call it - does not rule it out."
"As a second point, the Committee on Legal Affairs takes the view that different directives should not be enacted for each individual type of non-conventional medicine, since the very contentious issue then arises of what is nonconventional medicine?"
"It can develop into conventional medicine, but it can also degenerate into magic or esotericism."
"In any event, it is much more important to enact a basic directive, and we therefore do not wish to have either an abstract definition or seven different directives."
"I should personally like to say, moreover, that this report does not even refer to the most important form of nonconventional medicine: red and white wine."
"We believe that it is more important to enact a basic directive that encompasses general points and is applicable to all."
"The most important principle is to ensure a very high level of patient protection."
"Perhaps the clock is wrong, Madam President."
"I have not spoken for three and a half minutes yet!"
"(Laughter, applause) The most important principle is the protection of patients, and the Committee on Legal Affairs is therefore proposing that very high standards for the training of non-conventional medical practitioners must be established."
"The latter do not necessarily have to be doctors who can produce a corresponding diploma, but it must be ensured that they have a basic knowledge of general medical principles. Naturally, the individual professional organizations should then participate in deciding on appropriate training standards."
"An example would be the German law on non-medical practitioners."
"This is the level of regulation that should be introduced for non-conventional medicine."
"There would also have to be the requirement to provide information and compulsory liability insurance."
"This issue is too extensive to address in just two minutes, and since no one else will wish to make a long speech on this subject, I think that I should be allowed to overrun my speaking time."
"In short, the Committee on Legal Affairs has come to the conclusion that Community competence to regulate these matters does exist, and that, in the interests of patients and people seeking to be treated, it should undertake that regulation."
"I realize that people like to listen to you, Mr Alber, but I did say - which you will not have heard just now - that we have an extremely long agenda this evening, and if we are to complete our work by midnight, it will only be by keeping to time."
"So I must insist that the following speakers keep to their speaking time."
"Madam President, I shall try to stay within my speaking time, since I notice that, all of a sudden, the clock is right again, although it was unfortunately wrong during Mr Alber's speech - for which, I must admit, I am not ungrateful."
"Indeed, part of what I wished to say has been pre-empted by Mr Alber's comments on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and it is therefore superfluous to talk about the need for freedom of establishment or matters concerning the internal market."
"Let me address a number of other points, therefore. In the European Union, we are very tolerant in our dealings with one another, and I trust that we shall also manage to be so in the debate on this item of the agenda."
"We are not discussing legislation here, but an own-initiative European Parliament report, which seeks to prompt the Commission to consider the need for legislation."
"When I look at the ideological war which has been waged by the professional associations of doctors over the last few months, however, I am not entirely sure what this matter is about."
"For us - as Mr Alber has already made clear, I am glad to say - it is a question of safeguarding and upholding the principles of the internal market, notably the freedom of establishment, and also of ensuring a high level of patient protection."
"I do not know who has the right - or thinks they have the right - to deprive people of the freedom to choose their treatment."
"I do not concede that doctors have that right."
"I do not concede that the training of doctors gives them the right to decide what is best for patients."
"There are different situations in the different Member States. In some Member States, there are chiropractors, practitioners of different types of massage, non-medical practitioners, acupuncturists, and so on; and patients from other Member States must be provided with access to their services if they so wish."
"My group sets great store by the freedom of adult citizens of the European Union to choose and make decisions, and I trust that colleagues in the other groups do so too."
"I believe that, to a great extent, they are capable of deciding for themselves what they want."
"So it is important for us to insist that the people treating these patients know what they doing - in other words, that they are properly trained."
"This is what Mr Lannoye and the Committee on the Environment are calling for in the report."
"They are demanding that anyone practising a form of medicine - any form of medicine - should be properly trained, so that they know their limits, and know when it is time to let a conventional medical practitioner, a surgeon, or an internal specialist take over."
"This requires them to have a qualification, and the granting of this qualification has to be regulated Europe-wide, since the safety of patients must be guaranteed in equal measure in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Spain and so on."
"If training courses and the granting of diplomas are regulated in this way, patients in the European Union will be protected, and will be able to decide for themselves whom they trust and who they wish to treat them."
"This is what we are calling on the Commission to do."
"We are calling on it to take action and bring forward appropriate legislation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate over the last few weeks, we have become acquainted with a great many extreme positions, and it will undoubtedly be the case again this evening that these extreme positions clash with one another."
"At the beginning of my speech, therefore, I should like to introduce a somewhat more conciliatory tone."
"I am myself a so-called conventional medical practitioner. I underwent medical training and - to the extent that my time allows - I still work in the field of conventional medicine."
"I am sure that there will be general agreement, as a number of colleagues have pointed out, that conventional medicine has made tremendous advances over the last few decades and helps many people."
"On the other hand, we have to recognize the fact - and I know this from practical experience - that many people do not find what they are looking for in conventional medicine."
"Especially when they are suffering from chronic illnesses or long-term health disorders, many people turn to so-called non-conventional therapies."
"There is, of course, a reason for this."
"Like many other colleagues, I believe that the vast majority of these therapies have absolutely no effect, other than that of a placebo."
"Nevertheless, people do turn to them."
"I believe that the reason for this is, above all, that therapists and other practitioners of non-conventional medicine listen to people."
"They perform a function that clearly no one else in society fulfils."
"We cannot blame this on doctors alone, since because of the billing system, because of the costs, doctors are not always able to take as long with their patients as is perhaps necessary."
"This is a reproach to society as a whole."
"The decline of the family, perhaps in some ways also the increased detachment from the Church, are leading to the disappearance of traditional structures which once ensured that people always had someone to listen to them."
"In some countries of the European Union there are non-medical and similar types of practitioners, and in others there are not."
"Perhaps the fact that there are no non-medical practitioners as such in Italy has something to do with the fact that this need is catered for by other mechanisms in that country."
"I do not know, and it is very difficult for us to judge the matter this evening."
"I am merely offering food for thought."
"We should not simply believe that everything about conventional medicine is perfect, but should give some thought to the reasons why people turn to non-conventional medicine."
"Nevertheless, my group has serious problems with Mr Lannoye's report in its present form."
"I have long endeavoured to reconcile the different positions that exist in Parliament in some way."
"However, there is a key problem which we cannot get round, even with the best of compromise proposals."
"On the one hand, Mr Lannoye's report seeks the greatest possible freedom of choice for patients and therapists."
"On the other, it seeks the greatest possible safety - and therein lies the problem."
"It transpires that certain therapies have proven effects which can be scientifically verified."
"I am greatly in favour of promoting these therapies and their use by doctors."
"However, there are other therapies which, by their very nature, are not susceptible to basic scientific verification."
"The user believes that a therapy helps."
"Indeed, he is convinced of the fact."
"But a third party cannot verify this in accordance with scientific principles."
"The question is: how, in such circumstances, does one establish the border between use and abuse?"
"How, for example, does one pursue an action for damages, if objective verification is impossible?"
"I believe we must consider this very carefully, not least because some non-medical practitioners in Germany and other countries maintain that it could be dangerous for Europe to lay down strict criteria, since that could lead to them no longer being able to practise in their own country as before."
"We also receive critical letters from users of non-conventional medicine telling us that it is better to leave well alone."
"The question of subsidiarity must also be considered in this respect."
"I believe that all these reasons should lead us not to adopt Mr Lannoye's report in its present form."
"This is not a rejection of so-called gentle medicine."
"It is a rejection of what has so far been an inadequate attempt to harmonize it at European level."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not be mistaken."
"The rapporteur is repeating his old refrain with new words."
"After having spoken to us in previous years of parallel medicine, complementary techniques, alternative therapies, now he is telling us of non-conventional medicines, in the hope that we will forget that behind this word are hidden esoteric notions - shiatsu, sikh, and others."
"These are vague, woolly, unverifiable notions."
"The rapporteur is quite simply asking for a Directive to recognize these so-called medicines and those who practice them."
"But on what guarantees?"
"The report is vague on that point."
"With a diploma?"
"A university diploma?"
"No."
"A diploma awarded by the practitioners themselves 'as a result of a rigorous self-regulatory process within the profession itself' ."
"That means that these practitioners would form a jury and therefore be both the judge and defendant."
"Would you entrust your health to such practitioners?"
"For example, would you travel in a plane with a non-conventional pilot in the cockpit?"
"The rapporteur wants to convince us by pointing out that some of these practices enjoy a form of legal recognition in certain Member States."
"Does that mean he wants us to align ourselves on the most laissez-faire States in such a serious area?"
"By the way, he has no scruples about attaching a false meaning to certain articles of the Treaty, in particular Article 57 (3)."
"Amendment No 10 calls for the assessment of these non-conventional practices."
"But by whom?"
"By a serious, officially recognized scientific committee?"
"Not at all."
"By a joint committee including practitioners from both schools of medicine, conventional and non-conventional."
"What on earth is this?"
"You would think that we are at a religious synod or a trade union meeting."
"But that amendment goes further."
"In the following paragraph, to simplify, it quite simply recommends committees comprising only qualified practitioners in these non-conventional techniques."
"Practitioners qualified by whom?"
"Of course, in Amendment No 11, we should immediately stop pursuing these 'honourable practitioners' ."
"Here, we can begin to detect some of the interference by the lobbies behind this project."
"While he is at it, the rapporteur also wants the pharmacopoeia to be reformed, changes to the list of authorized medicines and, as in Amendment No 15, to have medicines and practitioners reimbursed by the social security system."
"This is an extraordinary paradox: just as Parliament is demanding a tightening up of security and safety for consumer protection, here we are talking of abandoning the health safety of those same consumers, our fellow citizens, our children, to individuals without qualifications - or with sham qualifications, using unproven medicines, at the taxpayers' expense."
"That really is going too far! I am certain, ladies and gentlemen, that you will reject a report of this kind which would discredit us in public opinion."
"Mr Lannoye, stop showering us with these mass-produced letters, signed by the same hand, illegibly."
"It is not worthy of you or of us."
"And do you not think that this money would be better spent on a proper health project?"
"Madam President, I rise to welcome this report which attempts to orchestrate some basic harmonies in a rather chaotic symphony."
"The popular acceptance of non-conventional medicines is a fact of life."
"But how this is to be regulated in the European Union is not so obvious."
"The rapporteur has made a valiant effort to achieve a consensus out of a variety of cultural experience."
"For the English-speaking world I would venture to put on record that the acceptance of non-conventional medicine is a core value in that culture and is woven out of three different strands."
"One, that part of European traditional medicine which was excluded as Western allopathic medicine developed in the 19th century out of the disciplines of the apothecary and surgeon - and I speak of manipulative medicine and herbalism in particular and also of homeopathy."
"Two, the traditional medicine of the non-European world which was overwhelmed by the power of the Western mindset, also in the 19th century."
"Three, the de-skilling of women as primary health care providers as medicine became institutionalized in the 19th and early 20th centuries."
"In these three strands we are talking of the inclusion of what was excluded which is a major focus of democracy in the European Union."
"So, we are not simply talking about listening and caring, but about proper practices."
"Many of these disciplines are extremely profound and have their own practical traditions which are very effective."
"Let us be sensible and adopt this sound and sensible proposal or we will risk a great divergence and indeed, discordance, in the Union."
"In any case, the UK and Ireland will persist as centres of excellence for nonconventional medicine."
"We have this tradition of regulation by professional bodies, not with the kind of legal base that is common in other states of the Union."
"Indeed, this is non-problematical in many areas of cultural life in these countries."
"The financial sector is a case in point."
"I would ask the Commissioner to consider the amendments I have tabled on behalf of the Greens which give priority to non-conventional medicine disciplines which enjoy some form of recognition and organization at European level already."
"I hope we can take this excellent report on board."
"Madam President, the non-conventional medical practitioners have obviously done their work well, since here Parliament is discussing yet another report on improving the status of non-conventional medicine."
"What is it all about?"
"The recognition of non-conventional medicines clearly involves a conflict of interests."
"Conventional medical science generally has a low opinion of non-conventional medicine, which it sees as competition and whose practitioners it even sometimes views as dangerous or unscientific."
"Behind this conflict lies a fundamental difference of opinion about mankind and what illness really is."
"This motion for a resolution tries, fairly successfully, to bridge the gap between the 'objective scientists' and the non-conventional practitioners."
"The first two paragraphs rightly stress the need for detailed research into the safety and effectiveness of these medicines, which lifts the debate above the purely emotional level."
"However, what I find less welcome is the fact that European law is now being expected to solve a conflict that is primarily being waged at national level between protecting the patient, quackery, and allowing the patient freedom of choice."
"Including non-conventional medicine under 'medical and allied professions' under Article 57(3) of the Treaty is far too broad an interpretation."
"This was not what this article was intended to cover, as both the Commission and the Council have stated."
"Perhaps this could be confirmed again."
"The article in question actually deals with the coordination of the conditions for practising certain medical and allied professions in the Member States."
"I would therefore prefer this issue to be dealt with through subsidiarity at Member State level."
"Freedom of establishment is the only truly European issue here, and economic considerations must not be allowed to outweigh the medical or ethical aspects."
"Non-conventional practitioners have to pay the price for this: they must abide by the rules of the country in which they are established, rules which have been introduced through democratic processes."
"However, this need not be too great a burden, since successful research into nonconventional medicines may mean that treatments which are proven to be safe and effective are included in conventional medicine."
"In my view, using European rules to impose greater freedom is not acceptable."
"Madam President, first of all I must congratulate the rapporteur on the effort he has put in in such a specialized field."
"Mr Lannoye has always impressed me with his huge knowledge of ecological matters."
"But medicine is quite another science and I am disappointed to have to say that, in drawing up these reports on nonconventional medicines, Paul Lannoye has been ill-advised, misguided and misinformed."
"All practitioners in the art of curing, including me, recognize the uselessness, even the danger, of over-relying on technological methods for reaching a proper diagnosis."
"Similarly, chemotherapy is part of the therapeutic arsenal to be used with discernment and moderation."
"I have always been a partisan of learning about and the use, as a complement, of less aggressive medical techniques, provided they are correctly practised - e.g. homeopathy, manual medicine, acupuncture - as well as massotherapy, unfortunately left out of this report."
"But it is commonsense that whatever the means of therapy chosen, medicine can only be practised by medical doctors who have had full training in a European university - European universities being, nobody will deny it, the best in the world."
"The rare mistakes or excesses committed by a few doctors cannot justify leaving the art of curing in the hands of health 'officials' whose practices sometimes are more like witchcraft than medical science."
"When a plane crashes following pilot error, nobody ever thinks of training non-conventional pilots."
"I therefore insist that all of my colleagues who are not doctors should understand the overriding need to integrate the teaching of so-called 'soft' , ' alternative' or 'non-conventional' medicines in the main university training courses for all doctors."
"The vital principle of primum non nocere cannot be reserved only to allopathic therapy but must apply to the art of curing in all forms."
"I must express my very sincere regrets to the rapporteur, but I think that it is my duty not to vote for his report."
"Madam President, very often Members of this Parliament are called on by our citizens to set out the benefits and disadvantages of the European Union."
"Very often we explain them in terms of rights and responsibilities, the freedoms and rights of the single market and the social and legal responsibilities which are fundamental to its fair achievement."
"The debate about non-conventional medicines, which is undoubtedly controversial, crystallizes that wider debate."
"Our citizens are demanding rights."
"Consumers are clearly demonstrating their demand for non-conventional medical products and treatments."
"Studies, for example, by the UK Consumers' Association show that one in four people now visit non-conventional practitioners by choice."
"In turn, those practitioners seek the rights of movement enshrined in the treaties."
"Yet perfectly respectable osteopaths and chiropractors, for example, who are legally permitted to practise in some states, such as my own, face serious penalties in others - let alone receive any encouragement."
"So, demand for change exists from both patients and potential healers."
"But for potential legislators, there must be responsibility too."
"The risk of exaggerated claims of miracle cures, of weakening of standards and of insufficient regulation is arguably real although international bodies which are strong in, for example, the field of homeopathy, have worked very hard to raise awareness and standards."
"That is why Mr Lannoye's tenacity in bringing this initiative to Parliament tonight is to be applauded and should be supported by votes tomorrow, as my splendid colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt has urged tonight."
"It may be imperfect as Members both for and against are arguing tonight but it represents a step in the right direction towards better access and choice for patients, the removal of barriers for responsible and properly regulated practitioners, recognized standards of training and qualification and the possibility of sensible integration into future conventional health systems at an appropriate later stage."
"That has been gradually welcomed by the British Medical Association since 1993 and while we must work with the Commission and other agencies to scrutinize future proposals carefully and also consider very carefully remaining genuine reservations, it would be the right and responsible decision of this Parliament tomorrow to lead the way forward for an open-minded approach to tackling some of the very real health needs of citizens throughout Europe."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have to say something to the visitors in the galleries."
"Our Rules of Procedure have been established, and these state that visitors in the galleries are to remain seated and keep silent."
"Anyone expressing approval or disapproval will be immediately ejected by the ushers. I would just point that out to you, because the rules are indeed administered in that way."
"We like the general public to have the chance to listen to what takes place here."
"But you are not allowed to participate in any way, whether you express approval or disapproval."
"I would ask you to respect this, since otherwise I shall have to tell the ushers to remove you from the galleries."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to emphasize the fact that medical science is a single science and there is no such thing as 'alternative' or 'non-conventional' medicine, just as there is no such thing as 'alternative' physics, chemistry or architecture."
"Secondly, medical science has already shown what a considerable contribution it has made to protecting people's health and also to restoring it when it is endangered."
"That is obvious from the large increase in life expectancy, well-known achievements in the field of vaccinations, and the amazing progress in diagnosis and surgical methods."
"Heart surgery is now regarded as almost routine."
"Thirdly, I should also stress the fact that medical studies are lengthy and difficult and usually last at least ten years in all."
"Fourthly, in medical practice, apart from doctors themselves, there are also other scientists and professionals such as physicists, chemists, laboratory assistants, psychologists, physiotherapists and others all of whom work for the service of patients and always under the responsibility of doctors."
"That could also be the case of some of the teams referred to in the rapporteur's report but he wants to make them independent and give a licence to nondoctors who wish to carry out medical practices."
"I am totally opposed to that."
"The fifth point I wish to emphasize is that in order to tackle a medical complaint a proper diagnosis must be carried out."
"The danger here is great since therapy by non-doctors, without proper diagnosis of the illness, could be dangerous and it could possibly lead to a delay in treatment by proper means and that is a basic point in medical science, unfortunately not accounted for in this report."
"My sixth point is that everyone knows that it is impossible for any new medicine to be used by doctors unless it has undergone lengthy and documented tests so that responsibility can be taken for its circulation, something which again is overlooked in the report."
"Finally, I should like to say that the health of European citizens, one of the most precious assets, must be the responsibility of doctors with whom any paramedical branches who wish to help sick people must cooperate. So far medicine has worthily assumed that responsibility with brilliant results."
"I hope that the European Parliament will reject this report because, if it is adopted, I think that we will be taking several steps backwards in the protection of the health of European citizens."
"Madam President, in the debate on the merits of non-conventional medicine as opposed to conventional medicine, the issues of a lack of humanity and the decline of the relationship of trust between doctor and patient are repeatedly brought up."
"I wish to emphasize in the strongest possible terms here that humanity, trust and personal commitment depend not on the method of treatment, but entirely on the person carrying out the treatment - in other words, the doctor or therapist."
"The clear and unequivocal demand set out in recital J of the report for clinical trials and comprehensive, scientific tests of effectiveness to be adopted as a prerequisite for the recognition of non-conventional medical disciplines is very much to be welcomed."
"If the conclusions of a series of tests carried out in this way prove positive, then a method of treatment will have fulfilled the requirements of conventional medicine for verifiable and comprehensible operating mechanisms."
"The rush to embrace new, alternative therapies whose effectiveness is so far only partly proven is misguided."
"It would be more appropriate to test these new approaches and therapies fully and rigorously within the context of a tried and tested medical tradition, with a view to integrating those which prove successful into conventional medicine as soon as possible, so as to hold out to conventional medicine - which in the last few years has perhaps become too technical and equipment-oriented - the prospect of a more humane form of medicine, which views people as a whole and builds on their powers of self-healing."
"Finally, I should like to refer to the financial aspect of this question."
"The treatments that we are all paying for dearly with our contributions must have demonstrably positive effects."
"We owe this fundamental quality assurance not only to patients, but also to taxpayers."
"For example, the president of the German Association of Health Service Doctors said in this context yesterday that it is unacceptable for all and sundry to practise Tibetan drumming or meditative Ikebana at the expense of the insured community as a whole, simply because they once did one insured person some good!"
"That is not enough for them to be recognized as therapies and receive financial support."
"Madam President, not all members of the PSE Group share the views expressed by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, because many of us think that a progressive attitude to so-called 'alternative' medicines does not mean putting it above any other value of freedom of choice."
"That is an ultra-liberal attitude."
"On the contrary, we want to see a development of alternative medicines - progress, legislation on them, while guaranteeing, or at least protecting at all times, the health, safety and legal rights of ordinary people."
"We do not think that the Lannoye report goes in this direction, on the contrary, and that is why we have tabled some amendments and we shall vote against certain articles and we will vote against the whole report if paragraph 2, for example, is kept as it stands. We go along with the defence of two basic principles: first of all, anyone wishing to exercise in the European Union one of the so-called alternative medicines should have a general medical training base and an official qualification guaranteeing that training."
"That qualification could be in medicine, but it could also be in naturopathy or homeopathy etc. But it must be a qualification issued by an academic authority rather than the current situation in which a so-called committee assesses the practitioner's qualification; secondly: the efficiency and, above all, the harmlessness of treatments must be assessed by scientific or academic institutions in the light of scientific, biological or statistical methods, etc., and by no means as a result of 'self-regulation' carried out by the profession itself, as the report would have it - this would be a step backwards."
"These and other proposals are not compatible, in our view, with the scientific guarantees that European qualifications must offer nor with the safety of ordinary people, nor with the functioning of the European Parliament."
"The history of medicine, like the history of mankind, is a fight between knowledge and beliefs: the more knowledge advances, the more withdrawn beliefs become."
"Will there come a day when medicine is an exact science?"
"Obviously not."
"The final result will always be weak, because fighting death is the weak point of all of biological science."
"However, that must never be a reason for abandoning scientific bases founded on reason and knowledge."
"Madam President, all I would say, quite calmly and simply, is that this resolution would allow treatments typically performed by the medical profession to be carried out by persons who have not been trained on the basis of the European directives regulating medical school curricula, which have been established in order to permit the free movement of doctors throughout the Union."
"Apparently, these therapists do not wish to practise medicine, but merely to be able to treat patients according to the principles of so-called alternative medicines, but there is no doubt that, by promoting direct access for European citizens to alternative therapists, these persons would also be entrusted with the very delicate diagnostic phase, without having the relevant training."
"The fact is that only once an illness has been identified, in other words after diagnosis, can the appropriate treatment be determined."
"Diagnosis is a basic task of doctors, and of doctors alone: an incorrect, over-hasty diagnosis of an illness that is curable by medical science - which, as is well known, has made tremendous advances in recent years - can often endanger the health and, sometimes, even the life of a patient."
"An amendment tabled in committee, not approved by the rapporteur, calls for a study of the effectiveness and safety of alternative medicines to be carried out before any directive is issued."
"Naturally, many colleagues who are in favour of the resolution voted for this amendment because, despite everything, they are still not convinced of the effectiveness and safety of therapies which have not been scientifically verified."
"Given the approval of this amendment calling for a thorough precautionary study of the safety and effectiveness of all non-conventional medicines, we are now faced with an absurd and contradictory resolution, Commissioner, because all the recitals and other paragraphs of the resolution itself are geared to obliging the Commission to allow so-called alternative medicine to be practised in all the Member States."
"I shall therefore vote against this resolution, as will my entire group, in the interest of the citizens of Europe, but also because I believe that in any event this matter falls under the principle of subsidiarity, which allows the Member States to make arrangements in keeping with their own customs and practices."
"Madam President, I too want to congratulate the rapporteur."
"He has put in a lot of work since this own-initiative report was first referred to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection almost three years ago in October 1994."
"As we know, complementary medicine is practised by thousands of people each year throughout Europe and it has been discussed at length at European level over recent years."
"Mr Needle said one in four people had partaken of complementary medicine and seen the benefits of disciplines such as shiatsu or - as in the case of my own mother where conventional medicine failed - received great relief from acupuncture."
"Many practitioners of conventional medicine realize that traditional medicine has a lot to offer and reasonable, independent-minded people must realize that our whole future health and well-being undoubtedly lies in a good mixture of the two."
"I am asking the Commission to come forward now with a draft directive."
"There is a clear need for complementary medicine to be regulated legally and the professional qualifications of practitioners must be legally recognized."
"They must be allowed to circulate freely throughout the Union provided they meet basic standards."
"The Commission is best placed to set out these rules."
"I would therefore urge Commissioner Flynn here tonight to come forward with a draft directive and I would urge Members to support the report and the amendments to which I have appended my name."
"Madam President, I am convinced that non-conventional medicine can be of great use to patients."
"I take it as read that there is a need for action at European level in this field, but I would stress first and foremost that Community interference in the organization or contribution and reimbursement obligations of national health insurance schemes is unnecessary."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, dealing with these matters remains the responsibility of the Member States."
"As a practising pharmacist, I feel it is important that the report gives valuable impetus to the debate on the question of self-medication."
"There are calls for increased selfmedication in a great many countries, when health systems come under review."
"Pharmacists must therefore come to grips with the question of self-medication and bring their knowledge to bear in consultations on the choice of treatment with so-called gentle medicines."
"In any event, they need to able to judge confidently the nature of the illness and the extent of the threat."
"Non-conventional therapies are based on the same natural laws as conventional therapies, but seek to stimulate the body's internal self-healing powers to a greater degree."
"It is also important to stress that the different types of therapy are not mutually exclusive, but complement one another."
"It is extremely important for patients to be guaranteed a very high level of safety, and it must be ensured that they are given detailed information on the quality and effectiveness - and also the possible risks - of non-conventional therapies."
"It is therefore necessary to secure the highest possible level of qualification and a requirement to provide information."
"The level of Europe-wide qualifications must be as least as high as that already required for non-medical practitioners in Germany and Sweden."
"Furthermore, in the interests of patient protection, there is a need for compulsory liability insurance which is not of a lower standard than that required for conventional medical practitioners."
"It has been my experience in the Committee on Petitions that we frequently discuss the recognition of diplomas at European level."
"And there is no indication in the Treaty that non-conventional medical disciplines should be excluded from such recognition."
"In the interests of securing cross-border mobility, the recognition of diplomas in this field must also be promoted."
"In general terms, it must not happen that the practice of a non-conventional medical discipline is prevented in a Member State because the profession does not exist in that country."
"I also believe that, in an age of Europe-wide telemedicine and teleshopping, the existing study courses in medicine and pharmacy should be reviewed rather than harmonized, and I would likewise propose that courses in nonconventional medicine should also be offered at universities. I welcome Mr Lannoye's proposals for the Commission to draw up studies on non-conventional medicine, using them as a basis for any coordinating legislation, and for the Council and Parliament to encourage the development of research programmes in this field."
"Madam President, in following this debate, one sometimes gets the impression that one has read the wrong document."
"There is talk of witchcraft, and there are comparisons with the aviation sector."
"Engaging in polemics and trying to conceal matters or present them in a totally different light does not help matters, in my opinion."
"The point that different Member States have different regulations or problems is a reason for supporting Mr Lannoye's report, rather than an argument against it."
"The ideological battle over this issue has rightly been condemned."
"However, it is not enough to condemn this battle if a colleague who does so then falls into the same error and rides roughshod over doctors."
"Our group has strong reservations and will vote against the report."
"However, a number of Members in our group hope that the Commission will finally carry out a thorough study of the safety, effectiveness and scope of non-conventional medicine and take steps towards harmonization."
"We hope that rules will be introduced in the interests of protecting public health, as well as in those of existing and perhaps future professions, not least in conventional medicine."
"For example, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I are of that opinion."
"Although I am unable to endorse every paragraph and amendment, I broadly support Mr Lannoye's report, and I also fully agree with the substance of the comments made by Mrs Heinisch."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Lannoye for his good report and for highlighting the problems associated with alternative medicine."
"Alongside conventional medicine, and in support of it, alternative medicine has developed."
"It should be borne in mind that conventional and alternative medicine are not mutually exclusive but in many cases, indeed, support each other, to patients' advantage."
"I have myself benefited from both of them."
"However, the position and role of conventional medicine vary widely among the Member States."
"Different views are taken of alternative medicine."
"Trained chiropractors, for instance, have already acquired a legalized status in many Member States, such as Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Britain."
"Because of the differences of approach, it would be difficult to integrate alternative medicine as a whole into European social security systems."
"As Mr Lannoye observes, the position of consumers also differs greatly from one country to another."
"In my view, treatments which do not form part of conventional medicine ought to be precisely defined, as should the levels of training required of their practitioners, so that, when choosing among treatments, patients know as accurately as possible what the various options are."
"It is important to harmonize legislation in order to determine the standard of training institutes for practitioners, to help new graduates find work, to supervise work and further training, and particularly to guarantee the effectiveness and safety of the care offered to patients."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to compliment the rapporteur Mr Lannoye on the breadth and depth of his own-initiative report on non-conventional medicine."
"However, it would be only fair to say at the very outset that at this juncture the Commission cannot share all the report's conclusions."
"The sphere of non-conventional medicine is at present a highly topical and emotive one."
"Discussions on this issue often give rise to strongly-held and conflicting opinions within and outside scientific circles."
"In fact, the difference of opinions and the diversity of attitudes which exist on this subject are very obvious even in the House this evening."
"This divergence of view is reflected, as the report itself points out, in the different approaches adopted by the legislation of the Member States."
"It is for this reason that the Commission feels that the time is not yet ripe for it to undertake the comprehensive study of non-conventional medicines and therapies which Mr Lannoye advocates."
"In compiling reports of this kind, the Commission must rely on national data and policies to evaluate the need for action at Community level."
"But as we are so far from achieving consensus in this area, it is unlikely that such a study, if undertaken at this point in time, would be able to come to any decisive conclusions."
"Furthermore, given the very limited level of budgetary provision for public health programmes, we have, as you know, had to establish priorities for Community action and the severe constraints on our resources do not allow us to undertake other new commitments for the time being."
"The report also invites the Commission to harmonize the conditions for the exercise of non-conventional medicine in the different Member States."
"In response to this specific request, I should first point out that the general system for recognition of diplomas, which has been in place for a number of years now, already guarantees free movement to practitioners between those Member States which recognize non-conventional medicine as a discipline distinct from conventional medicine."
"As the recitals in the resolution point out, it is perfectly true that under Article 57 of the Treaty, the Commission could propose a directive which would provide for the creation in each Member State, subject to agreed rules on education and training, of one or more recognized professions in this field."
"But, in accordance with the Treaty, such a directive would require the unanimous approval of the Member States."
"I must be frank and say to the House that in view of the diversity of approach that I mentioned earlier, it is unlikely that any real progress on a proposal of this kind could be made in the foreseeable future."
"On a more positive note, I should like to say that in relation to food supplements, the Commission in its Green Paper on Food Law adopted on 13 April 1997, announced its intention to initiate technical consultations as soon as possible on the need for and possible scope of Community legislation."
"Concerning pharmaceutical legislation for non-conventional medicines, the Community legislation in the field of medical products is based on the three requirements of quality, safety and efficacy."
"The main problem for non-conventional medical products is the proof of efficacy."
"A special approach was taken with Directives 92/73 and 92/74 for certain homeopathic medicinal products, where a product was allowed to be marketed without fulfilling the requirement of efficacy."
"The Commission is prepared to examine the potential that this approach offers for giving effect to the views expressed in the resolution."
"With regard to the specific issue in point 5 of the motion for a resolution, concerning budget line B6-7142 of the Biomed programme, I have to inform you that it was not legally possible to carry out the research projects referred to because non-conventional medicines are not included in this specific programme's objectives."
"On the other hand, in the case of budget line B6-8332, which is referred to in the preamble of the motion for a resolution, a report by a group of consultants dealing with research on homeopathy has been published in recent days."
"I have brought a copy with me for the honourable Members' information; other copies will find their way to Parliament through the normal channels."
"Furthermore, the Commission has published a call for tender for a study relating to herbal medicinal products."
"A contract for this study will be granted shortly and it is expected that the results of the study will help the Commission in evaluating the situation and in developing possible proposals for specific legislation."
"Although the Commission feels that it will be some time before it is possible to provide a comprehensive response to all the many issues raised in this resolution at Community level, I am confident that Mr Lannoye's report will provide an important contribution to the debate which is already under way within many of our Member States."
"Do you intend to produce a green paper on this topic, Commissioner?"
"The public very much needs information in this field."
"What form will future training standards take, and will it be possible to focus on new issues in the area of research?"
"Madam President, it is not the intention at this time to propose publishing a Green Paper."
"The other matters referred to were dealt with in my reply."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Social aspects of housing"
"The next item is the report (A4-0088/97) by Mr Crowley, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the social aspects of housing."
"Madam President, at the outset I wish to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, Nik Lane, for all his work and also the officials from my own group, Mrs Emma Petroni and Mr Denis Smyth."
"They have put a tremendous amount of work into what I consider to be a very important and vital report which deals with the social aspects of housing policy across the European Union."
"I would like to convey to Members the ideology behind this report and also dispel any fears that some Members may have about it."
"One of the major arguments which erupted in committee when this report first came up for discussion was the question of subsidiarity."
"Through dialogue, negotiation and compromise with other groups in the committee and other interested parties, I have attempted to overcome their difficulties with certain areas."
"You will therefore find that there is no call in the report for a fundamental right to housing to be included in the Treaties."
"I had originally sought this, not least because of the imminence of the Amsterdam Summit."
"However, the European Union already has some power with regard to housing."
"Under the European Coal and Steel Community, there is a specific budget line and a specific reserve for the granting of low-cost loans for the re-housing of coalminers and steel workers, and also for the renovation and re-development of housing in coalmining or steel regions."
"As Members know, the ECSC Treaty lapses in 2002."
"There is no reason why the European Union should not take over the powers of that Treaty."
"The Maastricht Treaty allows for us to do so and also to harness the reserves left in those budget lines and bring them back into use under a new European Union policy."
"The human aspect of what we are dealing with is huge: 18 million people homeless in the European Union, supposedly the most wealthy economic bloc in the world."
"13 million people live in inadequate or temporary accommodation."
"We are talking about nearly 10 % of the population of the European Union suffering because of the lack of a coordinated and proper policy towards housing."
"As well as that, one has to look at the unemployment figures."
"And yet despite the huge unemployment figures from the most recent information from the Commission, the number of people going into skills-based training is reducing every year."
"That means that possibly in five to ten years time there will not be sufficient skilled workers in carpentry, plumbing, building and so on to meet the demand."
"We should look at this not in a negative but in a positive way, of Europe taking to its heart those who are most vulnerable in our society, living the true social model behind this European Union, to ensure that the wealth that is created in this Union will reach every citizen and that he or she will not be at an economic disadvantage because of barriers that are put in place by European decisions."
"As well as that, we have an opportunity to create new employment and new training."
"As part of my research and discussions for this report, I met with the construction industry's federations across the Member States and they are willing to contribute financially towards a house-building programme in cooperation with the local and national authorities."
"I am asking that the European Union become involved as a expert facilitator to bring the best practices from every Member State to show how a sustainable housing development policy could work and also to instigate proper training and managements skills for the operation of those programmes."
"Finally, on the matter of rural depopulation: this is a problem that can be overcome."
"In the last ten years we have seen a decrease in the rural population of Europe of 48 %."
"That has brought with it major problems for large urban areas where tenements have proliferated, where there are inadequate services, inadequate roads and schools and so on. This has brought social problems such as drug abuse and crime."
"By taking positive action, we can rehouse people in rural areas, re-vitalize rural communities and take some of the pressure off urban areas."
"In conclusion, I would ask that all Members take to their hearts the ideology and the belief behind this."
"It is a People's Charter for a better Europe."
"It is showing that we can react to the real needs of every individual European citizen."
"I ask every Member to support it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak about one part of this report, namely the issue of homelessness."
"This is one of the causes and consequences of social exclusion."
"It is one factor of deprivation which, along with unemployment, poverty, social isolation and inadequate education and training, blights the lives of millions of European citizens."
"Homelessness particularly affects the young, the old and other vulnerable groups in society."
"For example, in my own city, the largest single cause of homelessness is domestic violence, namely violence against women and children in their homes."
"Because homelessness is part of a complex multi-dimensional pattern of disadvantage, it requires a coordinated approach from public authorities, an approach which is sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the homeless, which takes account of the fact that homeless people need jobs, schools and health services and an income as well as a home."
"That is the reason that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is calling for a Commission taskforce of relevant directorate-generals to develop integrated strategies to combat social exclusion."
"That is why we are saying that the homeless themselves and their organizations should be consulted about relevant European programmes."
"The major responsibility for the provision of housing lies with the relevant authorities of the Member States."
"If, however, the European Community is serious in its desire to build an inclusive society, Europe can add value to the work of Member States."
"For example, we could be using the structural funds."
"We could be unblocking the Council's veto on the poverty programme to explore new initiatives which address housing needs alongside the need for sustainable urban and rural development, skill training and employment."
"We can create new pathways for the integration of those who are homeless and excluded."
"I hope that Mr Crowley's report, on which I congratulate him, will contribute to this process and that the pace of progress to build a social Europe will gather momentum in Amsterdam next month."
"Madam President, there is an expression in Dutch which says that the later it is in the evening, the more beautiful people become."
"I think this is certainly the case here, but I have to say that there are really very few of us to be discussing such an important issue."
"The Commission recently published statistics on poverty in Europe which show that a considerable number of people live in relative poverty, in other words in comparison with the people around them."
"Of these one third are unemployed, one third are pensioners, and one third are in work."
"This means that a large proportion of these people are still fairly young."
"If we look at the figures for the homeless, we can see that more than half of them too are aged between 20 and 40."
"Most of them have worked at some time, usually in temporary or insecure jobs."
"So poverty and poor housing or homelessness tend to go hand in hand, and both can lead to social exclusion."
"This is why the fundamental right to decent and affordable housing needs to be put into effect through specific measures, first and foremost by the local and national authorities."
"Last year at the Habitat Conference in Istanbul, the first steps were taken at international level to provide housing for all, and action now needs to be taken at local, national and global levels."
"The European Union's role could be to coordinate certain aspects of housing policy, and a European initiative such as a pilot project could be set up."
"As regards the PPE Group's amendments to the Crowley report, I would stress that in the case of Amendment No 13 by Mr Mann, the German version is the original."
"This means that only technical support projects are to be covered, such as technical assistance in obtaining loans."
"It does not mean that housing projects themselves should be given European funding."
"If the rapporteur is prepared to support our amendments, with this clarification, the PPE Group will vote for the report tomorrow."
"I should like to congratulate him on his work, which I think provides us with extremely striking evidence of why action is needed on a housing policy."
"The only question is who should take it, and how."
"Madam President, Mr Crowley's report can be seen as an entirely satisfactory response to the problems connected with the social aspects of housing."
"Where I come from, in Rome, it is said that unless the construction sector recovers, the economy as a whole will not recover; so why not promote this sector across Europe, wherever it can provide a significant number of jobs?"
"But quite apart from employment, housing also represents comfort and a focal point for the principal nucleus of society - the family."
"Every human being has a right to a decent, affordable home; indeed, certain families should be given one free of charge."
"It serves as a meeting-place and base for those excluded from society. Homes are needed for the elderly, and family homes for the handicapped: just think how important it is to incorporate into our town planning - both old and new - family homes where handicapped persons can continue to live after the death of their parents."
"Parliament and the Commission must pay more attention to this sector, which is so important from the social point of view."
"Obstacles exist, of course: there is inadequate funding."
"I am very familiar with the construction sector - I used to build houses before becoming an MEP - and I know that it is a depressed sector, a poorly supported one: the EIB does not yet fund building projects, the rules are still too complicated, and firms both large and small have difficulty in moving around Europe."
"This problem will not be solved unless and until we find a proper solution to its financial aspects, without even mentioning the lack of planning."
"The report touches on all the social aspects of the matter, as well as addressing itself to town planning in respect of housing."
"It is true that planning is essential to free people from the ghettos which would be created if housing were nothing more than bricks and mortar, for the use and abuse of speculators alone."
"Finally, Madam President, larger houses ought to be built, so that this old Europe of ours can have many children."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group sympathizes with the sentiments behind this report, which expresses concern for those groups in society that need us to care for them."
"However, we in the Liberal Group feel that we cannot vote for it, because it expects far too much to be done at European level which we simply cannot achieve."
"For example, we have to disagree with recital B, which says that there is a general trend in the Member States towards the abandonment of their responsibilities in terms of housing policy."
"This and a number of other examples place far too much responsibility on Europe, and Europe simply cannot deliver the goods."
"There is also no legal basis for it, which is why we have said that we will not vote for the report."
"We would not oppose an action programme to encourage model projects, but this is the only thing we feel we can discuss."
"Madam President, more than 18 million people without a home or poorly housed in the European Union is an intolerable situation and one that is likely to get still worse."
"That is one of the most dramatic consequences of policies based on financial profitability which, at the same time, scandalously encourage real estate speculation and increase unemployment, precariousness and exclusion."
"The implacable law of the markets applied to housing throws on to the streets millions of people - young people in particular - who are unable to find a stable job."
"The right to housing is a fundamental human right."
"The report mentions some interesting proposals, such as measures against urban speculation or European funding of projects presented by Member States."
"But I think that an integrated European policy, as demanded by the report, is not a good solution - primarily because experience shows, alas, that most Community policies have lowered social standards because they are never based on the upper level."
"I would also emphasize the fact that the Maastricht criteria and the criteria for the switch to a single currency have led to reductions in the financing of social housing construction and housing support."
"The problem of housing, which depends on each State, can be solved, however; all that we need is the political will to grant social housing the place and the means it deserves."
"I should like to refer to three types of solution which might be food for thought."
"First of all, favouring the construction of housing at accessible prices, offering material support, lowering bank interest rates, taxing speculation."
"As for the homeless, the construction of social hostels where homeless people could seek shelter, and setting up housing centres respecting human rights and including social services so that the various problems posed could be dealt with."
"Above all, we must find ways of halting the increase in the number of homeless."
"Therefore, the barbaric practice of evictions must cease, and must be banned when rent delays are have social reasons."
"Being thrown out on to the street is, in most cases, an irreversible step towards marginalization."
"Losing the roof over your head, especially for children, is terribly traumatic."
"Specialized committees could help people with rent payment problems and make them more responsible for their lives."
"Finally, considerable aid must be given to charity associations whose support is vital, as they are devoted to alleviating the suffering of the least well-off and I would like to repeat the need to re-establish European credits in favour of the fight against poverty."
"Trying to find solutions to solve the basic problem of housing means putting an end to the logic of financial markets and putting human beings rather than money at the centre of society."
"Madam President, in this House it is customary to congratulate rapporteurs on their excellent work."
"On this occasion, when I offer my congratulations, I do so quite sincerely."
"In this report, drawn up at the initiative of Parliament and the Committee on Social Affairs, Brian Crowley has very clearly demonstrated the central importance of housing policy as an element in social policy."
"Other employment and social policy measures are in vain unless people have decent housing from which to go out to work, in which they can bring up their children and where they can relax in their free time."
"It has now become clear to us that there are enormous differences in housing policy between Member States."
"Some Member States spend as much as 3 % of their GDP on housing, others less than 1 %."
"It can also be said that housing policy has been shamefully neglected at Community level."
"It is not too late for us to seek the insertion in the Treaties at the Amsterdam summit of an article on social policy which would create the legal basis for common housing policy measures."
"There is a challenge for us here in the weeks ahead."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I should like to thank Mr Crowley for his report and all the Members who have contributed to the debate."
"While we are all rightly concerned with the problems caused by homelessness, there are strict limits on what the Commission can or seeks to do in this field."
"Fundamentally, housing provision is a matter for the Member States and the Commission does not believe it has any significant role to play in the physical provision of housing."
"Mr Crowley's resolution suggests that European low-cost housing loans could be modelled on the example of the ECSC."
"Certainly this was a programme which brought great benefits in its day but these loans are less relevant now than they were."
"Indeed, demand for them has fallen in several of the Member States, to the extent that part of the funds allocated remains unclaimed."
"The scheme is, in fact, being wound up at the end of this year."
"The structural funds have been cited as a potential source of housing finance."
"This has not been the case in the past, although the Urban Community Initiative has, for example, focused on areas of housing deprivation."
"Whilst I do not know what the Commission will propose in the context of the post-1999 reforms, I wonder whether lowcost housing loans can really be given priority over, for example, our employment needs."
"However, on a more positive note, while the Commission is unable to finance housing as such, it tries to contribute to efforts combating homelessness and the social effects of poor housing."
"We fully agree with the emphasis which the resolution places on the need to adopt an integrated approach to resolve the complex web of economic, social and cultural problems that are their root cause."
"An excellent example of this integrated approach was the Poverty III programme which promoted multiagency approaches to tackling poverty."
"This programme supported a wide range of housing-related projects which range from improving shanty towns in Greece to aiding the regeneration of run-down social housing areas in Edinburgh."
"Indeed, housing action of some sort was involved in almost three-quarters of the projects that were supported."
"Mr Crowley's resolution also mentions the IGLOO initiative."
"The Commission has already provided support to help establish this European network and I would very much hope that we can continue to support this type of activity in the future."
"I should like to thank Mr Crowley for his thoughtful report."
"The Commission will consider his proposals with due care and the material from the Member States is worth studying."
"Thank you, Mr Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"European Information System - Information technology for customs"
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank all groups for the cooperation which they demonstrated in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and their very good will towards this report."
"I should also like to thank our Swedish colleagues for the patience they have shown, as they had their language version of the convention to which we are referring very late in the day."
"They had to start work on the English language version, until the Swedish translation finally appeared, so that we could discuss this report."
"Today, Madam President, the Council and the Commission have explained to us the progress made at the Intergovernmental Conference, including progress on the free circulation of persons, one of the aims of the Union which is still far from being attained."
"This debate could not be more timely."
"We are speaking today of a convention presented to us by the Council, establishing the European Information System, in order to replace the Schengen Information System."
"Today, I am not going to enter into details of the experience of the Schengen Information System, which we approved a long time ago, but I would refer to the report by Mrs van Lancker on that subject."
"I should like to focus on what seems to be the basis of my report: the request for a change to the legal basis of the establishment of the European Information System."
"The Council has presented us with a convention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union."
"Article K.3 refers to Article A.1 of the same Treaty and Article K.1 specifically refers to the crossing of external borders, immigration policy, the policy on nationals of third countries, judicial cooperation, both civil and criminal, customs cooperation and police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism, unlawful drugtrafficking and other serious forms of international crime."
"However, the EIS covers a completely new area since its main purpose is to provide a compensatory measure in relation to the free movement of persons and the abolition of internal borders, an area in which the Community has exclusive powers on the basis of Article 7.A of the EC Treaty."
"The same Article K.1 of the Treaty on European Union provides that the cooperation described in Article K.1 will apply without prejudice to the powers of the European Community."
"Because of the exclusive Community powers, one would have expected Community rules, and that is exactly what we are proposing for the EIS."
"The European Parliament has already expressed itself on various occasions to state that, bearing in mind that the free movement of persons should already have been achieved since the approval of the Treaty of Rome, in other words, virtually 40 years ago, controls on persons at external frontiers ought to be regulated in the same way as controls on goods."
"If we look at the content of the European Information System it is even clearer that Community legislation is called for."
"There is no doubt that the EIS concerns police cooperation, but not specifically in the fields of terrorism and unlawful drug-trafficking, nor other forms of international crime."
"The main aim of the EIS is to sight and monitor the movements of persons wanted nationally, and control the whereabouts of persons subjected to national control, as this is no longer always possible at national level because of the removal of internal borders."
"In other words, as I said before, the main purpose of EIS is to provide a compensatory measure in relation to the free movement of persons."
"Changing the legal basis and using a Community regulation would offer many advantages, such as satisfactory consultation of the European Parliament over a subject for which there are not even any guarantees that national parliaments can effectively exercise their control."
"That would also enable this approach to be applied rapidly."
"I think that experiences such as the Schengen Agreement and Dublin Agreement make us fear the worst."
"Sometimes we have taken over ten years to reach an agreement."
"The Commission also needs a clearer role."
"In Community jurisdiction on a subject concerning personal data, the Court of Justice and Court of First Instance ought to be able to intervene when, for example, citizens are making claims or when a uniform interpretation of the convention is needed."
"As it stands at present, the EIS Convention is linked to the so-called External Frontiers Convention."
"At no point is any sound reason given for this link and, in my opinion, nor is there any reason for making such a connection because the main purpose of the EIS - as I have already said many times - is to compensate for the lack of checks at internal borders."
"Checks at the external borders will be carried out come what may, regardless of whether there is an External Frontiers Convention."
"It is not easy to see why the setting up of the EIS has to wait until the conflict between Member States and the External Frontiers Convention has been resolved."
"A regulation, on the other hand, could not be subjected to a convention established on the basis of Article 6 of the Treaty."
"Coming to a more practical point, I think that everything to do with refugees and persons asking for visas should be looked at carefully."
"It is dangerous that, as long as there is no approximation in this field, this subject should be included in the system, because anyone seeking asylum and having that request rejected could end up being included in the category of undesirable foreigners."
"I think that that is sufficiently serious for us to do everything that we can to stop it happening."
"I think it is unbelievable that the only thing that was specifically mentioned, before this convention was completed, was the fight against illegal immigration."
"I think that we should change that number by controls on immigration."
"There is other minor information that I would like to see changed in the convention, but I wanted to focus what I had to say on the change of the legal basis which we are asking for."
"I think that, if that is done, it would be proof that what the Council tells us here sometimes is something more than just good words, something more than goodwill, and that there really is a political will to head towards the aim of the European Union, i.e. achieving the free movement of persons."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to follow on from what Mrs Terrón i Cusí has just said."
"In doing so, I shall refer to another information system that is due to be set up in the European Union: the Customs Information System."
"Its aim is to enable customs authorities to acquire and exchange as rapidly as possible the information necessary to combat serious crime, with a view to increasing the effectiveness of their cooperation and control procedures with regard to the transport of goods, the treatment of transport companies, the various means of transport, fraud and organized crime. It is also designed to enable them to improve their strategies for combating organized crime through the dissemination of this information."
"Within the framework of this information system, the intention is to address the kind of cross-border organized crime now developing in the European Union, to draw up studies and make these available to the national authorities."
"Naturally, this will only be possible if information is also gathered on the persons committing the crimes - in other words, this information system will also contain personal data."
"So far, so good."
"That is the right and sensible approach, and Parliament must support the Member States' authorities - not only the customs authorities, but all the other national authorities involved - in their efforts to step up the fight against crime in this area, which is constantly on the increase; and we support all efforts to set up the necessary information systems to this end."
"What we cannot support, however, is that in the process of establishing this information system and putting it into operation, in the legislative process that is necessary to bring the Convention into force, Parliament should as usual be sidelined."
"Article K.6 of the Treaty on European Union provides for the European Parliament to be consulted on measures such as the setting-up of a customs information system."
"What did the Council do?"
"It signed and adopted the Convention - and I would urge the House to note this carefully, since this is the Council's customary way of doing things - before its text was forwarded to Parliament in all the official languages."
"In other words, the Members of this House - not many of whom are present here tonight, which I can well understand - had to deal with this project by first having to fight to obtain copies of the necessary document in their respective official languages."
"Moreover, Parliament must also note the fact that the process of consulting it - which in theory should be taking place tonight - is completely worthless, that everything we say tonight is completely pointless and meaningless, since the Convention has already been forwarded to the national parliaments for ratification."
"This issue concerns the establishment of an information system which could include data on every single citizen of the Union, since the Convention contains passages which provide, for example, for the operators of the future European Information System to cooperate with all national authorities which could be involved in the collection of the data for this information system, without it being defined which national authorities are meant by this, or how these national authorities are supposed to transmit the data concerned to the Customs Information System."
"In any event, it seems that nothing less than a race to set up information systems has broken out in the European Union, with a continuing disregard for the right of the freely elected representatives of the people of Europe to be involved."
"Mrs Terrón i Cusí has just told us about the European Information System; I am speaking about the Customs Information System; there is the Schengen Information System; and Europol has its own information system."
"These different systems sometimes process data collections which duplicate each other and overlap. In future, it will only be possible for a European citizen to avoid being included in an information system by residing outside the European Union - but not in one of the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe, since they are cooperating intensively in the establishment of the European Information System."
"This is what distinguishes the applicant states from the European Parliament."
"The Polish Minister of the Interior undoubtedly knows more about the Customs Information System than Parliament's rapporteur - I can assure you of that."
"The same is true of the other information systems, moreover."
"The idea has been floated of creating a single, vast information system combining the customs, European, Europol and Schengen information systems - a sort of information Big Brother, outside the control of national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"The directors of such an information system would have a great job."
"They could collect whatever data they liked, without having to account to anyone for what they did with it."
"If a Member of this Parliament, as an individual citizen of the vast legal area that is the European Union, happened to come into contact with such an information system and objected to the data held on him there, he could not bring a complaint before the European Court of Justice, because - surprisingly - the information system would be outside the ECJ's jurisdiction."
"Following that broad description of this highly undemocratic situation, let me make the following basic comment: anyone who wishes to enlist the support of the EU's citizens for the marvellous European project for the future which could help to alleviate the difficulties in the European Union, anyone who wishes to encourage the EU's citizens to take part in this project, must make them feel that they live in a democratic legal system."
"It is unacceptable that in setting up information systems such as those I have been describing this evening, the aim of which - fighting organized crime effectively - is undoubtedly a good one, the fundamental requirements of democracy should go unobserved, and civil protection and the lawful establishment of the legal foundations should not be guaranteed."
"And they will not be guaranteed, if Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty is constantly trampled underfoot!"
"If that is the case, we shall be unable to persuade the EU's citizens that it is a good thing to take part in the Union."
"And I shall tell you why: it may well be that ordinary citizens - who, tonight, if they are German, are celebrating Borussia Dortmund's victory over Juventus - are not interested in the Customs Information System and do not care if the European Parliament, the German or any other national parliament deals with it - and I am sure that that is the case."
"But when they see, in the long term, that the European Union's entire legislation in the field of internal security is no longer being debated by national parliaments or the European Parliament, when they see that systems are being set up which can intrude in their daily lives without our citizens being able to have a say in how they are established, then I am quite sure that mistrust of these bodies will grow, instead of the trust they need in order to be able to combat those who pose the greatest threat to the development of the European Union - apart from the Council of Ministers, which, if it continues in this way, will be in permanent danger of being criticized for being an undemocratic institution."
"What really poses a threat to us is organized crime, which it must be the aim of all these bodies to combat."
"However, they will only be able to do so efficiently and effectively if their action is placed on a genuinely democratic footing."
"Unfortunately, however, that is not the case."
"I regret to say, therefore, that we must make clear with this report that, once again, a project which is actually a very good one is being laid open to dispute, and will remain open to dispute in the process of ratification by the national parliaments - as is currently the case with Europol - because the Council, in its infinite wisdom - which, tonight, I shall for once describe as arrogance - failed to consult Parliament in good time."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer mainly to the opinions of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes and the Convention on the establishment of the European Information System - the reports on which have already been introduced."
"Cooperation in the customs sector raises the question of demarcation between the first and third pillars, and thus concerns a variety of competences."
"It involves administrative cooperation between the Member States' authorities, and their collaboration with the Commission in areas of Community competence."
"The result is that merely the exchange of information in the customs sector has two different legal bases, which hardly serves the purpose of improving cooperation between customs administrations."
"We are therefore faced with a somewhat misleading title and, above all, an objective which does little to encourage integration."
"The Commission will simply be responsible for managing the system's technical infrastructure."
"Moreover, the Convention establishes no links with other Community databases - some of which have already been mentioned, such as SCENT or IRENE - the database for the fight against fraud, or the IDA proposal to facilitate the smooth functioning of the single market."
"The protection of the Community's financial interests is therefore not taken specifically into account."
"The customs authorities are required to prevent and combat offences against both Community rules and national laws."
"So in the most complicated way, the expenditure for this system will be included in the Community budget and borne by the Member States."
"Under the terms of the TEU, the exchange of customs information must be set within the framework of the EC Treaty."
"Unfortunately, however, the Council has given in to the wishes of certain Member States and placed the Convention within - or let it drift into - the intergovernmental sphere."
"The artificially perpetuated hovering of this Convention between the intergovernmental and Community areas can, in my view, do nothing to promote the campaign against fraud and the protection of the Community's financial interests."
"The paragraph in the motion for a resolution calling on the Commission to determine whether the system could be regulated under the EC Treaty by means of a directive or a regulation raises this problem only tentatively."
"The Convention on the establishment of the European Information System is also designed to improve the effectiveness of controls - this time on the Union's external borders - especially through the dissemination of information on persons or objects being sought."
"Its purpose - and this has already been pointed out - is to transpose the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, which was signed by certain Member States as long ago as 1990 outside the framework of the EC Treaty."
"The European Information System will be funded solely from national contributions."
"There is no provision for any kind of links with the Commission's services - such as the anti-fraud unit - or access by Commission officials to the data in the information system."
"These information systems are necessary and important."
"I too would recognize that."
"However, I have to say with disappointment that this is certainly not the ideal way to draw up Community legislation or create Community facilities."
"These systems will continue to be set up in parallel, and then isolated from one another."
"That is not what we want or need!"
"Unfortunately, it cannot be said that the Intergovernmental Conference will produce any relief either, though that is a popular term there - at least, not yet, I am sorry to say!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights delivered its opinion on the convention on the establishment of the European Information System, it had at its disposal only a draft convention dated December 1995, which was still being examined by the Council of Ministers."
"The Parliament's involvement in the framework of Article K.6 is an imperfect one and depends on the goodwill of the Presidency. It is not accompanied by the jurisdictional guarantees that characterize the European Parliament's participation in the legislative process, pursuant to Article 138.B of the Treaty."
"Article K.6 of the TEU provides for Parliament to be informed and/or consulted by the Council Presidency in the framework of Chapter 6. The letter by which the French Presidency forwarded a draft EIS convention to the European Parliament was informative rather than consultative."
"Nevertheless, the European Parliament decided to deliver an opinion."
"The aim of this Convention is set up the means and even the conditions prior to the free movement of persons."
"The EIS Convention is an instrument of the Convention on Crossing External Frontiers of the Member States of the European Union."
"These two conventions are very closely interlinked."
"Police and judicial cooperation set up by the EIS Convention between Member States with a view to rapidly disseminating information on persons being sought, under surveillance or to be arrested, with legal guarantees established by the convention, should make it possible to make progress towards the aim of the free movement of persons."
"On the other hand, the Schengen Information System is the model on which the EIS is copied."
"On this model, the EIS comprises two parts, a national part, and the separate technical support function."
"This 'twin-arm' system inevitably has the disadvantage that each Member State will apply two separate laws: its own law and that of the Convention."
"The problem will, in all likelihood, arise in respect of the reporting procedure laid down in Article A.4."
"Whereas the welter of international instruments involved in the Convention is proof of the importance of the questions dealt with, our committee fears that this interlink creates a supplementary factor of complexity which could mean that implementation of the EIS Convention will infinitely be delayed."
"Similarly, our Commission regrets that questions concerning the Court of Justice are dealt with separately."
"If they had been integrated that would have strengthened the legal security of the Convention when it comes to be applied."
"Finally, to conclude, I should like to say personally that I strongly regret the fact that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs should not have thought it appropriate to consult the Legal Committee when its rapporteur considered changing the legal base."
"If, as is quite probable, the questions of crossing borders and immigration etc. are dealt with and communitarized at the Amsterdam Summit, it will then be necessary to transform the Convention into a regulation, but not before conclusion of the IGC - that was a little bit premature."
"Madam President, judging by all the empty seats in the House it would appear that our citizens are not all that 'worked up' about these technical issues."
"So, looking at all the interpreters around me, I would like to say a special thank you to those of you who are struggling with us at this late hour when so many are absent."
"But the subject does have important political implications."
"Our people must be able to feel safe in Europe."
"Criminals adapt to the new common order quicker than the legal system does."
"A Europe which does not have an effective system of combating crime or which has a feeble legal system will not win the wide, popular support needed to develop it sufficiently to ensure that people's hopes and expectations, in securing freedom of movement for example, can be fulfilled."
"Free movement through the abolition of internal borders requires compensatory measures in the form of the EIS, primarily at the external borders, to make border controls more effective."
"It is essential for Member States to keep each other informed about items which have gone missing or fake items in circulation as well as about missing persons."
"As for criminals, information about them could be registered where there is good reason for supposing that they are about to commit a crime or where they have committed very serious crimes."
"The fight against crime within the Union is based on the dissemination of information between the national authorities."
"There are currently four information networks."
"Of course there are some differences between them, since they all have different objectives; after all nobody wants a 'Big Brother' attitude in Europe."
"For this reason we need to be cautious about huge information networks."
"There must be clear restrictions surrounding the collection of information, but vital information relevant to a particular case must be included, otherwise it can never be a key instrument in the fight against crime and it has no other function to fulfil."
"At the same time any irrelevant information, and irrelevant information cannot be avoided, must be treated with great care and held at the lowest level possible."
"We regret that the Council has taken so long to produce translations."
"Obviously, Parliament cannot adopt a position on a draft law which is not available in every language, which is why the Council's action could be taken as an indication of how much the democratic process in Europe is being eroded."
"Had the matter been raised under Article 235, the Council could have avoided the current unpleasantness."
"So we have put forward several amendment proposals intended to follow up formally on this position."
"Mr Bardong expounded the PPE group's view on these issues from a constitutional point of view so well that I will skip that section and simply point out that it would be of value if they are ultimately included within the framework of the Union."
"In conclusion I would like to quote Mr von Wogau's words from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"He states the following: ' The Convention creates the information system necessary through the Convention on Controls on External Frontiers, gives concrete reasons for greater co-operation in the legal sector and for police and customs co-operation, facilitates an improvement in the safety of people (and objects) on the Union's territory and contributes to the removal of barriers to the proper performance of national economies: the fight against the criminal economy, illegal trade of all types (narcotics, weapons), terrorism, criminality, crime and the embezzlement of capital.'"
"Then we hope that this convention will be quickly ratified so that people can move freely. The broad consensus shared by both committees ought to be converted into practical action as soon as possible and be viewed as an important step towards freedom of movement."
"Madam President, I would address the reports first by referring to Mr Schulz's report and then to Ms Terrón i Cusí's."
"On behalf of the Commission, I should like to thank Parliament for the significant work undertaken in various committees on the convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes."
"As the House will know, the aim of the convention on the customs information system is to create a database containing operational information on sensitive matters such as illegal drugs, weapons, pornography and so on which are currently outside the Community's legal competence for use by the customs administrations of the Member States."
"As the House will also know, in parallel with this convention, a new regulation on mutual assistance and administrative cooperation in customs and agricultural matters was adopted by the Council on 13 March last."
"Clearly, therefore, the CIS under the convention is complementary to the CIS under the regulation."
"Obviously the Commission has no right of initiative in the field of customs cooperation under the third pillar."
"Having regard to the link with the CIS under the above-mentioned regulation, however, the Commission will also manage the technical infrastructure of the CIS under the convention, whilst having no access to the data contained in this system."
"The House will also be aware of the Commission's active interest in the fight against fraud and the Commission believes that reinforcement of customs cooperation among the Member States, particularly through the use of computerized systems, significantly contributes to the effectiveness of those efforts."
"Our practical experience is that the aspects of organized crime which the customs administration have to deal with cover, without any possible distinction, both first and third pillars."
"That is why the Commission, while respecting the legal constraints deriving from the Treaty of Union, has pushed very hard for operational customs officers to make technical use of the single computerized system."
"The CIS convention obviously falls within this framework."
"To summarize, therefore, whilst the technical infrastructure used for the CIS under the regulation will also be used for the CIS under the convention, in legal terms there will be two different systems in accordance with the pillar structure of the European Union."
"The Commission agrees with the guidelines of the report made by Mr Schulz."
"However, whilst noting the various references made to the Commission in this report the House will know only too well that the Commission has no right of initiative in this area and has to take account of the pillar structure of the European Union."
"Of course the issues raised in Mr Schulz' report could be resolved in the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference and I know that this Parliament and the Commission are in accord on that matter."
"I would, therefore, invite Parliament to continue to support the transfer of the administrative aspects of customs cooperation which are currently under Title 6 of the Treaty from the third pillar to the Community's sphere."
"Of course the penal and judicial aspects of customs cooperation should and would remain in the third pillar."
"But, as Members of the House and the Commission have argued, there are common advantages in administrative customs cooperation and change would consequently provide general benefits, without compromising the distinctive interests of Member States."
"I commend the report to the House and I thank Mr Schulz and his colleagues for their useful work."
"I now turn to Mrs Terrón i Cusí's report on the European Information System."
"I must say that the Commission shares the rapporteur's concern that the EIS Convention is deadlocked in the Council of Ministers and our disquiet is all the more marked because of the clear link between the EIS Convention and the Convention on Controls on External Frontiers."
"The Commission also agrees with the rapporteur's suggestion that the European Court should also become involved in matters relating to the conventions under Article K3."
"I will take the opportunity in this debate to clear up a few misunderstandings which have become evident."
"Firstly, the European Information System (EIS) will replace the Schengen Information System (SIS)."
"We will therefore just have one system and not two."
"Secondly, the Eurodac System is about the possibility of taking fingerprints in the case of asylum-seekers and has to do with the implementation of the Dublin Convention."
"Thirdly, CIREA and CIREFI are not information systems, they are working parties in the Council of Ministers."
"The Commission has pointed out on several occasions that the term 'Centre ' in both these titles could lead to misunderstanding so I emphasize that in this case Centre refers to groups and not to places."
"I trust that is crystal clear."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we have to be careful to avoid an overlap between different information systems in the future, for example with Europol systems."
"At the same time the Commission is convinced that the introduction of the EIS system will lead to clearer and more rational information systems and, who knows, one day it may lead to clearer and more rational hours of debate for this Parliament."
"In closing I would like to make a general comment on an institutional question which runs like a common thread through both the reports which are being debated tonight."
"Ms Terrón i Cusí suggests that the EIS Convention might be converted into a regulation."
"I have to say to her, however, that it is doubtful whether it would be possible to apply Article 235 of the Treaty in practice since, like Article K3 it requires unanimity in the Council."
"The questions we have been discussing here tonight show that it would be much easier if we had a common legal framework."
"That is why the Commission proposed to the Intergovernmental Conference that everything in Title 6 with the exception of police cooperation and judicial cooperation should be transferred to the first pillar."
"Such a change in the Treaty would facilitate our work on both the EIS and the CIS and provide plain benefits for the Community and for its people."
"I hope therefore that Parliament will continue to give support to the Commission's proposal in the IGC and I also hope that the results of the Intergovernmental Conference and the new Treaty will mean that our common desire for greater efficiency can become a reality."
"I am grateful for the work done by Ms Terrón i Cusí and her colleagues in a report that gives further substance to the case for progressive change."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Air carrier liability in the event of accidents"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0172/97) on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0092/97-95/0359(SYN)) with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation on air carrier liability in the event of accidents (Rapporteur: Mr González Triviño)."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to thank all of those in the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their work, dedication and cooperation so that this duty could be performed."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for the sensitivity that it has shown to the amendments tabled by the European Parliament and its willingness to accept the Parliament's opinion."
"I should also like to thank Mr Sánchez, who was a Member of the European Parliament for two years and began this process."
"In recent years, air transport has taken on considerable, unprecedented importance in the countries of the European Union, as a result mainly of the following factors:"
"First of all, higher incomes which have made this means of transport more accessible."
"Secondly, liberalization and competition measures within the European Union, which have slashed air fares."
"And finally, technological progress which has made it possible to use aircraft more intensively, increasing capacity over the last 20 to 40 years."
"The result is that, in recent years, the number of air passengers in Europe has been going up by almost ten million a year."
"The latest figures from the Association of European Airlines indicate that there are now more than 150 million air passengers a year."
"This is a very high figure, which clearly shows that air transport has become a system regularly used by a large proportion of the European population."
"However, in the field of insurance cover for air carrier liability, this is still covered by the provisions of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol which, now more than 40 years old, are very antiquated, for obvious reasons."
"Logically, the same criteria for insurance protection in a system of transport initially regarded as very risky and used by a minority of the population can no longer apply."
"We have reached the absurd situation in which passengers using air transport have poorer coverage and protection than road passengers, despite the fact that statistics show that air transport has become the safest of all existing forms of travel, with an average number of deaths of approximately 700 persons a year."
"A study carried out by the European Commission shows, for example, that an incident of a 40-year old manager dying in a road accident could result in damages of 650, 000 ECU, whereas his or her death in an air crash would lead to compensation of 30 times less than that."
"This is due to the fact that the maintenance of minimum guarantees stipulated in the Warsaw Convention is still the international norm, except in cases of airlines whose countries have approved separate national standards."
"On the other hand, it is quite obviously unfair that no measures have been taken to uniformize the level of coverage received by all citizens of the European Union."
"That is why the Commission's initiative is a laudable one, and that is the one which is being submitted for the European Parliament's consideration today."
"The debates and exchange of opinion in the Committee on Transports and Tourism showed that there is unanimity among the various political groups in backing the Commission's initiative."
"The main aspects of the regulation are the following:"
"First of all, to waive all financial limits of liability where the airline is at fault for damages suffered by passengers in the case of injury or death."
"Secondly, even if carriers can show that they took all measures to avoid damage to passengers, liability is set at the equivalent of 100, 000 ECU for each passenger."
"Furthermore, it lays down provisions for advanced hardship payments to victims to offset their most pressing economic needs or those of their beneficiaries."
"It is important to point out that the adoption of these protection measures for air passengers does not necessarily mean any considerable increase in transport costs, since the cost of insurance premiums varies from one to three thousandths of air companies' costs."
"It should also be mentioned that passengers in the European Union flying in planes belonging to carriers registered outside the European Community will have a lower degree of protection."
"It should also be pointed out that the regulation obliges non-Community carriers to inform their passengers of their degree of insurance coverage, i.e. lower than that existing in the European Union, at the time of ticket purchase."
"It is predictable that once this regulation is enforced higher levels of coverage will be extended to all air users, as many of these concepts have already been adopted by a number of world airlines in the inter-carrier agreements on passenger liability, voluntarily approved in Kuala Lumpur, in October 1995, covering already a total of 83 major airlines."
"It should also be pointed out that the Legal Committee of the International Civil Aviation Organisation has just completed its proposal to revise the Warsaw Convention, to be put later this year or at the beginning of next year to the diplomatic conference of that Organisation."
"If, as is foreseen, the Council has to consider the content of the text that we are debating here in order to meet international standards in this field, we hope and desire that the final text will be submitted again for consultation by the European Parliament."
"Madam President, there have been a lot of changes between the first and second readings."
"But one thing remains the same."
"The debate seems to be taking place at about ten minutes to midnight."
"Those of us who travel regularly by air have seen year-on-year the increased number of passengers at our airports."
"Fortunately the risk to most of these air passengers from transport accidents is extremely low and I certainly took great comfort from the impressive statistics which the rapporteur produced to prove that."
"But when disaster strikes, there needs to be an adequate system of insurance protection which entitles consumers to full and fair compensation and gives access to funds within a short time to meet urgent commitments."
"This regulation helps considerably in this respect and represents a big step forward in consumer protection within the EU."
"It is one on which there has been a very considerable amount of accord between the institutions and also between the Members of this Parliament."
"Up to now the obligations of air carriers, as the rapporteur said, have been governed basically by the 1929 Warsaw Convention."
"That is quite old - in fact, it is as old I am and that is quite old."
"Obviously this needs updating and many of the voluntary agreements amongst the European and other airlines have recognized this."
"The regulation brings these together and improves them considerably."
"The original proposals which the Commission put forward have been greatly strengthened by the amendments carried in the European Parliament in the first reading, as, indeed, the common position of the Council indicates when it states that it takes on board most of these amendments, most of them supported by the Commission itself."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism and the two rapporteurs can be well pleased at a job well done."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the regulation waives all financial limits of liability, where the airline is at fault."
"This is necessary to keep pace with the vastly increased amounts being granted by the courts in these circumstances."
"Even in the case where the carrier did everything to avoid an accident, there is now to be a strict level of liability and in fact, there are also proposals for advance payments in the case of death."
"These are very much needed and have been a strengthening of the regulation."
"Of course these provisions apply only to European Union airlines, but, I am pleased to say, that non-Community carriers are obliged to inform passengers of their conditions when they purchase their tickets."
"Finally, as I said, this is an improvement."
"But as European passengers are flying more and more outside Europe and new, and sometimes dodgy, airlines spring up, we must do everything we can in the way of striking new agreements with other parts of the world to see that this protection for air passengers is extended even wider."
"Madam President, I regret that a matter of such sensitivity to air travellers is taking place at such a late hour."
"But I would like to thank everybody for staying on this evening, especially the interpreters and, obviously, the Commissioner, as well as fellow speakers."
"The Group of the European People's Party welcomes the Commission draft regulation and I would like to congratulate Mr Gonzalez Triviño, the rapporteur, on his work in this regard."
"It is important to recognize that the common position reflects the main objectives of the proposal."
"Its main points are extremely important: to update the levels of liability for the carriers, recognizing the lower risks involved in air travel today but the higher level of damages paid to victims in transport accidents."
"It is important to waive the financial limits of liability where an airline is proved to be at fault but to impose a strict level of liability up to the equivalent of 100, 000 special drawing rights."
"The most important thing is that non-EU carriers must inform passengers of their conditions of carriage at the time of purchase of the ticket."
"The situation in Europe today is regrettably very fragmented and in this regulation and our comments on it we should emphasize the need for uniform interpretation of liability."
"The proposed regulation is therefore extremely welcome in this regard."
"My group will support the amendments with the exception of Amendment No 4 by Mr Wijsenbeek."
"We believe that the original text is better and stronger."
"We commend this proposal to the House and we are particularly grateful to our rapporteur Mr Gonzalez Triviño for the excellent work and for the Commissioner for his patience in being with us here this evening."
"Madam President, Commissioner, since we are all in agreement, I should simply like to make two brief points."
"I am somewhat disappointed that the Council did not agree to the Commission's proposal that the regulation should enter into force six months after publication, but has extended that period to one year."
"I appreciate that airlines have to prepare themselves, but I preferred the Commission's proposal to the effect that six months are sufficient."
"That would clearly have improved passenger protection and would have been better."
"Commissioner, perhaps you should say something about one of Parliament's amendments which I regard as particularly important."
"Amendment No 4 by Mr González Triviño calls on the Commission to ensure, in all future civil aviation negotiations with third countries, that those countries introduce liability rules in the interests of passengers that are similar to those laid down in the regulation."
"You know that the Council frequently makes life difficult for the Commission in its negotiations with third countries."
"We are therefore asking that legislation should be adopted to ensure that action is taken in the context of such negotiations."
"Ensuring that European passengers have the same rights of protection when they fly with non-Community airlines is presumably a concern that reflects both our views."
"If we decide this jointly, Commissioner, if the Commission supports this request, the Council will create fewer difficulties for us."
"And, above all, it will create fewer difficulties for you."
"I would therefore ask you to comment on this particular amendment by Mr González Triviño, and to accept Parliament's proposal that this issue should be incorporated into all negotiations with third countries."
"Madam President, there is one advantage - and I think only one - in meeting and discussing important issues at this time of night."
"It promotes a certain kind of team spirit which is all to the good, especially in the development of further solidarity between the Commission and this Parliament."
"I am extremely grateful to those Members who have expressed satisfaction at the fact that the Commissioner is here to listen to this interesting debate tonight."
"All of us are here, of course, at no extra cost to the European taxpayer."
"As the House will know and as Members have said, this proposal offers the legal prospect of welcome change and improvement in the protection of the interests of air transport passengers."
"Despite the fact that there is still a small point of difference with the Council, progress towards the adoption of this regulation is assured and the fact that the common position wholly or partly incorporates fifteen of the nineteen amendments adopted by this Parliament during its first reading, will mean that the House can feel some justifiable satisfaction."
"The main objectives of the original proposal were, as the House will recall, the removal of the long outdated liability limits of the Warsaw Convention, the establishment of a principle of strict liability up to 100, 000 special drawing rights, about ECU 120, 000, and the specifying of a requirement for airlines to make an advance payment to persons entitled to such payments."
"I am pleased to say that those objectives are all intact."
"The only change of significance made by the Council was the deletion of the commitment to introduce application of the regulation in negotiations with third countries."
"That proposal has now been re-submitted in the amendment offered by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as we have heard in the course of the debate."
"As the House will know, the Commission considered this amendment and the proposal contained within it to be a useful and legitimate proposal which, without violating the rules of the Warsaw Convention, aims to encourage third country carriers to apply the same levels of insurance cover as Community airlines, while those third country airlines are operating within the Community."
"The Commission can therefore agree to Amendments Nos 1 and 4."
"I can also inform the House that in our preliminary discussions with the Central and Eastern European countries on air transport, the Commission has already adopted this approach by requesting that their air carriers apply such levels of insurance cover when operating to, from or within the Community."
"The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 2 and 3 to replace Article 6.2 and 6.3 of the common position."
"It is important that comprehensive information on the carrier's liability regime is accessible to passengers exactly as Mr Gonzalez Triviño has correctly argued."
"The conditions of carriage also contain other information of interest to passengers and a reference to those conditions clearly has value."
"The suggested system would mean that there was no need for several different notices to be attached to the ticket, thereby dealing with the problem highlighted in recent correspondence from IATA."
"I would like to commend warmly Mr Gonzalez Triviño and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the excellent work done on this issue, not just in the report we are considering tonight."
"I am very grateful for the continued support which has been consistently offered by this House to the Commission on this proposal."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.05 a.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, concerning the Minutes, item 2: yesterday I brought up the subject of Norwegian salmon dumping."
"I have to report to the House that the reports we heard yesterday seem to be true that Norway has done a deal with the European Union which will involve a voluntary code of export limitation."
"There will be much anger within the EU that the country which voted No to membership of the club seems to have better access to the Commission than we in this Parliament when we tried to raise the matter yesterday."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please join the members of the Austrian Freedom Party in welcoming to the gallery a very special guest, Mr Lama Gangchen, the President of the World Peace Foundation, who is visiting the European Parliament for the first time."
"Thank you!"
"Mr President, I come from a peripheral region where we depend very much on fish and fish farming as we have no alternative source of employment, so I fully support my colleague Allan Macartney from Scotland."
"We must ask, who do we represent?"
"Do we represent the citizens, the fishermen and the fish farms in the Union, or those outside the Union?"
"The Commission must take a hard look at itself and think about who we represent."
"Mr President, I am glad that Mr Macartney has raised this matter."
"It is an important issue of the standing of this House and its relationship with the Commission."
"The Committee on Fisheries and Parliament have always taken the view that we should stand together supporting the European Union in this dispute with Norway."
"For the Commission to enter into any negotiations and do a backroom deal, not considering the full implications for the European Union, is not very clever."
"And we should ask the Commission to make a statement at the next part-session so that we can understand fully what has been going on in the background."
"Mr President, on the same issue, the Socialist Group supports the other groups in demanding a statement from Commissioner Brittan."
"For the last few months I have been trying to find out exactly when he is going to divulge the contents of the study his department has been carrying out."
"There have been leaks in the press to the effect that he was recommending a duty on Norwegian salmon imports but that he is now getting cold feet about going down that road."
"He seems to prefer the old road of minimum import price which has not worked in the past as we have seen in this Parliament."
"So, as Mr Provan has suggested, I hope Sir Leon Brittan will make a full and frank statement to the House on Monday or Tuesday of the next part-session in Strasbourg on the current state of play on this very serious issue, which affects thousands of jobs in Scotland, Ireland and other parts of the Community."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Social security: workers moving within the EU"
"The next item is the report (A4-0118/97) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0452 - C4-0543/96-96/0227(CNS)) amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament finds the proposal which is before us today to be very positive, Commissioner."
"The aim is to strengthen the existing telematic services in the Member States which are required for the coordination of social security systems."
"We are quite happy with the proposal."
"Another excellent proposal concerns sickness and maternity benefits for students and trainees."
"Europe already has freedom of movement, and this is something we wish to promote."
"We wish to ensure that increasing numbers of students have the opportunity to spend a year abroad either studying or following a training course, and it is therefore all the more reasonable that the system in their Member State should also entitle them to sickness and maternity insurance."
"So this amending regulation can count on our support."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that my own country, the Netherlands, has adopted provisions which will prevent Dutch students going abroad from taking advantage of this excellent legislation."
"We in the Committee on Social Affairs feel that the opt-out that the Netherlands has requested on this point must be rejected."
"One Member State must not be allowed to treat its students differently from other Member States."
"I also have a number of supplementary questions."
"We are all familiar with the problem of frontier workers, which affects not just the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, but also France-Spain, Spain-Portugal, and Italy."
"The problem is growing, because Member States are under increasing pressure to make cuts in their social security budgets and are therefore changing their systems."
"But the Commission is not always immediately notified of any changes made, so that it can examine whether they have any impact on people living in one country and working in another."
"The notification procedures are simply not adequate, and I would ask the Commissioner what he intends to do about them."
"We had an example of this yesterday, unfortunately again in the Netherlands, when something was decided in the Second Chamber in a general debate and all the political parties, not just the CDA group but also the VVD, PVDA and D66, then asked the Secretary of State to consult the Commission about whether what they had done was acceptable."
"And what had they done?"
"They had tabled a proposal which would drastically reduce the rights of people working in the Netherlands but living or intending to live in another country."
"The effect is that if you are, say, a Belgian frontier worker working in the Netherlands and you become unfit for work, you can claim benefits for a limited period only."
"It also means that there is no longer any guarantee that you can build up old-age pension or social insurance contributions."
"Has the Commissioner discussed this with the Netherlands?"
"These rules will affect not just the countries bordering on the Netherlands, they could also have implications for the whole of Europe."
"Have you had contact with the Netherlands?"
"Will you do so as soon as possible?"
"If there has already been a general debate, then the matter will be dealt with by the Second Chamber very shortly."
"Will you talk to them as soon as possible and report back to us?"
"Parliament has already expressed its views in an earlier report which I drew up on the changes that are constantly being made in social security."
"Should we not discuss the effects on commuters and frontier workers once again with the Ministers for Social Affairs, so that we at least know what is happening in advance, rather than constantly having to take corrective measures after the event?"
"I should like to thank the Commission once again for its proposals and for the successful cooperation we have had, and I hope that my amendments will be adopted."
"Mr President, this report regulates the social security system in the case of an employee or a self employed person and their family relocating within the Community."
"It is an important report since mobility is increasing, and this, of course, is something to be welcomed."
"The amendments which the Commission has proposed aim to incorporate amendments which for the most part have already been made in national legislation."
"But it is still a good thing that this is continuing."
"Currently a person who is residing in another Member State to further their studies is entitled only to 'minimal health care' if they are sick; this is a form of basic health care or emergency health care."
"But under the Commission's amendments they will have access to care each time they need it, something which really ought to be a matter of course."
"Naturally, this is something which must be supported, and something which we do in fact support."
"The committee takes a positive view and welcomes improvements especially for students."
"The Liberal group also supports the amendment which aims to guarantee citizens from third countries studying in the EU the right to emergency medical care as well."
"This, Mr President, is an improvement on the current situation."
"But I would like to point out that there is still a difference between students coming from countries within the EU and students coming from outside."
"All the same it is a step in the right direction which improves conditions for students coming from countries outside the Union."
"It ought to be possible to remove the remaining differences during the next round of reforms."
"The Liberal group will vote for this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have had the single market for quite some time."
"We also have gradually increasing cross-border mobility, but the free movement of workers is still inadequately underpinned by social security provisions and access to health care."
"The Commission proposal and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report therefore represent the very first steps towards creating the minimum that is necessary to ensure that basic social rights continue to be guaranteed in the context of the growing cross-border mobility of workers."
"It is important that the provisions will also apply to students and workers on vocational training courses, since this an area in which mobility is particularly increasing, thereby contributing to the consolidation and development of the internal market in paid employment."
"I would also stress the importance of ensuring that third-country nationals are no longer discriminated against, as at present."
"We must continue to take steps in this direction."
"There are other wishes that remain unfulfilled."
"Since we are interested in ensuring the development of cross-border mobility within the European Union, we are also interested in making it possible for workers to take benefits from their own Member State with them when they go to reside temporarily in another Member State."
"In its assessment of the possibilities here, the report falls short of what is required."
"To sum up, it can be said that in those areas where Parliament has a say, it clearly has difficulties securing even small advances."
"Only in areas in which it has no say can it formulate broad principles."
"We must finally overcome this discrepancy."
"We must introduce genuinely principled and radical policies in our legislative processes."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, the rapporteur, for the continuing support she gives to the amendments of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72."
"The Commission welcomes the very positive attitude of the European Parliament on this proposal and Parliament shares the Commission's opinion that Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and 574/72 on the coordination of national social security schemes need to be updated in the light of changes made in national legislation."
"Parliament also shares the view that it is necessary to give a proper basis in the text of the regulation to telematic services for the coordination of social security schemes."
"This is known as the TEST programme and Mrs OomenRuijten has made particular reference to the importance of this."
"Parliament also endorses the proposal concerning the extension of the rights of health care benefits to students and to those on vocational training staying in a Member State other than that in which they are insured."
"In her report, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten suggests three amendments."
"The first and the third concern the derogation proposed for the Netherlands on the method of reimbursement between Member States of health care costs for students."
"It seems that this derogation puts the Netherlands in a favourable position vis-à-vis the other Member States."
"The Commission is therefore prepared to endorse these amendments."
"The second amendment seeks to extend to third country nationals the right to health care when they are staying temporarily in a Member State other than that in which they are insured."
"Mr Wolf made particular reference to this point."
"The Commission had already forwarded this idea to the Council in 1995, unfortunately without success."
"However, the Commission is again prepared to take over this amendment in its modified proposal."
"Finally, there was another point raised by the rapporteur."
"It does not have anything in particular to do with today's report."
"However, it concerns a decision of the Dutch Government and it is due to enter into force shortly."
"It relates to disability pensions."
"DG V is aware of the issue and has received representations from disabled people concerning this proposal."
"DG V has asked the legal service for advice on this matter and the issue appears to be quite complicated."
"It is also politically sensitive."
"Even if the Commission is unhappy with the new decision, it cannot prevent it coming into force."
"However, should it come into force, the Commission could be in a position to institute infringement proceedings, if it is contrary to European Union law."
"I give an assurance to the honourable Member that the matter will be pursued with all diligence as she has indicated it should be."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Passenger registration and training of seafarers"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0152/97 by Mr Watts, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(96)0574 - C4-0029/97-96/0281(SYN)) on the registration of persons sailing on board of passenger ships; -A4-0174/97 by Mr Parodi, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(96)0470 - C4-0550/96-96/0240(SYN)) amending Directive 94/58/EC on the minimum level of training of seafarers."
"Mr President, the view of the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that this Commission proposal for a directive on the registration of persons on board passenger vessels in the European Union should be endorsed."
"Indeed, the committee was unanimous in its support for this measure."
"We believe it is overwhelmingly clear that this measure is necessary as a means of ensuring effective search and rescue."
"To fully appreciate why this measure is so important, one must go back at least ten years, most notably to the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 just over ten years ago."
"When that ship sank with the loss of over 190 lives, the official report at that time concluded that one of the factors leading to the loss of the ship was the lack of concern shown by the company, in that case P & O. One of the ways in which that lack of concern was demonstrated was the fact that the company did not know how many people were on the ship nor the names of the passengers."
"One of the recommendations of the Sheen report was that passengers should be listed and each should have a boarding card."
"Ten years on there has been little or no action to put that recommendation into practice."
"Since then, tragically, we have seen further passenger vessels involved in accidents, some serious, some not so serious."
"On the Scandinavian Star many people died in a fire."
"Most notably, 900 lives were lost when the Estonia sank."
"In all these cases the effective search-and-rescue operation was impeded because of the lack of passenger registration."
"Some people say that this is a burden and a chore and that it will impose costs."
"To some extent there will be additional responsibilities but surely as we approach the new millennium, the least we can expect from ferry companies is an acknowledgement that they ought to know how many people are on their ships and who they are."
"If they can record details for the purpose of vendor control for duty-free - which I agree they should be doing - why can they not have a list for the purposes of search-and-rescue?"
"Surely the lives of their passengers and crew is as important as ensuring the effective enforcement of duty-free regulations."
"There are also a number of further points which are worth conveying to Parliament."
"Firstly, concerning overcrowding."
"Sadly there are still cases of ferries sailing in European Union waters with excessive numbers on board."
"At a stroke this measure will prevent that."
"Secondly, as I have already explained, this measure will allow more effective search-and-rescue."
"HM Coastguard in my own Member State fully endorses this measure."
"It will greatly assist their operations."
"In my own constituency, the Kent Fire Brigade tells me that this is exactly the sort of information it needs."
"It wants to know why we have waited ten years for this measure to come into force."
"Thirdly, it will enable ships to ensure that their safety equipment is appropriate for the sort of passengers they are carrying."
"Finally, and possibly most important, it will lead to a change in attitude on the part of ferry companies."
"Passengers are no longer just numbers, no longer just a source of revenue, but real people with real names, real lives, real families and with real value."
"The broad thrust of this proposal is welcome."
"However, there is a need for the information to become available immediately upon the point of departure of the ship."
"Waiting half an hour could, tragically, be half an hour too long."
"The Herald of Free enterprise sank within twenty-two minutes of leaving Zeebrugge."
"Secondly, we think there is a need to extend this measure to cover under-sea tunnels, in particular Eurotunnel."
"It does not make a lot of sense that the cross-channel routes quite rightly are caught by this measure but the tunnel is not."
"We simply do not know how many people will be in the Channel Tunnel at a given time."
"The emergency services argue - as do the ferry companies - that for the sake of fairness and safety we need to see progress in this area."
"I hope the Commissioner can comment on this suggestion of ours."
"Finally, we are asking not only for journeys of 20 miles to be covered but also journeys in excess of two hours which we hope the Commissioner can look favourably on."
"In conclusion, we believe that real progress has in the last two years finally been made on the issue of ferry safety."
"It is true that it took the loss of the Estonia to give this issue the momentum it needed but I would also pay tribute to the way in which Commissioner Kinnock, since he became Commissioner, has ensured that the issue of safety in general has remained at the top of his agenda. Safety at sea, in particular, has remained at the top of the agenda of this Parliament."
"He ought to take credit for the way in which he has skilfully steered through a number of important legislative proposals which ensure that the lives of passengers at sea and crews are that much safer."
"The work must continue and my report acknowledges the fact that there is more still to be done."
"But we confidently believe that this measure which is simple but important will significantly contribute to safety at sea and we look forward to working with others who share our concern and in particular with Commissioner Kinnock."
"We can assure him that we will always continue to support his efforts to put safety at the top of the agenda."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the International Convention on standards of training, certification and watch keeping for seafarers - the STCW Convention, as revised in 1995 - is to bring the training of seafarers more into line with the real conditions of sea transport, in particular the new technological developments on board vessels and modern methods of vocational training."
"Let us not forget that almost 80 % of accidents at sea are caused primarily by human error or negligence."
"In order to remedy this situation, or at least to minimize the 'human factor' in accidents at sea, it was necessary to lay down minimum requirements for vocational training, certification and watch keeping for seafarers and to guarantee proper enforcement of the international provisions - avoiding what had happened in the past, when failure to comply with the provisions of the Convention led to a lack of confidence even in the certificates issued."
"The new 1995 Convention, to which 14 Member States of the European Union are contracting parties, therefore marks a step forward towards greater safety at sea, in that it strengthens the powers of the IMO to monitor the signatory states' training and verification methods."
"At the same time, the IMO will be able to respond to any shortcomings by withholding international recognition of certificates issued."
"The proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 94/58/EC, which is the subject of my report, calls for all the requirements of the Convention to be properly and effectively implemented in the EU and incorporated into Community law."
"Starting out from the need to improve safety at sea, which is the guiding principle behind my report, I have sought to introduce certain changes which, without altering the legal nature of the Convention, are designed firstly to improve and consolidate the proposal for a directive wherever possible, making it simpler to interpret and apply; and, secondly, to remove any legal uncertainty or conflict as regards Member States' obligations in terms of issuing and recognizing certificates and training seafarers."
"On the basis of this approach, the main modifications to the original text include the need for a common working language to be established on board all vessels, in keeping with the new SOLAS regulation due to enter into force on 1 July, so that all crew members are able to communicate with one another; the need to better reconcile work on board with the necessary qualifications; a more rational system of recognizing qualifications issued by third countries, subject to a set of quality criteria to prevent the use of under-qualified crews; and finally the tightening-up of the directive on port state control."
"I believe that the training of seafarers can help to improve the safety and competitiveness of the Community fleet and, in a broader context, to reduce the number of sub-standard vessels."
"Although it is too soon to assess in any detail the impact of the revised Convention, it is certainly likely to be significant."
"Indeed, most international commentators consider that the introduction of new standards will lead to a worldwide reduction in the number of seafarers who possess internationally recognized certificates."
"If the effect is a general raising of levels of competence among seafarers, that will undoubtedly be beneficial for the international shipping industry."
"The simultaneous adoption of measures to promote the training of qualified crew members in Europe, which is now declining steadily, would be equally beneficial, in my view."
"International statistics point to a shortfall of 18 000 officers needed to operate the world fleet, or some 4.4 % of the workforce."
"This aim could therefore be pursued by the Member States and regions through a policy of attracting young people to the maritime profession, by creating a European Maritime Institute - as called for on several occasions by this House - which would offer initial and further training courses for seafarers."
"Under no circumstances should such a project be mounted by shipping companies alone, most of which are already overburdened with management costs out of all proportion to market conditions."
"Instead, fiscal and economic incentives should be offered to make the recruitment and training of European seafarers affordable."
"What is at stake here is safety at sea and of human life, as well as the protection of the marine environment, but above all the safeguarding of a profession and the urgent need to create new specialized jobs in Europe, the demand for which is growing steadily in this sector."
"Once again, through this report, we are opening up new sources of employment for our young people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very welcome that it looks as if we shall be able to agree at this part-session in Brussels on two issues concerning safety at sea."
"When we last met here in Brussels a month ago, we disagreed with the Commission on how to give fair treatment to the shipbuilding industry."
"However, I should like to emphasize - as Mr Watts has also done - that we in Parliament's Committee on Transport are pleased at the cooperation which has taken place with the Commission, and in particular Mr Kinnock, on the question of safety at sea."
"I naturally support these two proposals."
"There are still many accidents at sea, and many people are still losing their lives."
"One cannot imagine that such a large ship as the Estonia can be lost at sea, but that is the tragic truth."
"We therefore need to work to improve maritime safety; in other words, safety has still not been assured."
"Safety at sea is a continuing debate that will never be closed, because new challenges can always arise."
"If the will exists, however, we can take positive steps and achieve more and more good results."
"And I think that is what we are doing with these two directives."
"The directive on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships will help to improve the rescue work in a crisis situation."
"The rules will have a decisive effect in terms of saving the elderly and the handicapped in particular."
"On the whole, the shipowners are sceptical about such proposals."
"Perhaps this reflects the fact that improvements cost money."
"The shipowners can take some comfort in the thought that we are cooperating well on safety in the Community, and there is scope for changes in the rules where special circumstances obtain."
"But we have to start somewhere, and this provides a good basis."
"I feel that the directive on the minimum level of training for seafarers should above all be seen in the light of the fact that 80 % of all accidents at sea are due to human error."
"We need to ensure that seafarers' knowledge of first aid, language skills and other areas of knowledge are constantly improved."
"The West is indeed losing jobs to other parts of the world, and that also applies to seafarers."
"We must therefore be on our guard against social dumping."
"That is why we need to take the offensive in the maritime sector, as we are doing elsewhere."
"A high level of employment of European workers in any sector depends on the emphasis being placed on quality."
"For seafarers, that means training and further training."
"I should like to draw the Commissioner's attention to Amendment No 10 in Mr Parodi's report, which we in the Socialist Group support."
"I realize that the PPE Group is not in favour of it, but I wonder if the Commissioner could tell us to what extent the Commission envisages supporting this proposal."
"Mr President, both these reports deal with safety at sea, which is a vital issue, not just because disasters occur on a regular basis, as has always been the case and is sadly always likely to be so, but also in terms of minimizing the consequences of those disasters which are unavoidable."
"That is why it is essential for the European Union to adapt itself to the standards laid down by the International Maritime Organization."
"Unfortunately, we do not have our own European registration requirements, which is a most regrettable state of affairs."
"There are two problems which are touched on in both reports."
"The first, which Mr Parodi mentioned, is the problem of language."
"Maybe the Commissioner would pay some attention."
"Last year when we had the disaster with the Sea Empress , which went down just off his beautiful native coast of Wales - I see he is in fact listening - it turned out that the only way of communicating with the crew of the Sea Empress was via the local Chinese restaurant owner because the whole crew was Chinese."
"In Mr Parodi's report we insist on a common language."
"With due respect to other European languages, it has to be the English language, as it is in air transport."
"That is one point."
"Secondly, regarding Mr Watts' report, despite all the good intentions, how much will it be able to control and how many ships crews will live up to the standards requested?"
"Mr President, I should like sincerely to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Watts and the Commissioner, Mr Kinnock on this initiative, an initiative which has unjustifiably been delayed until today and which will perhaps make it possible for a safer and more humane functioning of passenger sea transport, with more respect for ordinary passengers."
"I think that the various speakers have been repeating the same position and this shows just how unanimously we are supporting this proposal."
"I also would like to emphasize, in turn, that in terms of Greek ports and sea journeys within Greece this was a necessary proposal, first of all in order to avoid the terrible evil of the uncontrolled overloading of passenger ships and, secondly, so that we can have controls on the ground of the correct means of working out the number of passengers on ships and, thirdly, so that we have all the necessary information whenever an accident happens. Fourthly, as Mr Watts himself very rightly emphasized, we should call on shipping companies, at long last, to change their stance towards the public who travel on their ships: i.e. rather than just looking upon them as a source of profit, also looking upon them as citizens to whom they really do have an obligation to provide some kind of quality, efficient service."
"Finally, I should like to emphasize the fact that, in my opinion, with the development of information systems neither the cost nor operational difficulties are going to be very significant and, therefore, it is important that this should be brought into effect as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, could I add my congratulations to Commissioner Kinnock on bringing forward this proposal for a directive."
"Some credit is also due to the former Member for Merseyside, the late Ken Stewart, who as an ex-seaman worked tirelessly on the Committee on Transport and Tourism to try to improve maritime safety."
"I was particularly concerned when the Estonia disaster occurred to discover that a very good friend of Parliament's, Lennart Pettersson, former chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Swedish Parliament, who had been actively involved with this Parliament during Sweden's accession talks, was one of the victims."
"The scope of that disaster shows the need for a general tightening up by keeping passenger lists so that the number of passengers on board is known."
"I am also concerned from a Scottish dimension."
"Commissioner Kinnock will be familiar with Caledonian McBrayne and Western Ferries."
"Indeed, I believe he even took the wheel when going to Dunoon on one occasion."
"They are interested in this because they have several routes."
"Fortunately their safety record is very good."
"They use common sense so that when the winds are rather high in the Firth of Clyde or the Minch, they do not sail."
"They do not put passengers' lives at risk."
"Nevertheless, they are concerned about the provisions concerning the length of journey, in particular on the run to Barra, which will be encompassed by the directive."
"But I think we can persuade them that it is in their interests."
"The information which the Commissioner has asked for is not very great and with computer technology this should be manageable."
"On the matter of the Channel Tunnel, it is regrettable that last week Eurotunnel cancelled a visit."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism could have discussed Mr Watts' report and its implications with them."
"However, for some reason Eurotunnel decided that cowardice was the best form of valour and decided not to invite us along for a discussion, cancelling the meeting at very short notice."
"This was a pity as we could have had a useful dialogue on the implications of the Watts report for Eurotunnel."
"Generally speaking, the directive is a good one and Mr Watts' proposals strengthen it in many respects."
"Mr President, I wish to refer to the Parodi report on the proposals for a directive on the minimum level of training for seafarers."
"I have to say that there is a story behind this."
"There is an international convention called the STCW on minimum levels of training for seafarers."
"This is an agreement which was signed in the framework of the IMO."
"In 1994, on the basis of an extremely just initiative, the Commission and, subsequently, the Council and the European Parliament produced Directive 94/94 on the basis of which the subject of the minimum level of training for seafarers was revised, in particular in the case of third countries , and that is something I wish to emphasize."
"We are talking about the minimum level of training of seafarers in third countries serving on ships flying European flags."
"Subsequently, the IMO, the International Maritime Organisation, amended the STCW Convention in 1995 and now the Commission is proposing the new directive, a new draft directive, taking into account much of what was agreed in 1995."
"First of all, I must say that the EPP Group regards the Commission's proposal as a very good one, and this is something I should emphasize."
"However, it does not agree with the way in which the Commission proposal has been amended by the European Parliament."
"In particular, we voted against certain provisions of the report and unfortunately we are forced to vote against the report, in particular concerning Amendment No 10, Amendment No 32 and Amendment No 33."
"What does Amendment No 10 say?"
"That Code A of the international STCW Convention will prevail as Community law and this international convention will be in force through the method of the Directive."
"While the amendment states that the Directive will be in force, at the same time it will automatically implement the international STCW Convention."
"This is an unacceptable amendment for us because it automatically binds the Member States, many of which have not yet ratified the STCW Convention."
"We have already emphasized this, a clearly procedural point, and we said that it was impossible through the issuing of a directive for us to be in a situation whereby the STCW Convention should be binding on us, binding on the Member States, which have not yet ratified it."
"However, in its wisdom, a majority of the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided the contrary."
"Nor can we accept that the system set up under the 1994 directive will be abolished."
"As I said to you, the Commission has done some very good work and its amendment, as tabled, is one we can agree with."
"In other words, we want to change very little to the draft proposal which has been put to us by the Commission."
"Another point I would like to refer to is that there is considerable confusion over the addition of a new annex and here we are referring to the Committee's Amendments Nos 32 and 33, which we are against. The reason why we are against these amendments tabled by the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism is that they would lead to considerable confusion."
"Therefore, I shall repeat what I said at the beginning - we shall be voting against this report."
"Mr President, during the discussion of this topic today I, as a Finn, automatically think back to that September morning in 1994 when I heard about the Estonia catastrophe."
"It is an event which seafaring Finns at least will never forget."
"I am pleased to see that the accident with the passenger ferry Herald of Free Enterprise has been highlighted in the report but it is equally important that we remember the victims of the Estonia."
"We must learn lessons from these incidents, and we have done so in both reports."
"But I think that there is still much work to be done on tightening up requirements for crews."
"I note also from the shipping situation which we have experienced in Finnish waters in the Baltic Sea that there are seamen who know less and less about their craft these days."
"I do not think that it is totally out of the question that we should have even stricter requirements for certain stretches of water which are particularly vulnerable, the Baltic for example."
"It is unfortunate that today we are discussing a proposal which is quite far removed from the joint position held by the Council."
"I hope that we in Parliament can also come back to better personal privacy and to certain exemptions for routes on which passengers get on and off (similar to tram routes in the city), for example the type of traffic which we have in our Finnish archipelago."
"I understand that there is readiness in the Member States to review the conditions required for a practical system, such as registration."
"I also hope that in the future, we in Parliament, will put more emphasis on personal privacy itself and that the passenger lists are not stored too long, something which I hope we can come back to."
"I also hope that the Commission can indeed see the need for exceptions in certain waters where the sea is really not rough, where the trips are shorter with people continuously getting on and off; this has also been discussed with the Commission recently."
"Mr President, the subject of safety at sea has been on the agenda repeatedly over the last few years, following the various serious accidents that have occurred."
"Partly thanks to the work of the European Parliament, a coherent European policy is now being developed in this area, and these two reports on passenger registration and training for seafarers are an important contribution in this respect."
"Given the global nature of maritime transport, any measures taken in this field should be at international level."
"Here too, one of the biggest problems is to enforce the existing regulations, including the 1978 STCW Convention."
"Inadequate compliance has brought this Convention into disrepute, which is why we welcome the 1995 revised version and the Commission's proposal to transpose this into European law."
"In addition to the substantive changes, the main improvement in the amended Convention lies in the provision for tighter supervision and control by the IMO."
"However, we are not happy that the Commission's revision of the earlier directive only covers part of the STCW Convention, whereas what we need is a single directive which incorporates the entire text of the Convention."
"We therefore support the amendments in the Parodi report calling for the whole of the new STCW Convention to be incorporated in a new directive, which will make this present directive clearer and easier to implement."
"I shall also be supporting the amendments which, in line with the STCW Convention, eliminate the reciprocity requirement from the Commission proposal."
"However, we shall not be supporting the amendments which introduce safety requirements above and beyond those in the STCW Convention."
"Given the intense competition on the world market, we cannot allow ourselves to place the European fleet at a disadvantage."
"Finally, a few words about the directive on passenger registration."
"After the various ferry disasters, a series of measures were taken to introduce considerable safety improvements on these vessels."
"The main aim of the Watts report is to make any rescue operations more efficient."
"The introduction of passenger registration systems may appear to generate a great deal of red tape, but the new technologies ought to mean that it can all be done rapidly and efficiently."
"We also feel that Mr Watts' proposals on the scope of the directive are well balanced."
"We shall therefore be voting for the Watts report, with the exception of the amendment on tunnels."
"Mr President, I too believe that a good job has been done here: these two reports tackle head-on the difficulties affecting sea transport."
"However, I appreciate that this is not enough. We must continue to monitor the sector and do more, above all, in the field of safety and training."
"I am of course speaking with reference to areas which I would describe as delicate or sensitive, where passenger numbers are very high, and where the competition enlivening the single market - or, if you like, the deregulation sweeping through the shipping sector - is creating very real problems, to the extent that very often, even the basic legal requirements are being flouted."
"The situation is therefore extremely awkward: I am referring to certain sensitive areas, in particular one that I know well, the Adriatic."
"A good deal more work is naturally required here. For example, even now there are still some Chinese boxes, as it were: companies registered in Community countries but which nevertheless do not meet all the requirements of reliability and trustworthiness when accidents occur."
"This is an extremely tricky point: accidents have occurred in the past where it has been impossible to pinpoint the liability - or even the owners - of a shipping line."
"That is why the Member States are being called to account, just as the Community institutions are being called on to be watchful and to nudge the Member States in the right direction."
"All I would add is that I support Amendment No 10, tabled by Mr Parodi: a ship is a complex machine, so a single working language is necessary."
"Recently, there has been a tendency to rely somewhat on qualifications, in other words having a large number of qualified crew members, whereas the lower grades remain completely unskilled."
"This of course results from competition and the need for hands on deck, and it opens the way to a very real problem of social dumping in the case of seafarers."
"That is another point to be borne in mind."
"Mr President, my congratulations to Mr Watts and the Commissioner for bringing this forward."
"All of us here are frequent travellers."
"There are many anomalies in transport systems."
"For example, if you travel by air from London to Brussels it takes only 40 minutes."
"Yet you are checked onto the aircraft, you have to have a boarding pass with your name on it and the airline is responsible for checking that the name on the pass is yours."
"They have a sheet with all the passengers' names."
"If you come through the tunnel by Eurostar - with its well-documented problems and dangers during recent months - you have a boarding pass with your name on it but there is no check as to whether you are the person whose name is on the boarding pass."
"There is no list of passengers on Eurostar."
"Travelling on the cross-channel ferries between England and France or England and Belgium, there is no check on passengers whatsoever."
"There is no list of passengers."
"The authorities do not know how many people are on board."
"And this is not because there have been no problems."
"Mr Watts spoke of the problems of ten years ago on the Herald of Free Enterprise ."
"In his remarks he said that there has been very slow progress by the owners or the passenger ships in general on the Sheen recommendations which followed this disaster."
"But this was the Herald of Free Enterprise , functioning under the flag of the Townsend Thorensen Company."
"That company was very quick to change its name to P & O so that people did not realize they were going on the same ships."
"They very quickly changed the name of the sister ship of the Herald of Free Enterprise , the Spirit of Free Enterprise , to the Pride of Bruges so that it could carry on sailing and people would not know."
"That was all in the interests of free enterprise."
"Never was a ship more vividly named and the dangers of free enterprise more apparent."
"Some people who have spoken have looked for excuses."
"Mr Stenmarck said that the shipping companies need to know the children and elderly passengers on board."
"They need to know everyone on board!"
"Mrs Thors asked for exceptions on very short trips."
"We do not ask for exceptions on very short air trips."
"Mr van der Waal said that it could be too administrative and there might be problems for competitiveness."
"I do not think the victims of the Estonia or the Herald of Free Enterprise would think it was too administrative."
"We do not want to find ourselves in years to come with these same problems."
"We need proper registration and we need it now."
"Some companies do not object."
"Sea Containers which operates SeaCat and Hovercraft do not object and I am absolutely convinced that the Commissioner with his track record will be 100 % diligent in putting the safety of passengers before that of profit and free enterprise."
"Mr President, like Mr Evans, I am concerned with the safety of passengers, but I will be talking to the Parodi report."
"Four out of five maritime accidents are due to human error or human incompetence."
"As you know, safety at sea, far from reaching higher levels, is declining."
"All the more reason, therefore, for the European Parliament to be concerned with the establishment of minimum standards for training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers."
"The STCW Convention of 1978, blessed by the International Maritime Organization, was updated in 1995 to take into account new technological developments on board vessels and also the more modern training methods currently used."
"The big question for the European Commission was whether it should have absorbed the revised STCW Convention lock, stock and barrel, or whether it should pick, piecemeal, the best revised elements."
"It chose the latter and has fallen foul of not giving a coherent or comprehensive new set of rules."
"This is to be regretted, despite my sympathy for the Commission which is eager to update Directive 94/58."
"It was bent on not cluttering up that directive with the minutiae of detail extant in the STCW Convention."
"Once this decision had been taken in principle, it was Parliament's purpose to make the best of what might be described, unfairly, as a dog's breakfast."
"Given the importance of the shipping industry as an economic generator and its pivotal relevance for being well-administered to maintain the highest forms of safety at sea, the Socialist Group are concerned to batten down all the safety hatches."
"My own amendments focus on safety aspects."
"Regarding principles governing near coastal voyages, for example, it appeared that the Commission was allowing Member States to avoid internationally agreed training and qualification standards."
"But passenger ferries, oil and chemical tankers have all been subject to terrible accidents associated with human error in Britain and the Continent's coastal waters in recent years."
"Article 5(i) concerned with the fitness for duty of seafarers seems remiss on the question of new members, masters, officers or ratings joining a ship just after they had been travelling for some time before arrival on board."
"Ambiguity is evident in the cobbled-together text as to whether masters, as well as ordinary seafarers, are included in watch-keeping regulations."
"To take another example, port state control."
"We should be exercised about the seaworthiness of seagoing vessels."
"But - and I would ask Commissioner Kinnock to take this on board - should we not also exercise control over the competence and qualifications of the crews that sail those particular ships?"
"In conclusion, I accept our rapporteur's interesting proposal to create an EU-wide action programme, designed to attract young people to sea."
"There is a worldwide shortage of qualified and able seafarers."
"Why should young Europeans, properly trained and educated, not contribute to defeating unemployment in Europe as well as contributing to safer seas worldwide?"
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Watts and Mr Parodi on their reports, which are excellent examples of our committee's determination to give priority to safety in transport."
"My sincere thanks to them."
"I think this is a very important point, particularly as we currently have a Commissioner who also gives priority to safety in transport, so if there was ever a time when we, the European institutions, were likely to make significant progress on this issue, it is now."
"The problem that we still have, however, is what I would call the tension between Brussels theory on the one hand, and the reality of everyday life on the other."
"Last week the ADAC organization in Germany published a report on the results of a safety study carried out in April on 14 ferries in the Mediterranean."
"They were very revealing."
"Five ferry links between France, Greece, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Morocco were judged to be totally inadequate, five of the 14."
"Three were classified as reasonable, two as good and two as excellent."
"The study focused on stability, watertightness, emergency safety equipment and fire prevention."
"I would ask the Commissioner to instruct his department to look at this study and then to come back to us with his comments."
"I think it is essential that we not only ensure that we have good legislation, but that we also ensure that it is applied to the letter in practice."
"This is why I would specifically ask the Commissioner to look into the results of this ADAC study and give us his detailed comments on them."
", Member of the Commission . Mr President, not in terms of quality but in terms of temperament, what a great relief it is to be able to speak to this House quite early in the morning, instead of at midnight."
"I am sure we all benefit from the different hours."
"I would like to respond to both the Watts report and the Parodi report."
"I would commend both honourable Members on the quality of the work they have undertaken."
"On the Watts report I should like to thank the House for the thorough but speedy deliberation they have undertaken on this new proposal relating to the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships."
"That speed and thoroughness makes it possible for ministers to adopt a common position at the next Transport Council which will take place in three weeks' time."
"I am very grateful to the rapporteur Mr Watts and to the committee for the supportive view they have taken and I congratulate them on the common understanding they achieved on this proposal whose main and necessary objective, as we have heard this morning, is to ensure that search-andrescue and the wider implications of any accident to passenger ships can be tackled more effectively than in the past."
"It is clear that the two main issues raised by the committee amendments relate to a need for more flexibility to cope with specific situations and a special interest in safety in the Channel Tunnel."
"The objective of more flexibility is pursued in the first part of committee Amendment No 8 and in Amendments Nos 9 and 12."
"I am glad to inform the House that the Commission is prepared to meet the point of those amendments by changing Article 9, in conjunction with some definitions."
"That provides a possibility for explicit derogations to be granted by the Commission in well-defined circumstances after consultation with the committee set up to assist the Commission."
"I am sure that Members of the House will understand that such flexibility should not affect the application of the registration of persons on board ships that operate in areas where dense traffic exists and where adverse weather and adverse sea conditions frequently prevail."
"Indeed, I am very certain that committee members and Members of the House would not want the reasonable flexibility for which they argue to weaken the basic necessary provisions of this proposal in any way at all."
"The suggestion for imposing a registration system for motor cars using railway shuttles which is made in Amendments Nos 5, 7 and 10 falls outside the scope of this maritime directive and the amendments cannot therefore be accepted."
"However, the Commission is prepared to investigate the merits of such a proposal, taking into account assessments like that made by the Kent Fire Brigade, drawn to the House's attention by Mr Watts and, in due course, we will report to the House on the issue."
"I recognize the purpose of Amendments Nos 1 to 4 and I strongly agree with the view that has been expressed this morning by several honourable Members that there is always room for improvement in maritime safety."
"However, it is fair to say that the advances made through the International Maritime Organization and in the European Union for safety management and on safety rules and standards, taken together with last year's Stockholm Agreement on Design and Stability of Passenger Vessels, are evidence of continuing and significant progress."
"Whilst I note and understand the references made by Mr Watts in his explanatory statement therefore, I have to say that some of those references are specific to a particular government and some fall outside the scope of this directive."
"We shall definitely return to these matters but the Commission cannot accept the relevant amendments at this juncture."
"Since it is not the intention of this proposal automatically to exclude passenger ships sailing in sheltered waters from its provisions, Amendment No 6 cannot be accepted."
"The third part of Amendment No 8 which puts the entire burden of providing information on the master of a vessel rather than on the company is also unacceptable and it may be that this consequence of the amendment is inadvertent."
"On the other hand, I can accept an improved wording for the second paragraph of Article 8, along the lines the Amendment No 11."
"I also accept the reference to the precise age of a passenger in Article 6 as proposed by the second part of Amendment No 8."
"However, the final part of Amendment No 8 which would require the use of a full first name rather than allowing initials is unnecessarily inflexible."
"I would like to conclude by thanking all who contributed to this excellent report, in particular Mr Watts whose interest is deep and well-known and was evident again from his effective speech this morning."
"There were questions raised by Mr Watts and other honourable Members."
"I should like to take those at the end of what I have to say."
"Meanwhile I am confident that the adoption of this report by Parliament will facilitate the achievement of a common position on this measure that will have a beneficial effect on safety management and also greatly help authorities and families in the awful event of tragedy at sea and to be able to do that without great bureaucracy, without significant delay to services and without any significant additions to operational costs."
"I now turn to Mr Parodi's report on minimal training levels for seafarers."
"The Commission is grateful to the House not only for the quality of the report but also for ensuring that this report is on this sitting's agenda, following the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism last week."
"As the House will know, the new proposal provides for consistency between the training and certification provisions of Directive 94/58 and the new requirements of the International Maritime Organization Convention on standards of training certification and watch-keeping for seafarers."
"It also defines the common criteria for recognition in the European Union of seafarers' certificates issued by third countries."
"To fulfil these purposes the changes in the existing directive firstly reflect the entire revised STCW Convention, including both the mandatory section, part A, and the recommended guidance in part B of the code."
"The changes secondly correct certain omissions which could lead to inconsistencies between the proposed directive and STCW 95 and the changes thirdly take into account recent amendments in the IMO Safety of Life at Sea Convention, in particular those regarding on-board communication for passenger ships."
"I am glad to be able to tell the House that the Commission welcomes Amendments Nos 10, 14, 21 and 32 since they help to ensure that the STCW 95 Convention is reflected without ambiguity in the directive."
"The Commission can also support Amendments Nos 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 26, 27, 31, 34, 35 and the first part of Amendment No 7 because they improve a number of specific provisions of the directive."
"We can also agree with Amendments Nos 23, 24 and 25 to reflect the recent revision of the IMO's Solas Convention concerning the introduction of a common working language on board passenger ships."
"However, there are a number of amendments which the Commission cannot accept."
"First there was what Mr Harrison just called the big question."
"The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to replace the existing Directive 94/58 by a totally new directive."
"The amending directive before the House can achieve the objective of having a consolidated text by proceeding to a codification after the adoption of the present draft directive by the Council."
"I emphasize therefore that the purposes sought by Members of this House - and rightly so - can therefore be fulfilled without the legal complexities and the possible delay that might come with the alternative course of wholesale replacement."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 2 cannot therefore be accepted by the Commission."
"Amendments Nos 5 and 6 are not consistent with the objective of the directive which is the establishment of minimum training standards and not the introduction of a harmonized system."
"The suggestion in the second part of Amendment No 7 is well-intentioned but it is vital that priority is given to the improvement of the quality and the performance of the existing national maritime institutes and the creation of a symbolic European Union school is not necessary or particularly relevant to that major objective."
"The Commission cannot support Amendment Nos 28 and 29 simply because they repeat provisions which are already contained in other articles of the proposed directive."
"Amendments Nos 15, 16, 19, 20 and 30 cannot be accepted because they seek to change the wording of the STCW Convention provision or to refer both to articles of the directive and to the relevant STCW provisions which are transposed in the directive."
"In some respects that would mean duplication and generate uncertainty and I am sure that on reflection the House would not want that."
"Amendment No 11 regarding exemptions from certain training requirements in respect of near coastal voyages cannot be accepted since the wording proposed is not consistent with the relevant text of Regulation 1.3 of the STCW on the same topic."
"Finally, Amendments Nos 18, 22 and 33 cannot be accepted simply because their content is outside the scope of the revised STCW Convention on which the present proposal before the House is based."
"Although I have concentrated on explaining why the Commission cannot support certain amendments, I would emphasize that there are many that we would give our support to and I hope the House will appreciate that and accept it from me just as we welcome the constructive spirit in which the proposal has been considered by the committee and, indeed, by the House."
"I conclude by thanking all those who contributed to this very good report, particularly Mr Parodi, and I will respond to some of the questions that have been raised in this debate."
"I will not respond to all of them simply because of the constraints of time."
"I will write to Mr Cornelissen about the points he made on the ADAC investigation."
"As he would expect, the Commission took an active interest in those proceedings but I will give him details in a letter."
"On the questions raised by Mr Watts, Mr Sindal, Mr Stockmann and Mr Harrison, so far as further developments on maritime safety are concerned, although this is not an exhaustive list, they will include a draft directive on the licensing of passenger ferries that we will be producing in October and after that I will be coming forward with a proposal for amendment to the port state control directive in order to give legal effect to the International Maritime Organization International Safety Management Code."
"The purpose of making amendment is to try to ensure that vessels that do not have the ISM Certificate will not only be detained under the port state control directive until they are made seaworthy but can then be banned from all European Union ports until they have obtained the ISM Certificate."
"Members of the House will want to examine this proposal in detail but they will already recognize that in broad principle the further development of the effective implementation of port state control will be a welcome addition to efforts to raise continually the standards of maritime safety and the protection of cruise passengers and the environment."
"I am confident that Parliament by adopting both these reports will facilitate the early achievement of common positions on two important instruments which, both in terms of training and in terms of the management of passenger vessels, will further raise the standards of safety."
"I am grateful to the House for its patience towards what has inevitably been a long response to the reports."
"Mr President, I am grateful for Mr Watts' further inquiry."
"I would reassure him that the numbers collected on shore will effectively be immediately available."
"The transmission of names can take place very quickly but it is important not to have the kind of time limit he would build in, simply because of the possibility of an unnecessary inflexibility."
"It is very clear that it is technologically possible now to ensure rapid transmission and certainly in practice this will probably occur, thus overcoming the kind of problem which, for obvious and sensible reasons, Mr Watts thinks could arise in other circumstances."
"I hope, with that further explanation, that he will regard the position taken by the Commission as not in any sense being antagonistic to his but completely accepting the principle on which he argues and only having its reservations based on immediate practicalities."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and resumed at 11 a.m.)"
"VOTES"
"Mr President, these two amendments, Nos 20 and 21, tabled by Mrs Peijs and Mr Blokland, concern a technical revision aimed at equalizing the way of working out States' GDP, so that prejudicial discrepancies in their calculation can be avoided."
"I would ask Parliament to approve them."
"Neither the Commission nor the Council accepts them but I think it is worthwhile approving them so that we can send a signal in that direction."
"Amendment No 19"
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that I voted incorrectly."
"I wanted to vote against. Please correct my vote."
"This is not a nominal vote, Mr Cunha, so the result is not registered."
"Mr President, I would ask you to look again at the result of the vote just now."
"If I have counted correctly, that last vote means that there was a tie, and the amendment was therefore rejected."
"Mr von Wogau, I do not want to go into such an analysis."
"You know perfectly well what the rules are and they shall be applied."
"Mr President, I wish to second Mr von Wogau's request, since my own vote, which was against, has not been recorded."
"Mr Azzolini, you know that mistakes are not acknowledged after votes."
"Mr President, I should simply like to say that we always play by the same rules in this House, and you have restated those rules quite correctly."
"I am sorry that our Conservative colleagues are succumbing to the temptation to try to change the rules when the result does not suit them!"
"The Chair interprets the rules, Mr Wolf."
"Mr President, it is all very well for you to say that you are not going to take account of it, but when somebody genuinely makes a mistake with the electronic voting system and corrects it straightaway, surely that should be taken into account."
"No, Mr Provan."
"Mistakes can only be accepted if the Chair is informed before the result of the vote is announced."
"(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, allow me to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Christodoulou, who has succeeded in ensuring that Parliament has finally delivered a clear opinion on this exceptionally difficult issue."
"The line that we adopted in our negotiations with the Council, the current Council presidency and Mr Zalm, has been endorsed, and I am sure that the Council will be able to accede to at least two of Parliament's three key wishes for amendments."
"I believe this is a joint success on the part of Parliament."
"Mr President, I do not wish to make any further comments, but merely to draw attention to the following. There are two amendments to paragraph 17: Amendment No 9 by the PPE Group, and Amendment No 1 by the PSE Group."
"Both these amendments, as well as paragraph 17 itself, are now redundant, since the matter to which they refer has now been settled."
"There is now agreement that legal disputes will be referred to the European of Court of Justice."
"I should therefore like to withdraw Amendment No 9, on behalf of Mr Chanterie for the PPE Group, as well as our own Amendment No 1. I would then ask the House to vote against paragraph 17, which is completely redundant."
"That is the only way in which we can remove it from the text."
"(Parliament adopted the proposal)"
"Mr President, a mistake has occurred in paragraph 6, because a phrase was omitted in the text produced by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The chairman of the committee and the rapporteur also agree that there has been a misunderstanding."
"The phrase 'calls in particular for a minimum tax rate to be levied on all incomes in the EU' must be added to paragraph 6."
"This was a completely uncontroversial point that was decided almost unanimously in committee."
"(Parliament adopted the proposal)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Aparicio Sánchez has tabled an amendment that I cannot accept as it deletes the final part of the text."
"If he agrees to see it as an addition, while maintaining the final part of the text stating that the methodology must be appropriate for each assessment of each discipline, then I could accept it as such."
"Mr President, I appreciate Mr Lannoye's effort, but I cannot accept this as it would alter the meaning of my amendment."
"Before the final vote"
"Mr President, I should like to speak before the vote."
"In my analysis, the outcome of the vote on paragraph 2, following the vote on amendment No 6, totally destroys the report."
"I cannot therefore leave my name on the report."
"I would ask you to withdraw it and ask my colleagues to vote against it, because Parliament's position is limited to asking for what has already been achieved, i.e the studies."
"Mr President, I regret Mr Lannoye's decision to withdraw his name from the report."
"This report was before the Parliament before 1994."
"It ran out of time then."
"We have now spent four years dealing with it."
"I understand that he has lost amendments that he would like to retain but four years' work should not be thrown away lightly like this."
"It is customary when a rapporteur declines to have his name associated with the report, that the committee chairman should take it over."
"I therefore propose to take it over and it should be put to the vote immediately."
"(Parliament adopted the proposal)"
"Mr President, surely, since Amendment No 13 has been adopted, Amendment No 10 falls."
"Mr Azzolini, there was that view, but the chairman of the relevant committee and the rapporteur did not agree."
"I am therefore obliged to put both amendments to the vote."
"Amendment No 12"
"Mr President, I wish to say something about Paragraph 12."
"Can I do so now? There is an error in Paragraph 12 of the Finnish-language version of the report."
"The words 'in particular the implementation of the proper land use policy' which appear in the English version are missing from the Finnish version."
"Accordingly it says in the amendment to this paragraph that the Finnish version is unaffected."
"It is unaffected because the Finnish version is wrong, but the amendment to Paragraph 12 does indeed alter the substance, and I should like to draw attention to this."
"Thank you, Mrs Ojala, for your comment and we shall look into the problem you have raised."
"(Parliament adopted the proposal)"
"We have already stated that in our view the European Union should be based on co-operation between independent States."
"This is why we cannot vote for a resolution which supports Council decisions by qualified majority, the abolition of the veto in the CFSP, that the European Parliament shall have co-decision power on all budget items and common statutes for all members of the European Parliament etc."
"These are extremely important issues and it is inappropriate for Parliament to support such a resolution without further consideration. This is why we are voting against the resolution."
"This 28 May was chosen by the European Confederation of Trade Unions as a day of action for employment."
"With the Amsterdam Summit approaching, which in mid-June will conclude the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, I felt I had to remind you that employment is a major preoccupation of ordinary people, as is the problem of democracy."
"Europeans rightly consider that the European Union is a structure which evades any democratic controls."
"What is European-level democracy in reality?"
"The European Parliament has given its opinion on several occasions on the transparency of procedures, the responsibility of governments and the recognition of fundamental rights for all citizens."
"The complexity of European procedures discourages any well-intentioned citizen from trying to find out exactly what it means."
"According to the subject, the European Parliament, which is legitimately elected, is consulted for a simple opinion or in a codecision procedure by means of conciliation, following two or three possible 'readings' , in opinion procedures and budgetary procedures etc. In each case, the majority requirements in the Council differ: simple majority, qualified majority, super-qualified majority or unanimity."
"These majority requirements themselves vary according to whether or not the Commission approves of or rejects the European Parliament's opinions."
"In matters of foreign policy, EMU, police and judicial cooperation, the procedures differ again."
"Democracy is thwarted here because European citizens have the impression that the decision-making process is completely beyond their understanding."
"But the complexity of procedures is not the only obstacle to transparency."
"When it exercises its legislative powers, the Council is the only parliamentary institution to deliberate in secret in order to avoid explaining its decisions to the ordinary people, national parliaments or the European Parliament."
"In order to fill in this gap, the European Parliament must take a firm stance towards the Council and remind governments that it is useless fighting for minimum social standards if it fails to give Europe the means to produce substantial and coherent social policies."
"The thousands of people marching in the streets of Brussels this Wednesday want Europe to make employment the main priority."
"Will they be heard?"
"Democracy is not limited to an election every five years."
"It implies the daily control of the executive by popular representation."
"We are again far from achieving that."
"Legislative power is exercised by the Council of Ministers on the Commission's proposals."
"The European Parliament does not have a law-making initiative and only intervenes to deliver an opinion in most cases."
"As for the executive measures, they are a mixture of different types of committee, ' comitology' , to use a Community jargon expression, i.e. national civil servants who are not answerable to their national bureaucracy."
"These weak controls are too much: that became apparent during the 'mad cow' issue."
"I must confess that I find it increasingly difficult to explain to ordinary people that they must continue to fight for Europe, despite my commitment to it."
"Democracy is inextricably linked to human rights and Europe is proud to be the birthplace of those human rights."
"Once again reality and intentions are not the same."
"The European Union has not always adhered to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It does not even apply the modest provisions adopted on that subject: the right of vote for citizens in municipal elections in France or Belgium, the shutdown of the Renault factory in Vilvoorde, and the sacking of 3, 000 Belgian workers in flagrant violation of the European Directive on Information and Consultation of Workers in Multinationals."
"Unless we make real political and social progress when revising the Treaty, we run the risk of destroying Europe's future."
"I have met some of these people marching for employment and they spoke to me about their fears - and also their hopes."
"It would be suicidal to try to build Europe without its citizens and that would run the risk of helping the Mr Le Pens, Mr Goldsmiths, Mr Pasquas of this world - and Mr Heider in Austria."
"Although John Major has lost power, his ideas would win the day in Europe if the heads of State and government do not make one last leap to build Europe with the citizens instead of building it against democracy."
"The will expressed by both sides of industry during the employment march has set the tone."
"Now it is for the governments to take their responsibilities at the European Council in Amsterdam next month."
"When we see the results, then we will be able to decide whether Europe really has recovered democracy."
"The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament hope that the Intergovernmental Conference can be concluded at the forthcoming summit in Amsterdam."
"We are very pleased that a proper chapter on employment is being included in the Treaty, so that the Union has a commitment in proportion to the disastrously high level of unemployment in the 15 EU Member States."
"We also support all the calls to strengthen environment policy, consumer protection and the campaign against fraud."
"Because of Denmark's reservations, we cannot support third-pillar matters being brought within the scope of Community cooperation, and we also have to dissociate ourselves from the Schengen Agreement being incorporated into the Treaty."
"We are strongly in favour of vigorous cooperation to combat crime, and of a common policy on asylum; however, we believe these can be achieved through the type of decisions provided for under the third pillar."
"Because of Denmark's reservations, we are unable to support the introduction of majority decision-making as regards the common foreign and security policy, but we feel it is a good thing that there is agreement on the setting-up of a joint analysis and planning centre."
"We also feel it is a very good thing that forms of decision-making other than unanimity are being sought."
"All too often, joint action has been blocked by a single country."
"In our opinion, a method needs to be found whereby a single country cannot block joint action, while on the other hand it must be seen as important that nearly all the EU countries are involved."
"I have voted for Parliament's resolution although I do not completely approve of the majority position."
"The majority has approved a text far too general in scope on ending the difference between obligatory and non-obligatory tasks."
"I do not think that the various political bodies or their organisation are mature enough for this yet."
"It is important that the capacity of the Union to handle foreign policy functions jointly is strengthened."
"One individual country should not be able to stop action and in so doing exert pressure on the rest of the Union."
"But equally an individual country should not be forced to participate actively either."
"the Christodoulou report (A4-0181/97)"
"Many of the amendments proposed in the resolution are good especially No. 8 where it is proposed that the size of the investment should also be considered when determining if the budget deficit exceeds the permitted level or not."
"But we still cannot vote for the report as it includes acceptance of what we refer to as the stability pact, a pact which we consider to be damaging for the economy and which will mean that unemployment in the EU will remain permanently at a high level."
"The undersigned have voted against the resolution for the following principal reasons:"
"1.The proposal restricts the right of countries and peoples to set their economic policy in line with the economic situation of their own nation and is therefore undemocratic.2.The proposal is designed to paralyse the ability of Government bodies to combat in an appropriate manner recession, unemployment and under-utilisation of capacity in the economy.3.The proposal is founded on out of date economic theories which are not valid in modern economies."
"The two intergovernmental conferences which paved the way for the Maastricht Treaty each had a specific aim: one, EMU, and the other, political union."
"Those two objectives went hand in hand but what is the state of affairs now?"
"Political union is making very slow progress."
"The economic aspect of EMU has been put on the back-burner."
"It is the single currency which is dominating the political and economic debates."
"Is that the best means of guaranteeing social progress and strengthening the European idea?"
"I do not think so."
"Monetary union is vital but not enough."
"I am therefore throwing all of my support behind Christa Randzio-Plath's report and I share her criticism of the European Commission's 'guidelines' ."
"We must urgently give priority to consultation and stepping up European activity in the following fields:"
"The future monetary policy of the European Union must be able to be controlled by a political authority which represents public opinion and general interests."
"I am in favour of setting up a European economic government."
"In a market which will soon be completely unified, it is now vital that we approximate social legislation in the Member States in order to avoid situations of social dumping and we must work together to increase the level of welfare in European societies in order to protect its most vulnerable categories."
"In other words, we must have 'more social' ."
"Taxation must also become a priority area for work."
"We must coordinate our legislation in this field in order to put a stop to relocations within the European Union."
"Fiscal harmonization must be decided by a qualified majority for this purpose."
"More important still is that we must achieve close coordination of budgetary policies."
"It is only in the framework of a concerted approach to relaunching consumption and public investment that a pro-demand policy, so necessary at the moment, can be pursued."
"Finally, employment is our main preoccupation and it must be integrated into all European policies."
"Whether it be training, lowering working hours, protecting general interest services, for a long time I have been paying considerable attention to it and I think it should be given more credit in the definition of Community policy."
"The single currency is not an aim in itself."
"The real aim of the policy is social cohesion."
"That can only be achieved if we truly coordinate economic policies, for which Article 103 of the Treaty offers significant potential."
"Manifestly, the Member States and the Commission have not wanted or known how to use them."
"Do I need to repeat the fact that a recent study assessed the cost of the non-cooperative management of monetary policies over the last three years at an increase of 1.8 % in the budget deficit-GDP ratio?"
"In 1995, an average 3.4 % deficit instead of 5.2 % would have made it possible to avoid the restrictive budgetary policies of the last two years and would also have made it possible to continue the recovery, the green shoots of which were first seen in 1994, and would have led to a far quicker convergence of our economies."
"We share the overall criticism in the report of the minimalist position adopted by the Commission and their rigid adherence to convergence criteria."
"We also agree with the report's proposal for more active policies to create jobs, particularly through active investment in environmental measures."
"We are not against increased inter-state co-operation between EU Member States and between the EU and other relevant countries in order to reduce unemployment and promote integrated environmental stewardship through economic policies but we are opposed to any attempts to restrict the freedom of the Member States to act freely with regard to economic policy."
"This is why we have abstained from voting."
"the recommendation by Mr González Triviño (A4-0172/97)"
"During the vote at first reading, the European Parliament adopted 19 amendments to polish up the Commission's proposals."
"The common position on which we had to give our opinion takes up 15 of those amendments."
"It is, therefore, our right to welcome the excellent cooperation which has been achieved and to address our congratulations to our rapporteur."
"This text, awaited by the users of airlines and the companies themselves with bated breath, updates existing rights in this field."
"Until now, air carrier passengers insurance protection has depended on the 1929 Warsaw Convention and the Additional Protocols to it, dating back to 1961."
"It was, therefore, high time to update this matter by imposing a certain level of liability with financial intervention thresholds."
"The text which has been proposed to us meets that aim and therefore should be adopted."
"the Watts report (A4-0152/97)"
"At the end of November 1994, the European Parliament, sensitized and outraged by the sinking of the 'Estonia' with 900 victims, demanded that the European Commission set up a programme aimed at boosting safety on board ships."
"The text which we have to vote on now is a component of that programme."
"It calls for the compulsory registration of all passengers on board passenger ferries."
"This obligation will help to improve the effectiveness of searches and rescue operations."
"However, we deplore the fact that this obligation has been introduced so late in the day."
"It is my hope that the European Parliament will follow the guidelines of our rapporteur and support his amendments."
"The European Union must comply with international rules - I am thinking in particular of the Solas Convention on the protection of human life at sea - and cannot tolerate any failings, with disastrous consequences."
"I should like to conclude by lending my support to the Parodi report, which was the subject of joint debate this morning."
"In particular, the idea of setting up an institute for training seafarers, financed out of the European Union's budget."
"This idea has been put forward on several occasions by the European Parliament but has never seen the light of day."
"The Commission and the Council must urgently study this possibility in all seriousness."
"Passenger safety and professional knowledge are at stake."
"This is one of the major scandals facing the European Union: in a situation in which RoRo ferries are suffering ever greater and more dangerous accidents, and in which there have already been spectacular disasters in major under-sea tunnels, the Union is still 'gradually setting up a coherent framework for a European Union Safe Seas Policy' - see COM(93)0066 of 24 February 1993 and the Stewart report of 28 March 1994."
"Given the urgency of the matter, this is too little too late."
"Binding European legislation for maritime transport in EU waters, and especially for ferry transport and the use of under-sea tunnels, is long overdue."
"It should have been implemented by port state authorities long ago, at least as far as passenger safety is concerned."
"The EU can longer hide behind the IMO with regard to the fundamental issue of the safety of Ro-Ro vessels!"
"Nonetheless, this report represents a small step in the right direction."
"We shall therefore be supporting it, although with anger in our hearts at the thought of the many victims that any further delay will probably cost."
"the Parodi report (A4-0174)"
"I should firstly like to refer to the consequences of flagging-out and the secondary register for the training requirements for seafarers."
"While it is important that the EU is abandoning its damaging stance of waiting for the IMO - damaging for the general safety at sea of passengers, seafarers and the environment - it is not enough to introduce rules that are essentially restricted to vessels flying the flag of a Member State."
"All vessels using EU waters must be subject to appropriate minimum requirements."
"To this end, application of the STCW code can be no more than a very first step."
"It must be a question of laying down the European minimum requirements that alone will guarantee the adequate protection of passengers, seafarers and the environment."
"We owe nothing less to our citizens."
"We shall also be supporting this report, since it is moving - albeit slowly - in the right direction, so as to eliminate the present legal uncertainty and the actual lack of safety in all EU waters."
"We shall vote against Amendment No 1, since we believe it is unwise to give the Member States the opportunity to object by creating a new directive, rather than enabling rapid progress to be made by amending one that exists already."

"(SV) We have voted against the report concerning the development of a convention for European information systems."
"There are many reasons for this and here we give some examples of why we cannot accept this report."
"The EIS Convention does not pay enough attention to safeguarding rights and personal privacy.-Parliament wishes to increase supranationality in this area which is something we oppose.-We oppose and strongly condemn the restrictive and brutal asylum policy which is reinforced through the Schengen Agreement and the EIS.-We think that effective police co-operation can and should be developed within the framework of Interpol."
"The Danish social democrats voted against the Terrón i Cusí report on the draft Council act drawing up the Convention on the establishment of the European Information System."
"In our view, the report is extremely problematic, since it proposes to turn the Council act into a Council regulation, and thus to bring the EIS under Community legislation based on Article 235 of the Treaty."
"This would mean the Commission taking over the Member States' control powers in relation to the EIS."
"The Danish social democrats believe that the EIS should remain a matter for intergovernmental cooperation under the third pillar, with the final authority resting with the individual Member States."
"Information systems which allow the Member States to exchange data can be very useful instruments, especially as regards the investigation and prevention of serious breaches of the law."
"Examples of these are the Schengen Information System, Europol and the Customs Information System."
"However, when systems of this kind are introduced, regard for privacy is of crucial importance."
"It is therefore right for the committee to take the view that the systems should be secured effectively against unauthorized access."
"It is also to be welcomed that individual citizens should have an opportunity to bring actions before the courts to test the legality of the data held on them in these information systems."
"the Schulz report (A4-0060/97)"
"'Knowledge is power' , the saying goes, and with some justification."
"It also applies to the third pillar of the European Union."
"Cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs is unthinkable without some minimum level of data collection and transmission."
"Information and information systems form an essential part of measures on immigration and asylum, fraud and corruption, crime, drugs, terrorism and civil or penal judicial cooperation."
"That is why the Member States of the European Union have set up a whole range of information systems, such as Europol and the EIS at intergovernmental level and SIS for Schengen on a multilateral basis."
"The number of different systems involved means that there is a risk of duplication, but they all tend to serve different purposes, and overlapping between systems need not be a problem if there is also coordination and control."
"We do not need competing or rival systems, but at the same time we do not need completely uniform and all-embracing ones either."
"We need to give careful attention to democratic controls, judicial controls, respect for privacy, operationality and compatibility."
"The PPE Group would therefore urge the Council and the Member States to make the European Parliament the political watchdog, to give the Court of Justice the power to deliver preliminary rulings, to ensure respect for the Council of Europe's rules on privacy, and to encourage cooperation between the various departments involved and between the bodies that are responsible."
"These are not secondary issues: they are fundamental conditions for setting up and using the information systems in question."
"Systems which do not comply with these requirements are not an aid, but a threat."
"This report deals with the Customs Information System, or CIS."
"Just as the SIS is half under the third pillar and half outside the European Union, so the CIS falls half under the third pillar and half under the first, given that the Treaty provides that customs matters are related to freedom of movement and are thus to be handled at Community level."
"However, this is no reason to leave the European Parliament and the Court of Justice out, as happened with the signing of the Convention, which occurred before Parliament had the chance to deliver its opinion on the approved text."
"The Convention was signed on 26 July 1995, and a Protocol was subsequently signed on 29 November 1996."
"In addition to procedural matters, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs concentrates mainly on the issue of legal protection for citizens, with its demands for democratic controls and judicial powers for the Court."
"Both the Convention and the Protocol go some way towards satisfying these demands, but in the end it is up to the Member States to decide whether or not to ratify the Convention and apply the Protocol."
"It remains to be seen who ratifies and applies what, and when."
"The PPE Group continues to be firmly in favour of ratification as soon as possible, so that the Agreement can come into force as quickly as possible."
"We do not need reminding just how difficult decision-making and policy-making are under the third pillar, and how they even have to struggle to keep up with events."
"It appears that even where non-controversial issues are concerned, conventions, protocols, agreements and declarations are used because they are unavoidable in an intergovernmental context, with endless negotiations between the governments beforehand and time-consuming ratification procedures in the Member States afterwards."
"Think of Schengen, Europol, the campaign against fraud, and now the Customs Information System."
"It has become pointless and irritating to refer to the Intergovernmental Conference, but it is still the case that, as this dossier shows, the gradual and partial communitization of the third pillar is now inevitable."
"In today's world, and particularly in the developed countries where there is a great deal of specialization and complexity, informatics and computerization are a 'must' for both authorities and officials."
"Individuals too, including criminals, have access to data carriers and networks, and it is partly because of the accessibility of databases, directories, files and other sources of public or private information that we increasingly need data banks and so on if we are to exercise power in the information society."
"Europe needs to keep abreast of these transfrontier developments if it is to be able to continue to guarantee the security of its citizens, but at the same time it must also deal very carefully with their legal security, equality and protection."
"The Council Act setting up the Customs Information System contravenes Community law."
"The Council failed to consult the European Parliament properly, in accordance with Article K.6(2) of the EU Treaty."
"This Act was therefore already seriously flawed by the way in which it came into being."
"In addition, the scope of the Act is made unclear by the fact that the Convention on the Customs Information System is accompanied by an agreement on provisional implementation between certain Member States."
"Is it possible to imagine a clearer symbol of the constantly increasing legal uncertainty prevailing under the third pillar?"
"The Green Group unreservedly endorses the criticisms made by the rapporteur as regards the shortcomings in the legal protection of data and the lack of provision for parliamentary or judicial control, as well as his call to the Commission to examine whether the Act should not be replaced by a directive capable of fulfilling the tasks to which the establishment of a customs information system will give rise."
"the Secchi report (A4-0169/97)"
"We think that the Member States themselves, for democratic reasons, should have the right to set their own taxes and that the principles of unanimous voting should continue to be used for the consideration of issues by the Council."
"We believe that it is the Member States themselves who can best determine taxation policies and we believe that these can be co-ordinated between the Member States by the EU Finance Ministers without relinquishing the principle of unanimity."
"It is for precisely the same democratic reasons that we cannot support a recommendation (point 9 in the report) which states that 'total taxation must not be allowed to increase further' ."
"Although we agree with parts of the report, for example, on a code of conduct for tax matters or in other words, an agreement between the Member States on voluntary self regulation, we cannot support the basic concept of the report that the principle of unanimity on tax issues shall be abandoned in the Council."
"This is why we cannot vote for this report."
"We think that Member States should have the right, in principle, to set taxes and that the Council should continue to treat tax matters in accordance with the principles of unanimous decision making."
"But we think that minimum standards should be developed for capital tax, company tax and environmental tax and that decisions in the Council concerning these issues should be adopted by means of a qualified majority vote."
"We cannot support point 9 in the report since the recommendation that total taxation may not be increased is too far reaching."
"We agree with the rapporteur's views on a code of conduct for tax matters, in other words agreements between the Member States on voluntary self regulation."
"But this position does mean that we cannot support the basic concept of the report that the principle of unanimity in all taxation matters be abandoned."
"The undersigned have voted against the report for the following reasons:"
"1.Economic and budgetary conditions in each country are very different."
"Any attempt at standardising taxation policy could lead to chaos.2.The right to set taxes in all democracies is the prerogative of the people and their elected Parliament."
"To restrict this right is to attack democracy.3.Transferring decision making on taxation issues to Union institutions deprives the people of their control over transparency."
"The Union's governing level lacks basic principles such as Parliamentary procedure, openness and constitutional obligation."
"Permitting decisions on taxation to be adopted by majority vote infringes democratic self determination."
"The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Secchi report as a whole, but against paragraph 4 and Amendment No 7, because we are opposed to majority voting on tax issues in the Council."
"A move towards the harmonisation of taxes in the Member States and towards a common fiscal and finance policy would have serious implications for EU co-operation."
"It would lead to a federal EU in which the Member States' most important governing instruments for national economic policy are transferred to EU level."
"Taxation policy, the areas of taxation and the level of taxation in the Member States are also very varied because of different attitudes to welfare policy and the size of the public sector."
"Tax policy should continue to be a national matter in the future."
"For this reason I have voted against the report."
"the Harrison report (A4-0160/97)"
"Mr President, the motion for a resolution rightly emphasizes certain legitimate concerns, which nobody could possibly oppose."
"Probably, the effectiveness of the single market means that measures must be contemplated in order to make the way in which committees operate more transparent in order to guarantee independence vis-à-vis lobbies, when working out legislative procedures, for improving the protection of health and environment."
"The aim to help small businesses that take part in the single market and profit from it, and the desire to protect children against the negative effects of the single market, go without saying."
"Nevertheless, a proper reading of the subsidiarity principle would call on us to look at a number of the problems raised by this report, in a more flexible way, in a more appropriate way, which would be more effective than a systematic and sometimes abusive communitarization of the issue."
"It is, in particular, true of questions concerning legal systems and taxation matters, dealt with in another report before us today."
"Furthermore, the proposals to adopt a Community regulation on media ownership confirm the desire of the Community institutions to take on powers for controlling the media."
"We have already denounced this type of manoeuvring when, in the context of enlargement to the countries of central and eastern Europe, the European Parliament proposed that press organs should not be subsidized, as a counterpart to their integrationist orthodoxy."
"It is strange, on the other hand, that the European Parliament and the Commission should be so eager - quite rightly - to emphasize the dangers of red tape which could arise from excessive regulation but, at the same time, are exclusively attacking national administrations without asking any questions about shortcomings in the Community institutions themselves."
"Finally, while we go along with the preoccupation with fighting for jobs, we do not want the implementation of a common employment policy."
"That would lack the necessary flexibility and pragmatism."
"The negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference will not offer a solution to the burning challenge of unemployment."
"The contribution to this difficult battle at European level means, in fact, a desire to reintroduce the principle of Community preferences inscribed in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, but systematically sacrificed on the altar of free trade in the case of trade negotiations..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"The rapporteur expresses enthusiasm for the internal market, for continued integration and for very extensive legislative harmonisation in many of his points."
"But we very much doubt, for example, that the internal market has increased the Union's GNP by 130 billion dollars as stated in point 3 of the report."
"All such figures are, and must remain, guesses and we could equally well say that the internal market has reduced the GNP by the same amount or that the internal market will increase the level of unemployment by 5 million people."
"More serious than this enthusiasm however, is the fact that the rapporteur in several places recommends the replacement of national legislation with Union legislation."
"Point 14, for example, recommends that environmental policy be based on 'EU standards and guidelines' , while it is Sweden's view that a country should always have the right to impose stricter environmental legislation."
"In point 16, the rapporteur states that the internal market will provide the base for a 'tax system at EU level' ."
"In Point 25 he makes a plea for a 'monitoring system at Community level' and so on."
"Consequently we have many objections to various sections of the report although we acknowledge that it does have many merits."
"The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Harrison report as a whole, but against paragraph 11, because we believe that social security arrangements should remain a national area of responsibility, and also against Amendment No 3, since we do not believe that a taxation system at EU level should cover all sources of income."
"Growth, job creation and welfare in Europe are dependent on the internal market functioning without any obstacles."
"The information from the Commission that only half the measures in the 1985 White Paper on the internal market have been fully implemented in the Member States is therefore very disturbing."
"The Member States' tendency to introduce new technical rules is unfortunately only further jeopardizing the operation of the internal market."
"It is to be welcomed that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has put forward so many constructive proposals in its report as to how to remedy these shortcomings."
"Particular attention should be drawn to the committee's proposal for simpler rules on legal redress for citizens when they experience faults or ineffectiveness in the functioning of the internal market."
"the Lannoye report (A4-0075/97)"
"British Conservatives recognize the great interest felt by thousands of electors in our constituencies over the issues raised in the Lannoye report."
"Whether as consumers of complementary medicines, as users of alternative therapies or as practitioners of so-called non-conventional medicine they want to see this report succeed."
"At European level the most important issue is the freedom of establishment and freedom of choice."
"We would like to see the adoption of the UK approach to complementary medicines made possible in other Member States, particularly those where severe constraints are placed upon the practice of nonconventional medicine at present."
"It is vital that consumers interests are protected by establishing standards and qualifications which can be mutually recognized throughout Europe."
"How this can be achieved without a torrent of legislation at both European and Member State level remains to be seen."
"These aims are sufficiently ambitious without the desire expressed in the report to make charges recoverable through the social security system, i.e. to have the taxpayer foot the bill, at a time of great pressure on public funds."
"We Conservatives support the broad aims of this report but feel greater emphasis should be placed on further studies into the means of achieving them and the need for research into the efficacy of the various therapies before calling for European level legislation."
"We are against calls for immediate legislation on the ground that this would pre-empt the outcome of any studies and could impose an unacceptable and restrictive burden on the practitioners of non-conventional medicines."
"The reform of the system of non-conventional medicine, despite the intolerant corporatism of some of our colleagues who are doctors, has aroused a fair amount of interest among many of our fellow citizens in the European Union and - among many other reasons - who has not resorted or sometime will resort to these different medicines?"
"Recent public opinion surveys show that between 20 and 50 % of European citizens use these so-called 'nonconventional' medicines."
"As the rapporteur pointed out, the resolution we are debating today is intended to seek necessary answers to these factual situations, both for the professionals and medicines involved in these disciplines and for patients."
"These situations call for an appropriate Community response if we are to avoid any deviances or abuses."
"I think it is important to emphasize that we are not talking about or defending quack doctors but nor are we talking about the privileges of obsolete corporatism - quite the contrary."
"What this report, brimming with initiative, sets out to do is to establish a Community status with the highest degree of health and legal safety for the exercise of these alternative medical disciplines to which all of us - or nearly all of us - resort, as I said a moment ago."
"It is, therefore, urgent to regulate the training and qualifications of these professions in order to guarantee patients maximum safety and quality whenever they resort to their use."
"For this very reason, and not because of issues which have nothing to do with this debate, as far as Lannoye report is concerned, I should like sincerely to congratulate him on his work. It was not simple, especially given the narrow-mindedness of certain opponents."
"To conclude, I can declare that I shall be supporting this report."
"The subject of the status of non-conventional medicine has been a subject of lengthy and sometimes intense discussions and controversies in political circles."
"At the same time, and perhaps this is the most important aspect, a large section of the population in most Member States of the European Union make use of the services and methods offered by certain branches of so-called non-conventional medicine, something which calls for a new way of dealing with the problem which does not have 'experimental' but genuine, social dimensions."
"The subject, concerning a large number of ordinary people and concerning a sector as important and sensitive as health, cannot be dealt with by means of excommunications or witch-hunts."
"From this point of view, we think it is extremely important to open the way to responsible dialogue and to undertake serious and thorough research and studies into the content, possibilities, peculiarities and scope of non-conventional medicine."
"It is vital that we obtain documentation on the knowledge of each branch of non-conventional medicine, the methods used and its capabilities of diagnosis and therapy, in such a way that ordinary citizens, in particular patients, can have at their disposal the largest possible amount of reliable and thorough information on the competence, quality, efficiency and possible dangers of so-called non-conventional medicine rather than abandoning the chronically sick to ignorance and misinformation."
"All of this, however, requires open and productive dialogue, according to scientific criteria and guarantees for the levels of safety and for ordinary people's health."
"From this point of view, we think that the Lannoye report gives a positive boost towards finding ways of seriously tackling such an important problem, concerning the health of millions of ordinary people, and lends support to a considerable number of people who are specialized in, working on or providing this type of medical service and who, nevertheless, are entitled to know what the status of their profession is."
"And I think it is heading in the right direction as a whole, as far as some of the points of the report are concerned, although I do have some reservations or disagreements over certain points. We shall therefore be voting for this report, because overall we think that it is a step towards dealing with this subject properly and responsibly."
"The spectrum of alternative and supplementary medicine requires common legislation in EU territory."
"The recommendation by Paul Lannoye and the Committee on the Environment contained a clear message to the Commission, namely that it should improve and harmonize the position of alternative treatments in the Union by means of a proposal for a Directive."
"A common framework for practitioners is needed, as are recognition of alternative treatments and a list of medicines which also includes alternative medicines."
"The Commission ought no longer to have wasted its time carrying out comparative research."
"Enough is already available in the various Member States."
"What is needed now is action."
"Unfortunately, Parliament sabotaged the Environment Committee's demands by contenting itself with requesting further research."
"The wide range of practices in the various Member States is not in the interests of patients."
"Training requirements for alternative medical practitioners have not yet been harmonized."
"There is no clear list of pharmaceuticals."
"It would also be rational for the Member States to investigate the refund of costs of treatments and medicines under the health insurance system if and when there are guarantees that treatments are effective."
"Good results have been achieved with these treatments, and it is no wonder that people favour them."
"I voted for this resolution, as amended."
"The area of non-conventional medicine, and the possible regulation, via EU legislation, of freedom of establishment for practitioners of such medicine is a subject where Europe needs to proceed with great care."
"This is not only because national systems of regulation differ very widely, but also because, on past form, it is quite possible that the compromises necessary in a Europewide approach would create problems for the very groups and individuals calling for such a European approach."
"For this reason, I strongly support those parts of the Lannoye report which call for the Commission to carry out a study of the issue, as expressed in the first part of paragraph 2, and a study on results of research already done under budget item B 7142 into the effectiveness of homeopathy and other non-conventional medicines."
"I am glad that the Parliament has rejected that part of paragraph 2 which originally called for immediate legislation, without awaiting the result of any study."
"Since the EU does have a real problem regarding the freedom of establishment of the practitioners of nonconventional medicine, I hope that we can now use this resolution as a means of urging the Commission to carry out the study needed, and, possibly to bring forward legislation."
"The Danish social democrats seriously doubt the relevance of the European Parliament expressing any views at all on the status of non-conventional medicine, partly because we have not been asked for an opinion, and partly because the subtext here may be that many practitioners could benefit from public health insurance schemes with the help of recognition from the EU, and we do not think that the EU has or should have any powers at all to become involved."
"However, we do not wish to give the impression that we are blind to the need for the different treatment systems not to shut themselves off, but in fact to become more sympathetic to one another."
"In some countries, conventional and non-conventional medicine are simply being integrated."
"In others, they are at each other's throats."
"We believe in striking the golden mean in this case."
"Everyone knows that many people feel that the help available to them from conventional medicine or conventional practitioners is not enough."
"But on the other hand, we do not wish to contribute to the general hypochondria which the views of many alternative practitioners actually help to create - there seems to be a pill or a therapy for everything."
"It is important that alternative medicine (non conventional medicine), for example anthroposophy, homeopathy and chiropractic is allocated the same amount of working and development time as conventional medicine."
"First a study is needed which lists the regulations covering the setting up of a practice in Member States. This study would indicate whether EU harmonisation is really required."
"If this is the case it could, for example, concentrate on establishing minimum standards to safeguard patients' health and safety."
"For these reasons and with these reservations I have voted for the report."
"I voted against the Lannoye report on the status of non-conventional medicines because, among other reasons, I thought that most of the claims set out in the recitals to the motion for a resolution were imbued with a strong feeling of opportunism, a lack of impartiality and, fundamentally, conceal behind imprecisions and half-truths economic interests that are not compatible with the interests of ordinary people in terms of their health and quality of life."
"We think that, in the recognition of methods for diagnosing and treating patients and their illnesses, we must invariably demand the vital scientific validation that has been established and that all the techniques used in medicine must be proven by scientific methods and experimental tests."
"Other reasons are mainly those of a cultural nature, links to the tradition and sensitivity of ordinary people, enabling the coexistence in the Member States of the European Union of concepts of considerable diversity, as far as health care is concerned."
"We think it undesirable that the European Union should produce legislation on this controversial matter, especially in respect of any intention to include so-called non-conventional medicine in the social security system, which would lead to incalculable costs."
"In this area, and for the reasons already explained, we think that the principle of subsidiarity should prevail ad infinitum in this case."
"I supported the Lannoye report and voted for it in the Committee on the Environment, together with the amendments which I tabled, despite the odd disagreement over certain paragraphs in the text."
"The reasons why I supported the adoption of a positive attitude towards the recognition, legitimacy and the regulation of the so-called non-conventional medicine health care sector are various."
"Maintaining the situation in which these forms of therapy were tolerated but not recognized is extremely serious for the professionals applying these methods, and prevents the setting up of a system of certification and mutual recognition of competencies, which would eliminate the wheat from the chaff, and would lead to a recognized code of conduct."
"At the same time, patients are presently unable to assess the professional competence and experience of these practitioners."
"With regard to the absence of co-funding of these treatments by the social security systems, the situation found in most cases, this should be changed, because it is inadmissible that there should still be discrimination in access to these treatments on the basis of the economic situation of patients, although we do need to control and contain excessive costs."
"I am glad that Mr Lannoye's report has finally been put to the vote."
"It is important to pave the way for common legislation on health professions which are not already covered by directives on training and professional activity."
"In the Committee on the Environment, the debate has very much centred on the participants' fundamental attitudes to alternative medicine - especially in the case of those members opposed to any form of alternative medical treatment."
"And that is a pity, because the report is about creating sensible conditions for the non-conventional health professions."
"It should be obvious that a clear and transparent framework of legislation will serve both the various groups of practitioners and - not least - the interests of patients, since the alternative treatment sector can be like a jungle in which it is very hard to find one's bearings."
"It is a fact that alternative forms of medicine are used by about a third of the population of the Member States."
"It is therefore desirable for the EU to establish common legislation in the sector, so as to assure this large group of people of correct and uniform treatment by properly trained practitioners."
"However, I would make the point that the EU should in no way intervene in the individual Member States' health insurance schemes for reimbursing the cost of treatment and medicines, as is proposed in Amendment No 15."
"On the other hand, I personally can sympathize with the idea that health insurance schemes should refund the cost of alternative treatment, so that patients are given a free choice of therapy."
"Even so, what is refunded in a health insurance scheme financed from taxation has to be a purely national matter."
"Finally, I would entirely support the idea that the European Pharmacopoeia drawn up by the Council of Europe should be extended to cover non-conventional forms of medical treatment."
"I am in favour of this report because I support the right to have a high quality medical service, with guarantees, that is fully recognized and legislated, which does not necessarily have to be conventional, ' academic' medicine."
"At present, the personal dimension between patient and doctor has been lost."
"Efficient but rapid treatment of symptoms has replaced patient care."
"The history of medicine is a series of episodes of memorable intransigence followed by the later acceptance of techniques which, at the time, were seen as diabolical or miraculous."
"Now, at the dawn of the 21st century, let us not repeat these past equivocations and open the door to dialogue between official and non-conventional medicines."
"I do not believe in miracles, but I still have hope that corporate, medical or pharmaceutical interests will not stand in the way of the regularization and legislative recognition of practices which have been shown to be effective and which have been accepted, for some time now, in certain Member States and in other countries too."
"In many countries, such as Spain, there is an absolute legal vacuum in respect of these, which only encourages charlatanism, putting the health of consumers at risk."
"Patients' freedom to choose the way in which they wish to be treated and the safety of guarantees for the choice they have made is a right which must be respected, facilitated and sanctioned by the Member States and the European Union."
"The controversy which the Lannoye report has generated is based on a false premise: that legalizing the exercise of non-conventional medical practices is tantamount to allowing the professional exercise of people without medical competence."
"The aim of the report is exactly the opposite."
"In urging the Commission to conduct thorough studies into the harmlessness and effectiveness of treatments, on one hand, and to approximate rules on delivering diplomas and the exercise of the profession, on the other, is precisely aimed at preventing charlatans from taking advantage of the lack of information given to ordinary people and existing legal vacuums."
"Refusing to accept the powers of practices such as homeopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, acupuncture or shiatsu is both surprising and useless."
"It is surprising because it goes against all recent trends towards an overall understanding of the individual, and useless because the number of practitioners will only go on growing - but without any form of protection."
"It is the European Union's responsibility to create conditions of equality between citizens and, in this case, the practitioner's right to exercise and establish and the right of choice for users and consumers."
"This freedom, on both sides, must, however, be based on safety which only a thorough system of professional certification, harmonized throughout Europe, could guarantee."
"This is a cornerstone, something which is not sufficiently highlighted in the relevant paragraphs of Mr Lannoye's motion for a resolution."
"It is quite ridiculous to denigrate these practices just as psychoanalysis was when it made its appearance."
"On what side of the argument does the obscurantism lie?"
"the Crowley report (A4-0088/97)"
"We cannot support Mr Crowley's report on the social aspects of housing, primarily on the grounds that housing policy is and continues to be a national responsibility."
"We feel it is absurd to contemplate an EU housing policy, since the various considerations which lie behind a national housing policy cannot simply be transferred to the European Union, given that the diversity among the Member States is much greater than that which is found at national level."
"On this basis, we therefore also think that the establishment of a European Housing Forum and the launching of an IGLOO pilot programme, aimed at funding integrated housing-related projects, are completely superfluous."
"Nor are we able to support the inclusion of a provision in the new Treaty on the right to decent and affordable housing for all."
"We can fully endorse the comments that some of the appropriations for the SAVE programme should be used to aid energy-efficient housing, and that all developments must be sustainable and take account of the protection of the environment, conservation of energy and best building practices; these are also in line with the views of the great majority of the Danish population."
"in writing. (SV) We totally agree with the basic claim in Mr Crowley's report that everyone has the right to decent housing and that the 18 million or so people in the EU who are homeless or living in poor accommodation have the right to decent homes which are reasonably priced."
"As proposed in the report we want to combat the trend which has allowed property speculation and a lack of financial resources offering reasonable terms for loans to turn the housing sector into a 'high cost sector' to which only the well off have access."
"All Member States have ratified the UN Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which acknowledges the right to adequate housing for all and more attention should be paid to this."
"We are also in favour of Member States, on their own initiative, or through the Union introducing pilot projects for housing, employment, health care, and social services etc. in accordance with the proposal in the report."
"We also think that the building of housing must be based on recycling, sustainable use of natural resources, environmental and health considerations and energy efficiency."
"On the other hand we think that the demand for a European housing policy which Mr Crowley makes in his report is too far reaching and is unacceptable."
"Housing policy is and must remain a matter for Member States."
"But there can of course be co-operation and exchange of expertise at an international level within different sectors to solve the problems involved in guaranteeing good housing at reasonable cost for all."
"Pressure should be brought to bear on countries to make them fulfil the UN Convention which they have signed."
"Despite the fact that the report contains many good proposals we cannot vote for it for the above mentioned reasons."
"I support all the main proposals in the report which concern an improved housing policy."
"But there is no need for a common housing policy at EU level offering EU housing loans or for integrated housing legislation."
"The very serious problems raised in the report must be resolved at national level and through inter-state co-operation where this is considered necessary."
"For these reasons, I have voted against the report."
"That concludes the votes."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 29 May 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the part-session of Thursday 29 May 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, the Minutes of 29 May show a considerably larger attendance than we get on the last day of a Strasbourg session."
"I suggest that this is because the French authorities are unable to offer a decent service by air or any other means to get home after a meeting."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman, I understand how every Monday in Strasbourg, we have the same question. I can only give the usual answer: that I refer this matter to the French authorities."
"You know that the French authorities have responded with a proposal to the European Council on fixing the institutions' seats and timetables."
"Mr President, I have a genuine point on the Minutes."
"You will recall that I raised the matter of the Norwegian salmon dumping case on Wednesday."
"I returned to the matter on Thursday."
"We have still not had an answer to our question which was why we as a parliament have been unable to gain access to the Commission to hear what was going on, whereas the Norwegian Government seems to have been able to talk to every single Commissioner."
"I want to know when we can question the Commission on this issue."
"The deal has now been done to Norway's benefit and we are entitled to know when we can hear about it."
"Thank you, Mr Macartney."
"I shall forward your remark to the Commission."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Mr President, I want to ask about the management of this building."
"Since we last met in Strasbourg, someone has torn down and removed a poster I had on my door commemorating French and German resistance to Hitler."
"I see the difficult of policing an institution which contains the likes of Mr Bernard Antony, who was convicted on 15 May in Montpellier for racism, fined FF 50, 000 and received a six-mont suspended jail sentence, and Roberta Angelilli who endorsed the re-enactment of the book-burning of Hitler's Nazis in Rome, but can the President assure me that in future the security services will try to ensure we are protected from this kind of vandalism?"
"Mr Ford, your complaint will be noted and referred to the security services, who must protect members' posters from acts of vandalism."
"Mr President, I should like to appeal to you personally, as a gifted lawyer and long-time leading member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, to intervene in the situation in the Netherlands which has resulted in various technical provisions of European law becoming null and void."
"The country is facing a legal disaster as a result of an absolutely incredible blunder on the part of the government in failing to notify Brussels of some 340 provisions, which are therefore now cancelled."
"For example, the breathalyser test can no longer be used in the Netherlands because the relevant provision is now void."
"It was the previous government rather than the present one that was responsible for this."
"What I would ask you to do - and I shall be discussing this with Mr Wijsenbeek this evening, since we two are the only Dutch lawyers here, and in the Legal Affairs Committee - is to urge the Council of Ministers of Justice..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Janssen van Raay, this is not the time to raise that question."
"It is a matter for the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"Mr President, I should like to urge the Commission, in particular the Transport section, to bring forward a report on the transport of nuclear material."
"At the present time aircraft carrying plutonium are flying over Member States including the UK."
"It is a matter of extreme urgency that this matter is resolved as quickly as possible."
"I would therefore respectfully ask you to prevail upon the Commission to bring forward an up-to-date report on the transport of nuclear waste."
"Mr Morris, if you have put this matter to the Commission, I shall ensure that they answer you."
"Mr President, the British Sunday Times on 1 June this year carried an article in which it indicated that the new British Government was maintaining a computer database on the activities, questions and speeches of Members of this Parliament."
"Mr Hugh Kerr specifically was mentioned."
"I am not aware whether other Members are being monitored and surveyed in this way by the British Government."
"I wish to know whether this action constitutes a breach of the privileges of this House."
"Mr Perry, I would rather interpret this information, if it is true, as a sign of the interest shown by a Member State Government in the European Parliament's activities."
"We are forever asking Member States to take an interest in the European Parliament's work, and so it is a good sign that a new government should be concerned with these matters."
"That is how I would prefer to interpret this."
"Mr President, I raised orally the question of interpreting at interparliamentary delegations' meetings, with reference in particular to the delegation for relations with Kazakhstan and the other central Asian republics."
"I am the vice-chairman of that delegation. The trip was arranged for early May."
"The meeting went ahead as scheduled, but even though I wanted to take part and thought that I could make a useful contribution I was unable to do so because I had been informed that there would be no Greek interpretation."
"In addition to my oral query I wrote to you about the matter, and after an awfully long wait I have received a letter form you in reply in which you say that you do not know who decided that interpreting should not be available for all of the languages of the participants in interparliamentary delegations and that in the case in question interpreting from Russian and English suffices."
"I do not know on what criteria that decision to exclude all of the other languages was taken."
"I am concerned about Greek, because as a member I must be able to participate."
"Why do I raise the matter?"
"Firstly because I had to wait so long for your reply. But that could be excused, perhaps, bearing in mind your workload."
"The real issue, though, is that we cannot do our job."
"Somewhere - in the Rules - there ought to be a stipulation that Members who wish to participate in the various bodies and committees must, inter alia, be familiar with English and Russian or have knowledge of German, because that is the reality of the situation."
"Effectively you are sidelining us."
"Mr Ephremidis, I think that this matter has been considered by the Conference of delegation Chairmen and you will be informed as to why only two languages were on offer in this case and the possible solutions to the problem."
"Mrs McNally, of course the time limit can be extended but, as for the signing of written declarations, may I remind you that the relevant procedure is laid down in the Rules and any change would require a change to those Rules."
"In Brussels, the place where written declarations are signed is just beneath the hemicycle and here in Strasbourg, if I am not mistaken, it is just next door."
"Order of business"
"The final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents (at its meeting of Thursday 5 June 1997) pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"No amendments have been proposed."
"I give the floor to Mrs Green."
"Mr President, following the meeting of my group this evening there are a couple of changes which we would like to put to you."
"Firstly, as you know, we in the Conference of Presidents supported the movement of the McIntosh report on aviation safety from Tuesday to Thursday."
"We did that on the understanding that the Commissioner would be available on Thursday to deal with this issue."
"We understand now that this is not the case."
"Whilst we understand the reasons why the report was moved and are in favour of being as helpful as we can, we would ask the rapporteur if she would consider moving the report to July so that it can be dealt with when the Commissioner is available."
"It is a very serious issue and we want to make sure that it is properly debated and dealt with."
"Thursday does not seem like a good idea."
"The second proposal is that we currently have a deadline of 4 p.m. tomorrow for compromise motions and amendments on the IGC and the Amsterdam Summit."
"The outcome of the vote which takes place tonight in the Committee on Institutional Affairs, where, as you know, there are 134 amendments to the text on the IGC, will not be available for consideration by the groups before the deadline for amendments expires."
"I am therefore asking for an extension of that deadline for compromise texts and amendments until, perhaps, 10 a.m. on Wednesday."
"That would allow all groups tomorrow evening to assess whether they want to make further amendments to the texts which will only emerge from the Institutional Affairs Committee tonight."
"Mr President, I am rather surprised that we are still talking about the McIntosh report, which has now been moved to Thursday, since I assumed that if no written comments were received, the agenda would remain as it stands."
"However, if as it now seems, the Commissioner is unable to attend, then I think we can agree to postpone the report to the July part-session, since the second June meeting is already full."
"What we do have a problem with are the two resolutions on the IGC and the other items on the agenda for the Amsterdam summit."
"I gather from Mrs Green's proposal that if the amendments are to be tabled by Wednesday morning, the vote would be held on Thursday."
"I do not think this is a good idea for such an important issue - we have already discussed it in our group - and I think it would be much better to set the deadline for tabling amendments at 7 p.m. or even 7.30 p.m. for once, rather than 4 p.m., so that everyone has the chance of further discussion in their groups."
"We would go along with the Socialist Group to that extent, but I do not think it is a good idea not to vote on Wednesday."
"I would therefore ask how late it is technically possible to set the deadline so that we can still be sure of voting on Wednesday?"
"Mr President, I have a point about the sitting on Tuesday."
"About ten minutes before the start of this sitting, I received a copy of a letter addressed to you, presumably because I am the rapporteur for the agriculture budget."
"The President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers informs us that he cannot attend the prices debate tomorrow afternoon, but proposes to come tomorrow evening instead."
"I would suggest that we should vote on this point at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning, so that we can have time for discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and perhaps also with Commissioner Fischler."
"I would therefore ask that we should decide at 9 a.m. tomorrow whether to postpone the debate on farm prices until 9 p.m. tomorrow evening."
"Mr President, we also think it would be most unfortunate if we do not vote on Wednesday."
"It would be sending out entirely the wrong political signal on such an important issue to hold the debate on Wednesday morning, but not to have the vote until the next day."
"We therefore support the idea of being able to table amendments and compromises later, at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. instead of 4 p.m., depending on the technical constraints."
"Let us take one part at a time."
"Postponement of McIntosh report"
"First of all, we have Mrs Green's proposal, supported by the EPP Group, to postpone the McIntosh report until the July part-session."
"I am going to put the proposal to the vote. May I remind Mrs Green and other members that this is an exception because proposals for amendments should, under the Rules, be tabled one hour before the part-session begins, at the latest."
"(Parliament approved the request) - Deadline for tabling (European Council)"
"The second point raised by Mrs Green concerns the deadline for tabling amendments on the Amsterdam European Council."
"The deadline can be extended until 4 p.m. Tuesday, so that resolutions can be voted on on Wednesday."
"Groups must display responsibility and not table too many amendments, so that the vote can be completed, given the importance of this subject."
"Mr President, I am trying to be helpful."
"I understand why we would want to vote on Wednesday."
"We could support that provided our Group and most of the other groups which meet in the evening on Tuesday have at least some opportunity to discuss the amendments and the text that comes out of the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"My Group meets at 7 o'clock, so it is quite impossible for us to have the amendments in by 6 o'clock."
"We will try to keep them to an absolute minimum."
"Even a deadline of 8 o'clock will only allow us an hour to discuss these issues with a group of 214."
"You see the pressure we are under!"
"Obviously 9 o'clock would make it much easier for us."
"If we can all agree with that, then we will do all we can to facilitate matters for the services."
"We will even give drafts in advance, which we can then perhaps adjust in minor ways afterwards."
"We will do everything we can to be helpful."
"Mrs Green, that means that we would vote on Thursday?"
"Mr President, I would like to propose that if we can have a deadline of 9 o'clock - and we will facilitate matters as much as we can for the services - we should vote on Wednesday."
"We will try to do it."
"But if it is technically impossible, because amendments are numerous and complicated, then we will have to hold the vote on Thursday."
"We will know by Wednesday morning."
"In any case, my services tell me that we can put 9 o'clock if we have amendments by that time."
"Requests for split votes must be in by 6 o'clock, but we would accept amendments until 9 o'clock."
"Mr President, I do not have much experience of procedural debates here, but Mrs OomenRuijten has been extremely helpful in explaining matters, drawing on her own wealth of experience."
"However, I would also refer to the practice adopted by Mr Hänsch in the past, whereby votes had to be taken as soon as possible after the debates."
"This seems a very good rule to me, and as Mrs Aelvoet said, it would be sending out the wrong political signal if we held the debate on Wednesday morning but did not vote until Thursday afternoon."
"I therefore agree with your proposal, Mr President, that we should have our meetings by 9 p.m. tomorrow night - our group too does not meet until 7 p.m. and that we should have until 9 p.m. to table any amendments."
"I would urge most strongly that we should vote on Wednesday afternoon after the debate."
"I agree, that is what I said."
"Mr President, I entirely agree with the proposal that we should keep the number of amendments to a minimum and that we should have them in by 9 p.m."
"However, what I cannot understand is why we need to decide which split votes we want by 6 p.m."
"I do not see why it has to be so early, since there is really not a problem with getting things translated - the President of the sitting just reads out the split vote that has been requested - but simply of preparing the votes."
"I honestly cannot see why, if the amendments are to be in by 9 p.m., we cannot also have until then to consider which sections need a split vote."
"I simply cannot see the reason for this."
"This is an exceptional vote, and that is why we are exceptionally setting an 8 o'clock deadline."
"The European Parliament's services will pull out all the stops so that we can vote on Wednesday."
"Mr President, I am surprised at this result, because the groups are being very helpful to the plenary."
"After all, we have to have the opportunity to consider what will only come out of committee tonight."
"You are giving us one hour, which makes it extremely difficult not only to discuss the amendments we might wish to submit but to submit them in a form acceptable to the plenary."
"That is very tough going!"
"I cannot see why, if we must vote Wednesday - and I accept it would be better to vote then - we cannot say that if there are too many amendments and it cannot be dealt with by lunchtime Wednesday, we will have a special voting session at 5 o'clock."
"After all this House is sovereign."
"We need to be able to discuss these issues."
"It is not just the vote that is important."
"The whole issue is important."
"The groups' response to the discussion on the IGC is crucial."
"So I would still ask that it be 9 o'clock."
"My Group has 214 members."
"It is not easy to discuss this issue and submit the amendments in one hour."
"Mrs Green, the deadline will be at 9 p.m., but I take note of what you have said: if everything is not ready for the vote on Wednesday, late in the morning, then the vote will have to be at 5 p.m."
"We cannot vote unless decent translations are ready and all the preparations have properly been completed."
"Agricultural debate"
"The third point concerns the joint debate on agricultural prices."
"I have just received a letter from the Dutch Agriculture Minister to the effect that he must attend a national parliament sitting in the afternoon."
"I can suggest two scenarios: either the debate will be held from 9 p.m. to midnight on Tuesday - when he would be present - or we hold a debate with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I give the floor to Mr Colino, chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, I am surprised by this announcement, for reasons you have explained, that the Dutch Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, will not be here, and I think it would be preferable for him to attend the debate."
"I would not oppose postponing the debate until 9 p.m. to midnight on Tuesday, in accordance with this request, as long as the Minister will attend in that case."
"The Minister's letter states quite clearly: ' I shall be able to attend the debate from 9 p.m. to midnight."
"I would therefore be grateful if the debate on agricultural prices were postponed until the evening' ."
"It seems quite clear."
"I put to the House the proposal to postpone the debate on agricultural prices to Tuesday evening."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"The order of business has been adopted thus amended ."
"Mr President, it was actually intended that there should be a joint debate."
"So are we now going to have a debate just on agricultural prices, or on the whole complex that is on the agenda?"
"Thank you very much, for your question, which gives me the opportunity to make it clear that this is the joint debate that we are talking about."
"Mr President, I must object."
"We agreed on one point, and that was the discussion about agricultural prices."
"It is simply not right that we should go on discussing this whole complex until midnight."
"There will be no Members left in the House by then!"
"I understand your argument, as your Group voted against."
"But the majority of the European Parliament has decided otherwise."
"Mrs Lulling, you have the floor."
"Mr President, my report also concerns agriculture, bee-keeping to be precise."
"I do not see what it has to do with agricultural prices and we could quite easily examine it in the afternoon, like the Baldarelli report, as the agenda states."
"Is that not possible?"
"Mrs Lulling, according to the agenda, you report was not part of the joint debate."
"It is therefore unaffected by this decision."
"The decision was to postpone the joint debate but not the other items. In other words, not your report."
"Petitions 1996-1997"
"The next item is the report (A4-0190/97) by Mr Perry, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 1996-1997."
"Mr President, I present the annual report on the work of the Committee on Petitions."
"I find that wherever people are in the world, they tend to perceive themselves as being at the centre of the universe."
"I find that whichever committee in this Parliament colleagues are members of, they regard that committee as the most important, the most vital and central to the work of Parliament."
"They can all make a good case, whether it is the Budgets Committee, Environment, Women's Rights, Regional Affairs or whatever. They are all doing important work."
"I know that the Committee on Petitions is not universally regarded as the most important."
"In fact I describe it to my constituents as the complaints department of the Parliament."
"We do not decide policy, we make no legislation, we control no budgets, which are the ways you normally decide power and influence."
"But we do listen to the people of Europe; and in a democratic process can anybody tell me anything that is more important than to listen to the citizens' concerns and problems?"
"Citizens take their right to petition seriously."
"In the last ten years the number of petitions has doubled from 500 to over 1, 000 per annum."
"There has been a slight decrease this year, which was to be expected with the advent of the European Ombudsman."
"The committee has established good working methods with the Ombudsman and I pay tribute to the work and the good relations that exist."
"The Committee on Petitions performs the role of listener on behalf of the Parliament."
"Last year saw a petition with over 4 million signatures objecting to tests on live animals by the cosmetics industry."
"But it is the opportunity for the individual to get redress of grievances that is important."
"Colleague Mary Banotti works very hard on the issue of tug-of-love children, working as your representative to solve those very personal problems."
"There was a young man in Luxembourg who got the tax authorities there to repay him tax."
"Nobody can do a better job than getting the taxman to pay money back!"
"Even in my own constituency a petitioner complained that his pension had been miscalculated and he got several thousand pounds back pay."
"The committee works in a harmonious way across our national and political divisions."
"I certainly want to pay tribute to last year's chairman, Mr Newman, and my political colleague, Mr Fontana, who is the chairman this year."
"I also wish to place on record the committee's appreciation of the work of its secretariat and the work of the Commission."
"Their reports are invariably thorough, well-researched and presented in a helpful way."
"Sadly my report is not all plaudits."
"The Council of Ministers is often conspicuous by its absence."
"I wonder whether they are in the debate this evening."
"Yet a significant proportion of our petitions comes from citizens who believe that Member States are failing to honour their obligations to the European Treaties."
"There might be issues of social security, respect for the environment - a whole myriad of problems arise because it is citizens who seek to put the Treaties into effect by living, working, studying where they wish in Europe."
"It is not yet always as easy as we wish it to be, or indeed as we fondly might believe it to be."
"Attendance by representatives of the Council frequently and regularly at meetings of the Committee on Petitions might obviate that sort of problem."
"It is not just the Council I comment on."
"Our own services - and even some of our committees - pay scant attention to the work of the Committee on Petitions."
"To my mind, when a committee of the Parliament is asked by the Committee on Petitions for an opinion they should believe there can be no higher priority than heeding the pleas of the citizen who thinks Europe is not working."
"In the report we have also asked the press and publicity offices to pay more attention."
"These are human interest stories; they show what Europe means to the individual; they show that Parliament is the protector of the individual and we should be shouting our successes from the rooftops."
"The report contains a proposed formula that sets out what European citizens are entitled to expect of bodies that administer regulations and directives, whether these bodies are national governments or the Commission."
"They cover such obvious issues as transparency of rules, who is in charge of a service, the right to prompt attention to a case within a published timescale."
"In Britain these administrative standards are contained within a Citizens' Charter and this is a model which the Commission could well study and emulate where appropriate across Europe."
"I hope we shall find a mechanism for establishing that formula of good administrative practice as a European citizens' charter."
"Finally, as a committee we urge that the 'Citizens First' information campaign should not neglect to remind citizens of their worthwhile right to petition the Parliament to help ensure that the rights of the European citizen are respected."
"First of all I should like to congratulate Mr Perry on his excellent report."
"This annual report, and the way in which it has been drawn up, are a sign and expression of the excellent cooperation, above all party-political considerations, that characterizes our work on this committee."
"The Committee on Petitions has been in existence for ten years now, and during that time it has received about 10, 000 petitions with about 10 billion signatures."
"We can quite rightly claim that the Committee on Petitions forms the link between the citizens of the EU and its institutions."
"The people of the European Union come to the Committee on Petitions with their concerns, their negative experiences and their desires."
"Often we are able to help them solve their problems, but often our hands are tied because, even when there is European involvement, the legal basis needed in order to take action is lacking."
"In that case, the matter turns out to be a national problem after all."
"Sometimes, however, the Committee on Petitions, as an institution, is completely misunderstood."
"We are regarded, as it were, as the highest instance, along the following lines: I, the petitioner, have complained to my local authority, then to the regional authority, and then to the national petitions committee."
"None of them upheld my claim, so I am now going to go to the European Parliament and complain there."
"Of course, that is not what our competence is all about."
"We are not the Supreme Court."
"One problem that we still have to overcome is the problem of time."
"Petitioners have to wait too long for a reply, or for the solution to their problem."
"It takes some time, after a petition is first received by post, for it to be summarized, checked in advance to see whether it is admissible or not, and then translated into eleven languages."
"Once the Committee has decided on a recommendation, then the real work begins."
"The Commission, thank goodness, has finally complied with our request and is trying to process petitions very rapidly, but they are still being held up at the level of the Member States and the Council."
"They operate very slowly, particularly when an infringement of Community law is involved."
"Insufficient information is made available; in other words, in most cases it is incomplete, and it is also too slow."
"We are asking for more precise and more rapid information and replies from Member States."
"We need firmly agreed deadlines, and all those people who are involved in the expansion and coordination of the electronic data-processing system could help here."
"Because, since 1992, the Committee on Petitions has been meeting in public, and because the petitioners are always asked whether they want their petitions to be handled in public or not, this should not cause any difficulties with data protection either."
"The participation and hearing of petitioners by the Committee is often desirable as a matter of urgency, and we try to be fair in arranging for this to be done."
"For example, on the petition about opencast lignite mining in Garzweiler, because we as a committee thought that the information provided by the petitioners was insufficient, we decided to send a fact-finding mission there."
"The visit will be taking place next week."
"Unfortunately too much of our work still goes on out of the public eye."
"Many of the initiatives of the other committees, and legislative initiatives by the Commission, too, are closely linked to the petitions dealt with by the Committee, because people are constantly discovering defects and deficiencies in European Directives and statutory provisions."
"So we are also requesting that the European Parliament's offices should be better informed about the right of petition."
"The public should be informed about the petitions that are being examined, and above all about the petitions for which solutions have been found."
"Only in this way can we, as elected representatives of EU citizens, establish a closer link with them and put into practice our oft-quoted desire to be 'close to the people' ."
"Mr President, this is an unexpected bonus for me."
"I am replacing Mr Fontana and, as an active member of the Committee on Petitions, I wish to take this opportunity to inform Parliament that we have had some extremely good news in relation to children who have been abducted."
"In the past year children who have been missing - in some cases for up to 18 months - have been recovered."
"There was a very notable case where a German child had been abducted to Western Samoa and there were others abducted to France and North Africa."
"With the considerable help of your office and of Parliament we have had some significant successes in returning these children to their parents."
"This has resulted in some very good publicity for Parliament."
"People recognize it as a human issue and, while we are not going about it strictly speaking as lawyers, through Parliament we have considerable influence in putting pressure on local authorities who might be ignoring these cases assuming them just to be domestic tiffs."
"When we ring from Parliament I have noticed a considerable willingness on the part of many authorities, legal and social, to take these cases seriously and to give us wonderful help in the process."
"Another matter on which the Committee on Petitions has been lobbied intensely is the difficulties many teachers experience working in other Member States."
"Every Member State has its own sneaky little tricks for making sure that people do not find it too easy to go to other countries and practice their professions."
"So, in the context of the directive on free movement and practice of the professions, we hope there will be improvements here."
"I also had the honour of being the rapporteur for the report on disability."
"A petition by over 3, 000 people with disabilities throughout the Community resulted in my report which I am proud to say was passed unanimously last December."
"Another petition also raised very serious issues."
"Two of my constituents petitioned Parliament when their parents died in a carbon monoxide poisoning incident in a holiday apartment in Spain."
"As a direct result of this petition we have discovered some very alarming things about some gas heaters, including the fact that 61 people died in Belgium last year as a direct result of carbon monoxide poisoning from water heaters."
"Thus, issues far beyond the actual content of the petition have been raised."
"As Mr Perry has rightly said, the people of Europe are effectively probing the laws of Europe, the directives of Europe and the issues that concern them most closely."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Perry for the report, which I think is an excellent piece of work. It does seem true that, as Mr Perry says, people tend to think that the particular committee in which they are currently active is the most important one in Parliament."
"But, that said, I think we can safely say that the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman together really focus on the most vital areas of the Union's work."
"There are very few other agencies through which citizens have the same direct contact with the Union."
"This is where the individual citizen can get a concern addressed in an entirely concrete way."
"Unfortunately of course, it is often because there is something wrong in the relationship between Member States - after all that is what the Committee on Petitions deals with - but it is possible for the citizen to lodge a complaint or raise matters more or less at no cost."
"Where else in the Union is it possible to get a case off the ground without spending huge amounts on legal assistance?"
"It is possible when the matter is raised with the Committee on Petitions."
"But, precisely because this is where the individual citizen comes into direct contact with the Union, it is important that the procedure should be as effective as possible."
"And, as we have the President in the Chair, I would like to say - and I hope the President is listening even though this is in Danish - that, when it comes to the use of information technology in the conduct of business in Parliament, there is a great deal lacking."
"Things get almost completely impossible when one ventures into this area, and I think that, particularly when fifteen countries have to cooperate, it is absolutely vital to make use of computer systems and information technology."
"Mr President, I want to start by congratulating Mr Perry on the first class report he has presented to us and then ask the House to bear in mind that the right of petition is one of the fundamental rights of European citizens."
"The exercise of this right currently represents one of the few points of direct contact with the European institutions available to the European citizen."
"So it is essential that we activate this right fully."
"It has already been said, and I want to underline it, that in the last ten years some ten thousand petitions have been presented and millions of citizens have signed them."
"That is why it is important for all the parliamentary committees to be involved in activating this right, and not just the Committee on Petitions. It is also vital to find a way of amending the Rules of Procedure so that a rapid response can be given to all the petitions we receive."
"We have taken a considerable time to respond today, and we cannot maintain dialogue with the citizens of Europe and protect this right for them unless the response procedure is changed to make it faster and easier."
"Here I must also mention that the Commission collaborates too slowly, but at least it does, whereas the Council hardly collaborates at all."
"A strong request needs to be made on this point too if the right of petition is to be fully realized."
"Mr President, the annual report by the Committee on Petitions naturally contains little that is controversial."
"There is no doubt that there must be mechanisms at every level of government to protect people against abuses of power or the indifference of officialdom."
"For example, support and help needs to be given to frontier workers within the European Union facing problems with their tax or pension administrations."
"However, it is most regrettable that when this ideal is put into practice using all our highly detailed Community law, it is invariably presented as a kind of victory for democracy."
"I would point out that in many cases Community law is introduced in a way that could not remotely be described as democratic, either because decisions are taken behind closed doors where no one monitors what happens, or because they are taken at a level so far removed from the man in the street that there can be no question of controls, let alone involvement."
"Let me give you an example."
"The Maastricht Treaty provides that in all the Member States, even people who do not have the nationality of the country concerned must have the right to vote in European and local council elections."
"This was a totally arbitrary idea, the brainchild of a purely pro-European ideology."
"It was a decision taken over people's heads and was not even welcomed by the people concerned, as we can see from the fact that the most recent European elections were a major flop amongst the electorate in question."
"For the last three years, I have been asking the Commission at regular intervals for the turn-out figures, and they have always claimed that they are unable to provide them, even now, three years after the event."
"In my own country, this European decision is threatening to result in cultural genocide - there is no other word for it - for Flemings around Brussels and in Brussels itself."
"Tens of thousands of new voters, almost by definition not Dutch-speaking, of course, are threatening to create a tidal wave of support for the French-speaking parties."
"These French-speaking parties represent people who think that they belong to a sort of 'Herrenvolk ' that does not need to adapt itself to the language of the country in which it settles, but thinks instead that the native population, the Flemings, the Dutch speakers, should adapt themselves to the newcomers."
"This modern form of cynical and brutal colonialism is now being supported by a European decision which the vast majority of my people did not want and which has to be seen as helping to promote cultural genocide."
"The Flemish Parliament has actually adopted a motion linking the right to vote in European elections to a number of very strict conditions and restrictions, but it looks very much as if the decision taken by Europe over everyone's heads carries more weight than the democratic wishes of the Flemish Parliament."
"It is examples like this which make me think that Europe is often actually harmful to the interests, survival and identity of the nations of the Union. That is why I have become a eurosceptic and why I cannot endorse this report, uncontroversial though it may be."
"Madam President, I too wish to compliment Mr Perry on his report and to thank him."
"We should recognize, of course, that the report is the product of the committee as a whole, as is reflected in the unanimous approval given to it and the constructive additions made via amendments throughout the period during which it was being drawn up."
"The Perry report follows the lead set by the Gutiérrez Díaz report last year and the Kuhn report in 1995 in enhancing the standing of the Committee on Petitions."
"Yes, it is true that the Committee on Petitions is not the most exalted of this Parliament's committees. However, as a committee, it is not the same as the others."
"The right of the citizen to petition is a fundamental right recognized in the treaties and the European Parliament has a duty to promote that right. And it is the Committee on Petitions which is charged, in the name of this Parliament, with the task of supporting and making a reality of the right of the European citizen to petition."
"This right of the citizen to approach the European Parliament directly provides us with a good tool for monitoring the European venture on the ground."
"It is form of ongoing check, a form of public scrutiny of Community law through the eyes of ordinary people who very frequently find themselves up against adverse circumstances in their everyday lives."
"I think that this message is good news to very large numbers of people."
"The fact, I mean, that the European Parliament has this committee which is now able to protect and promote the rights of the citizen in concert with the institution of the European Ombudsman."
"Madam President, I join colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for his report, which was quite excellent, as was his presentation."
"But, of course, as the last speaker has said, the report is a reflection of the work of the Committee on Petitions as a whole."
"I am an outsider, ie, I am not a member of the Petitions Committee, but I have, from time to time, constituents with knotty problems."
"I must confess that we have had our share of failures."
"I am the first to acknowledge that the committee has been successful on many fronts."
"We have heard in particular from Mrs Banotti how children have benefitted from the work of the Petitions Committee."
"But the hard fact is that there are a number of knotty problems and some of them have come through my own hands."
"I have not been able to satisfy the constituents concerned; not at least until now."
"That may or may not be the fault of the Petitions Committee."
"It may or may not be the fault of the Commission."
"But one gets the feeling that some people sometimes are not doing their stuff."
"I would put the Commission officials in that category."
"Who do I have in mind?"
"I have in mind, for instance, my excellent constituent, Mr Peter Thomas."
"He won a case against the Greek railways several years ago and he is owed several thousand pounds by them."
"Have they honoured that?"
"Certainly not!"
"They have not paid him for breach of contract."
"The thing drags on and on and my constituent is in serious trouble with his bank manager."
"That is case one."
"Case two: I have a constituent - Mr Hawthorne - who had a villa in Malaga, in Spain."
"This was sold when he was not looking."
"He only owed them a very small loan."
"He has been struggling now for six years with the Spanish courts and we have not had any help yet, effectively, from this Parliament."
"I feel slightly ashamed about that."
"Madam President, I think this is a very useful report, as we are seeing from the debate, because it gives an account of the work of the Committee on Petitions - an account fully deserved by the Committee on Petitions and its secretariat."
"But we must realise that we are far from making the effective and necessary response expected by Europe's citizens, who are turning to us in droves, submitting very important cases, cases affecting their fundamental interests - and we have not been able, as I said, to provide the desired effective response to these petitions, to these requests and to the defence of their rights and interests."
"We have not been able to do that for two types of reasons: one might even be our fault because of the difficulty entailed in informing citizens that this facility does exist; that is bound up also with the lugubrious and complex nature, in spite of everything, of the actual process which also requires translation into all languages."
"But, in the second place, this inability to respond quickly and positively to the requests and petitions submitted by our citizens is due to the fact that the complaints are often directed against the acts or omissions by the Member States."
"And the problem is that the procedure we work to does not allow us to contact the Member States direct to compel them to respond to the wishes of the citizens."
"We must therefore accept that, in order to respond effectively, the terms of the very procedures in the Treaty must be amended."
"But I must not forget to point out the practical importance which petitions to the European Parliament have, for example in Portugal in the case of discrimination as regards salaries in the Banco Central Português and in the case of the customs agents, specific cases where many petitions were received - indicating that people expected an objective response to their problems from the European Parliament."
"And that is why we have to improve the way we work. I also appeal to the Council and to the Member States to cooperate in the process with the Committee on Petitions."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the honest report that the Committee on Petitions has presented to the House on the queries raised by European citizens gives us an excellent opportunity to think about the relationship between the citizens of Europe and the institutions of the European Union."
"The Commission has placed great emphasis on this point, which is so important to the European Union, particularly during the Inter-Governmental Conference, where it was a central issue in the discussions about the future of the institutions, because the Commission believes that it is very important that citizens and institutions should be brought closer together."
"It is also, at the end of the day, a question of the confidence in Europe that people are already feeling."
"The right of petition is an important achievement for our citizens."
"The rapid and efficient processing of petitions is therefore an excellent means of increasing people's confidence."
"When a citizen hands in a petition to Parliament, he is not only highlighting what, in his opinion, is an unsatisfactory application of Community provisions, but also, at the same time, expressing his confidence in Parliament."
"He is also linking that with the expectation that what he sees as a wrong will be righted accordingly."
"The Commission therefore tried hard to ensure that the questions put to it by the Committee on Petitions are answered quickly and comprehensively."
"As Mr Perry has shown in his extremely informative report, this cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission has once again this year, in many case, enabled solutions to be found and definite improvements to be made."
"The thorough examination of the many different petitions is also interesting, as Mr Perry has quite rightly pointed out, for another reason, because the Committee on Petitions is the barometer of the specific issues that concern our citizens, the most important parliamentary citizens' forum."
"Since 1987, more than 10 million European citizens have turned to Parliament, in around 10, 000 petitions."
"The subjects that chiefly concern them are social issues, the environment, taxes, free movement and the recognition of diplomas."
"The Commission regards it as one of its most important tasks, in the interests of the people, to ensure that the relevant Community law is applied without restrictions, and to discover and remedy any weak points in the provisions of that law."
"Parliament provides the Commission with very valuable assistance in carrying out this task."
"The Commission is therefore particularly pleased about the excellent cooperation with Parliament, and Parliament's recognition of that fact."
"It will continue to give the Committee on Petitions all the information it needs in order to process petitions efficiently, and will be happy to comply with the desire expressed by the Committee on Petitions for close cooperation on the 'Citizens of Europe' initiative."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Television broadcasting"
"The next item is the report (A4-201/97) by Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Hoppenstedt, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive (C4-0203/97-95/0074(COD)) amending Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities."
"Madam President, throughout the debates and the course of work on the Directive on Television without Frontiers, we have held intense discussions, often lengthy and sometimes controversial, but I think that everyone who has taken part in those discussions will agree that our recollection of the debates will be a good one."
"I think that we have put in a good deal of effort and imagination and have all fought for our convictions, but with enough flexibility and room for dialogue for the debates to be a success."
"I also am convinced that all of us who have discussed this issue have had as the main aim of our positions the general interest, over party interests and economic interests."
"As co-rapporteur along with Mr Hoppenstedt, I must also note the leading role played by the European Parliament in this debate."
"In the recitals, we have pointed out the elements always regarded as essential by the European Parliament for promoting the European audiovisual industry: fostering production by means of a Community mechanism, that could be the guarantee fund, and boosting independent producers in particular."
"I should like on this point to appeal to the Commission to insist on its proposals: it will always have the European Parliament on its side in the fight to go from declarations to practical actions that could change the situation."
"The European Parliament has also contributed specific solutions, such as developing a novel television phenomenon, like tele-sales, or updating the regulation on advertising, which is always debatable, but I think that this subject has emerged from our debates with a 'healthier' regulation, if I may use that word."
"Above all, the main satisfaction of the European Parliament in my view lies in its ability to be sensitive to social demands."
"We have added to the Directive a reinforcement of the protection of minors' rights and I have every hope that we could even develop this matter in a year's time when the Commission presents the findings of its research, as reflected in the Directive."
"We have also ensured the free access by ordinary people to events of great importance for society."
"So that both provisions can be fully operative, we must ask the Commission to bring forward the creation of the contact committee provided for in Article 23bis of the Directive and to stick to its promise - as Commissioner Oreja has declared himself willing - to inform the European Parliament regularly of the deliberations of that contact committee."
"I think that by means of tomorrow's vote we are really going to be able to respond to the expectations raised by the debate in our respective countries, thanks to two years of intensive work by the Culture Committee."
"I would like to thank, in particular, Mrs Castellina and Mr Pex, who have chaired it over that time, the effort by the Dutch Presidency and Commissioner Oreja's involvement and skill, as well as that of his colleagues, who has so magnificently helped us throughout our discussions."
"For media policy and media-policy development, what we have been doing for the last two years has made media history."
"I believe that, in view of the meteoric development of electronic and digital communications, especially via satellite, we have done a good piece of work."
"However, we are also aware of the fact that media developments are driving us as we move into the future."
"You could say that this is a very exciting task."
"In our search to find the right solutions, many people have given us their help."
"This includes, of course, our fellow members, even though, in many cases, at the first or second reading we did not agree with them. It also includes the Commission, and also, as has already been pointed out, the Dutch Presidency of the Council."
"However, I do not want to forget, either, the professionals who were involved, and to name the individual groups who have supported us or tried to point us in the right direction."
"That would certainly be a subject that would take up the whole evening."
"During the second reading, we made some important decisions, for example, about the definition of the concept of broadcasting, the differentiation of the so-called new services, and also the clear definition of advertising rules, which is naturally an important factor in setting the course for the dual system which we all wanted, without - Mrs Tongue - pressurizing public-law broadcasting in any particular way."
"We have established that the quota system will be voluntary, and on this subject I have to say - and it was a very wide-ranging discussion - that everyone here in this House wants European programmes, and European films, to make up the largest contingent of our programmes."
"We could do nothing by means of quotas."
"It is our opinion - and mine - that quotas have never yet created programmes."
"MEDIA I and II, Action Plan 16: 9 and the Guarantee Fund which has already been mentioned, and which we still see as an important contribution to the development of European programming policy, all these, on the other hand, are elements which we trust will take European programming policy forward."
"As has already been mentioned, we have had very thorough discussions on the protection of young people and, in particular, on the technical devices for switching television sets off, as the last option for those who have parental authority."
"I think it was a mistake for the Council not to accept this."
"In the context of the conciliation process, from which we achieved excellent results, we have commissioned a study which should once again make it clear, where young people have been placed at risk, just how great that risk is."
"In addition, of course, the study should also make it clear whether a switching-off device would be a suitable tool, and whether the assessment criteria, if they cannot be harmonized at European level, could be made effective at national level."
"This study, by means of a questionnaire on the subject of whether television is harmful to children, may well be superfluous, however, since there are already 5, 000 of these studies throughout the world, so we could perhaps have made things easier for ourselves!"
"One important subject - and I believe this was also a satisfactory result of our conciliation procedure - is the question of how we can make sure that, even in future, consumers continue to have access to important national, cultural and sporting events."
"On this question, in the course of the conciliation procedure, we proposed - and decided- that the drawing up of lists should be voluntary."
"This voluntary basis will put Member States into a position - and Member States have already received the submission on this subject - to turn it into something sensible and thus decide on a suitable path into the future for their citizens and consumers, as far as participation in these events is concerned."
"Owing to technical developments, we as a Parliament will in future be called on to give some thought to major developments in media policy."
"This year, Parliament has taken up a key position on this issue, and I can only say, that if we continue to act - and develop as a parliament - in such a positive manner, especially where media policy is concerned, then we are moving in the right direction."
"I only hope that we shall continue to work on this exciting subject."
"In so doing, we shall be finding a sensible solution for our fellow-citizens of the European Union and beyond it in the worldwide network of the new media."
"I should just like to thank, once again, my fellow campaigner, Mr Galeote Quecedo, and also all those colleagues who have supported us."
"I should also like to thank the Commission, especially Mr Oreja, and Nicole Fontaine who, together with the Council, managed the conciliation procedure extremely successfully."
"Madam President, I should like to thank our rapporteurs."
"We have shown that the future of the audio-visual industry is a debate which crosses all political and national boundaries."
"We have all shown a shared concern for the future of television, the most influential medium in our democracies and in conciliation we were united as a parliament which was most welcome and most important."
"It is worth remembering what the directive is about."
"It is about building a strong and competitive audio-visual industry which should offer more than 1 million new European jobs by the year 2000."
"We cannot tolerate a $6.3 billion deficit with the US."
"America only accepts 3 % of audio-visual material from outside of non-US content."
"Free trade must be about reciprocity."
"The directive is about ensuring that we as Europeans benefit economically and culturally from this expanding industry."
"We must create in order to compete."
"We must make sure all our cultures have a space on our screens."
"Canada, Australia, all countries across the globe ensure that there is space on their screens through quotas."
"I say to Mr Hoppenstedt that European quotas are not protectionist."
"The US enjoys a massive structural advantage."
"It can sell programmes to us at a tenth of the cost it takes to make them and this is in part due to their own regulatory regime that they have enjoyed in the past."
"Moving on to sports rights, there are two possible futures for television."
"The one is driven by commercial demand and the other shaped by the public interest."
"Sports rights are key."
"Thanks to our amendment on sports rights every country will be able to draw up a list of key events."
"This will ensure the continued success of culturally diverse free TV. The Olympic Games and the European Cup Final, for example, must be on free TV for every citizen."
"TV is Europe's Hollywood."
"The Television without Frontiers directive is our chance to show that we are really serious about jobs, investments, exports and cultural pluralism."
"We must be able to create and see our own stories, be it Inspector Morse or Derrick."
"We must benefit economically from this industry which will soon be the largest employer in Europe."
"Finally, the major sporting and cultural events must be shown free for everyone's enjoyment."
"Madam President, now that the dust has finally settled on this directive - possibly the most lobbied directive in my experience here in the last 13 years in Parliament - let us look at some of the issues that concerned not just us here in Parliament but specifically those who were quite bemused by the complexity of this directive in terms of public perception."
"The reason why I have supported quotas is - as I am sure is the case for many other colleagues - because we cannot necessarily trust our own broadcasters not to take the easy option when it comes to cheap programming."
"The independent producers were very concerned about this directive, and we must recognize and support our young, independent producers, who are already producing some of the best and most interesting programmes out of Europe."
"Let us look in particular at those who produce in minority languages and who, inevitably, need to have subtitles for their programmes."
"Yet if we already have subtitles, it should be possible for these programmes to be seen throughout all European countries and, I hope, throughout the world - if necessary with subtitles - for they do give us a very special insight into the less well-known languages and less well-known cultures within our communities."
"We must protect our public service broadcasting."
"Coming from a country that has mixed public service and commercial broadcasting, we have particular problems and we must also recognize that we are not selling our own programmes to our own colleagues and other countries in the European Union."
"Of course we must try to break into the lucrative American market, but first of all let us make sure that we produce programmes that will sell across our own borders, that people will be interested in and will buy, and thus add more to the pot for independent producers."
"This directive has been a great catalyst: it has pulled us up short to look at what we mean by our culture and to put a value on it that perhaps was lacking in many of our other deliberations."
"Madam President, a conciliation meeting of 100 minutes was deemed to be sufficient, partly because the European Parliament, in its wisdom - though not everyone would agree with that - dropped its original demands for compulsory quotas for European productions and the inclusion of new services."
"The Liberal Group is happy with the high level of protection which is provided for minors in the revised directive, and I sincerely hope, Commissioner Fischler, that you will look into the question of the V-chip very carefully, and that this or some similar technical device will eventually be introduced."
"I see this as a Liberal principle: the government provides the means, and it is up to parents and teachers to decide whether or not to use them."
"We are also happy that the general public is to have guaranteed access to major sports events at no extra cost."
"I should like to congratulate both the rapporteurs on this."
"On an entirely different subject, but in the same context, I am concerned at the Dutch proposals to include a protocol on public service broadcasting in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Will governments then be able to provide unlimited funding for public service broadcasting?"
"And would this not then put public service broadcasting in an entirely anomalous position with regard to European competition rules?"
"Once the protocol has been adopted, could commercial radio and television complain to the Commission if they think that public service broadcasting is being given preferential treatment?"
"Could government funding be used to give public service broadcasting an advantage in launching new services and breaking into new markets?"
"These are matters that have nothing to do with public service and would be unacceptable to the Liberals."
"I know for certain that Commissioner Van Miert finds them difficult to accept too."
"We support the idea of a dual system, with strong public service broadcasting providing information and maintaining its own cultural identity, while at the same time allowing plenty of scope for commercial broadcasting - choice instead of a concentration of power, no preferential treatment, and everything on a level playing field."
"We should not forget that commercial broadcasters too have to make their living on the open market, yet they are just as bound by the provisions of the 'Television without frontiers' directive - which is as it should be, but then they should also be given equal treatment."
"Madam President, Mr Hoppenstedt, Mr Galeote Quecedo, are you not astonished that there are so few people in the hemicycle - not forgetting Mrs Banotti - after two years, as you have pointed out, of such intense lobbying directed at us?"
"Today, you are holding your Oscar ceremony, congratulating each other, in an empty Chamber, but you are not astonished."
"The Council is represented, but no Culture Minister is here."
"Mr Oreja could not be bothered to come."
"Mr Bangemann, so furious over the quotas, is not here either."
"Yes, nobody is here because they have won!"
"There is nobody here because those who want to fight and continue to fight the fight for quotas no longer believe in us."
"It is also a failure for Europe and its institutions, when at the IGC we are not going to be able to call into question that false codecision, and we were 22 votes short of a qualified majority, whereas we had a simple majority, such that we opposed democracy."
"Of course, we are heading in the direction of what the former White House aide, Mr Brejzinski, used to say: ' What we have not succeeded in doing by force of arms, we shall achieve by means of the information superhighways' ."
"Ah yes, we are opening up the information superhighways, we are opening up our screens."
"For many countries, they have in any case been largely invaded."
"Then we can say that we have won."
"For sport, it is the least we can do, in every corner of France and Europe, perhaps to watch the Tour de France or Wimbledon."
"But is that really a victory?"
"Is this a victory - I was not really a partisan, for the furious campaigners for protection from violence and pornography, to know that the solution finally opted for means that, in a year's time, the Commission will conduct, together with the Member States' competent authorities, an inquiry into the advantages and disadvantages of measures aimed at facilitating parental controls."
"But who are they poking fun at?!"
"Faced with a great challenge for civilisation - so great that the United States, since the Blum-Barnes accords, have understood that that was a priority and that that was where the future of employment lay, but also the future of culture, language, ideology - why not say so?"
"The quotas battle is vital."
"I hope that we shall continue to fight that fight, with trade union organisations, with professional organisations."
"I can tell you that at Cannes, during the fiftieth anniversary, people were convinced by and spoke a lot about quotas."
"I hope that after the elections in Great Britain and France, we shall be able to fight this fight intelligently and responsibly."
"Madam President, I want to put on record, briefly, that throughout the lengthy period of work in which discussion of the Television without Frontiers Directive has been going on, the Greens have made their position clear, declaring their agreement with the text as it stood after first reading."
"In that text we recognized an important step forward in the evolution of this directive, and above all we recognized that a link between television, media in general, and democracy had been established."
"There is a link between television and culture and the need was recognized, not for a European culture, but for the group of different cultures that exist today in Europe to be able to have a future and not be suffocated by the domination of transmission modes and fiction, are all imported from the United States of America or, in some cases, from the Far East."
"We cannot accept that situation."
"The first reading provided a remedy. Unfortunately, as has been mentioned, by a few votes the second reading has radically altered the meaning of the text that came out of the first reading."
"And I am not just referring to the quota problem but also, it has to be said, to the failure to include all the possible developments in television, the television of the future, in the directive. All these factors have brought the Green group to a negative position."
"Now, as other colleagues have already said, in the end the outcome of the conciliation was facile and anyone can support it on certain points which are important, true, - the problem of the protection of minors, the problem of clear guarantees of transmission of national and international events, particularly sporting ones - but the sum of these is not enough to change our negative assessment of the directive as a whole in the form it has taken after second reading and after the changes made by the Council."
"That is why our position is a one of criticism."
"Madam President, the interest of the conciliation focused on the European Parliament proposal to guarantee the open broadcasting of major sporting events."
"The text agreed upon is satisfactory and balanced, but I have to regret and denounce the fact that the Spanish Government, led by the Partido Popular, has used this provision of the Directive as a pretext to persecute the media not at the Government's service."
"The European Parliament proposal established that in all Member States it would be compulsory to broadcast openly certain sporting events of extraordinary importance, such as the Olympics, and World or European Football Championships."
"For legal reasons, the Parliamentary delegation to the conciliation accepted that this rule should not be compulsory in all Member States but that it would be optional for each State."
"The agreed text maintains the extraordinary character of events to be broadcast openly as an obligation, through national lists approved by the Commission."
"Precautions are set to guarantee the transparency of the procedure, with respect for all principles of Community law."
"In the Spanish case, however, the Government is proposing a law making football a more important general interest than education or health, banning the cable television broadcast of the regular club championship matches at weekends."
"This excessive rule was particularly unnecessary since Spain is one of the countries where it is easiest to see matches broadcast live on free television channels every weekend."
"This situation was guaranteed, at least until 2003, by agreements freely adopted by the various TV companies with broadcasting rights negotiated with the clubs."
"The provision contained in the Directive defends a balance between the different legal assets to be preserved."
"The right to receive information must be compatible with the rights of ownership and free competition between companies possessing broadcasting rights."
"But in the Aznar Government's law on football, it is possible to withdraw those rights retroactively and without compensation."
"It wants to force the various TV companies and clubs to break contracts reached freely so that a pro-Government company can take them over."
"This is an abuse of authority by an authoritarian government which has declared war on the digital TV sector in order to dominate it, expelling the current operators and imposing its monopoly with communication companies close to Mr Aznar."
"The Television without Frontiers Directive is being used in a wretched way in Spain in order to persecute opponents of the PP Government which are already being persecuted or threatened judicially by that government."
"Nothing like this has been seen in twenty years of Spanish democracy."
"Madam President, I shall be very brief because I do not want to enter into a national debate."
"This is the European Parliament and not the place for that type of speech."
"As far as I know, Madam President, lies are not accepted in any parliament."
"Madam President, the debate on the right to televise major sporting events, incorporated in the TV directive, has been good in principle, for it is important that everybody who wishes to do so should be able to follow major sporting events on television. It is also important for sporting discipline that they receive as much publicity as possible, since this will enable general interest in the sport to grow."
"There have, however, been clear shortcomings in the preparation of the directive."
"No consultation of sports organizations or competition organizers has taken place, or at least not very broadly."
"The influence of the directive on these very sporting organizations and competition organizers has not been adequately explained."
"The sale of TV rights is an important source of income for associations and clubs organizing sporting events."
"Copyright and the EU's principle of free competition should be taken into account in the televising of sports as of other events."
"Restricting the sale of TV rights may have serious consequences for sporting activity as a whole."
"The organization of major events particularly in Finland, where sporting activity is voluntary and Community based, would be made more difficult and might prove economically unviable."
"How can we compensate the organizers for this loss of income?"
"As a result of conciliation each Member State has to list the sporting events which must be transmitted publicly."
"This 'blacklist' can also include events taking place in another country."
"These events must therefore be broadcast freely to another country."
"Is not this an interference in the subsidiarity principle?"
"The listing of events is a difficult job."
"Moreover, it puts different sporting disciplines on an unequal footing."
"Which will be included on the list, and which not?"
"Which will be seen and which not?"
"This is a restriction of free competition in sport."
"There are other, better ways which can be found of guaranteeing that sporting events can be seen which will obtain the support of sports supporters fans and sporting organizations."
"Madam President, the interminable and heated discussion about this directive has not produced the desired result: obligatory quotas for broadcasting European programming as a condition for creating a genuine European audiovisual market, the result sought by the Commission, by the great majority of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media at first and second reading, by a large majority of this House, but not by the majority necessary at second reading, a proportion which is virtually impossible to reach on an issue involving so many contradictory interests."
"The position of the Committee on Culture was also unanimously supported by the European audiovisual sector, which gave evidence to Parliament several times."
"But it has not been a pointless battle, because a regulation to support the European cultural identity has been obtained. Although respect for the quotas set in the directive has not been made legally binding, two gains have been made: the establishment of the contact committee to monitor the implementation of standards, and a change in the public attitude to the problem."
"Today there is more awareness of the need for measures that can prevent the globalization of trade cancelling out cultural differences."
"Thanks to all this it will now be more difficult for public and private broadcasters to ignore the rules contained in the directive."
"So it is not the result we would have wanted, but it is a basis for further progress."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is pleased with the text which the Conciliation Committee has agreed on and which you are to vote on today."
"The Commission can only warmly recommend that you approve it."
"On the one hand, this text is the result of excellent cooperation between the institutions, and on the other it provides a new legal framework for television in Europe, a legal framework that is modern, improved, complete and clear."
"To those who work in this sector, it gives the conditions for legal certainty, which are necessary for the development of the sector."
"For European citizens, it ensures that the public interest is taken into consideration, which is so important to their daily lives."
"The Commission will supervise the complete application of the text, in all its parts, as it is required to do by the Treaty."
"It will also set up the so-called Contact Committee immediately, and support the Committee in carrying out its work."
"This Committee will be composed of representatives of the competent authorities in the Member States."
"Therefore, as has already been said in the course of the proceedings of the Conciliation Committee, the Commission wishes to confirm, yet again, that it is determined to ensure that the competent commission of the European Parliament is kept informed about the results of meetings of the Contact Committee, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form."
"Finally, on behalf of the Commission I should like to express my special gratitude to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, the rapporteurs, Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Hoppenstedt, and also successive Presidencies of the Council, for the excellent work that they have done, which has made it possible for us to achieve this result."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Health monitoring"
"The next item is the Report (A4-0202/97) by Mr Poggiolini, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision (C4-0204/97-95/0238(COD)) adopting a programme of Community action on health monitoring within the framework for action in the field of public health (1997-2001)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative journey of the programme of Community action on health monitoring concludes with this third reading."
"This is the fourth action programme in the field of public health to be launched by the European Union, a programme aimed at establishing a health monitoring system by collecting a wide range of data which the Member States will be able to use for setting up and evaluating national and Community health policies. So it is an important instrument, especially at this delicate stage in history when, to respect the Maastricht criteria for the single currency, all the Member States are occupied with the very serious problem of health expenditure, which has now become unsustainable."
"The optimal operation of such a health monitoring system will help define priorities, improve the viability of health systems by avoiding waste and consequently increase the effectiveness of health policies."
"I believe the European Parliament can feel satisfied, because the amendments it proposed are now an integral part of the legislative text, considerably improving the quality of the initial proposal presented by the Commission, and widening its scope."
"In the course of the two readings and the preparations for the Conciliation Committee, which included two trialogues, as fruitful as they were important, Parliament has succeeded in obtaining a good compromise agreement with the Council on almost all the technical amendments, relating in particular to three problems: the harmonization of data and indicators, the creation of a health observatory and the enlargement of the scope of the programme."
"As regards the harmonization of data and indicators, in fact, on the basis of an obstinately restrictive interpretation of article 129 of the treaty which, as everyone knows, excludes any harmonization of legislative and regulatory provisions, the Council even opposed harmonization of scientific language."
"But it did accept the word 'comparable' instead of the word 'harmonized' with reference to scientific data, and all legal quibbling aside, that was what we actually wanted to obtain."
"Then it was also felt that the words used about creating a European health observatory were too binding."
"Instead of 'observatory' , which may indeed evoke the idea of costly new agencies which Parliament does not want either, a feasibility study for a permanent structure for monitoring was obtained, which was precisely our purpose."
"Finally, we obtained enlargement of the scope of the programme, providing the possibility of cooperation with nongovernmental organizations, the support of the Member States and a precise date for the programme verification reports."
"But in the end the main bone of contention on the conciliation table turned out, as always, to be the funding. In Parliament's view such a programme ought to have had funding of ECU 20 million rather than the ECU 13.8 million included in the Commission's proposal for a decision."
"Well, the Council, demonstrating great parsimony, promptly cut the ECU 800, 000, arriving at a proposal of only ECU 13 million, a figure we considered inadequate."
"Parliament's delegation suggested a range of possible solutions, from reducing the duration of the programme to building in an extra amount, outside the programme, to be used by Eurostat for data collection."
"In the end Commissioner Flynn added to the Council's immovable position, by explicitly stating he was quite sure there was no need for the extra funding Parliament had been fighting for."
"In the end agreement was reached confirming the ECU 13.8 million for five years, but including two joint declarations which will be published in the Official Journal: one from the Commission, making the commitment to introduce actions in the health sector into the next statistical programme, for 1998-2000, in order to strengthen this programme; and another from the European Parliament, committing itself to supporting such action during the budgetary procedure."
"So some doubt remains as to the funding achieved, which may not be sufficient for the minimal threshold of effectiveness we consider necessary."
"The Commission does not harbour these doubts, and promises, if necessary, to use the 1998-2000 statistical programme as well."
"We shall watch and wait."
"The European Parliament delegation which conducted the conciliation takes note of the position and of the commitments made and, all in all, believes the result obtained is positive."
"It therefore recommends that the House approve the joint draft, recognizing the immense importance of this programme, which is fundamental to the success of all the current and future programmes in the area of public health."
"Madam President, Mr Poggiolini has made an excellent summary of the gist of his report, our initial intentions, our frustrations and the solutions found so that we can celebrate an important approval and so that my group can side with the Poggiolini recommendation, coinciding with it in that the European Parliament must vote for a resolution that is positive and even I would say, historic."
"This is the first time that, in health matters, there is to be a programme that consists in cooperation between the Member States, i.e. it is not just going to be the sum of the efforts by the 15 Member States but we are actually going to carry out Community-level monitoring, and there will be Community controls - I am not mincing my words - of all health parameters and health indices in the Member States."
"This will lead to a comparison, a criticism and procedures for improving public health which is, after all, what is important."
"I think that this programme is important and the result has been good thanks to the serenity and good work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Poggiolini, and also thanks to Mrs Fontaine's skills, as she firmly but courteously and admirably chaired the Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee."
"The free movement of persons, the physical disappearance of frontiers, the free circulation of services means that it is common sense for health to come within Community scope and, in that sense, many of us think that the Treaty on European Union should more explicitly turn health into a Community competence."
"Until that happens, I think that there are countries for which the terms of the Treaty on European Union are a trench where they hide and prevent harmonization taking place."
"How on earth can we manage when in some countries 'post-operative period' , for example, means three hours after the operation, in others one day, in others five hours, or when there are no common standards on 'neo-natal periods' , etc, etc!"
"At least unify the criteria - that is what we were after - on the basis of a few basic scientific data."
"I think that common sense is on our side."
"It is a fact that the term 'health observatory' has been avoided because the word has an overtone of supervision."
"That is not important, as long as there is a permanent structure where statistics can be pooled and studies from all Member States can be compared, and that is something e welcome. Good luck to everyone and let us formulate our proposal to the European Parliament so that it can vote for this report."
"Mr President, the collection and analysis of all health data is obviously a necessary condition for the promotion and actualization of the Community's competence in the field of health, as required by Article 129 of the Treaty on European Union, and for ensuring that Community programmes and actions in the field are structured in the best possible way."
"The European Parliament for its part has made clear its position that the protection of the health of Europe's citizens must be a main policy concern of the European Union."
"Monitoring of the health of the peoples of the Member States and of health indicators should therefore be a priority for the Community, and the establishment of a permanent system for the monitoring, evaluation and development of those indicators in the European Union will be an essential element in that regard."
"It is also obvious that precise knowledge concerning the development of health indicators in the Union will assist the determination of priorities and objectives in the public health field and the shaping of programmes."
"These actions should have been taken immediately after the adoption of Article 129."
"I recall also that the findings of the report of Parliament's committee on bovine spongiform encephalopathy revealed a glaring absence of effective monitoring of the development of very serious problems affecting public health when those problems were being created, and, of course, a lack of appropriate action."
"A system for coordinating the various measures for protection of the health of Europe's citizens is essential, therefore, even though it is late in coming."
"I find it hard to understand why the financial framework for this important programme is so meagre."
"We should not forget that the programmes that are devised, regardless of how important and detailed they are, may end up as texts in the eleven Community languages and make no effective contribution to public health in the Member States."
"The building of the Europe of the peoples quite clearly requires that particular attention be paid to issues of health, education, culture and the environment, and that spoken and written concern should be augmented by actions and bold funding initiatives to bring genuine change in the quality of life of Europe's citizens as a reflection of political will."
"I wish to thank Mr Poggiolini for his excellent report. We do have reservations about the financial framework but I hope that the House as a whole will give its approval to the report."
"Mr President, my colleague, Professor Cabrol, who followed the conciliation on the health programme, is unfortunately absent, and has asked me to speak on his behalf."
"The file on health surveillance includes two points which we see as essential, namely the harmonization of data and definitions concerning health and the creation of a European centre or agency for health, responsible for collecting and centralizing that data."
"The main aim of the health programme is to gauge the state of health and policy trends in this respect throughout the Community and to supply the Member States with appropriate health information that could enable them to make comparisons and support their national health policies."
"In order to be of use this data must be harmonized."
"The Council has accepted the idea of comparable data."
"We hope that that will suffice for a coherent health protection policy."
"The creation of a European observatory or agency responsible for collecting and centralizing data, monitoring the development of diseases and sounding the alarm in good time, has been repeatedly demanded by the European Parliament and Professor Cabrol in particular."
"That observatory or permanent structure as the Council calls it must cover various European health programmes and enable our fellow citizens to enjoy greater safety and avoid the serious mistakes that we have recently seen."
"Nonetheless the Council seems to be giving in little by little, since it has agreed in the conclusion text to consider setting up a permanent structure."
"This is a small step forward, nothing more, and this body is not yet ready to see light of day."
"We are voting for the joint project because the proposed programme is a real step forward for the health of our compatriots even though it is small, since we are starting from scratch."
"However, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall continue to demand the setting up of this permanent structure, whether it is called a European observatory or centre, since Europe absolutely needs an instrument that is efficient in terms of information, alerts and protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Liberal Group is quite happy with the outcome of the conciliation procedure, except for one point with which none of the Parliament delegation agreed, namely the size of the budget."
"Fortunately, we have a written undertaking from Commissioner Flynn to ensure that the next Community statistical programme devotes appropriate attention to the development of statistics on health monitoring."
"Parliament will be watching to ensure that the Commission carries out its promise."
"In the short term, developing statistics may seem a laborious and expensive task, but in the long run, accurate statistics can bring considerable savings and can teach us a great deal about developing an effective preventative health policy."
"Finally, I would urge that more work should be done with statistics broken down by sex, so that we can tailor policy more specifically."
"Mr President, in joining others in welcoming this compromise which our rapporteur is recommending tonight, I just wish to make three brief points."
"Firstly, on the outcome of the conciliation process itself: the deal which has been achieved is probably the best that Parliament could realistically hope to expect."
"On the most contentious points, namely the question of competence of data harmonization, the concept of an observatory and, most of all, the budgetary implications, the detailed work of the rapporteur and the negotiations undertaken by Mr Collins, as the relevant committee chairman, and others have borne fruit."
"The progress has perhaps not been as significant as some would have wished, but there are improvements to be celebrated nevertheless."
"My second observation is rather more of a query directed at the Commission as to how far we can view this as a reasonable precedent in cooperation in the field of public health."
"Having undertaken these negotiations over some broad principles of terminology and participation, it is reasonable to expect now a consistent approach to all aspects of health policy in the pipeline and to look for an effective approach across Commission directorates and portfolios when it comes to cooperation on research or economic, social and environmental policies, for example, which affect public health."
"That just does not apply to BSE, or internally, of course."
"We are all here aware of the importance of cooperation with the wider world, be it in liaison with the World Health Organization, UN agencies or third governments, particularly the United States."
"That leads to my final point, which is to urge that all the institutions learn the lessons of these carefully negotiated proposals in the discussions next week in Amsterdam."
"The Council seems to be poised to throttle the broad remit sought by the Commission in the field of public health and would doubtless follow that by a noose of budgetary restrictions."
"Yet there are strong demands from the public for action and international cooperation on health priorities, as the BSE fiasco showed, and this process has shown that there are imaginative proposals and policies available if the political will exists."
"As with so much in this field, these conclusions should be seen as just a start."
"Parliament will be keenly awaiting the agreed studies and will equally keenly want a positive approach from the Council and the Commission to reforms of the Treaty, notably Article 129, to continue the progress that this represents."
"Mr President, I too believe it is very positive that a common position has been reached on an important subject, which completes the group of health programmes."
"In fact monitoring is a fundamental instrument for checking whether the programmes the Community implements are effective in contributing to raising the protection of human health to a high level, guiding efforts to prevent disease, encouraging cooperation between the States, supporting their actions in this field and promoting coordination of policies."
"I would also like to dwell a few moments on the funding."
"The rapporteur, Mr Poggiolini, has already mentioned that the European Parliament felt ECU 13.8 million was inadequate because it was less than ECU 5 million a year."
"We think the Commission's proposal on this is rather inconsistent: inconsistent with the Commission's own stated position in its communication on legal bases and maximum sums, where it proposed that actions with amounts below ECU 5 million should not be given legal bases."
"Having said that, however, I do agree that this common position is an important step forward in the direction of improving and monitoring the health of European citizens, and I think we should vote for it."
"Mr President, health monitoring is of course an important field of activity within the framework of the Community objective of achieving a high level of health protection, as set out in Article 3 and Article 129."
"The exchange of opinions, the considerations and discussions, which have accompanied the tedious process of getting this programme accepted, have been extremely fruitful, and have led to definite improvements in the instruments used for health monitoring in the Community."
"The Commission takes the view that on the basis of this programme a valuable health information system for the Community can be built up, a system which will be very useful to the Member States and to the international organizations, in observing the state of our health and the ways in which it is changing."
"On behalf of the Commission I should like to thank the European Parliament for the support that it has given to this programme, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Poggiolini, for all his effort and hard work."
"I should also just like to say a few words about the conciliation process."
"Once again, each institution has made full use of its opportunities in order to ensure that the programme takes their particular interests into account."
"In this context, there are two particular points that the Commission would like to comment on."
"Firstly, there are the funds that have been set aside for this programme."
"I know that Parliament initially took the view that ECU 13.8 million would not be enough for such an important programme."
"In view of the important work involved in such a programme, there is something to be said for this point of view."
"However, I am convinced that it will be possible, even with the sum that has been proposed, to achieve the programme's objectives."
"In order to emphasize this point, I would add that the Commission, as long as it can count on the full support of the Council, will ensure that when the next statistical programme is implemented, special attention is given to extending the statistics in order to include health monitoring."
"Secondly, I should like to say something about the way in which the European Parliament will be kept informed about the implementation of this programme."
"I should like to emphasize that the inter-institutional modus vivendi for the implementation of legal acts, under Article 189(b) of the Treaty, which applies to this programme too, provides us with the conditions for ensuring that Parliament receives the information it needs."
"Moreover, as far as Article 5(4) of the Decision is concerned, which lays down that the Commission should keep the relevant committee regularly informed about decisions on individual projects, the Commission undertakes to make the same information available to the European Parliament too, on an annual basis."
"I hope that you will regard the findings of the conciliation process acceptable, and that the work that has been done here and in the other institutions will lead to the start of a programme that will be of great benefit to the health service and to the citizens of the Community in general."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon tomorrow."
"Noise policy"
"The next item on the agenda is the report, drawn up by Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the Green Paper on future noise policy (A4-0183/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I begin by saying that the urban culture of our century could partly be described as a culture of noise."
"Our fellow citizens' days and nights are becoming increasingly noisy."
"People's concerns over noise pollution, as we approach the third millennium, as shown by the latest surveys published by the Euro-barometer, are on the increase."
"Not only is noise people's fifth concern, but complaints in this environmental area are the only ones to have gone up in number since 1992."
"Commissioner, the truth is that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, whose rapporteur it is my honour to be, is not insensitive to that concern."
"Since 70 % of the European population lives with sound levels coming from a single source, namely road traffic, far higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization, one might think that people should be listened to more attentively."
"Especially since the twelfth section of the Fifth Action Programme on the Environment states that people should not be exposed to noise levels which jeopardize their health and their quality of life and set a series of measures and actions about whose accomplishment we knew nothing or very little when it was revised."
"If it is true, and it is in the view of our committee, that the European Union must become closer to the ordinary people, how can it be explained that the Commission omitted this from its 1996 work programme although it promised to present, in July of that year, a whole set of legislative measures on noise?"
"In other words: two framework directives and a communication."
"We are now debating a mere Green Paper which replaced, and it is important to stress this, the Commission's previous promise to introduce legislation for a programme which is obviously insufficient and, as we all know, is not binding at any stage."
"Obviously I have nothing against opening a debate in the European Union on noise pollution, involving the Commission, State authorities, local and regional authorities, experts, lawyers and citizens' movements."
"That would undoubtedly be extremely interesting and very positive; but given that seven in ten people are exposed to sound levels harming their health and quality of life, at levels far higher that those authorized by the WHO, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council should try and make it a top priority to take urgent action and set in motion, as promised, a set of practical measures in the form of an appropriate legal response to the problem."
"This debate and the programme are welcome, of course."
"But, nonetheless, our parliamentary resolution - and I cannot repeat this too often - is asking the Commission to present, this year, the announced legislation on the reduction of noise levels."
"That is what we want."
"I think this matter should be referred to your colleague, Mrs Bjerregaard, conspicuous by her absence this afternoon."
"I conclude, Mr President, by saying that we are only asking the Commission to do something as basic as honour its promise and for the Council to listen to this popular outcry against noise, never better expressed."
"If I may - and I would like to thank Mrs Graenitz - I should like to add a personal experience."
"Two months ago I had to have an operation for a serious complaint."
"The hardest thing to put up with was not the pain, but the noisy traffic at night, dust-carts collecting rubbish, ambulance sirens."
"It is impossible, Commissioner, to rest when you have to put up with an atrocious nightmare of noise."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the Community and Member States need the most accurate and detailed information available concerning the real costs and consequences of noise if they are to develop an integrated strategy for combating it."
"For this reason the Community should, on the one hand, develop a uniform methodology for measuring and evaluating noise which can then be uniformly implemented by the Member States and, on the other, launch general guidance and technical aid initiatives in respect of the Member States to organize research, exchanges of information and public awareness campaigns, and also to monitor the implementation of the measures."
"As you know, there exists no Community legislation at present fixing permissible noise emission levels from industrial installations, even though most Member States impose limits on noise levels in industrial regions."
"Measures to combat noise at source mean an additional cost for industry which has to adapt to new specifications."
"On the other hand, industry should bear in mind that noise is one of the five main sources of annoyance which erode the quality of life, behind environmental pollution, which are attributed to industry and damage its image among the public and consumers."
"Consequently noise abatement is in the interests of industry."
"No one should expect the adoption of strict measures to produce immediate results."
"Society and industry need at least a decade of planning and adjustment until the positive results are measurable."
"The costs will have to be shared out gradually so as not to impose a disproportionate burden on the state, industry or citizens."
"It is self-evident that Community policies within the framework of the various action programmes and initiatives on environmental, transport, regional, industrial and social policy must be coordinated so that the problem of noise can be addressed in a multi-faceted and, consequently, more effective manner."
"I must say that I am surprised that the Committee on Transport has not wished to submit an opinion on the Green Paper, even though the matter touches directly on air and land transport."
"Lastly, Mr President, I believe that the Member States must address the problem of noise, in cooperation with industry, in a planned and responsible manner, given that the cost of such an exercise is not excessive, while an improvement in working conditions and in the quality of life of citizens will lead in the long term to a reduction of costs and benefit society as a whole."
"Mr President, I have little to add, as Mrs Díez de Rivera's report is so excellent and so complete that it says it all, and I support everything in it."
"It is good to begin with a Green Paper, and it is good that we are opening a debate, but if we know anything it is the cause of noise; most people, when inquiries are held into environmental problems, complain about noise."
"However, we must now reduce noise, not only industrial noise but also the main problem: vehicles and road traffic."
"As draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I am going to refer to that subject."
"Measures were taken in the Third and Fourth Programmes in the framework of research to reduce, within the telematics and materials programme, the noise produced by equipment, but that is not enough. Much more still has to be done."
"In industry, the main areas have to be distinguished."
"Heavy industry does not pose a problem because it is confined to large, enclosed areas, and the noise does not reach the outside; the noise problem in those industries is one of health and safety at work, the prevention of work-related risks and there is legislation on all of that; we are not therefore going to look at that subject."
"Small industries in urban estates are quite another thing, small workshops, etc, which are an extraordinary nuisance for local inhabitants; another major nuisance is discotheques, ambulances, road traffic and the lack of education and consideration towards one's neighbours."
"In the research programme, we are asking the Commission to call on the European Committee on Standardization to set new standards for the European Union on the noise produced by different groups or activities."
"There are various programmes that could be included in the Fifth Programme, and that would be an interesting task."
"We also think that, when measuring noise, we should not only set standards but actually take action to reduce the noise made by refrigerators, air-conditioners, building machinery - especially the latter."
"Europe is an old continent where construction work is going on all the time and the sound of building sites is quite unbearable, as well as the traffic noise mentioned by the rapporteur; that noise should be limited."
"Large and small industries should be legally required - not voluntarily, because then they would do nothing or take ineffectual action - to implement a noise limitation plan, just as they are obliged - although few do so - to limit waste production."
"I think that this, whether or not included in the environmental management plan, would be a major step forward."
"It would also be necessary to take noise into account far more when building new rail networks, new roads and new vehicles."
"Congratulations to Mrs Díez de Rivera."
"We all agree that this is a first step down a road where progress has to be made."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we subjected our eyes to light in the same intensity as we subject our ears to noise, then we should all go blind immediately."
"Yet in spite of this, the question of noise is one that is repeatedly and controversially debated, even though noise is one of the most severe forms of environmental pollution, and although, in many of the European Union's environmental programmes - most recently in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme - specific reference is made to the fact that reducing and combatting noise is an important measure in maintaining human health, and that health is very badly affected by noise."
"Mrs Diez de Rivera Icaza, whom I should like to thank most warmly for her report, and to whom I should like to say that I am happy that able to discuss it with her, has set out many of these points, in very precise terms, in her report."
"The most important thing is that the Commission's Green Paper should be followed by legislation, so that this framework legislation for noise protection, which was part of the Commission's programme for last year, can finally be put into place, because I believe it is necessary for you to do something about it."
"No doubt much of what our citizens experience as noise does not fall within the competence of the Union."
"But then, people are not asking who is responsible for the noise, or which legislative body is responsible for controlling noise."
"They are much more interested in getting noise brought under control."
"Therefore we must do something."
"By all means let us bring in subsidiarity, but we really must take some sort of action."
"I believe that the issues that have been touched on here - aircraft noise, street noise, railway noise - can be tackled by a variety of methods, that it is essential to set noise limits for tools and machinery, and that we need to make more progress in research."
"We have plenty of research programmes on the subject of noise, and it is time something was happening here."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza."
"I am very grateful to have the opportunity to speak to her today and to see that she has recovered sufficiently to attend."
"One of the oldest types of environmental nuisance is actually not noise but smell, though smell is a very subjective term, so I prefer to call it odour."
"Even with perfumes, if you do not like them, they are not a pleasant smell, they are an odour."
"And this is one of the oldest pieces of environmental legislation that we have in Europe."
"The legislation on noise is different, although it exists in most Member States, and noise is something that can actually be harmful to health, which is why it is essential for us to do something about it."
"The purpose of the Green Paper is to see first of all whether we can reach agreement amongst ourselves."
"We need to determine the areas in which we feel that common agreements should be reached in Europe."
"We all agree that noise pollution is something we need to clamp down on."
"What is the Community interest in combating noise pollution?"
"The Community element comes into play as regards distortion of competition in the Community."
"Looking at the Green Paper, I note that it talks about low-noise aircraft, and it says that we need to change the sort of tyres we produce in Europe to help reduce tyre noise. But there is no mention of Community zones or any kind of agreements on the subject, which means that it could happen - and there are precedents for this - that a regional airport is turned down in one Member State but allowed in another which has less strict requirements, and is then built six miles from the border, so that the first Member State still suffers from the noise pollution anyway."
"So I think that in calling on the Commission to do something about noise pollution, we need to look first of all at equipment and machinery, and we also certainly need some sort of framework legislation to cover everything that distorts competition."
"I am thinking here of airport zones, high-speed trains and major motorways."
"For the rest, I think we must assume that things can be dealt with at national or regional level."
"Mr President, noise pollution is a problem that needs attention at European level, I think we would all agree."
"But we must be careful to take account of the principle of subsidiarity when it comes to deciding on measures to be taken."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten talked about airport zoning and aircraft engines, and these are indeed issues that have a cross-border impact and should be dealt with at European level."
"But we must also ensure that the measures which should be taken at national and regional level in accordance with subsidiarity are indeed implemented."
"Mrs Díez de Rivera's excellent report contains a number of extremely good proposals, such as the development of common measurement methods in Europe, for which the Environment Agency needs to collect information throughout the Union."
"Public information is another good idea. We already have several directives on noise pollution from specific sources, such as aircraft, construction equipment and so on, and we have already debated noise pollution from engines."
"So in other words there is already a good deal happening in this field, and we in the Liberal Group rather doubt whether we really need a framework directive as well."
"We therefore reject paragraph 23 which calls for framework legislation in the Green Paper, and we would prefer to tackle whatever needs to be done at European level and leave everything else to local, regional and national level, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"That is the Liberal Group's position on Mrs Díez de Rivera's excellent report."
"Mr President, it is not just urban culture which has become a culture of noise, as our excellent rapporteur says; these days tourism, chiefly mass tourism, particularly in coastal areas, is also a culture of noise."
"The people of the European Union go on holiday in their millions and encounter one lot of noise after another."
"During the day from various engine-propelled craft on the sea and at night from extremely noisy entertainment centres. Both sources are regarded as attractive to tourists and are thus a focus of competition for profit."
"Of course, such competition is very damaging to tourists and their health, and in the end it always destroys the tourism itself."
"That, Mr President, is why I think we should persist in demanding the formulation, in serious terms, of course, of a common policy which will take account of the interests of the millions of European citizens who go on holidays, establish permissible noise levels and curb competition based on noise. In the final analysis that will probably benefit the very people who generate all the noise at tourism undertakings."
"Mr President, first of all I too would like to compliment Mrs Diez de Rivera Icaza on her excellent report, because it is a document which finally clarifies the impact of the noise problem on all European citizens."
"A high proportion of the population of Europe is now forced to live with dangerous noise levels, and we cannot ignore that fact."
"Faced with a lack of legislation either at Community level or, often, at Member State level, we certainly cannot be satisfied with a Green Paper without precise commitments to ensure that in the near future we will finally have standards adequate to deal with the problems of all the citizens who face this situation."
"Now we all know that the effects of noise strike at several levels."
"It has a direct effect at the physiological level, but it also acts directly on living conditions, psychological well-being, and the very bio-rhythms of individuals."
"As the rapporteur said, the problem of noise at night is particularly dangerous, as it makes sleep impossible, and sleep is an important physiological function, vital to the life of each individual."
"Not being able to sleep properly actually changes a person's life radically."
"That is why it is important to have regulations banning night flights at airports or only allow them if there are no homes in the neighbourhood and no-one can suffer serious damage."
"The Committee on Petitions has received many petitions on this problem."
"In general it can be said that much of the noise, though certainly not all, is linked to transport."
"That is why the report lays great stress on this point, and I would also like to mention that it is particularly important for the new transeuropean network projects to take account of the possible increases in noise that could derive from them - I refer especially to the problem of high velocity trains."
"So I hope that approval of this report can finally push the Commission into raising the standards to a satisfactory level and giving us appropriate provisions on the matter."
"Mr President, the European Union has been very reluctant to introduce rules on noise pollution up to now, which I can quite understand, since noise problems are usually localized issues."
"But there are certain European aspects."
"Take the noise regulations for products such as cars and lawnmowers, for example, or the transfrontier noise pollution caused by having a motorway or airport right by a border."
"It seems strange that people laugh about lawnmowers and ask if we have nothing better to do in Europe, but I think that these are exactly the kind of issues that should be regulated at European level."
"The Commission remains very reticent in its Green Paper, and rightly so, in my view."
"Most noise pollution problems are local issues and can best be resolved at local level, so the Commission is simply showing common sense in putting forward a limited number of specific measures."
"What is the point of trying to regulate all sorts of issues in European directives if nothing changes in practice because the Council does not wish to tie its own hands?"
"I think that setting limit values to be applied throughout the Union simply will not work."
"It is simply making environmental planners responsible for doing the impossible."
"But there are still the proposals in the Commission's Green Paper: better harmonization of the methods for evaluating noise pollution, a directive laying down fiscal measures to combat noise pollution from road traffic, and an approach on train and aircraft noise and noise from equipment used outdoors."
"The Díez de Rivera report adds a number of recommendations here which I am quite happy to support, since they are all excellent ideas on noise abatement."
"The only thing with which I cannot agree is that all this should be covered by a framework directive, complete with limit values to be applied by the environmental planners."
"The Union really would be biting off far more than it could chew there."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, noise is a significant environmental problem, and with the rapid development of technology it will soon be one of the most serious."
"The Commission's Green Paper is an important advance. I would, however, like to see it developed into a framework directive."
"The report of our excellent and experienced rapporteur Carmen Díez de Rivera Icaza covers the subject comprehensively and I agree with everything that it says."
"Nevertheless, there are a few points that I think deserve special mention."
"Noise pollution is a phenomenon of the modern age."
"It is now quite common to hear people complaining about noise of one form or another."
"It not just aircraft noise, which has very rightly been highlighted, and noise from factories that we are talking about."
"There are also the incessant noises of everyday life which though less intense are a source of nuisance and damage human beings without being directly noticed."
"There is a need for strict specifications to be imposed on major construction projects because we are seeing more and more instances of motorways being built near to residential areas."
"Likewise areas of housing in the vicinity of airports seem to be expanding all the time."
"I believe that we have a duty to examine this whole matter and to tackle it comprehensively."
"In addition, I think it is very important that research be carried out on the quality of materials used for soundproofing so as to ensure that the products used are environmentally friendly."
"Lastly, I think it essential that the specifications to be imposed for various forms of noise should take account of climatic factors in the Member States, given the differences between the north and the south."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, noise is classified nuisance number one by most Europeans and nearly 70 % of them have their quality of life affected by noise."
"Over 20 % European suffer from diseases linked to excessive noise levels."
"I am an ear, nose and throat specialist, specializing in deafness and I can tell you that the number of complaints and cases of deafness linked to noise increase from year to year, as the WHO report quite rightly points out."
"The non-auditive consequences of noise should also be dealt with, especially the effects on sleep, work performance, schooling, medical consultations (their number), the consumption of tranquillizers and even neuroleptic drugs."
"History has shown for thousands of years that man can adapt but that adaption has a price and, so far, most national governments and the Community has reacted too little."
"Legislation is insufficient, still."
"It is high time for the European Union to take full stock of the size of the problem and turn the fight against noise into a priority."
"It must go beyond general - albeit generous - intentions to improve matters."
"It must set a precise timetable, with common maximum levels, if we are to stop this scourge from spreading."
"Research must be encouraged."
"I turn to Mrs Cresson, so that she can provide us with the necessary standards."
"Current noise standards do not match the physiological reality."
"We need a strict timetable, with updates standards and the European Union must carry out regular checks and impose sanctions in cases of violations."
"The relationship between noise and health is extremely complex."
"If we make clear commitments, take concrete actions and show strong political will, we shall be offering all European the protection they are asking for."
"I therefore approve this report which must be an opportunity for the European Parliament to express to the Commission the high expectations of European citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel most strongly that we need a stricter European approach on noise pollution from aircraft and the upward harmonization of noise standards, as proposed by the rapporteur in paragraph 29."
"At the moment, it is only the larger and more competitive airports that are able to impose stricter standards and refuse to handle noisy aircraft."
"Smaller airports that have to fight to stay profitable impose as few requirements as possible, and thus become the Mecca for all the old and noisy aircraft which larger airports will no longer tolerate."
"Take Ostend airport in my own country."
"The quality of life in the area around Ostend is being seriously undermined by the fact that this airport does not impose strict standards, which apparently only apply at Zaventem."
"Finally, I also think it is important, as the rapporteur says in paragraph 8, for noise prevention and repression to be included with other environmental standards as a prerequisite for approving the funding of projects by the Structural Funds."
"Mr President, I am fully behind the Díez de Rivera report, a magnificent report on the rules to be applied as quickly as possible."
"Noise pollution is, along with atmospheric pollution, the major problem facing cities and it is lowering the quality of life in our towns and cities."
"I come from Valencia, one of Europe's noisiest cities, mainly due to traffic and socalled 'pleasure-related' noise."
"If we produced a noise map of Europe, as I hope we do, then Valencia would definitely be one of its blackspots."
"As the rapporteur said, road traffic, building work and industry can disturb and upset the normal functioning of city life."
"We all have examples near us of how noise affects us every day."
"Our cities are noisy, above recommended levels, and the need to draft a Community framework directive that will be binding, and to implement measures and actions at national and local level, is an urgent matter."
"Not only must we deal with noise but with road traffic as a whole, encouraging public transport and a planning policy that favours functionality and not speculation."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur personally for illustrating her report with letters from our Noble Prizewinner for Literature, Juan Ramón Jiménez, who was one of this century's first famous people to complain about noise."
"If only, seventy years on, we only had to complain at night of crickets and pianolas and did not have to tell the Commission that this is an urgent question and one of prime concern for all our citizens."
"Mr President, the Commission Green Paper on future noise policy contains many important and correct considerations on the noise problems we experience in our daily lives."
"In particular, I note with satisfaction that the Commission pays special attention to noise nuisance from road traffic, which is absolutely the most disagreeable source of noise in Europe."
"I welcome the Commission's decision to replace its original idea of committing the individual Member States to common legislation in the area with a noise abatement programme."
"Indeed the prevailing view in Denmark is that it makes sense to solve noise problems at national level."
"In this way we have managed to deal with all major noise problems in an exemplary manner."
"We have an exceedingly efficient system of planning legislation which ensures the rational planning of the physical landscape with respect for human needs."
"This is done in the best democratic fashion through a dialogue with local agencies in the local environment."
"Also, Danish citizens, who are manifestly experiencing nuisance from traffic noise, can get the State to foot the bill for the sound insulation of their houses."
"Our international airport at Kastrup, in cooperation with the Folketing, has introduced a full landing ban on especially noisy aircraft during the hours of night, and is moreover currently one of Europe's quietest airports."
"With the greatest respect for the impressive and brilliant work done by Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza, I cannot support the parts of the resolution calling for common framework legislation."
"Overall, I can give heartfelt support to the other proposals, and I will wait to see whether the close national monitoring called for by the resolution actually takes place."
"The splendid analytical section of the Green Paper gives a good description of the noise nuisances we are subjected to today and can serve as a powerful incentive to this monitoring process."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza for her passionate pursuit of the noise issue, despite her illness."
"I welcome the overdue Green Paper on noise because nearly seven out of ten people in Europe are subjected to noise levels higher than those recommended for health."
"The main culprits as we know are excessive road traffic and aircraft noise, amongst other things."
"Despite often being seen as a local issue there are huge costs to European society and to business of stress-related illnesses to which noise is a big contributory factor."
"In urban environments we usually find that it is the poorer citizens and the poorer districts where people have to live or work near big, noisy, polluting roads."
"It is high time that this problems was tackled much more efficiently than we have been able to do so far."
"My constituents in London also suffer the problems of sleep disturbance caused by early morning flights at Heathrow Airport and I hope Parliament's call for a ban on night flights will be acted upon before my citizens' lives are made even more miserable with the increase to air traffic which is likely to result from Terminal 5."
"The issues called for in the Green Paper are all very fine: measurement, the information exchanges, the noise mapping."
"Parliament agrees with all those things."
"But we also must have a proper framework directive on noise reduction and we ask the Commission not to delay but to come forward with this as a matter of urgency for the sake of the health of all our citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I say anything about the Green Paper and about Parliament's position, I should like to express my pleasure in the fact that the rapporteur, Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza, is with us once more."
"I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur most warmly on her excellent report."
"The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for its comprehensive contribution to the debate on future noise protection policy, which of course I shall be analysing in depth."
"Once thing that particularly impressed us was the large number of measures demanded in the resolution, which makes it clear how important it is to develop a coherent strategy for our future noise-protection policy."
"In the Commission's opinion, the broad consultation that its Green Paper has stimulated will provide a solid basis for the drafting of measures to combat noise."
"In the mean time, the Commission has received 175 written contributions, and has organized numerous conferences on the aspects touched on in the Green Paper, which may also supply the Commission with important information."
"The comments reinforce the Commission's view that a comprehensive noise-protection strategy is necessary, and that it must include all levels of government, from local authorities to European institutions."
"Many municipal authorities have given us their opinions on the Green Paper, and this is in line with the concept of shared responsibility, whereby all those involved must work together to achieve a common objective."
"All the contributions are currently being collated and evaluated by our staff, and are accessible via EUROPA, the Commission's internet server."
"The Commission is convinced that this report, and the resolution that we presume will result from it, can make a valuable contribution to the success of our policy and to the achieving of our common objective - to protect our citizens from noise that harms their health and interferes with their lives."
"We are aware of the fact that our Green Paper has given rise to great expectations on the part of those of our citizens who are exposed to noise pollution, and we must not disappoint those expectations."
"Mr President, I hold the Commissioner in great esteem, so I mean no disrespect when I ask why Mrs Bjerregaard is not here."
"We have also not had a clear answer from the Commissioner on whether or not there is to be a framework directive."
"If there is, when is it likely to appear?"
"I should like to have a rather more detailed response to the excellent report by my colleague, and to hear it from the Commissioner who is responsible for this dossier."
"Mr President, Mr Eisma, I am sorry, but unfortunately I am unable to say why Mrs Bjerregaard cannot be with us today, because I do not know."
"I can promise you, however, that I will pass on to her, word for word, the point that you have raised, and I hope that she will then react accordingly."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the Commissioner for his good wishes and the fifteen or more speakers in this debate."
"I too, you may recall, regretted the conspicuous absence of the Commissioner responsible for this matter."
"I hope Mr Fischler will pass on to her, with the same passion as Mr Eisma just now, our demand and the fact that we are not satisfied with the good words and more than 170 responses from the whole Union."
"Commissioner, recognizing your insistence, we ask you, please, to give us this year the legislation promised in 1996, and thank you for your good wishes."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Díez de Rivera."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon tomorrow."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.00 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"To clarify the Minutes, Mr President, my group would like you to invite Mr Sorgdrager, as President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers of Justice, to make a statement to Parliament concerning the 368 cancelled provisions."
"This invitation is a point of order."
"Was it just the previous Dutch Government that was so negligent, or has the same thing happened in other Member States?"
"Mr President, in yesterday's Minutes my name is not recorded as being here."
"That is not a fault of the parliamentary secretariat; unfortunately it is my mistake."
"I came down to sign in about 8.30 p.m. only to find that the session was over."
"Would it be possible to record my presence here yesterday?"
"Subject to approval by the Quaestors, Yes."
"It is not a point of order Mr President, it is on the Minutes."
"It is on the first page of the Minutes, the point made by Mr Macartney on Norwegian salmon."
"Mr Macartney and I, at the sitting of 29 May, raised the question of whether the Commission would be prepared to make a statement about the agreement which it was negotiating and which this House had not seen."
"We raised it again yesterday."
"The President said he would ask the Commission."
"I want to know whether Sir Leon Brittan, who has been the invisible man in this case as far as Parliament is concerned, if his services or if the Commission have come back to the President and said when they are prepared to make a statement on this Norwegian salmon issue."
"It is a very serious issue for Scotland and Ireland and many other states of the European Union."
"It raises a very serious principle in that a non-member state such as Norway is getting better treatment than the Union itself."
"To the best of my knowledge, the answer is No, the Commission has not yet come back."
"Mr President, I should like to refer to the subject of item 6, paragraph 4, of the Minutes, on the membership of Parliament."
"It says that the President announced that four of our colleagues had been appointed as members of the French Government and that pursuant to Article 12 of the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by universal suffrage, Parliament established these vacancies."
"This is incorrect given that the French Constitution lays down a 30-day period for (MPs and) MEPs invited to join the government to decide whether to remain MEPs or accept ministerial responsibility."
"It is therefore not correct to establish these vacancies but we should wait, in accordance with the French Constitution, for them to decide, i.e. for thirty days."
"As you know, European law is of a higher order than national law and European law on direct elections says that when you are elected to one of the other institutions, you cease to be a member of the previous institution of which you were a member."
"So whatever French law says, the European law is clear and their resignations have to be accepted."
"It concerns the Minutes, Mr President."
"I have no point to make on the Minutes because I cannot get a copy - they have not produced enough."
"Can you ask them in future to produce enough copies so that we can all look at them, rather than the first few people in the queue?"
"We will do that but one way of stopping points of order on the Minutes is not to distribute them."
"Mr President, could I follow on the statement yesterday from Mr Macartney and today from Mr McMahon and ask if you, Sir, will personally ask Commissioner Leon Brittan to come here, given that he seems to have got his way against the wishes of the Commissioner for Fisheries, the Committee on Fisheries, and indeed the Commission."
"And in view of the fact that there is at stake a fragile industry in Scotland and Ireland, a whole industry in the most fragile areas."
"The agenda is a matter for the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, I wish to make a point concerning Question Time."
"At the last plenary I put a question that was not reached and had therefore to be answered in writing."
"My question concerned the then forthcoming Council meeting on 26 May."
"I received an answer yesterday, dated 4 June, and I must protest about that."
"I would ask that, in future, answers be sent out immediately."
"You have protested but, in fact, we are on the Minutes."
"Mr President, although I took part in yesterday's vote, I omitted to sign in, thus neglecting the second most important duty of a Member."
"Could I ask you to add my name to the list of Members present?"
"Again, subject to the approval of the Quaestors."
"Mr President, I am afraid to say that I did sign the voting list."
"Really I was making a point of order on page 17 of the Minutes."
"Yesterday we discussed whether my report should be dealt with at a later date."
"I asked the President if I could speak on it."
"I have pressed the button and it appears that it does now work but yesterday it failed to work."
"We have an electronic system and I think we should use it; we should not need to stand up and flail our arms about like windmills."
"I would very much have liked to have spoken on that particular position yesterday."
"I am told that you should also press the button."
"This is useful because as people no longer sit in allocated seats, we then know their names."
"It is also useful to raise your hand."
"Mr President, I am reluctant to take the floor but it is in response to something you said..."
"... in answer to an earlier question."
"You said: ' the agenda is a matter for the Conference of Presidents.'"
"The agenda is for the Conference of Presidents to recommend but always for this House to decide."
"You are quite right but the Conference of Presidents makes the initial recommendation and the House approved the agenda on Monday at 5 o'clock."
"It is now Tuesday in case people have not noticed."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"The week before last three Members of this Parliament - Angela Billingham, Edward McMillan-Scott and myself - wrote to the President's Office to ask for urgent action to be taken on behalf of a number of citizens whose properties in Spain have been wrongly seized by banks - one of those citizens being my own constituent, Mr Frank Clark."
"We have had no reply as such from your office - no doubt due to an oversight."
"I would ask that your office help us to urgently respond and to show how this institution can be a defender and fighter for our citizens' rights where wrongs have taken place, particularly in an area which is part of the single market and European citizenship."
"We ask for your assistance on that case."
"Mr President, I rise to confirm what has just been said by Mr Teverson."
"I am sorry that Edward McMillan-Scott is not in the Hemicycle this morning because he has been dealing with this matter for over 15 years."
"A bad situation is now a desperate situation, with properties actually being sold as we speak."
"We have asked for intervention."
"It would appear that the Spanish authorities are running rings around the European laws and this is a quite disgraceful state of affairs."
"I seek the assistance of the President and of all our colleagues in this Hemicycle."
"I will ask the President to draw this matter to the attention of the Spanish authorities."
"Decision on urgency"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have received an urgent request to supply macrofinancial aid to Bulgaria and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"However, the Committee on External Economic Relations, which is responsible for this dossier, has not yet had the chance to consider it, and this has also meant, of course, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has not been able to deliver its opinion either."
"These are politically sensitive situations in which we would normally make macrofinancial aid dependent on a number of conditions, and I would therefore feel it a great pity if it were to be rushed through the Committee on External Economic Relations this week and then voted on without a debate."
"I think it would be perfectly feasible to deal with it at the July part-session instead, so it should be put on hold until Parliament has the chance to say what it thinks, as indeed it should."
"I give the floor to the Commission to defend the proposal if it so wishes."
"Mr President, the Commission wishes to insist on the request for an emergency procedure."
"As far as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, the International Monetary Fund and the World Ban have now agreed to throw their full support behind that government's economic policy."
"It is important for the European Union to take part in that movement, and I would add that there are pressing needs for external financing in that country and that if we want to be able to support it in the adaptation of its economic policy, given the instability of the region and the low level of reserves, we should respond alongside the Monetary Fund and the World Bank."
"The same is true of Bulgaria: may I remind you that that country's situation is extremely fragile, especially concerning the level of its reserves."
"It also has a very large foreign debt vis-à-vis the European Union."
"At the European Parliament's own request in its resolution of 10 April last, on humanitarian aid for Bulgaria, the Commission - along with the Council - was urged to take the measures needed to help the Bulgarian Governments in its fight against the current serious economic crisis."
"That is why it is important for the Commission that the European Parliament should be able to vote in favour of the emergency procedure on these two issues."
"Mr President, I have listened to the Commissioner but allow me to say that the situation in Bulgaria, as anyone who has visited that country will have noted, is such that we cannot not permit something that is absolutely vital to enabling that country to return to the path of good economic policy to be held up for bureaucratic and procedural reasons."
"Now we find that the Committee on External Relations has not discussed the matter."
"It must convene a special meeting to discuss it because the problem besetting Bulgaria is actual, not bureaucratic."
"If we delay for too long all of the work being done in conjunction with the IMF and, to some degree, with the World Bank will be destroyed."
"If the committee cannot meet I do not think that we should sit on our hands and let those people wait for things that are crucially important to the survival of the Bulgarian state just because of that."
"Mr President, I would just like to make it clear that the reason why the Committee on External Economic Relations has not dealt with this problem is the delay in consulting us. As a matter of fact we are not usually consulted at all."
"This is a very serious matter, which affects everything in these agreements. That is the simple reason why this has not happened."
"So we do find ourselves in a very embarrassing situation and we would really like a remedy to be found."
"Lots of Members are asking to speak but the Rules are clear."
"There should be one speaker for, one speaker against plus the Commission or the committee chair if appropriate."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Mr President, excuse my lateness."
"I see, however, that my name is not on the list of members present. I was here yesterday and signed in various committees."
"I hope that this mistake, for which I am to blame, will be corrected."
"We shall check that out."
"European Monetary Institute (EMI annual report - Monetary policy) - Budgetary and taxation policy - VAT"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0194/97 by Mr Mezzaroma, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the 1996 annual report of the European Monetary Institute (C4-0175/97); -A4-0185/97 by Mr Ettl, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the European Monetary Institute's report on Single Monetary Policy in Stage Three - specification of the operational framework (C4-0043/97); -A4-0192/97 by Mr Fourcans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the coordination of budgetary and taxation policy in the Monetary Union; -A4-0164/97 by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a common system of VAT - a programme for the single market (COM(96)0328 - C4-0458/96)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, a thank you to those who helped me complete this report."
"I also want to congratulate Mr Lamfalussy on setting up the EMI and quickly making it operational, carrying out so effectively the tasks conferred on him by the treaty and, throughout his term of office, demonstrating an independent and open-minded approach and a willingness for dialogue as testified to by the highly satisfactory relationship he established with our institution in spite of the limits imposed by the treaty."
"The purpose of the annual EMI report is to review all aspects of the tasks conferred on him by the treaty."
"The analysis looks at the economic, monetary and financial situation in the European Union, including the degree of economic and institutional convergence in the individual Member States, the preparatory work for stage three and the other activities of the EMI, especially as regards cooperation between the central banks, and, finally, the annual accounts in accordance with article 11 of its statutes."
"That covers the technical side."
"But in my view this House also needs to make a political assessment."
"The single currency presupposes holding individual national public debt in common and also presupposes equilibrium of balances of payments between individual Member States."
"But how can monetary union be achieved unless there is political union first?"
"I do not think there is a single example of a monetary union that survived without political union."
"In the sixth century BC the Greek cities set up a monetary union, but it lasted three or four years and then collapsed."
"More recently, the Latin monetary union between France, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium also failed, as did the Scandinavian one, because there was no political union."
"The United States made the dollar a single currency, but it preceded that with political union, with the Declaration of Independence."
"Bismarck created the gold mark after first unifying the German states politically; the monetary laws followed."
"A united Europe presupposes a single state, hence a parliament with legislative power and a government with executive power."
"Then the currency can work!"
"So an effort must be made in Amsterdam to develop the political bases of the European Union, the necessary economic, fiscal, financial and above all social convergence must be achieved, qualitative convergence parameters and not quantitative ones, including equilibrium of balances of payments and convergence of interest rates."
"The Commission has lately set out the framework for the convergence parameters, superseding those drawn up by the EMI."
"These new data have unleashed total uproar in the Member States: some had thought they were top of the class, some had thought they were at the bottom, and others were limping along, desperately trying not to die before the finishing line."
"Now who can say which will be in and which will be out?"
"Europe is constantly changing: economic, financial and political scenarios of individual nations change, and that changes even the most solid situations."
"One thing is certain: Europe today is experiencing a moment of weariness."
"More than anything, if Europe means being afflicted with new burdens, heavy taxation or economic and financial alchemy, they do not want to be part of it. it is true that structural reforms are needed to achieve a single currency, but they must preserve solidarity with the weakest citizen."
"It is no longer possible to assume that the free market can get everything right, as witness the depression of the Twenties and Thirties."
"Europe today needs to develop, to work."
"Our great problem today is unemployment. There is no work."
"The welfare of the world has to depend on work and on hope for development whereby people can rediscover themselves, and if the technological innovation produced by the information revolution also brings an increasing number of jobs, Europe will be able to compete on culture, education, professionalism, sport, tourism, environment, services, the restructuring of the territory and the development of public and private works geared to transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure."
"Let us make our cities more beautiful, let us make rural areas better places to live, let us make room for the cohesion process, so necessary to unite the citizens in a great movement capable of integrating traditions, languages, affections and - why not? - spreading our cultures to the rest of the world."
"Now is the time to have the courage to spend more, to make economic and social investments, to go out into the world with the accumulated experience of hundreds of years - experience such as no other continent possesses - to aim straight for the heart of development through research."
"Money was invented by man and man has become its slave."
"Europe must make a great effort to use this means of exchange only to guarantee the welfare of the people and not be overwhelmed by it."
"The EMI should make way for the Central Bank."
"I hope we are all aware that we need to arrive at 1999 with clear ideas, so that we are not overwhelmed by an institution which should be at the service of the citizens and which, if left alone, would be a state within the state, able to regard the European citizen as a means of developing Europe."
"This is the scenario spread out before us today, considering the deadlines, analyzing the situation and reading the EMI report."
"My best wishes to President Lamfalussy and I wish the new president every success even though, unfortunately, the road he must travel is still very uncertain."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish particularly to make the point that these reports on the introduction of the euro call both for employment policy and for the democratic rights of the European Parliament to participate and exercise supervision to be taken properly into account."
"I am also grateful for the preparatory work that was done by the European Monetary Institute and its president, Mr Lamfalussy, as this will provide a sound basis on which to build further, However, recent developments illustrate just how critical the situation is."
"The position of France has shed light on a number of things and is a warning to us to proceed with particular caution."
"The fact is that every economic and monetary policy measure must be geared to citizens."
"We need a socially responsible Europe and not a Europe founded on capital alone because capital alone undermines positive integration - and I mean capital alone, please do not misunderstand me."
"Those then are the purely political considerations."
"The European Monetary Institute's report on 'Single Monetary Policy in Stage Three - Specification of the operational framework' , concerning the introduction of the euro, has for the moment to be seen as a proposal: not until the European Central Bank has been set up can final decisions be taken."
"At any rate - and this is fundamental - we are already staking out the course for the monetary policy strategy which the ECB will need to evolve and pursue."
"Over and above that, particular sensitivity and transparency is needed in Stage Three particularly."
"Not only has there to be a guarantee that it will operate seamlessly and smoothly, the internal barriers to the single currency that actually exist in all the Member States will have to be removed."
"There has to be wide acceptance of all measures relating to the single currency policy of the ESCB."
"In the final analysis, it has to seem credible to the public generally."
"I wish, in passing, to make a very personal comment on the convergence criteria: the very fact that yet another stability pact has been devised demonstrates a failure to appreciate how integration is achieved in the process of European development."
"But that has now happened."
"The concept of a hierarchy with one person in charge, telling everyone else what to do is certainly not what is needed here."
"Penalties that appear to be a slap on the wrist will not help the financially weak countries and will inevitably impede the integration process."
"Introducing the single currency does not simply depend on whether the countries concerned are economically ready for it; it is, far more importantly, a question of our perception of democratic development."
"If we are to be able to develop the framework conditions in a sensible manner, we need a combination of tried and tested monetary policy strategies able to be applied by all the Member States."
"When it comes to converting monetary policy, it will be essential to apply different data and early indicators - of the kind we have for inflation targeting."
"That means that there has to be an operational framework for monetary policy."
"It makes sense to include inflation targeting as a strategy at the point of transition because we have to take account of uncertainties, particularly the unpredictable portfolio decisions of financial market operators."
"As we move over to the euro our approach has therefore to be very pragmatic and be an amalgam of both complete transparency of the money supply objective and the variety of information provided by the inflation target."
"I also believe that it is crucial to coordinate the exchange rate target, for which the ministers of finance are responsible, as far as possible through permanent consultation arrangements - possibly in the future Economic and Financial Committee or in some other way - with the European Central Bank."
"I do not consider it appropriate in that context always to be talking in terms of black and white, of hard and soft currencies, particularly when, in the background, we are considering and fixing exchange rate mechanisms."
"What is actually needed is to create a stable currency that meets our needs in the global currency context."
"That is what we are aiming for."
"Alongside monetary policy strategies, instruments for conversion and the effectiveness of those same instruments are a vital precondition if we are to convert smoothly to or introduce the system as a whole."
"Monetary policy instruments have to be applied decentrally, and this means that monetary policy has to be implemented decentralized basis, relying solely on the experience of the issuing banks."
"Wishing particularly to emphasize transparency in my report, I have to reiterate that the European Central Bank has to have a special duty of accountability in relation to the European institutions and the European Parliament."
"The economic dialogue with the ECB has to be placed on an institutional footing."
"This is not a matter of political intervention but primarily involves exchanging information at an early stage."
"That is the only way in which we can guarantee a prompt response in monetary policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the report that I am presenting to you today is very important for the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union, as of 1 January 1999."
"It is a shame that there has been so little thought and decisions about this matter since the success or the failure of the single currency will depend on it."
"It is from this viewpoint that this report poses a number of questions and proposes a number of answers to ensure that monetary union will work in favour of growth and employment."
"The vital questions posed are: firstly, how will the role of budgetary and taxation policy change once the euro is in place?"
"Secondly, in this unknown situation, this first in economic and political history, that of a centralized monetary policy with decentralized budgetary policies, how can we ensure that those policies jigsaw harmoniously and efficiently to ensure growth and employment for the whole of the European Union?"
"Thirdly, how can we conduct budgetary and taxation policies and, more generally, economic policy, in such a way as to obtain an optimal functioning of the single market?"
"Fourthly, how can we best respect the subsidiarity principle while ensuring the coherence of all budgetary and taxation policies and economic policy in general?"
"Fifthly, should we leave budgetary and taxation policies under the full responsibility of the Member States in the framework of the growth and stability pact - which of course there is no question of calling into question - or should we coordinate those budgetary and taxation policies, even increase the Community budget, if we want to guarantee a harmonious economic and social development?"
"Sixthly, how far should we harmonize taxation policy in order to avoid economic distortions that would be harmful to the allocation of resources, within the European area, and that might create very strong political tensions between the Member States?"
"Seventh - and this is the final question - how can we find this economic and political grail, while guaranteeing democratic control over decisions, in particular giving the European Parliament the role it deserves?"
"Those, ladies and gentlemen, are some of the fundamental questions that I try to answer in my report."
"They are ambitious, difficult questions, but they are crucial for the future of the Economic and Monetary Union and I think that everyone here will acknowledge that."
"The report therefore proposes various avenues to go down in order best to answer these questions and I will mention four that I think are vital."
"The first is that in order to deal with an asymmetrical economic clash, i.e. one affecting a single country or region, or even a symmetrical clash, common to the whole euro area, it will be necessary at least to coordinate the budgetary and taxation policies and, probably, in the long term, to increase the Community budget."
"Even if that is a taboo subject today, I think that in the long term that is the direction in which we shall head."
"Why?"
"To avoid external factors and situations that which soon prove insufficient in these matters."
"The second avenue, in terms of budgetary and taxation policy - again in terms of economic policy in general, in order to head in the direction just indicated - consists in proposing the means for implementing this coordination, via an adaptation of economic decision-taking in a political body to be determined, subjected to a solid democratic control."
"In other words more or less the proposal made here by Mr Lamfalussy and even by Mr de Silguy."
"I should like to emphasize the fact that it is not a question by any means of calling into question the independence of the European Central Bank, nor of calling into question the main aim, that of price stability."
"It is, on the contrary, a case of ensuring that there is a good policy-mix, as we say, between the two main instruments of economic policy, monetary policy and budgetary-taxation policy."
"The third avenue concerns taxation itself, Mr Monti, putting forward the desire for minimum common rules on savings, company taxes and transfrontier taxation."
"Finally the fourth main avenue is that of strengthening the ability to analyse the economic situation in the European Parliament, in order for it to participate more satisfactorily in the definition of European economic policy and in order to make our budgetary and taxation choices more credible."
"We therefore propose creating a committee of economic advisers at the European Parliament to include recognized experts and to report, let us say twice a year, to the European Parliament on the economic situation and on recommendations that it thinks ought to be implemented in terms of economic policy and, more specifically, budgetary and taxation policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is what we feel to be essential if we wish to guarantee the optimal functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union, i.e. strong growth and full employment, as that is the final aim, all of it within the framework of harmonious economic and social cohesion."
"Mr President, harmonization of taxation - just like monetary union - is part of the whole question of how we get the internal market to work to promote the investment and growth that stimulate employment."
"The reason I am concentrating on VAT alone in the context of our review of taxation strategy is because this is a tax that has to be paid at the creditor's place of business with regard to economic operators in the European Union, within the European single market, with - currently - 130 permitted derogations, 66 options and special rules and 25 differing rules on the place of taxation."
"And who is really going to be able to make sense of all of that?"
"Businesses that operate across frontiers have to have a detailed knowledge of the VAT systems of the other 14 Member States and familiarize themselves with the different procedures."
"That is the reality of the transitional rules on VAT that have been in force since 1.1.1993."
"It is high time not only that we improve these transitional rules but that we establish definitive rules based on the country-of-origin principle."
"Given the many problems, it certainly cannot be claimed at present that the internal market has made things easier."
"The transitional arrangements have involved complication, waste, increased costs and bureaucracy, and it is the economic operators above all who have to carry that burden."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are therefore unable to derive any benefit from the internal market in this area."
"What we need then is a reduction in administration, no reduction in the level of the Member States' tax revenue, a reduced risk of tax evasion and to ensure that there is no distortion of competition due to VAT."
"We have to achieve that by improving the existing system but also by moving towards the definitive system."
"The subsidiarity principle has, in any event, to continue to be observed."
"Harmonization should be required only where it is genuinely necessary."
"The chief requirement for the definitive VAT system has to be that intraCommunity and domestic transactions are treated the same."
"That can be achieved only if the taxation of all transactions is based on the country-of-origin principle."
"That principle is bound to cause shifts in VAT revenue."
"Member States with high levels of exports would benefit from increased revenue, while Member States with high levels of imports would have to cope with a substantial fall in revenue."
"A sensible macroeconomic clearing system is therefore crucial, as it offers the only way of securing the current tax revenue of the individual Member States."
"However, a clearing procedure of that kind will be generally acceptable only if it is simple, clear and quick and ensures prompt compensatory payments."
"Previous hearings on this subject in the European Parliament concluded that it was not actually the right moment to introduce the country-of-origin principle."
"Uniform and binding rules for all are essential to fair compensation."
"Macroeconomic criteria have definitely to be applied to the clearing procedure to avoid allowing a distinction between domestic and intra-Community transactions to creep in."
"I should like once again to point out here that the issue of the erosion of national sovereignty in the field of taxation concerns not merely direct taxation, for which the European Union will have in the long term to be competent also; it also arises in regard to indirect taxation, so that a definitive VAT system really does need to be established - it must cover all transactions and also treat the same transactions in all of the Member States in the same way."
"Tax exemptions should be replaced by the application of a zero tax rate."
"That will be of particular help to nonprofit-making organizations."
"However, the definitive VAT system has also to be seen as an opportunity to serve employment policy objectives."
"A further substantial contribution to the simplification of taxation and transparency will certainly be provided by setting two tax rates only - a standard rate and a reduced rate."
"Since VAT basically does nothing to distort competition, there is no need for full harmonization of the standard rates."
"A great deal of work needs to be done on the reduced rates, however."
"The definitive VAT system needs to be rounded off by introducing the single-place-of-taxation principle governing local competence in the taxation process."
"Both businesses, which would have to meet their obligations in one place only, and the tax authorities would benefit from that rule."
"The tax authorities would be able to monitor individual taxable persons more simply and more effectively."
"Security of revenue will therefore be improved and it will be easier for companies to meet their obligations."
"The call for the establishment of a minimum of control over the Member States' powers to raise tax is very important here, to prevent application of the single-place-of-taxation principle being used to avoid tax."
"To ensure that all persons liable for tax are treated in the same way, regardless of the Member State responsible, we have to have a rule that provides that VAT is payable throughout the EU on fixed dates."
"However hard we try, the establishment of the definitive VAT system is bound to take some time yet."
"We must therefore see to it that the transitional rules are improved and simplified."
"Every opportunity must be taken to make matters easier and save costs."
"Europe's economy can only benefit from that and, not least, its employment market."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to pay tribute to Alexandre Lamfalussy for the excellent work that he has done as the President of the European Monetary Institute and for the relationship that he has had with the European Parliament."
"(Applause ) I certainly hope that even though he will be giving up that post he will still visit the European Parliament to give us the benefit of his extensive knowledge."
"I would like to ask the President of the European Monetary Institute to respond to the points that I am going to make."
"I used to work for a former Finance Minister in Britain called Dennis Healey, who you might know."
"Mr Healey used to have a rule which was called the rule of holes."
"The rule said that if you were in a hole, you should stop digging."
"Do you not think it is time, given the state of the debate on economic and monetary union and the very clear shift of public opinion in Europe now, to rebalance economic and monetary union so that we can prove to the citizens of the European Union that we can have, on the one hand, a successful economic and monetary union and on the other hand, that we can tackle the problem of unemployment?"
"I recall when you came for your confirmation hearing as President of the EMI that you said in response to a question asked by one of the Members that you felt it would be very difficult to complete the EMU project with the levels of unemployment we had at that time."
"Those levels of unemployment have increased since that confirmation hearing."
"We have made no impact on the unemployment situation."
"Surely we must now recognize the political signals from the people in Britain and France and the nervousness of people in countries that have been strong supporters of the monetary union. This must be an economic and monetary union that is not an end in itself but a means to an end, namely a balance that will allow jobs to be created."
"In particular I should like to refer to the way in which we deal in future with the question of EMU."
"We now have nine prime ministers out of the fifteen who come from the family of socialists, or social democrats. This shows that there has been a switch in Europe in favour of a more balanced policy."
"Is it not time, therefore, for the EMI and the Commission to recognize that they have to rebalance their own policy?"
"Is it not time for us to look at a new model of development within the European Union?"
"In particular I want to refer to two areas of policy: the stability pact, where the French were right to call for a delay."
"It is time for us to include something in that pact on growth so that it is not only in name a pact for stability and growth."
"Is it not time for us to activate Article 103 of the Treaty so that we start getting proper economic coordination?"
"The most significant thing you could do today, Mr Lamfalussy, in your closing remarks to us as President of the EMI, is to send a very strong signal to the finance ministers and the heads of government in Amsterdam for them to recognize the pressure from the citizens for us to have an EMU, but an EMU in which there is public confidence and that will create jobs."
"You could do that today for us."
"Mr President, our group adds its voice to the chorus of thanks to President Lamfalussy for the commitment he has shown during this period, which has coincided naturally with a temporal and quantitative commitment without precedent in the history of the Community institutions."
"Our thanks also go to the four rapporteurs who have done excellent work on their reports at a time - I repeat - when Europe, particularly where major responses in the economic field are expected, is expressing simultaneous hopes and fears which we have never had to deal with before."
"But we must tell it like it is and not as we would like it to be."
"In the coming months and years the Member States and the European Union must make definitive choices, choices which prioritize both economic and social needs, and it is very difficult to combine the two."
"Europe was born of economic issues - the ECSC, coal and steel; it has since developed on the social side and today it is struggling to find the right relationship, the right balance, between the economic and the social."
"The four reports now before us are responses to this grave dilemma, helping us find a final approach, although a priori this must obviously include work and commitment from all the individual Member States."
"Regardless of their current position, we know there is very strong political, economic and social movement on our continent at this time and making definitive choices today is very difficult and would erect barriers against countries whose past and future commitment is the guarantee of the continuity and completeness of our continent."
"In particular, in presenting his report on the European Monetary Institute, Mr Mezzaroma has hammered home the point that political union and monetary union are mutually indispensable."
"A few days ago Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Dini, who has been President-in-Office of the Council and whom I have actually criticized in previous reports, said that a warning had gone out from Italy not to neglect political Europe, not to regard it as completely obscured by the race towards the single currency, which is obviously recognized as immensely significant."
"These statements were confirmed directly to the President, the Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, and to the Committee on Institutional Affairs of the European Parliament."
"That is important in restoring the confidence this institution needs to carry weight in the coming decisions."
"Minister Dini went on to say that the transition to the single currency will not be a change in degree, but a genuine change in kind. Understandably, it is a change which will mean new arrangements."
"He concluded that we are facing a real revolution."
"It has been announced in advance, but no-one is ever sufficiently prepared for a revolution."
"That is why our commitment must be permanent in giving priority to the qualitative over the quantitative, in devoting special attention to those sectors which are of an operational size to make the change positively."
"I refer in particular to small and medium-sized firms, in which all the reports presented have taken an interest."
"We are talking about reductions in taxation, contributions and bureaucracy: deregulation to let small and medium-sized companies operate more efficiently."
"Finally, on VAT, we favour the approach taken, we are especially grateful to Commissioner Monti for the intensive work of the group that bears his name, and we should unite behind harmonization of the system."
"In conclusion, we want to work even harder to define the logic of the single market's development into a genuine internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's joint debate, opened by the chairman of the European Monetary Institute, Mr Lamfalussy, for which I recognize the hard work and good relations that Dr Lamfalussy has maintained with the European Parliament in particular (last year it was my honour to draft the report on the first report by his institution), comes really at a key moment."
"We are facing a new element of uncertainty created after the position expressed yesterday by France at the ECOFIN meeting and one week away from the Amsterdam summit, which should lead us to a new Treaty."
"I think that an important conclusion of this debate would be for the European Parliament to consolidate, strengthen and very clearly insist on the need for EMU to come about and the euro to be introduced in the planned conditions and timescales."
"I think that any element of uncertainty could lead to greater difficulties, in an economic situation in which gradual recovery is taking placer, as is shown by the development of the European economy in the last quarter and the Commission's own forecasts, which we debated here for this year and next, and that should offer an appropriate economic framework for fulfilling this project."
"This project, as you know, also has a very important political dimension for the achievement of European Union."
"I should like to insist that this moment in time is not the most appropriate for asking institutions such as the European Monetary Institute or the future European Central Bank to implement policies that do not fit them."
"The Institute and, later, the Bank, must guarantee conditions of stability and solvency, with low levels of inflation and interest rates, offering a credible framework that is both secure and solvent internationally."
"Then, if the governments and administrations implement economic policies in a framework of competence, we shall be able to solve the most serious problem facing European society: unemployment."
"We cannot ask these institutions to solve what has to be done by the other administrations and the governments, when their electoral promises turn out to be more satisfactory, in the short term, from the electoral point of view."
"On behalf of my group I second the congratulations made to Mr Lamfalussy in spite of the differences which we still have."
"The current joint debate on these four reports evokes ideas which we would rather avoid, following the last Ecofin meeting, since we have already frequently had the uncomfortable feeling of having to think about something which we regarded as already decided and merely needing to be put into practice as quickly as possible."
"There might even have been some change through the pressure of the social consequences and we should be glad that it is recognised, albeit timidly, that reflection is called for - even on something which has already been decided."
"These reports fully follow the general direction taken, which we opposed, but which we think does contain some positive points, which might help in this new situation as regards the reflection which is so urgently needed."
"The mention in the Mezzaroma report of the rigidity of the labour market, the cause of all the evils for the European Monetary Institute, hides the fact that there is too little investment and a lack of spending power and demand - which are due principally to the high level of unemployment and to many other determining structural causes; on reading that we have no cause to think and reflect and we can only voice our concern about the attack on the socalled rigidity of the labour market if it is inspired by the example of the United States; downward flexibility would be disastrous in some countries such as Portugal where the wages spread is already vast and social protection is scant and fragile."
"When the Ettl report emphasizes the need for follow up measures which are more favourable to the real economy it really means unemployment, much talked about to little avail in practice, but there must be some levelling out of living standards as envisaged in Article 117 on economic and social cohesion."
"Should not the mention in the Fourçans report - that it is necessary to anticipate situations in which the Member States might suffer asymmetric or symmetric crises - be reflected in some points in a resolution?"
"I emphasize that it is acknowledged in point 13 that it is inappropriate to abandon the unanimity rule as regards fiscal harmonization, raising the vital question of the notion of fiscal sovereignty and more besides."
"When in various points of Mrs Randzio-Plath's report we find concerns expressed about equity in taxation and the strengthening of the instrumental nature of fiscal policy in order to meet national situations which are so diverse, are we not aggravating certain wounds which we would prefer to ignore?"
"But how can we then accept the fact that point 19 of the report calls for the introduction of the principle of majority decision-making on tax issues as a means of overcoming situations which the Member States might find fair in the long term, but which would not suit them in the short term."
"It is a pity that these reports are short on points supporting our reflection on the consequences of what is afoot."
"We do not think any the less of them as we are fully convinced of the need for this debate, which is not of our choosing, but which is forced upon us by social reality."
"Mr President, Mr Lamfalussy, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Alan Donnelly has already rightly said, the voters have again given us a one-off opportunity to correct the neoliberal and monetaristic concept of the euro and the relevant strategy, moving not back to the fifties, Mr Herman, but forward to the 21st century."
"We must and can now open the way to a Monetary Union within the framework of which it will at least be possible to resolve the major structural problems that were simply concealed by the previous policy of casino-style capitalism that was all show and no substance: the unemployment problem, the environmental crisis - when do we now hear anyone talk about the Rio principles and commitments and the Delors promises? - but also the problem of real and not just monetary convergence between our Member States."
"We ought really to take the opportunity put behind us the destructive temptation to get 'Back to Brüning' ; we should be moving not back towards classical Keynesianism but beyond Keynes and into selective social and environmental restructuring of our national economies."
"That will have to be underpinned by a common and coordinated employment policy because it will not be possible to build a stable euro on the back of increasing numbers of jobless."
"Since 1994, this House has again and again drafted proposals that were then ignored by the governments."
"These include the establishment of the Central Bank - French Socialists have again used the phrase 'economic government' but also the link to Community objectives and procedures."
"They include changing the monster stability pact, making it into a pact that facilitates and drives forward a common approach on the part of the Member States geared to solidarity and employment."
"It also includes a different interpretation of the convergence criteria, which have to be seen as a starting-point for a policy of genuine convergence and not in fact - and Mr Herman was quite right about this - some kind of mathematical obsession about the figure of 3.0 or indeed 3.00."
"Last, and by no means least, it includes - and all credit to Commissioner Monti who has consistently pointed this out - an end to tax dumping."
"We need to get out of this jam, that is to say we have to avoid getting further into debt and imposing taxes wherever possible."
"The fact is that the taxation of assets and profits is increasingly being undermined by tax dumping, and a community that covers its infrastructure costs from the coffers of employees, channelling it back to the undertakings, may make competitive gains in the short-term but this will not last."
"We now have an opportunity to change things."
"We must take advantage of it, and, in Amsterdam, the Member States can make a real effort here or we shall indeed be moving towards interesting, that is to say critical times when a wealth of decisions will have to be taken."
"Mr President, I would thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for her radical rethink on the VAT system which is a very cumbersome arrangement and does not seem to have been designed for the Single Market."
"The move towards a definitive VAT system based on the principle of origin will be a long process so I would suggest that we should not forget that we can improve matters in the short term."
"VAT is a standard rate of tax on consumption which is applied across the board regardless of levels of income and, as one speaker already mentioned social justice, I think it is vital that we manage that aspect in a socially just manner."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath's explanatory statement says that tax exemptions currently permitted on social grounds should be replaced with a zero tax rate."
"I see a warning light flashing here because such a move would change the legal tax basis for organizations that are exempt and possibly allow the imposition of the reduced rate or a standard rate in the future."
"I would like to suggest that there is a total lack of logic with the VAT rate on newspapers, books and magazines varying from zero to 25 %."
"We also have a situation where new education and information resources often attract the full rate."
"Surely, as we move into the technological age, the electronic page should be treated in the same way as the printed page."
"I have lodged amendments and would urge support for Amendments Nos 13 and 14 as well as Mr Miller's Amendment No 1, calling for zero rating of certain goods and services such as children's clothes, shoes, food, medical equipment, books, social services, etc."
"Surely we want to combat illiteracy and promote freedom of information, cultural diversity and an educated citizenry as well as a fair society."
"I would urge everyone to support the amendments."
"Mr President, the four reports that we are debating now have struck me with their lack of sincerity about the essential matters."
"The rapporteurs have made an effort to try and paint an objective picture of economic convergence in the European Union, the major differences existing in the Member States' fiscal and budgetary structures or the possible strategic axes of the future European Central Bank."
"Mr Fourçans is even trying to do a little 'social' by proposing to ease the constraints of the stability pact, by assessing public deficits not annually but over the whole of an economic cycle, whereas Mr Mezzaroma is aware that the rigidness of the labour market is neither the main nor the only cause of unemployment."
"The real reasons underpinning the forced march towards EMU are never targeted."
"Admitting that the single currency is not a vital condition for the proper functioning of the single market, that it serves only one aim, a single cause: the creation of a federal super-State, the structures of which our governments are putting the final touches to at the IGC."
"In truth, the single currencies creates more problems than it solves and everyone knows that full well."
"It calls for a considerable increase in the European budget in order to deal with asymmetrical economic shocks; Mr Fourçans recalled that earlier."
"It makes fiscal uniformization virtually inevitable, both in terms of rates and structures, in order to avoid fiscal dumping, and thereby considerably limits the different States' freedom for action."
"It necessarily calls for the creation of a European economic government to counteract the powers handed by the treaties to a handful of civil servants to run the Central Bank."
"In a nutshell, the single currency can only lead to the total transfer of economic, budgetary and fiscal sovereignty towards Brussels, or else the situation will be totally out of control."
"By means of the budgetary policies that it imposes the single currency is already an economic disaster, yet another source of unemployment in Europe."
"Tomorrow, when it exists, if it exists, it will be even worse as the right conditions will not be there."
"In order not to put back the date of introduction, we are now contemplating violating the principles originally set in concrete, the sacrosanct Maastricht criteria."
"Neither France nor Germany will respect them in 1997 or 1998, but neither France nor Germany wants to take responsibility for burying this economic aberration that is EMU."
"When they want to get elected, government promise to work for the common good, everyone's interests, the country's prosperity."
"Now, prosperity and interest call for the once and for all abandonment of the single currency."
"Mr President, European Monetary Union is constantly being hampered by talk of postponement which, in turn, inevitably leave citizens feeling uncertain."
"That is definitely not how to support the preparatory work that is being done by the European Monetary Institute, by the Commission, by this House and also by the Council and ECOFIN in particular."
"I therefore think it very important that the political élite in the European Union should finally speak out clearly, give clear signals and above all, Mr Lamfalussy, highlight what you yourself have again said this morning."
"We have made huge, previously unimaginable progress towards the convergence criteria - particularly those convergence criteria that are important for the operation of Monetary Union, the low inflation rate, the low long-term interest rates, exchange rate stability and also legal convergence in terms of the independence of the central banks."
"We are all aware - and I should very much welcome it, Mr Lamfalussy, if you could say something further about this - that tax criteria are merely a supporting factor in achieving monetary stability and that the future European Central Bank should not be forced to apply a rigid monetary policy because of unsound budgetary policies; that is something we could do without in the Monetary Union if we are achieve growth that is based on investment and creates employment."
"It is therefore important to emphasize and give prominence to the fact that those who are in favour of Monetary Union are also for job creation and must look to that."
"For that reason, the European Parliament has constantly called, since 1993 and by way of preparation for Monetary Union, for investment programmes in infrastructure to modernize and at the same time provide an incentive for private investment in Europe."
"In that context, I also welcome the fact that it is clear that the need to consolidate the domestic budgets of the Member States should in no event be at the expense of public investment, and that ought constantly to be emphasized, as this reflects the spirit of the Treaty also."
"In conclusion, I should like once again to ask you, Mr Lamfalussy, to explain how you think the democratic accountability of monetary bodies can be improved."
"We are grateful - and I want to say this very clearly on behalf of the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs - for your trust and constructive cooperation, for the forbearance you have shown in the face of what can only be described as impudent and disrespectful questions from Members of this House but we are also grateful because you have always been willing to listen and respond to us."
"I believe that you have worked not only to prepare Monetary Union but for the future of Europe. In conclusion, therefore, an indication of the form future cooperation between the European Parliament and European Central Bank should take would be especially important for us."
"Mr President, Mr Ettl has written a very good report on the EMI report on Single Monetary Policy in Stage Three."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my party group."
"The report was accepted without controversy by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and is a good summary of what is, in its turn, a good report by the EMI on the preparations which have been made before the ECB commences its work for the third stage."
"Preparations for monetary policy procedures are still underway."
"The EMI is drawing up various strategies for monetary policy."
"In order to gain credibility for the new currency and to create an understanding of it, it will be necessary to communicate this strategy."
"The EMI advocates that the ECB strategy is based on targets for the money supply and for direct inflation, which we warmly support."
"To waver on chosen strategies or deviate from them may cause serious damage to a project as wide-ranging as EMU."
"This is exactly why it is so important for the ECB to be independent and to take the long term view with its main task being to safeguard monetary stability."
"The risk of wavering has become a reality now that socialist leaders want to delay EMU or even to change it totally or to alter the stability pact."
"The stability pact is a central feature in gaining the necessary credibility for the new currency."
"My party group wants to see Europe being further developed in the name of freedom and peace, with foundations in a Europe for the people, where trade and interaction create a sense of belonging and a dynamism."
"We are prime advocates of the internal market which will strengthen our joint competitive strength and in so doing increase growth and produce new jobs in Europe."
"This is why it is so important to remove barriers to cross border trade."
"In this respect the report by Mrs Randzio-Plath on a common VAT system sets a very good example."
"The internal market and the single currency are both institutions needed by the EU to promote competitiveness."
"Other, different systems which have developed in our individual countries add a diversity which is enriching and which will not benefit from being standardised."
"Our common institutions are the external framework which set the long term conditions."
"The content must be created by the people and by entrepreneurs."
"The easiest way to find the best model is through healthy competition between different national systems and solutions."
"This is why I am concerned by those who wish to exclude competition and change as we will be the poorer for it."
"A comprehensive political tax harmonisation will not solve the growth problem in Europe."
"On the contrary we will set ourselves cost levels which remain permanently high and will continue to have high unemployment."
"I am in favour of a diverse Europe which works together for common solutions where these are necessary."
"I am also in favour of political leaders who keep their promises and are capable of taking a long term view and are not just out for gimmicks and popularity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's joint debate on the EMU, euro, VAT and coordination of budgetary policies hits at the heart of the matter, i.e. States' currency and public finances, in the perspective of EMU."
"All of these reports mostly are agreed to by our group although, in the case of Mrs Randzio-Plath's, we are unable to share the philosophy of paragraph 19, which stigmatizes the principle of unanimity for deciding taxation matters."
"As far as VAT is concerned, the switch to a final VAT system, due on 1 January 1997, has been put back sine die."
"But it must be admitted that the current system opens the door to numerous major frauds and leakages."
"We are aware of the imperfections of the transitional system and the European Union should set three objectives."
"On one hand, to improve controls over the real situation of deliveries abroad, and to improve the sharing of information available to customs and tax offices; in other words improve the exchange of information between States."
"One certitude is that the switch to the final system, which would make it possible to impose the tax in the country of origin, calls for the current system to be greatly improved."
"I should now like to make a more political comment."
"If I am to believe today's press, the new French Minister for European Affairs is asking for six extra months for understanding the set of dossiers on this subject."
"What did he do when he was a member of this Chamber, until last Friday?"
"I do not like criticizing our colleagues, but even so."
"A member of this Parliament who sat here for three years, who never spoke in plenary session, whom we never saw, either in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs or in the Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs, and whose most notable written question dealt with the comparative merits of the Cormorant phallocrocorax carbo sinensis and the Cormorant phallocrocorax carbo carbo , now that he has become Minister, comes and asks, cap in hand, for a six months' delay, probably in order to have the time to examine a dossier he did not give a damn about when he was a member of the European Parliament..."
"Some of us have been working here for many years and we could give him a few lessons, if he needs some cramming before the Amsterdam Summit."
"Mr Pierre Moscovici - I am talking about him - and his accomplice, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, are holding the single currency hostage and are taking on the huge responsibility of jeopardizing the patient and careful work done by the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament and the European Monetary Institute."
"I am sure that history will hold them responsible."
"It seems to me that our colleague, Mr Giansily, was more interested in making personal attacks than a real political judgment of the commitments made by the French socialists in their electoral campaign which led them to victory."
"Mr President, I should like to begin with the disturbing problem of the lack of consensus which has re-emerged on the question of fiscal policy at the heart of the EMU debate."
"This needs to be resolved urgently."
"If it is not, it has the capacity, politically and economically, to destabilize seriously the preparatory work to achieve a good EMU launch."
"There is a huge unemployment crisis in Europe today, but we should not kid ourselves about how to respond to it."
"It requires a realization that in a global economy we need more European labour market flexibility."
"It requires an understanding that in that context and inside the EMU we need a wage-rate and incomes policy that takes account of growth in labour productivity and of competitive requirements."
"It requires that we enhance labour mobility where possible within the Union through a variety of measures such as, for example, improving pensions' portability and other practical measures."
"It requires an emphasis on more European research and development."
"It requires a constant search for more competitiveness."
"It requires looking at switching social expenditure from passive to more active models."
"All of these and more are needed, but not the illusion that quick, short-term budget fixes are an answer."
"We tried that."
"It failed. If we try it again we create an illusion and that illusion will lead to a weak, inflation-prone, high interest rate Euro-zone."
"We do not need that either."
"So we have to sort this debate out now, abandon self-delusion and realize that a solid EMU requires a solid fiscal basis."
"Anyone who does not understand that will pay the price through higher interest rates and an inflation-prone Euro-zone."
"On the VAT question, I agree in substance with what the rapporteur has said."
"The Liberal Group wants two things from the Commission: that it should, in the short- to medium-term, try to improve the problems and shortcomings of the current system; also, it should continue to deepen its work on moving the system to a new regime using the point of origin."
"We cannot ask Member States to take a leap in the dark."
"We need to know what are the revenue implications for states."
"We need the macro-economic distribution key to be resolved sooner and not later."
"Subject to that, the Liberal Group supports the timetable set out by the Commission."
"Mr President, in my opinion this debate should have been more intensive and should have taken place a long time ago."
"I am referring in particular to the debate on the far too independent status of the future European Central Bank, and on the vital need to tighten up economic political cooperation under the conditions created by EMU, particularly in the area of taxation, because under the conditions of EMU fiscal competition between the Member States will become ever stronger."
"This distorts competition and also makes it harder for the Member States in their efforts to obtain sufficient tax income."
"We are relatively satisfied with this report."
"A number of views are put forward on how to create democratic supervision as a counterweight to the future European Central Bank."
"One idea which has come up in my own party in Finland is that the European Central Bank should have a 'confidence body' made up of Members of the European Parliament."
"The Bank of Finland, for example, naturally has a group of bank delegates made up of Members of Parliament."
"This thought perhaps tends in rather the same direction as the idea which the French floated when they spoke of a Stability Council."
"However, it would provide a parliamentary dimension to this problem of democratic supervision."
"It is also clear that the European Parliament should be consulted when the directors of the Central Bank are chosen."
"This consultation should involve the whole board, for never before has there been such an independent body of experts which can limit in such a decisive way the powers of democratically elected bodies to pursue economic policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these four reports are an opportunity for us to express our support for all those who want Europe not only to be a market and a currency, but it is also an invitation for them to clarify what they really mean by a 'European economic government' , which in our view must be clearly distinguished from the currency question."
"As for this currency question, we shall sum up by saying that it is imperative to apply all of the treaty, nothing but the treaty."
"All the treaty means the independence of the future monetary institution and banning excessive deficits."
"Nothing but the treaty means that we deplore the slide, noted at Dublin, between the aim of the treaty to ban excessive deficits and the now clear allusion to an aim of systematic balance, even budgetary deficits."
"We see this as a kind of dogmatic slide on which rests a perfectly erroneous assertion according to which growth and employment cannot only come from monetary and budgetary stability."
"The whole of this century's economic history shows the contrary."
"The single currency does not need that economic justification."
"While it is a necessary aim for completing European Union, it is a political aim and we know full well that it is because it cannot be built without budgetary stability that that stability is necessary."
"Those are political aims."
"As for the economic government, it must take into hand the question of growth and employment, but regardless of the currency objective."
"We should not get the negotiation nor the timetable wrong."
"What we need to achieve that balanced European economic construction is, for example, a strengthening of the means to take Community public action, by means of strengthening the budgetary means and strengthening fiscal means."
"That would, for example, require the adoption of qualified majority voting, at least for part of the fiscal sector."
"What is at stake is the IGC, not the stability pact."
"Mr President, last week the 'Euroboat' was moored at the Westerkade in Rotterdam, showing an exhibition on the monetary history of Europe."
"This week it has started a tour of various cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France, and is scheduled to bring this mobile euro-exhibition here to Strasbourg next month."
"Compared with the introduction of the euro itself, this cruise upstream by the 'Euroboat' is a piece of cake."
"The Waal and the Rhine are not exactly raging torrents, and there are rarely heavy storms in the summer."
"In economic and monetary terms, however, quite a violent storm has blown up in Europe."
"Confidence in EMU is waning by the day."
"The new French Government wants Spain and Italy to join the euro, but even if they were to meet the criteria - and Italy will certainly not be able to - everyone knows that the market has no confidence in a broad-based EMU, which would inevitably lead to a weak euro."
"And as Mr Ettl rightly points out, this is hardly what we want."
"If we take this view, the logical consequence is to call for EMU to be postponed, a conclusion reinforced by the fact that unemployment in Germany has remained at such high levels."
"But Chancellor Kohl insists that EMU must and will go ahead."
"This means that there is no chance of meeting the Treaty criteria by 1998."
"The Commission too says that postponement is impossible, which is the result of its highly irresponsible behaviour in promoting EMU and then, as it becomes clear that it cannot be achieved, claiming that there is no choice but to go through with it."
"With disaster looming whether it goes ahead or not, the public authorities are clearly skating on thin ice."
"One thing that surprises me is that the motions for resolutions support the independence of the central banks, while at the same time stressing that the European Central Bank should be answerable to Parliament and calling for a new political organ as an economic counterpart to the ECB."
"Mr President, given the way it is currently looking and going, the fact is that Monetary Union is going to be an economic area which, though comparable with a nation-state in terms of its currency, has in many others areas structures that are clearly critical if Monetary Union is to be a success but which differ greatly from one Member State to another, and this is in itself a factor that involves a whole range of problems."
"These are problems that have to be properly resolved before Monetary Union is set under way."
"If the solutions adopted to tax harmonization and the issue of stability are only half-hearted, then this Monetary Union will rest on very shaky foundations."
"The single currency should improve the operation of the internal market."
"However, if, at the same time, it is to promote growth and employment, the Union is going to have to tackle the budgetary and fiscal policies of the individual Member States, as these inevitably have a considerable influence on the Union's general economic position."
"Then there is the question of coordinating the national budgets or even significantly increasing the European Union budget."
"But as the rapporteur, Mr Fourçans, himself puts it, it is extremely difficult, both economically and politically, and I am afraid that it will not actually be possible to resolve those questions in the medium term, because Europe is not yet ready for this."
"As far as fiscal matters are concerned, the rapporteur points very clearly to the unfair tax competition that could arise in a variety of areas between Member States or regions."
"But, politically speaking, these are extremely difficult matters because the structures, traditions and cultures differ very greatly in the individual Member States."
"What the rapporteur is unable to say is how the distortions likely to result from differing taxes are to be prevented."
"At present, as far as many Member States are concerned, the principle of unanimity on this issue is something of a sacred cow."
"We can certainly expect that where wages and wage costs differ only marginally, we shall see both increased worker mobility and businesses exploiting these location-based advantages."
"Commissioner de Silguy said he was prepared to talk about everything but not about the point in time at which Monetary Union would commence."
"I take the view that he needs immediately to tackle the question of a new and realistic time-frame that makes it possible to achieve real convergence if he wants Monetary Union to be a blessing for Europe and not a lasting burden."
"Those, like me, who want economic union, may also want it at a later point in time, and I think that those who do want it have also to be in favour of closer citizen participation in this issue."
"Mr President, employment, competitiveness and growth are issues which deserve to be given priority attention, as has been pointed out more than once here this morning."
"It is quite clear that they are all affected by the way in which we organize our indirect taxation, so the report by Mrs Randzio-Plath deals with a subject that we cannot afford to treat lightly, not least for the following four reasons."
"VAT is naturally important for the national income of each Member State."
"It is also a consumer tax which affects everyone, and is particularly significant when it comes to the administrative burden on firms."
"VAT can also cause shifts in intra-Community trade flows and in the attractiveness of certain services that we offer to consumers outside the European Union."
"VAT based on the country-of-origin principle has formed part of the single market project since the very beginning, and its purpose is still to make intra-Community trade as easy as trade within one Member State."
"With the current system this is impossible, and it is therefore unacceptable simply to convert the transitional regime into a definitive system."
"Some people claim that this transitional system that we have been laboured with for far too long is now well established, and that firms would prefer to follow the principle of 'better the devil you know' ."
"However, this is not the dominant view in business circles."
"Anyone who takes a rather longer-term approach cannot but follow the Commission's logic and choose the short, sharp shock of conversion, rather than carrying on with the heavy administrative burden which, for a number of reasons, the current system represents."
"We should also not forget that the introduction of the euro will make the market more transparent, and that differences in rates and in how the rules on VAT are interpreted and applied are more likely than ever to distort competition."
"The completion of the single market now demands the introduction of the euro and decisive measures to eliminate the patchwork of VAT rates."
"This means having a system based on the country-of-origin principle, so that the rates remain roughly in line, and anyone subject to VAT only needs to nominate a single place where he can pay his taxes and claim deductions, with a clearing system based on macroeconomic principles."
"But this solution will clearly never be achieved as long as this whole issue is still subject to the unanimity rule."
"I therefore hope, perhaps against hope, that the Amsterdam summit will bring some progress in this area."
"Time is now short, and past delays mean that European firms could now face a number of upheavals all at once."
"Allowing the euro and the new VAT system to coincide could be too much of a good thing, and that is why we, as the authorities, have to show that we are serious about easing the administrative burden."
"Clearer legislation is what we need, and what we are waiting for."
"Mr President, this important debate is taking place at a time of dramatic change in the political landscape of Europe, when the situation seems too unbalanced to guarantee a stable euro."
"This is a particularly worrying state of affairs and comes despite the considerable progress that has been made, as Mr Lamfalussy has described."
"Although these reports are of a technical nature, we do of course all know that this is a political issue, much more so than many other aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it is the euro which can create unity in Europe."
"Not just Europe's unity, but also its competitiveness is at stake here."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath called in this morning's 'Financial Times' for the European Central Bank to have the same degree of openness as the federal committees in the United States."
"I find it remarkable that one of our leading rapporteurs should recommend an American model, when it is more usual for Parliament to feel frustrated by the actions of the USA."
"People in general have now become anti-European, and this is why all politicians from all parts of the political spectrum now have just one task before them."
"We are facing a revolution, as Mr Garosci said, and politicians must now do everything they can to make it clear that European unity requires substantial reforms from all its citizens, because this is the way to create a dynamic financial, economic and social Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to build on what Mr Cox said earlier, on behalf of my Group, about the debate on monetary union and the debate on fiscal union."
"It seems to me a little strange that we have brought such diverse reports together into one debate - certainly Mrs Randzio-Plath's report on indirect taxation seems to fit with little ease into such a debate."
"It is nonetheless important because, inevitably, the discussion on monetary union must be succeeded by an in-depth discussion on fiscal union, which must follow."
"I would like to raise the problem of our relative lack of understanding of, and failure to study, some of the principles of indirect taxation."
"There is a need for clear principles for indirect taxation to be established, and much of the very valuable work that is being carried out by the Commission in this area seems to ignore the wider context of the lack of consensus on the base of VAT; the danger here is that we will find the fiscal base actually being diluted."
"Certainly, in my own country, the government is extending exemptions from VAT to services which were once in the public sector and are now in the private sector."
"I am aware of similar problems in France and Italy."
"The Commission has indeed put some of these questions to the Court of Justice for resolution."
"I propose, and my Group proposes through amendments to the Fourçans and Randzio-Plath reports, the establishment of an independent organization which would bring together academics, industry practitioners, Commission officials and national government officials in a wider and informal context to discuss different VAT practices and to build a consensus on this."
"I hope that the House will feel able to support these amendments so that we may have a wider discussion on the very principles of indirect taxation before we proceed further with the details."
"Mr President, as opposed to the economic area of free trade initially set up, the rule of increasing Community regulation has prevailed once more, leading to the triumph of supra-national will."
"Since the second half of the 1980s, the growing desire for general harmonization called for the setting up of a socalled transitional VAT system that everyone knew was not appropriate."
"Transitional, but until when?"
"The final system was due to be adopted by the Commission by 31 December 1994."
"It is now June 1997 and the taxation question is still on the agenda for harmonization."
"It is a delay but, above all, an admission of failure."
"This failure is all the more damning because it affects the main Community institutions, the Council and the Commission."
"This delay is now symbolized by two simple points."
"The first is that this transitional system is inappropriate and must be replaced and the second is the difficulty in setting up the final system."
"For that purpose, a certain number of ideas have been advanced, primarily that of replacing the destination country rule with the so-called country of origin rule."
"We are in agreement with this rule in principle as it would simplify administrative steps for companies."
"When you have fewer declaration obligations, you have fewer risks of error."
"A single declaration in a single taxation location means less possible fraud and cost savings."
"Where we disagree is when you recommend the pure and simple abolition of national exonerations and their replacement by zero rating."
"This is a further abandonment of our national sovereignty since it would be the Community institutions which would decide."
"Like all national taxes, direct or indirect, VAT is a priority instrument of budgetary policy."
"The proof is that since its appearance in France this unique tax has been copied worldwide."
"Yes, to the desire to change the current system but not at any price."
"No, to a further abandonment of sovereignty."
"We want to preserve our fiscal autonomy, which is not necessarily incompatible with a new VAT system in the European Communities."
"Mr President, like many of the earlier speakers this morning, I should like to thank Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy for his work at the head of the European Monetary Institute and his relations with his institution, in the knowledge that we are not always easy to deal with."
"We thank him for the relations he has maintained with us, in the hope that we shall develop similar ones with his successor."
"He is leaving us at a moment when things are obviously moving."
"The nearer we get to monetary union and the more we can gauge the main consequence: the urgency of economic union."
"In this context the Fourçans report, as amended by our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is a useful one."
"Yes, we need to strengthen the coordination of the budgetary policies of the Member States, be it by indirect or indirect taxation, capital or company profit taxes, without forgetting the process of relocation."
"We also need to set up a democratically controlled political body that would be responsible for the coordination of economic policies."
"These are the concerns that we share although we have not been the main promoters."
"But we must go further and be more ambitious."
"The budgetary aspect of the report calls for several remarks, in my opinion."
"The stability pact - as the outcome of yesterday's ECOFIN Council meeting showed - is only legitimate if it serves faster growth."
"In terms of taxation, we should head towards minimum harmonization of corporation tax, savings taxes and transfrontier taxation."
"But we should also introduce qualified majority voting for certain direct taxes, or else we shall be unable to fight fiscal dumping or strike a taxation balance between capital and labour, taxing capital speculation."
"As for the political body mentioned in the Fourçans report, while not simply call it an 'economic government' and give it, as Article 103 of the Maastricht Treaty clearly calls us to do, clear powers to coordinate budgetary, fiscal and structural economic policies?"
"The Fourçans report heads in the right direction but seems a little timid when it comes to aims."
"Recent changes of government in certain Member States should help us, without delay, to promote at European level alternatives to the solutions and mechanisms proposed in recent years."
"We must all work for the introduction of the single currency within the set deadline."
"But the States that want it must be free to pursue their main public investment policies so as not to sacrifice the recovery in growth to the absolute priority of the monetary objective."
"To conclude, Mr President, we must avoid setting up a mechanism that would turn employment into the main variable of adjustment, thereby turning our back on our political priority: job creation."
"To achieve that, we must do all we can to ensure that the switch to the single currency takes place on the planned date but with an economic union that is also committed to, serving growth and employment."
"For that we must, in the beginning, as of today, complete the stability pact, which only has growth in its name and nothing else, so that thanks to a genuine coordination of economic policies, we can turn it into a genuine growth and employment pact."
"The vital thing is not whether or not the stability pact is adopted in Amsterdam."
"It is that the single currency will help to create jobs as of 1 January 1999."
"Mr President, with regard to the Fourçans report, it is extremely important for us to determine how far we need to focus on economic cooperation during the third stage."
"We can also no longer avoid the problem of harmonizing the taxation systems within the euro zone."
"We have heard much more recently about economic cooperation, such as at yesterday evening's ECOFIN meeting in Luxembourg on giving greater priority to the fight against unemployment in Europe."
"The socialists clearly see large government deficits as synonymous with social policy, so the proper organization of government finances has been pushed into the background, a move which I deeply regret on behalf of all of Europe's unemployed."
"Not long ago, a Stability Council was set up at the request of the French."
"Now the Fourçans report, once again by a Frenchman, proposes an economic government with far-reaching powers."
"The intention is clearly to provide a counterbalance to the European Central Bank, particularly with regard to employment, and it seems that there is a wish to have a trade-off between inflation and employment as usual."
"But I am firmly convinced that the answer to the unemployment problem does not lie in undermining the independence of the European Central Bank."
"The policy advocated by the future ECB - price stability and low inflation - means low interest rates, which should stimulate investment and, in turn, growth and employment."
"Next, tax harmonization."
"We need to avoid fierce competition between the Member States here."
"On the other hand, Member States whose government finances are in order and which therefore do not need to impose higher taxes on their citizens must not be punished for their success."
"The VAT system too will come under pressure from the euro."
"For businesses, and in particular for small and medium-sized firms, the current VAT system is the main distorting factor in the single market, and even the man in the street can see why there are still discrepancies."
"Commissioner Monti bases his definitive VAT system on the country-of-origin principle, which in theory should remove most of the problems we have with the current system."
"But it is the implementation of the system, particularly the clearing systems, that is causing great concern among the net exporting countries, especially those with a mainport on their territory."
"Small and medium-sized firms also regard this as a problem."
"As long as VAT is calculated on the basis of national statistics and the statistics within the European Union are not harmonized, there will still be a risk for the net exporting countries."
"The SMEs are currently worried that they are going to have to supply the missing figures, which would in one fell swoop cancel out one of the main advantages of having the definitive system, which is to reduce the administrative burden on firms."
"In principle, the clearing system ought to shift the administrative burden from SMEs to the government, where it belongs."
"As far as I am concerned, the definitive system is only acceptable if it places the administrative burden where it belongs, with the government, and if a solution is found to the enormous risks presented by the clearing system."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the European Monetary Institute, today we are debating reports whose common theme is the preparation for the single currency in connection with which you, Mr Lamfalussy, have been a prime mover."
"You have done it with exceptional skill and finesse and displayed a refinement of conduct which makes all of us regret that today marks your last appearance here as president."
"Mr Donnelly has recalled your reference here to unemployment and to the obstacle that you believed it placed in the way of completion of the process. Your full view, if I remember rightly, was that high levels of unemployment would push some governments into relaxing budgetary discipline."
"Looking at the developments in France one could say that your prophecy is beginning to come true, except that it is coming true, of course, with popular endorsement, and despite the sarcasm that has been expressed in this Chamber about the voice of the people I do not imagine that anyone will say that we should get discard the people of France and appoint another people in their place. I am assuming that in a parliament the voice of the people should carry some weight."
"With all due respect to your views, I must point out the one-sidedness of your positions concerning fiscal discipline."
"Unemployment may give an impetus to fiscal relaxation, and excessive budgetary stringency may, of course, create unnecessary and intolerable levels of unemployment."
"One has difficulty understanding in what way the persistence with a policy which is expanding unemployment and slowing down economic growth can benefit us as regards global competition, which also comes into play here."
"Is it or is it not correct that technological innovation takes off, that costs are reduced, that productivity rises and that, therefore, competitiveness increases when an economy is flourishing rather than when it is stagnating and when unemployment is perpetuated?"
"We are not saying that unemployment should be combated via consumption excesses, but for the stability pact effectively to prohibit public investment when private investment is not forthcoming is, to say the least, rash, and any move by the French Government to change things in the direction which this Parliament has called for would indeed be laudable."
"Furthermore, the imposition of fiscal stringency is wrong at this particular time. It is not a question of whether we can live with balanced budgets."
"We can and we must live with balanced budgets."
"What is at issue is the dynamic via which we achieve them and whether, as far as unemployment is concerned, now is the right time to be imposing a squeeze which is actually increasing unemployment."
"We need to get on top of the unemployment problem first and to escape from this impasse into which we have been led instead of digging a deeper hole for ourselves. After that we shall be able to tackle the issue of monetary stability, as indeed we must, with much more ease."
"Mr President, I want to speak mainly on issues linked to the Randzio-Plath and Fourçans reports, and then on fiscal issues."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, Mr Harman and I have presented two amendments to Mrs Randzio-Plath's report, which we strongly support. These amendments are intended primarily to emphasize our clear agreement on the final choice of the principle of country of origin."
"In the light of many considerations, we are in fact convinced that this is the optimum mechanism for the definitive VAT system, because of its advantages in terms of greater simplicity for businesses, but also for consumers, who will be able to benefit from more transparent news and information about the relative advantages in different countries and on different markets. Finally, it will lead to better functioning of the internal market, which will also be stimulated by a more transparent VAT system."
"In particular, a system of this kind would strengthen the fight against fraud - and we all know how important that is. We feel sure it is the right system to adopt, despite a certain confusion which emerges every now and then, on condition that it is based on the simplest possible mechanism, both as regards public administrations, hence the compensation mechanisms others have already mentioned, and in particular, obviously, as regards the obligations on firms."
"So our two amendments - Nos 9 and 10 - which we hope will receive wide support from Members of Parliament, are intended to reinforce this concept, and are also intended to stimulate the Commission, in the current transitional stage, to do the groundwork, so to speak, for moving to the definitive system."
"We are certainly facing all kinds of obstacles, in particular the famous unanimity problem."
"In this connection I am delighted that the Fourçans report, at points 11 and 12, incorporates the concept of a code of conduct in fiscal matters."
"We debated this at the last Brussels session with a report - I had the honour to be the rapporteur - which received a large majority and wide support from Parliament."
"I would like to record this fact not only as a point shared with the Fourçans report, but also as a question on which Parliament has already made its position clear very strongly."
"I shall restrict myself to these points and just reiterate my deep appreciation for the work of both colleagues, which I have had the pleasure of commenting on briefly here."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Lamfalussy and all our colleagues who draft reports, but due to shortage of time, I shall concentrate in this speech on the Fourçans report."
"The coordination of the budgetary and fiscal policies for Monetary Union is based on an initiative report by the European Parliament, which realised at a very early stage that it is essential to study not only the effects which the third stage of EMU might bring, but above all the new role which these policies should come to play in monetary stability, economic growth and the jobs market."
"It was even fundamental to make an in-depth analysis of the Maastricht Treaty in order to identify the mechanisms which would make it possible to define, follow up and control the policies to be pursued by the Council, the Commission and finally by the European and national Parliaments in this matter."
"The principal objectives of the single currency are to bring optimum efficiency to the operation of the internal market and to make it possible to develop a sustainable economy, to have more and better jobs and to improve living standards in the community."
"So what means should be adopted to keep within these principles?"
"From the budgetary point of view I think that the main ideas should be as follows: national budgetary policies will continue to be a fundamental instrument, but the deficits should not be assessed on an annual basis, but on the basis of a global cycle."
"And consequently, the stability and growth pact - if it comes to be implemented - should in some way be applied automatically and independently of political judgment."
"Budgetary policy should therefore tend towards the re-channelling of expenditure to help to create employment and improve the well-being and safety of the citizens, not to reduce that."
"At Community level we must in the long term envisage budgetary growth in relation to GNP in order to move ahead of the 1.27 % envisaged for 1999 to higher figures which will make it possible to overcome situations in which we have asymmetrical crises."
"As regards fiscal policy within the sphere of the single currency, harmonization measures are needed in order to avoid burdensome economic distortions, measures which must be applied above all in the field of taxation on savings, taxation of companies and the approximation of indirect taxation."
"The broad lines are set out in this report by Mr Fourçans, whom I congratulate on accomplishing this difficult task."
"It is now up to the national and European institutions to define the means and the time-scale for realising our hopes placed in the creation of the internal market and the single currency to reach the objectives of growth, wellbeing and economic and social cohesion which the citizens of Europe aspire to."
"Mr President, it now seems clear that the third stage of EMU will take place in accordance with the timetable, although according to the assessment of the Commission and the Monetary Fund only two countries, Finland and Luxembourg, will fulfil the convergence criteria It may therefore be necessary to interpret and relax them, partly in order to revive the employment situation and economic growth in some countries in the next few years and to prevent 'asymmetrical crises'."
"Mr Fourçans' report has excellently analysed the narrowing of the choice of economic policy instruments under the new current conditions."
"In adopting my three amendments, the Committee on Economic Affairs accepted a rather softer line which also stresses employment and the prevention of difficult economic crises while at the same time acknowledging the broad lines of the report's analysis."
"What would this line mean if put into practice?"
"Greater national freedom of action for budgetary policy."
"Its significance will be enhanced if the possibility of using exchange-rate policy disappears and the European Central Bank prevents the operation of national monetary policy."
"How should it be implemented?"
"The 3 % ceiling on budget deficit should not be interpreted short-sightedly but in the context of the whole trade cycle."
"In this way a deficit can be used as a means of stimulating growth, and a surplus as a weapon of deflationary policy."
"For this reason, punitive interest rates should also be defined on the basis of the average deficit over the whole trade cycle and not the deficit at one particular moment."
"This last is important because no punitive consequences ensue in the case of divergence from any other of the criteria."
"A Member State may happily have a debt representing as much as 100 % of its GDP and inflation on an interest rate exceeding the criteria, without these incurring any punitive measures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe's economic policy has taken a healthy, though to many people dramatic turn."
"The election victories of the Social Democrats have recently opened the door to the emergence of an economic policy which stresses the importance of employment."
"We cannot build a common currency on mass unemployment and the voters have now clearly shown that."
"We must not run headlong into a common VAT system on a wholly mechanical basis without taking account of employment factors."
"Fortunately, Mrs Randzio-Plath takes account of the social aspects in considering taxation priorities."
"However, we must go further."
"We cannot assume that the Commission has the sole right to analyse and direct the structure of tax policy."
"Here in the European Parliament we must bear our responsibility and define the new structures and priorities which will encourage employment."
"The current VAT directive which had its origins in the 1970s requires reform."
"Tax revenue has gone uncollected in all Member States since customs formalities were removed and because of the cheap depreciations carried out by big businesses."
"Large industrial concerns are able to adapt to the jungle-like VAT system, but SMEs are still trying to cope with the differences in practice between the various countries."
"Now the big firms do not want a new VAT system, but it is of vital importance to SMEs."
"The common VAT system will have problems if we assume that public services come within the scope of VAT."
"Will schools, kindergartens and medical care thus become a saleable good to be taxed and privatized?"
"And how about public service or charitable organizations which collect money for example for developing countries or for those who are excluded in their own society?"
"Will we thus tax humanitarian work while closing our eyes to bigbusiness tax evasion?"
"Setting tax rates at the same level is thus very problematic because it would distort competition."
"Mr President, I should like to comment on the report by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"In paragraph 14, she quite rightly calls for particular attention to be given to tourism, which as we all know is an extremely important sector for employment, with some 10 million people in the European Union earning their living from it."
"In a number of Member States, VAT is a major cost factor for tourists, for example in Denmark, where VAT accounts for 25 % of holiday spending."
"We should not underestimate the effect of this."
"Margins in this sector are usually small."
"In Ireland, the VAT rate for hotels was increased from 10 % to 23 % at the beginning of the 1980s, with the result that over 10 % of Ireland's hotels were forced to close within four years."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament all regard the fight against unemployment as our number one priority, and rightly so."
"Eighteen million people out of work is simply not acceptable."
"Experts believe that the travel and tourism sector offers the best chances of creating new jobs over the next ten years, particularly for women and young people."
"At the same time, they also conclude that of the tens of millions of new jobs that are expected to be created in tourism worldwide, less than 5 % will be created in the European Union."
"This poses two specific questions: firstly, what are the Commission's views on these studies, and is it prepared to try to ensure that the reduced VAT rate is applied across the board to all tourism-related activities?"
"More and more studies are indicating that tens of thousands of people could lose their jobs, not least in the ferry sector."
"Mr President, Mr Lamfalussy, in the long run you cannot spend more than you earn."
"Families that go on spending more than they earn, lose spending power; in businesses jobs are put at risk and lost if, in the long term, they spend more than they make, and the same, of course, applies to States if, in the long term, they spend more than they take in."
"Anyone can lose credibility in that way, and we have in the past seen crises which have shown that all citizens then lose their assets and enormous numbers of jobs are lost."
"That is why the Stability Pact is so important."
"We have to try to establish sound finances, as they are, when all is said and done, the best foundation for the internal market."
"The roof is build out of the single currency."
"Our finances are in the end critical to our ability to compete, including with States outside the European Union."
"That is why we need to take a very close look at the harmonized taxes."
"This House has already made a preliminary assessment of what the subsequent costs will be."
"It is very important in relation to VAT harmonization also, to consider what the costs will be to the State, to citizens and to businesses."
"My second point concerns lean management."
"I think it absolutely vital that those concerned are involved in the harmonization process."
"99.8 % of businesses in the European Union have less than 250 employees."
"I think that we have to ensure that, for individuals, the taxation system is as simple and easy to understand as possible."
"My third and final point concerns bench marks."
"In the same way as the convergence criteria provide useful bench marks, we need to have that same system for taxation, and indeed to have an improved version that can be applied when decisions are taken in the future also."
"Mr President, may I start by thanking the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have undertaken in this very important field."
"In particular, I am encouraged to see how the role of the European Monetary Institute is shaping up and look forward to seeing the institute become the central bank."
"One thing I would like to comment on are the obvious problems that we are finding with the economic and political developments in Germany and France."
"Both of those electorates clearly are somewhat concerned at the budgetary measures and steps being taken by their respective governments in trying to meet the Maastricht criteria required for European monetary union."
"In France that has manifested itself in a changing government, where the emphasis now will shift to jobs, prosperity and employment and away from the type of budget-cutting that we have seen in the past."
"Similarly, in Germany there are problems with the ability of the German economy to move in a way which will help the country meet the 3 % deficit requirement."
"Given the changing nature of the view of the electorates in both France and Germany - and indeed the UK since the election - and the emphasis that will be placed on jobs, growth and employment rather than on budget-cutting, the position has altered to the extent that there should be a review in the Maastricht timetable."
"I say that with regret because I am a keen enthusiast of monetary union and would have liked to see it go ahead on time but the positions of the German and French governments will be such that if a Euro is created on 1 January 1999 it will be a soft Euro and very quickly come under attack from the currency markets."
"I want to see an emphasis on growth and genuine stability and if we go ahead on 1 January 1999 we will not see stability and growth may be hindered."
"I want to thank Mr Fourçans for his report and to refer to his report in particular as a good basis for a strategy on the whole question of the harmonization of tax in line, of course, with economic convergence in future years."
"We should remember that the internal market has only just been completed."
"We should recognize that a considerable degree of economic convergence has already been achieved between the richer and poorer parts of the European Union."
"Yet we still have a wide degree of variation between the economic performance of the Member States, and indeed the traditions of government management of the economies."
"We should not jump to any rash conclusions about the need for the harmonization of tax in order to create equality of competition."
"We should also remember that whatever laws or whatever rules we make will apply to an enlarged Community where economic convergence will be much less than what it is today."
"The report is therefore a good basis for consideration but we must not do anything rash until we see properly how the Single Market with freedom of movement for people and money interacts with taxation policy and fair competition."
"In relation to some countries, I have heard it said that the manufacturing profits tax imposed by the Irish Government on manufacturing industry distorts competition."
"Yet I would like to point out here that when you consider the high rates of personal taxation, when you consider the social welfare system, when you consider the high rates of taxation on transport, you will find that the government is wiping out with some policies concessions that it gives to others and, in fact, competition is not at all distorted."
"It will take a number of years before we know what is actually happening."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate Mr Lamfalussy, the committee and the rapporteurs."
"The reports before us indicate that we are making considerable progress towards achieving economic and monetary union."
"A number of major political events have recently intervened in the final phase of preparations, and in a democracy it is logical and advisable to take account of such signals from the public."
"If we fail to do so, we shall simply undermine Europe's credibility further still."
"What is currently happening with the stability pact is supported not just by France, but by Parliament and Parliament's largest political group."
"It is not true, Mrs Peijs, that those who want the stability pact to have a proactive growth component are trying to derail public finances."
"For us there is no contradiction."
"We want compliance with the stability pact and the budget criteria, but the name of the pact is actually the pact for stability and growth, and the growth aspect also needs to be given attention."
"Proactive measures can take various forms."
"Monetary policy in the stricter sense can be tailored towards employment as well as inflation."
"The White Paper can be implemented in full, alongside the Member States' own labour market policies and in addition to a different, alternative form of taxation system to produce lower social taxes."
"So we are in favour of the timing of the euro and we also wish to see compliance with the letter and spirit of the convergence criteria."
"This does not mean 3.0 for a country such as France with a debt ratio of less than 60 %, and there needs to be room for some discussion on this point."
"We support an independent European Central Bank, but with democratic supervision by Parliament and a kind of economic government by the Council."
"So what we favour is a twin-track approach."
"First, prove that we are right to be confident about the exact timing for the introduction of EMU and, secondly, introduce a procedure for expanding the stability pact."
"Mr President, I will not bother congratulating Mr Lamfalussy and the Commission because I think they have had enough for one morning."
"I should like to speak on the report on VAT."
"Value added tax is probably the only true European tax."
"It is also the tax which touches the lives of every European citizen."
"This tax, though, does not come without its problems."
"There are problems of differential rates in the various Member States; there are problems of implementation of the tax; there are problems on the collection of the tax."
"All these problems and differences expose numerous loopholes."
"It is the exploitation of these loopholes which is responsible for the massive fraud which is occurring within the European Union today."
"It is therefore imperative that any system of VAT which we adopt must be able to tackle the problem of fraud."
"That is why the Socialist Group calls for a common system of VAT which is simple, transparent and above all, easily monitored."
"A VAT system based on taxation in the country of origin would seem to be the best method available to reduce the scope for fraud."
"The goal of the single European market is one which this Parliament is striving to achieve, but that also brings forward problems in the harmonization of taxation."
"In the field of value added tax this, on the face of it, would create innumerable problems."
"Cultural differences have led to different rates on the same items in different Member States."
"So, should we harmonize all levels of VAT?"
"I believe that is not necessary."
"As my colleague, Mrs Randzio-Plath, said, harmonization should only occur where it is necessary and can be effective."
"As I said at the beginning of this speech, VAT touches the lives of every European citizen."
"Therefore the system we adopt has to be simple, fair and effective."
"If it is not then we run the risk of alienating the citizens of Europe."
"Without the people's support we are no longer a Union."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to speak in this very interesting debate to refer to various questions and in particular the uncertainty that prevails in the European Union and is reflected in public opinion and the front pages of today's newspapers."
"First of all, uncertainty over the fulfilment of the convergence criteria in particular by the two central countries: Germany and France."
"Secondly, uncertainty over the possible postponement of entry into effect of Monetary Union, due to the previous question."
"Thirdly, uncertainty over approval and the functioning and effective application of the stability plan."
"Fourthly, uncertainty over compatibility between the logic of Monetary Union and the strategy to boost growth and employment."
"Uncertainty or argument that can be handled in different ways."
"Given all these uncertainties, I think, Commissioner and Mr Lamfalussy, that we must urgently send European public opinion and society a clear political message."
"First of all, that message must assert that Monetary Union will be achieved in accordance with the set timetable."
"In order to meet that aim, we must assess fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria using the flexibility foreseen in the Treaty and that has to be done at once."
"Secondly, we must affirm that Monetary Union will be accompanied by a coordination of economic policy between the Member States, with growth and job creation as the main objective."
"This strategy in favour of employment not only is not in contradiction with the logic of Monetary Union but, on the contrary, is precisely in the framework of the single currency where we shall achieve the vital level of autonomy to develop a European policy to boost growth and create jobs."
"Active growth policies that are currently coming up against serious limits in each Member State could be developed instead in the Union, by means of a common monetary policy."
"We must approve the instrument of a stable single currency, with low interest rates and less conditioning in respect of the external sector than that encountered at present by each of the currencies due to join the euro, in order to set in motion a European growth initiative."
"I would like finally to refer to the question of the flexibility of the labour market and our economies, a flexibility that often - this morning too - is considered to be the only requisite for growth."
"Our economies - it must be said - under the imperatives of the single market and fiscal consolidation - have achieved a highly appreciable level of flexibility during this decade."
"We are still far off the flexibility levels of Singapore, Thailand or the United States, but we enjoy a very high degree of flexibility by European standards, by the standards that are acceptable to our public opinions."
"These public opinions, bearing the sacrifices imposed by that flexibility, must be sent an urgent and positive message of hope, of confidence that Monetary Union will also make faster economic growth and more jobs possible."
"Mr President, one Member in this debate found bracketing fiscal issues and monetary union together a little forced."
"On the contrary, I have to say I found that bracketing very interesting."
"The single currency is the culmination of economic and monetary union, the essential basis of economic union is a properly functioning single market, and a well-functioning single market demands proper coordination of fiscal policies."
"I will now briefly discuss the fiscal policy aspects, which have been deepened very intelligently in the reports by Mr Fourçans and Mrs Randzio-Plath, and I thank them both for the important work carried out."
"I would like to start with a political point."
"We find ourselves at a stage in which the Member States are very much bound to the concept of fiscal sovereignty but are in fact largely losing that fiscal sovereignty to the benefit of the markets, as a result of mobility."
"The cover of a recent issue of the Economist was headed 'The disappearing taxpayer' ; it was about the phenomenon of mobility, which whittles away the tax base."
"As Mr Giansily and Mr De Rose have emphasized, subsidiarity is fundamental and so is national sovereignty."
"The Commission still considers it desirable to move from unanimity to qualified majority, at least for certain fiscal matters."
"Even if this does not happen, we must also make efforts to increase coordination of fiscal policies."
"The political stakes are very high: without coordination of fiscal policies, respecting subsidiarity, there can be no social market economy at European level, and no well-functioning market economy."
"There can be no social market economy because fiscal competition between the States is increasingly preventing each of them from redistributing income through the fiscal system."
"And the way fiscal competition takes place - so favourable to capital and adverse to labour, as Mr Wolf underlined - contributes to creating unemployment."
"Nor can there be a well-functioning market economy in Europe without fiscal coordination, given the obstacles facing firms, and indeed workers, in a single market without a minimum degree of fiscal harmonization."
"That is why the Commission has been taking a new approach for about a year, aimed at raising awareness amongst the Member States of the need to make progress and laying the foundations for consensus and concrete proposals."
"The Commission has put forward the VAT work programme dealt with in the Randzio-Plath report, the proposal for a directive for the taxation of energy products and a fiscal package being developed in the Fiscal Policy Commission."
"I agree with Mr Fourçans when he stresses that fiscal competition is not a negative phenomenon in itself, but it becomes one when it involves asymmetry and unfairness, as it does in many cases."
"As a result of continuous contact with the European Parliament, in particular with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and with the group of permanent representatives of the finance ministries, the Commission has been finalizing a fiscal package, which coincides in many respects with the lines proposed by Mr Fourçans, consisting of a code of conduct, especially as regards company taxation, measures to eliminate distortions in the taxation of capital, measures to eliminate deduction at source on interest and royalty payments between subsidiary companies and measures to eliminate some of the more significant distortions in indirect taxation."
"I now come to VAT."
"The new VAT system, dealt with in the Randzio-Plath report, is, in the Commission's view, an issue of the greatest importance."
"As you know, after the result of the vote on the Randzio-Plath report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on 22 April, nine amendments were presented and if you adopt them they will introduce changes the Commission thinks right."
"I very much appreciate the constructive attitude of all the political groups in deciding to reconsider certain extreme positions."
"I thank Mr Donnelly, My Thyssen, Mr Secchi and the others who have shown support for the Commission's project."
"The Commission has presented a precise programme of work with a political timetable organized in three stages: the first deals with improving the current VAT system and therefore addresses the perspective Mr Cox has identified; the second provides for the modernization of the VAT system as regards telecommunications services; the third will genuinely simplify the VAT system, moving to a system based on taxation in the country of origin."
"As Mrs Randzio-Plath has recognized, work is in progress on the preparation of this definitive system, to make simplicity its salient feature, responding above all - and here I turn to Mr Peijs and other Members of Parliament - to the needs of small and medium-sized firms and contributing to a major reduction in the serious phenomenon of fraud that exists today."
"I also want to reassure Mr Cox, Mrs Ewing, Mr Cornelissen and others that this will not be a leap in the dark, as every detail of the system will be covered and the issue of reduced rates will be examined in the light of social impact."
"I feel certain there is no divergence of views between us on an essential point: before moving to the system of taxation at origin, the current system must be modernized, applied more uniformly and, where possible, simplified."
"However, I would like it to be really clear that the proposal which we are examining is not limited to the transitional provisions but relates to the entire sixth VAT directive, which specifically includes these provisions."
"I conclude, Mr President, by observing that, in its report of a few months ago on convergence and in its annual report, the European Monetary Institute emphasizes the need for progress in fiscal harmonization, in particular as regards the return on capital."
"Finally I would like to thank the two rapporteurs and all the Members who have spoken."
"We shall continue to work on these delicate fiscal issues in close cooperation with the European Parliament."
"Lastly I would like to associate myself with the homage paid by my colleague Mr Silguy, on behalf of the Commission, to President Lamfalussy."
"Mr President, I do not wish to hold up the sitting, so I would just like to ask the Commissioner if he will answer my two specific questions in writing?"
"Yes, I will."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before I ask Mr President Lamfalussy to speak to conclude this debate, I think I am expressing the feelings of the majority of Members in this House, especially since this is the last time Mr Lamfalussy will be appearing here in this capacity in this Chamber, I should like in paying our sincerest, warmest tribute to him for the way he has collaborated with this Parliament and for giving us the benefit of his knowledge..."
"for his meticulousness and his personal qualities."
"Mr President Lamfalussy, please accept the warmest wishes of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot answer all of the questions that I have been asked but I shall try to answer the basic question underlying your debate."
"How can monetary policy meet ordinary people's expectations?"
"What can it not achieve and what should it not therefore promise?"
"The first aim that monetary policy has achieved is controlling inflation."
"That is a laudable direct aim: it must not be forgotten that inflation has always been behind most unfairness and inequalities."
"We are beginning to forget that now because we are fortunately coming out of a period of inflation."
"It should not, however, be forgotten that in periods of inflation the powerful and the rich can protect themselves against the ravages of inflation."
"It is the weak and the have-nots who cannot protect themselves from it."
"That is, in other words, a social aim that ought to be clearly put on the table."
"Once inflation has been brought under control, monetary policy can contribute to economic growth."
"It can contribute to it by bringing down short term interest rates."
"It has the means and the possibilities and has already done so."
"I only need remind you of the figures: in countries where inflation has now been under control for several years, short term interest rates are now around 3 %; in countries where the control of inflation is more recent short term interest rates are still a little higher, but are on the way down."
"In six months to two years that will undoubtedly have an effect on growth."
"On the other hand, monetary policy cannot bring down long term interest rates."
"That has to be made quite clear."
"I am particularly concerned with this: whereas long term interest rates, even in countries where short term interest rates are already very low, are relatively low, historically speaking, i.e. around 5.75 % to 6 %, real long term interest rates are still high, around 4 %."
"That poses a real problem."
"I do not think that those levels can be influenced by monetary policy."
"The reasons for this situation lie elsewhere, I think."
"Some people may fear that the euro will not be properly run: but that is not the fundamental explanation."
"I think that the fundamental explanation lies in two figures: between 1991 and 1996 public debt went up from 56 % to 73.5 % of GDP."
"There is no doubt that this huge increase has an effect on real long term interest rates and puts a brake on growth."
"In other words, monetary policy can influence growth but not without the help of budgetary policies."
"What can it do to help employment?"
"In that unemployment is due to anaemic growth, monetary policy can help within the limits that I have just indicated."
"In that unemployment is due to structural factors, without a lot to do with growth, it can have no direct influence."
"I rarely refer to particular countries, but allow me to mention my own: Belgium."
"Belgium and the Netherlands have been pursuing virtually identical monetary policies for six or seven years and very similar policies for a very long time."
"Yet the two countries' unemployment figures are quite different: 9.5 % in Belgium and 6 % in the Netherlands."
"Monetary policy cannot be held responsible for that difference."
"We have to realise that."
"I think that the resorption of that part of unemployment - nothing to do with weak growth but the largest part - has to do with the implementation of other policies, namely structural policies, labour market flexibility and policies concerning indirect contributions that affect labour costs."
"That policy can be pursued at European level."
"I think that the coordination of policies, as precisely and correctly described by Commissioner de Silguy, can be pursued at European level - but do not raise expectations that monetary policy cannot meet!"
"(Loud applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in the block voting time that will commence immediately."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, I think that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten should speak and then I shall answer her, if you will allow."
"Mr President, it was agreed in committee that something should be added to my original amendment, but unfortunately this has not been done."
"It was simply forgotten."
"The words 'stricter legislation concerning' should be added, otherwise the amendment does not make sense."
"Mr President, yes, I would agree to this oral amendment, if the European Parliament agrees because this Group is always in favour of measures to look after people's health and well-being."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I should like to ask for clarification."
"It has now been said at several points in the German interpretation in relation to confirming the vote that you will be holding a roll call vote."
"I think that either that has to be corrected in the German or that you have on several occasions said that there will be a roll call instead of an electronic vote."
"Could you please sort this out because we do not have roll call votes in these circumstances."
"But if there really is to be a roll call vote, you should make that clear."
"As I said I do not know whether this is just a problem with the German interpretation or whether that is what all of the interpreters have said."
"Mr Friedrich, I hope that the problem occurred only with the German vote, because when I announce a vote I always make sure that I say exactly which vote it is."
"Mr President, we have a further problem with the vote on Paragraph 15. It had been agreed with the rapporteur that it was not strictly necessary to create a new political body here and that this task could be taken over by the existing bodies."
"That was what was agreed, and it was also the rapporteur's suggestion."
"We therefore ought - and I apologize for only now realizing this - to have voted separately on the word 'new' in Paragraph 15."
"As Mr Friedrich has pointed out, we did not even know that it was a roll call vote."
"I have to say that I too have some problems with the interpretation from the Greek."
"My own Greek is not so very fluent, Mr President, but I am doing my best."
"This is a very important political issue."
"I would vote against this report if we cannot reach agreement on it."
"I would also call on my friends to vote against the Fourçans report, although this distresses me greatly when I think about my friend, Mr Fourçans."
"I would therefore suggest that the rapporteur be given the floor again."
"Mr von Wagau, first of all let me say that after all of the discussions there is one corrigendum published to the Fourçans report, namely where the word 'new' occurs."
"It has therefore been put to the vote with the word 'new' ."
"Secondly, the rapporteur has been at pains to frame all of the points on which discussion led to a conclusion and in each case I pointed out where the addition or other change occurred, for the vote, either roll call or electronic."
"So I do not think there has been a problem at all, and I think that you know what you are voting on."
"Mr President, I should like to reassure Mr von Wogau that the word 'new' is not in the text."
"If it is there, it is an administrative error, because in committee we voted for a text without the word 'new' ."
"There must have been a transcription error."
"So the word 'new' is not in the text."
"Mr President, to save the honour of the Sittings service, I shall explain matters."
"As a result of yesterday's negotiations, there was a corrigendum in which the word 'new' was deleted."
"But the majority voted against it."
"I have no idea why."
"A vote was then taken on the original text."
"If you look at your papers you will see that Paragraph 15 contains the word 'new' ."
"If we could agree that the word 'new' should be deleted and the necessary correction made, then we would be happy with that."
"Mr von Wogau, as you are aware, the word 'new' does not appear."
"There is a corrigendum, which is not being voted on, of course, in which the word 'new' is absent."
"You need not worry."
"Before the final vote"
"Mr President, in the light of Mr von Wogau's remarks, I think that we should clear the matter up before the final vote."
"Paragraph 15 of the report submitted to the committee, i.e. the one adopted on 22 May and the subject of the written report, contained the word 'new' ."
"In any case, it is included in the written report."
"Did the text adopted by the committee include it or not?"
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, it has already been made clear that the word 'new' does not appear."
"That is how the report has been approved thus far and how it will be approved finally if you vote for it."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, this new directive on TV broadcasting activities contains some positive aspects, especially since, in the field of subsidiarity, it acknowledges the fundamental responsibility of the Member States and their legal competence."
"On the other hand, on the question of the protection of minors, there is a clearly defined concern to work in conjunction with parents, through their representatives in associations and educators of all kinds, and to see how they can filter programmes that might be harmful to children, in particular thanks to technical mechanisms."
"Another positive aspect concerns the condemnation of pornography."
"On the other hand, this new directive sins by omission on some basic points."
"It is not of much use to reaffirm the desire or the intention to encourage European productions unless the necessary measures are taken to ensure European producers the possibility of producing and broadcasting."
"The fact that a freedom is proclaimed in abstract, without ensuring the means, and in particular the financial and economic means, is virtually tantamount to hypocrisy."
"Nobody want quotas as an absolute but it is, as they say in mathematical logic, a necessary but insufficient condition."
"It is not enough to have quotas to have good European productions but it is an absolutely necessary condition."
"Unfortunately, this revision of the Television without frontiers Directive does not contain any provisions on quotas, and it is therefore the ideology of a materialistic concept of the market that wins the day. That is not, however, the only concept of the market."
"We are all in favour of the market as a necessary economic phenomenon for dynamism, without its being an absolute."
"In this area, as in others, this has unfortunately not been taken into account."
"Here we are faced with the joint draft text adopted by the Conciliation Committee on updating the Television without frontiers directive."
"At previous votes, the European Parliament was the target of unjustified criticism by certain private operators, accusing it of being protectionist."
"I wish to pay tribute to the European Parliament's work and that of its negotiators, who have managed to obtain a compromise acceptable to everyone at the Conciliation Committee."
"On the three aspects that we classified as priorities (non-encrypted access to major events, anti-violence chips and independent producers), I think that the first one is of crucial importance."
"Where the broadcasting of sporting events or other major events is concerned, what would have been the logic of granting exclusive broadcasting rights to given operators, preventing thousands of people from sharing their enjoyment?"
"Let us take the examples of the Olympics or the World Cup, which have millions of spectators."
"I think it would have been harmful to grant broadcasting monopolies, for the sake of commercial and financial interest."
"Our Parliament took a wise decision."
"It must now be taken up by the Governments."
"I am delighted to support this conciliation agreement today."
"As a keen sports fan myself, I am relieved that major national sporting events will still be available to the public on regular television channels."
"Each of our countries has certain sports events which are more than just competitions between teams or athletes."
"They are an important part of popular culture and should be enjoyed by the nation as a whole."
"Although these negotiations with the Council of Ministers have dragged on for some time, the result is a victory for all sports fans."
"My own country is making sure that our football cup final, cricket internationals and tennis from Wimbledon are available to the general public."
"I am tempted to ask if the Council could guarantee my favourite teams and players a place in these finals, but for the moment I am satisfied with the minor miracle which this compromise represents."
"Millions of sports fans can feel that they have won the cup today."
"The European Parliament has today adopted the 'TV Directive' which has come to us from conciliation."
"The directive, and particularly the solutions reached in the conciliation procedure are among the few items of EU decision-making which directly affect the everyday life of citizens."
"The directive seeks to protect for the citizen the TV broadcasting of major events such as sporting competitions on a TV channel accessible to all."
"The televising of major events in such a way that all have equal opportunities to see the programmes is the responsibility of the Member States."
"All Member States should now make use of this power in the interests of their citizens and should define, together with the sporting organizations, those important events which they want to secure for universal viewing."
"The recommendation adopted in the conciliation committee for lists drawn up at national level was intended to reassure the market in advance and prevent overheating."
"It does not prevent competition or preclude sporting organizations from having access to important sources of income."
"It is also to the sports organizations' and competition organizers' advantage to ensure the widest possible audience for the most important events."
"In the European Parliament, and particularly in its Culture Committee, there was concern to develop TV programmes in the interests of children."
"There was also a strong public opinion demanding action to protect minors."
"The proposed technical devices for filtering programmes are not, however, without problems."
"A particularly careful attitude needs to be taken to any kind of pre-censoring, which would not in any case be effective."
"There is therefore a continued need for further research in cooperation between the Commission and the Member States' authorities on the various possibilities of regulation."
"In particular, the protection of minors must be implemented at national level."
"Broadcasters of programmes must take responsibility for the protection of minors."
"In its current form, the report is at best an uneasy compromise."
"It is no longer possible to prevent cultural products being completely subject to market forces (quotas); the compromise rules arrived at for the new services, the guarantee funds, the independent producers and the criteria for establishing them as well as for the promotion of European products are reliant on extremely vague Commission promises."
"As far as culturally and socially influenced programme content is concerned, we are therefore seeing the information society get under way with general commercial pressure winning out over cultural diversity."
"That is a bad omen for things to come."
"We have, however, to recognize that this is better than nothing."
"It at least protects minors and guarantees that important sporting events will be broadcast."
"We have therefore abstained."
"Perry report (A4-0190/97)"
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats welcome the fact that European citizens, through their complaints to the Committee on Petitions, have helped to put important issues on the EU agenda."
"Amongst other things, we are very happy that animal transport and human rights have been taken up in the committee."
"It is also a positive development that EU citizens have begun to make use of the Ombudsman, who has proved to be particularly effective in dealing with cases."
"Díez de Rivera Icaza report (A4-0183/97)"
"Mr President, I am delighted that the Díez de Rivera Icaza report has been adopted, and particularly paragraphs 29-31 relating to the very serious problem of aircraft noise."
"As the Member who represents one of the largest parts of London, near to Heathrow Airport and affected by the noise created by that airport, I am very pleased indeed."
"I am, in fact, president of a consortium of local, municipal authorities who are concerned about the noise issue."
"At the moment there is a public enquiry into the expansion of Heathrow Airport to almost twice its present size."
"The issue of noise is a very important consideration in that respect."
"The European Commission has done much over the years to create quieter aircraft but that is going to be undermined if we allow even more aircraft to fly, particularly outside daylight hours."
"During the night, when other noises are minimal and people are trying to sleep, even the quietest aircraft produce a disturbing amount of noise."
"There is new scientific evidence to suggest that public health is much affected by this."
"So I am delighted that these paragraphs have been adopted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, initially the Commission planned to introduce a regulation against noise."
"Aware of the harm done by noise to the health of millions of Europeans, it seemed to want to take specific, practical and robust measures."
"It seems now that we must now be content with a Green Paper, which should make it possible to hold a major debate on noise: a lots of 'ifs' for little effectiveness."
"That is to be regretted."
"Public debate is all very well, but it should lead to the introduction of binding Community provisions."
"It is no longer acceptable that Community policy should neglect anti-noise policy and I am sure the Commission is aware of that."
"We live in a noisy society and it is for the authorities to limit noise sources, and the intensity of noise emitted."
"It is a public health problem."
"As the rapporteur stressed, the main sources of noise must be ascertained and aims and guidelines must be worked out. We must then apply common assessment methods and determine common indices for noise sources, before contemplating common legislation."
"The European Union should no longer accept that 70 % of its population is subjected to unacceptable levels of noise pollution."
"We are ready to discuss that!"
"But we must above all take efficient, swift measures, aimed solely at protecting public health."
"I must congratulate Mrs Díez de Rivera on her serious, high quality piece of work."
"- The overwhelming majority vote just obtained in this House in favour of anti-noise legislation confirms what my report says and what was said at the heated debated last Monday."
"It distinctly emerges that the citizens demand a clear legislative policy to this effect which sets objectives and options for priority actions for reducing intolerable noise levels."
"Annex III to my report includes two letters from Juan Ramón Jiménez against noise, which I think are a treat, expressing this same concern about noise back in 1919..."
"For all the above reasons I do not doubt that the Commission, buoyed up by this voting, will be able to provide a global and coordinated response to the request we are all making."
"Finally, I should like to express my thanks for the cooperation I have received from everyone, especially from Mrs Graenitz, who stood in for me so well during my illness."
"The concerns expressed about budgetary intervention are quite understandable when, with the single currency, countries will cease to be able to intervene in monetary and exchange procedures."
"But such intervention is very limited, since national budgetary deficits are not allowed to exceed 3 % of GDP - we are hoping to keep to the Stability Pact - and since it is neither convenient nor easy to increase taxes."
"The rapporteur, Mr Fourçans, rightly points out the need for greather harmonization in this matter, especially as regards the taxation of company savings and profits to avoid fiscal dumping, which above all exacerbates the already widespread tendency to tax work carried out for other persons."
"But on the other hand curtailing participation in the national budget requires that, contrary to what some people are still maintaining, the Union Budget should exceed 1.2 % of GDP, so that in particular it is able to give greater support to countries which are lagging behind in structural terms."
"We must always have budgetary stringency, but that is not to say that a shortsighted approach should pose a threat to a project which will be decisive for the success of our collective metarmorphosis."
"The report contains many good addenda and specific points for the Commission's important Green Paper on combating noise."
"This is why we are supporting the report in the final vote."
"But we cannot support points E, 1, 11, 12, 15, 22, 23, and 30."
"These points advocate European framework legislation for an area which we most definitely consider should be subject to the principle of subsidiarity."
"Mezzaroma report (A4-0194/97)"
"Mr President, the 1996 report by the European Monetary Institute reveals once again the weakness of growth in Europe and the unbearable levels of unemployment, which continue to weigh down on public accounts and aggravate social imbalances."
"Faced with this situation, unfortunately, most countries are trying to meet the convergence criteria, not by reforming their administrations but by increasing taxes, braking growth even further, something that could expose the growth concerned to serious political problems, as has just been seen in France."
"This leads us to a paradox."
"Whereas preparation for the single currency should in the mind of its promoters, offer an opportunity for stricter public management favouring liberalisation and growth, it has turned out, given the blockages in our societies, to be a depressive mechanism attracting more and more taxes towards the public sphere."
"Alas, this situation is the subject of no serious analysis."
"The governments are going to content themselves tomorrow with interpreting the criteria as trends, which means putting rigour on to the back-burner."
"Others want to add an 'employment' chapter to the stability pact which, in the framework of today's Europe, would just be a little window-dressing."
"Switching to the single currency in these conditions would only prepare for a weak euro, with little credibility, quickly turning into a source of tension between the participants and cancelling out most of the advantages expected on paper of monetary unification."
"We should also ask why Europe currently seems to be sinking into paralysis."
"I see two reasons: one is that the European policy of building a super-State is trying to unify everything, including the currency, by imposing new rigid restraints, and on the other hand - it cannot be said enough - the policy of a poorly conducted international opening has led to higher unemployment, thereby compromising the conditions for achieving the single currency."
"Finally, the destroyers of Europe are hiding in Brussels itself."
"As this report is based on the fact that economic and monetary union will come about and also supports this project, we have abstained in the final vote on the report."
"Should EMU come into being, of course we would want democratic control of the European Central Bank to be as strong as possible."
"But the most appropriate course of action is for national parliaments to have democratic control over monetary policy via their elected representatives."
"While the economic convergence criteria are a major topic of discussion within the European Union, at the end of the day a political judgement must be made."
"The gold revaluation dispute and the results of the election in France should not cause the next phase of EMU to be delayed."
"A delay resulting from the French Government's insistence on renegotiating or reviewing the Stability Pact rules could change the political atmosphere and this would not be good for Europe."
"I believe that this would result in instability."
"This House must call on the heads of state to make a clear and unequivocal statement at the Amsterdam Summit and insist on proceeding as planned to the single currency on 1 January 1999."
"Europe has too much to lose by not complying with the conditions and the approach as laid down by Maastricht."
"The benefits of EMU are obvious."
"Ettl report (A4-0185/97)"
"As this report is also based on the fact that economic and monetary union will come about and it supports this project, we have abstained in the final vote on the report."
"Should EMU come into being, we would of course want the European Central Bank to be as open as possible in its activities."
"But it is important to stress that subsidiarity must prevail by permitting national parliaments to exercise democratic control over their own respective National Banks so that monetary policy can be democratically controlled."
"The report contains some positive features in its assessment of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the European Monetary Institute (EMI) and the activities of the European Central Bank, such as the view that it is necessary to develop democratic supervision for the Central Bank."
"A shortcoming of the report is its almost complete failure to touch on the issue of boosting employment."
"It is not possible to reduce the present high unemployment simply by monetary and economic mechanisms, and there is a need for an active finance policy, i.e. the more effective use of taxation and public forms of subsidy to promote employment."
"The stability and growth pact described in connection with EMU should also be examined from the point of view of promoting employment."
"In the debate on the EU's economic policy, Parliament in particular should prioritize employment and the elimination of social exclusion."
"The reports under discussion here are notably on the issue of employment."
"For these reasons, I voted against adoption of the report."
"Fourçans report (A4-0192/97)"
"Mr President, I suppose we will have to pay Commissioners overtime so that they can stay."
"As of 2002, the single currency will get rid of the budgetary shock-absorber, i.e. the monetary sluice-gates that enable different economies to rise to different levels."
"The only adaptation variable will, of course, be the budgetary variable and taxation in particular."
"Only, a single currency will make the differences of taxation pressures between States more sensitive and will favour relocations."
"I offer the example of what has happened to national rights: in Spain, for example, when the Basque Country lowered company tax rates, companies left Madrid for Bilbao."
"The same thing happened in France, over the Marne department car tax."
"The only way of avoiding injustice between, for example, ' relocatable' capital income and other revenues would be to plan for a European fiscal constitution adding at least a fifth criterion, providing for a ceiling on compulsory levies for all fifteen counties, a ceiling that might be set at, for example, an average of 40 % of GDP."
"That would then avoid having too many distortions."
"As this report is also based on the fact that economic and monetary union will come about and it supports this project, we have abstained in the final vote on the report."
"Above all, we take particular exception to point 15 in the report proposal."
"It proposes that 'a political body with considerable economic powers' be established with a view to developing a 'real combination of different political and economic instruments and the establishment of a mechanism for achieving standardisation' ."
"We cannot support in any way whatsoever such political centralisation."
"Point 16 of the report proposal also proposes that the European Parliament establish a 'committee of economic advisers' ."
"There are plenty of acknowledged experts whom Members of Parliament can consult for advice without establishing new committees and bodies. Unfortunately there are already too many of these within EU institutions."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for his work in producing a good report."
"But we could not support points 7 and 15 at the vote."
"Point 7 would involve the use of totally subjective criteria for the control of budgetary discipline."
"The implementation of working in such a way would seriously threaten the stability of the single currency and in so doing also threaten opportunities for growth and employment."
"We think that a single currency is very important for growth and employment but there is a requirement that those countries who participate in the currency union should also contribute to a strong and stable single currency."
"As far as point 15 is concerned, we think that the rapporteur's basis for a new political body in relation to EMU is a legal one in view of the need for increased democratic control."
"But we do not consider that the model proposed in point 15 will satisfy this need."
"The Fourçans report on the coordination of budgetary and taxation policies in the future single currency system shows very well, albeit involuntarily, the impasse in which Europe finds itself."
"Given economic uncertainties, countries will have their national abilities to make responses to given situations greatly reduced, and there will be nothing at European level to take over that responsibility."
"Imbalances therefore are likely to grow more easily."
"The European Union would then enter a zone of profound upheaval, if we judge correctly."
"Let us explain ourselves."
"In any economic area, a country can be hit by a particular economic accident, such as the bankruptcy of a major industry, very serious social unrest, etc. What economist call 'asymmetrical shocks' ."
"To remedy those situations, countries have several weapons at their disposal: monetary policy, exchange rate policy, budgetary policy, for example."
"But under the future system of the single currency, these national instruments will disappear or see their effectiveness reduced; internal changes will no longer be flexible but fixed by definition; interest rate policy will be unified; budgetary room for manoeuvre will be confined within tight limits by the stability pact; taxes can no longer be raised sharply, as the single market will prevail; more generally, economic policies will be coordinated and subordinated to Community aims, in accordance with Articles 102A and 103 of the Treaty."
"In such a hypothesis, theory teaches us that the country facing the imbalance should be able to find help from a central European budget."
"But that barely exists at present and the Fourçans report acknowledges the fact that we should not dream in the immediate future of setting up budgetary and taxation federalism in Europe."
"Not only are people opposed to it, but in any case even if nobody opposed it, such an upheaval, which would call for most taxation levers in our countries to be harmonized and very substantial European levies to be raised, would not be possible in the short term."
"This impasse is all the more worrying since the 'asymmetrical shocks' are not exceptional phenomena or marginal ones as we have heard some people in this Chamber pretend."
"In reality, when you have countries and societies with different economies, they never evolve in an exactly parallel fashion."
"Their relations are marked by asymmetrical 'slides' , constantly moving, that so far have been readjusted gently by equal slides in monetary parities."
"This brings us back to the fundamental question: the usefulness of several different currencies when there are several different peoples."
"Finally, it appears that the countries of Europe, propelled by ideologues, had rushed headlong into the adventure of the single currency, without first of all checking to see whether all the conditions were met and whether they actually had the vital instruments needed to see it through."
"We are now practically up against the wall."
"Is there a way out, enabling us to go further down the same line to accelerated unification?"
"I do not think so."
"If we wanted to go down it, we would have to propose to our people, in no uncertain terms, radical constitutional changes that nobody wants, really."
"The Fourçans report tries to evoke the possibility of setting up at European level a political body comprising representatives of all the Member States, subjected to solid democratic controls and that would play the role of coordinating national economic policies."
"We can see hints here of the famous 'economic government of Europe' which, in the current disarray of minds, serves as a lifebuoy for right and left alike."
"Unfortunately, this idea leads nowhere because if that 'government' wants to be anything other than a talking shop, it needs strong and specific powers; yet those powers could only be granted if we carried out radical constitutional reforms, which as we saw earlier are impossible."
"We are in a Catch-22 situation."
"The only solution is to abandon the single currency and take a more progressive approach, a more reasonable approach, tailored to the real situation. For example the single currency could be superimposed on the national currencies, which would enable the people to learn about it gradually."
"This report deals, inter alia , with the consequences, at the level of fiscal policy, of the adoption of the single currency."
"From that point of view the clarity and coherence of this document are to be congratulated. As may be clearly seen, if there is to be a single European economy, it needs, in addition to a single monetary policy, single budgetary and fiscal policies."
"The question, as this report rightly stresses, is to know who defines the objectives and implements the instruments of fiscal policy within the area of the European Union."
"According to the author of this document that could only be the economic governor of Europe, whose president is independent of the Member States with a mandate outstripping the Presidency of the Union."
"Such a governor would then naturally become the political governor of Europe."
"Since I still have doubts about real convergence of the economies of each of the States, I cannot subscribe to the premises and proposals contained in this report."
"Giving up fiscal sovereignty is tantamount to saying that the smaller, more peripheral States of the Union will no longer have available an important instrument for attracting investment, wealth, companies and job creation."
"The lack or inadequacy of infrastructures, the inability - due to various factors - to attract investment and lagging technology, as seen in the smaller, poorer economies of some States, can be overcome only by retaining fiscal sovereignty."
"A single fiscal policy would at the moment and in this context have the effect of preserving the lack of competitiveness both on the internal market and on the external market."
"I do not think that is right in these circumstances, which is why I cannot vote for the content of this report."
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats voted for the Fourçans report today."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree with the rapporteur that there is a need for a certain coordination of budgetary and fiscal policy in the EU."
"We also strongly agree that tax exemptions and social dumping in some Member States represent a very serious problem."
"We hereby call upon Ireland and other Member States to which this may be relevant to drop tax schemes that are advantageous to firms but unfair to the other Member States."
"The Danish Social Democrats favour very wide-ranging exchanges of information and coordination of initiatives between the Member States."
"First and foremost, to promote employment."
"However, we do not agree with the rapporteur that the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union at the third stage requires a new political body with considerable economic powers."
"We think that ECOFIN is an excellent and adequate forum for the cooperation that is needed."
". (DA) The People's Movement against Membership of the European Union, which I represent, cannot support this report."
"Since the preconditions for the introduction of EMU are not in place, it is clear that EMU is primarily a political project."
"Approximation of budgetary and fiscal policy should have taken place in a natural way and prior to the introduction of EMU, if it were in any way to prove necessary or desirable."
"Instead of this, attempts are being made to introduce harmonizations through the back door, thereby undermining the last vestiges of an independent economic policy in the Member States."
"The reference in the report to asymmetrical crises should automatically trigger a reflection on the warnings which American economists have sounded. Since the Member State labour markets are not wage-flexible, it will put disproportionately heavy pressure on general EMU policy if individual Member States run into difficulties."
"This will undermine the credibility of EMU and may invalidate all the claimed advantages of a common currency and approximated budgetary and fiscal policy."
"The report is contradictory on several points."
"The introduction states that the single currency as such will not influence taxation policy."
"Further on in the text it says the opposite, that tax competition and tax dumping will force a 'code of conduct' into being, in other words that countries will undertake not to introduce taxation policies which are in conflict with the 'interests of the Union' , or alternatively will lead to tax harmonisation."
"There is mention of common taxation on capital, companies and border trade."
"The Centre group thinks that tax policy should continue to be a national matter."
"For this reason, I have voted against the report."
". (DA) The June Movement votes against the monetary dictatorship of the Maastricht Treaty and has therefore supported a number of amendments which offer scope for more economic remedies and for action on employment."
"However, that does not mean we want to be a party to any transfer of economic policy instruments from the Member States to the EU."
"For the participants in the single currency the commencement of the third stage of economic and monetary union will mean handing over sensitive sectors of economic policy to the European Union and the European System of Central Banks."
"The stability pact, which will serve as the main policy instrument, will be used by the big financial interests which control the policy choices of Brussels as a vehicle for stepping up their demands."
"The concept of national government as an institution vested with executive power will effectively vanish, and the national parliaments will, in essence, lose their competence in these matters."
"The situation will not be all that different for the countries 'with a derogation' ."
"The strengthening of multilateral supervision and the intensity of the pressures to adjust to the convergence criteria and to avoid public deficits will render any notion of national competence on budgetary policy meaningless."
"As the time nears for commencement of the third stage and as the technical preparations are stepped up, so the situation that is being prepared for us looms ever more abhorrent."
"It is no coincidence that the clamour of indignation against Maastricht is increasing by the day and that in the face of growing working class anger political forces other than the communists are using slogans which distance them from the economic and monetary union provided for in the Maastricht Treaty: that they are trying to tinker with the provisions, talking about introducing a social element into convergence and maintaining that nominal objectives cannot by themselves achieve growth and that measures to support workers are also necessary."
"Of course, they have not yet gone as far as to propose that the intergovernmental conference that is now completing its work should amend the provisions concerned. Nor do they dissent from the fundamental principles and logic of the Maastricht Treaty."
"Our demand for the rejection of Maastricht is being shown to have been right."
"It is manifestly obvious that chasing after nominal convergence criteria cannot provide solutions for the problems of working people and society."
"It can only exacerbate them, as the facts of the situation are showing."
"We do not think that any of the individual solutions proposed by the rapporteur, such as allowing Member States leeway to tackle significant exceptional circumstances or permitting a European derogation from the Maastricht and stability pact indicators, or establishing some form of coordination of taxation policies within those frameworks, can work at a time when the very concept of independent economic policy based on response to particular situations as they arise and on the choices of the peoples and governments of the Member States has to all intents and purposes been rendered meaningless."
"We disagree totally with the rapporteur's proposals for a form of 'economic government' The institutional edifice of the EU has no need of new political bodies or of any strengthening of the Commission's information-gathering powers."
"Such measures are aimed only at polishing up the image of the EU and at deflecting the anxieties of the people about the transfer of economic and political authority to certain opaque and remote bureaucratic mechanisms over which they will have no control."
"In our opinion a better future can come only through total rejection of the institutional framework of economic and monetary union, of the brutal monetarist policy that it imposes, and adoption of another perception on economic growth that can combine recovery with improvement of the position of working people and widening of their rights."
"The message from the people encapsulated in the recent French elections, the escalating anger of the citizens and the steadfast struggle of the workers and trades union movement can open the way to destruction of Maastricht and economic and monetary union and to growth based on concern for human beings and their needs."
"Randzio Plath report (A4-0164/97)"
"Mr President, we tried to harmonize VAT and, as Mrs Randzio-Plath herself admits, the result is a disaster."
"It is a disaster in terms of the rules, leading to complexity rather than the aim of simplicity, with over 130 derogations, 66 possible options, without counting the different rules for the localisation of operations."
"It is also a budgetary disaster, as a result of fraud, in that, since there are no more border controls, fraud by taxi (i.e. false addresses in two countries doing trade) has obviously increased."
"The only solution left, it seems, is to compound the mistake by levying VAT in the country of origin, which would call for compensation funds with macro-economic criteria based on GDP."
"Excuse me, Mr President, but when you know what the Court of Audit says about GDP calculation in Greece or Portugal, then you can see what disputes there would be between the countries."
"The only solution again is the same one as for budgetary policy: establishing another convergence criterion, taking advantage of the IGC."
"We must bring about a global harmonization by means of a compulsory levy ceiling and perhaps, if I were proEuropean - which I am not - I would try and think about the free choice of the least taxed geographical avenue, as is already the case for the rich and for capital, since the holders of capital revenue can shop around in Europe in terms of rules and regulations and go wherever they are least heavily taxed, which is not the case for workers."
"Now you understand, Mr President, why the rich are so much in favour of Europe."
"We think that there is no real need for harmonisation of value added tax for the internal market to function since value added tax does not affect the comparative competitiveness of domestic or imported goods."
"We also take strong exception to the two proposals in point 19 of the report proposal."
"We think that the principle of unanimity should be applied in the Council of Ministers for all tax matters."
"Nor can there be any question of majority decision making being applied to matters of indirect taxation which are raised in the Council of Ministers."
"Value added tax is extremely important to the Swedish National Budget."
"Sweden is a country which has one of the highest levels of value added tax in the EU."
"We simply cannot agree to transfer decision making rights over an issue which is so important to us to the Council of Ministers."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for a well prepared report."
"We could not support point 19, which concerns majority decision making on tax matters, at the vote."
"We think that the Council should, in the main, continue to handle tax matters in accordance with the principle of unanimity."
"But we think that common minimum standards for capital tax, company tax and environmental taxes ought to be drawn up and that decisions in the Council concerning these areas ought to be adopted according to the principle of the qualified majority vote."
"Mr President, the Randzio-Plath report on the common VAT system invented by the Commission gives hope to all those who think that the madness of certain projects can be halted after all."
"The new VAT system being proposed to us is apparently founded on the taxation of goods and services in the country of origin (and not, as at present, in the country of destination), and would treat all European countries as a single domestic market where rates, packages and all other rules would have to be brought into line."
"This system would take away national decision-taking autonomy (is it not its main aim?) over a resource as vital for the States as this - since VAT receipts accounts, for example, for half of all French tax revenue."
"That loss of autonomy would lead to rates being harmonized regardless of national needs, other than suffering disastrous relocations, and the allocation of revenue no longer in State control."
"In fact there would have to be a very rough European share-out mechanism, based not on the real flows of goods and services but on the basis of statistics relating to the countries' GDP."
"We are pleased to note that, in a quantum leap of realism, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of the European Parliament considered as 'untimely' the introduction of this new system and urged the Commission to put all its energy into improving the existing system."
"It is true that this realism has been stimulated by the negative positions taken by several Member States."
"It is also true that it contains certain flaws."
"For example, the resolution ends with an appeal for majority decisions at Council, rather than unanimity, in taxation matters."
"That rule would have disastrous results as it would put an end to the only serious brake on the Commission's federalist activism."
"Another example: the European Parliament's appeal for improving the existing system does not go as far as mentioning why the current system is flawed and riddled with fraud (everyone now recognizes that: it is because, to satisfy the dogma of abolishing internal borders, customs controls have been abolished and replaced by simple voluntary declarations)."
"We would like to think that between maintaining certain outdated formalities and totally abolishing controls it might have been possible, if we had looked hard enough, to find a compromise version, satisfying the need for a safe taxation system while meeting the legitimate demand for simplification coming from the corporate sector."
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats today voted for the Randzio-Plath report as a whole, but against its proposal that the collection of VAT on commercial transactions should be based on the country-of-origin principle, that VAT-rate differentiation should apply on an EU-wide basis and that majority voting should be introduced in the Council for decision-making on tax issues."
"The Danish Social Democrats favour a certain coordination of policy on taxes and duties at EU level but wish to retain powers at national level to decide on VAT questions of key importance."
"It should still not be possible to force Member States into taking decisions on tax issues against their will."
"For example, it should be for each individual Member State to decide on the level of VAT and on any differentiation in VAT rates."
"The Commission has proposed the introduction of a fully integrated VAT system by the year 1999, in which all transactions will be taxed in their country of origin and not, as is currently the case, in the country of consumption."
"There are plans for five different draft laws from the Commission in order to implement this common VAT system."
"The committee supports the proposal in principle but thinks that we are moving too fast."
"The proposal would mean totally harmonised, or in other words common tax rates, which would mean considerable changes and would reduce income from taxation in Sweden."
"Tax policy should really be a national issue."
"I have, therefore, voted against the report."
"In explaining my vote against the report on a common system of VAT I wish to express the following points."
"It is true that the present transitional system of VAT has functional shortcomings and that it facilitates fraud and non-payment."
"It is on those things that efforts to modify the system should be concentrated."
"No actions have been taken, however, to stamp out corruption, to make the taxation and scrutinizing authorities more efficient, to tackle tax evasion and to ensure that VAT that is due is paid."
"There is never any mention of applying a zero or reduced rate on various items and services with wide public consumption as a means to strengthening the purchasing power of the working classes and of alleviating the impact of the austerity policy."
"We dissent from the proposal that the country-of-destination principle should be replaced by the country-of-origin principle in regard to VAT collection."
"For many countries such a change would result in revenue loss and have extremely negative repercussions."
"Moreover, we think it is logical that as a tax on consumption VAT should be imposed and collected in the country where the consumption takes place."
"Some people will say, certainly, that introduction of the country-of-origin principle would be accompanied by introduction of a system of compensation, of a clearing procedure."
"We believe, however, that this would complicate the system even further. In addition, there is no guarantee that the principle of the neutrality of the tax would be safeguarded."
"One of the main elements of the common system of VAT being examined by the Commission as a possible important simplification is the single-place-of-taxation principle for firms."
"In our view that would constitute an interference in direct taxation matters and run counter to the agreements on the avoidance of double taxation of income which the Member States of the European Union have signed on the basis of the OECD's model double taxation agreement."
"Specifically, it would run counter to Article 5 of that model which refers to application of the 'permanent establishment' concept."
"We are against any attempt to increase VAT rates as a means either to increasing tax revenues or to offsetting revenue losses resulting from measures designed to reduce the insurance contributions of employers."
"On the other hand we do believe that reduction of the rates in certain circumstances for the purpose of boosting economic activity and, thus, employment in specific labour intensive undertakings and small and medium-sized businesses is a necessity."
"In our opinion a main portion of tax revenue should be provided by progressive direct tax."
"Any action aimed at burdening consumption would constitute additional theft of the incomes of working people and violate the fundamental principle which should underpin a taxation system, namely that it should contribute to the redistribution of income."
"That is the end of voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Telecommunications and ONP"
"The next item is the report (A4-0171/97) by Mrs Read, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive on interconnection in telecommunications with regard to ensuring universal service and interoperability through application of the principles of open network provision (ONP) (C4-0185/97-95/0207(COD))"
"Madam President, I am delighted to invite this Chamber to approve the joint text."
"Although it looks very short it was arrived at after many hours of patient discussion and negotiation."
"I draw your attention particularly to the items where we reached agreement on the financing of universal service, the study concerning the setting-up of a European regulatory authority, an agreement about the settlement of cross-border disputes, the issue of number portability for subscribers, the question of transparency, the basis of costs of interconnection and assistance for new providers seeking to enter the market."
"I know that the Commissioner will want to comment on the two statements concerning number portability and the endorsement of the position taken by this Parliament on the voice telephony directive in its first reading and also on the question of to whom the directive applies."
"I hope the Commissioner will be able to deal with this in his response."
"I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that there is no Council representative here; that should be included in the record."
"However the following statement, which applies to number portability, was drawn up by the Council at the conciliation meeting: ' The Council states that it will consider carefully and take into consideration the Commissioner's opinion' ."
"I know that colleagues who have followed this issue on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy will be aware that many issues might be more logically attended to in different directives and we look forward to the Commission's proposals on an overhaul and review of telecommunications legislation in 1999."
"Nevertheless, on interconnections, which are a pivotal part of the creation of the single market and the liberalization programme, it is to the credit of Parliament and its staff - and I would like to thank my colleagues who did so much to support me in this work - and thanks to the cooperation of the Council and the Commission that we have a well thought out, coherent and, I hope, effective piece of legislation."
"I request Parliament to approve the joint text."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to the successful outcome of the conciliation process, particularly, Mr Imbeni, Vice-President of the European Parliament and co-chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mrs Jorritsma, cochair of the Conciliation Committee, Mr von Wogau, the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and you, Mrs Read, the rapporteur."
"This directive is an important part of the new competition-oriented environment in telecommunications."
"New market operators will be able to reach existing end-users in a way that will promote increased investment and market growth in the telecommunications sector, within a predictable and stable regulatory framework."
"Organizations that hold a dominant market position will have to offer new market operators access and connection under transparent, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions."
"The directive will also guarantee the interconnection and interoperability of networks and services so that users throughout the Union continue to be guaranteed universal availability of telecommunications services."
"The result achieved by the Conciliation Committee is very satisfactory and, at the insistence of the European Parliament, the common position has been substantially improved in key areas: firstly, in regard to consideration of the advantages of a European regulatory authority; secondly, the funding of the universal service; thirdly, a cross-border arbitration process; fourthly, a cost-breakdown and cost-based pricing; fifthly, reasonably priced number portability and, sixthly, recommendations from the Commission for the development of a genuinely European market."
"As an integral part of the compromise finally reached by the Conciliation Committee and in the interests of clarity, the Commission is making two additional declarations to be included in the protocol to the interconnection directive as finally adopted. Firstly, we have a declaration on Article 7(1): the Commission confirms that Article 7(1) of the interconnection Directive is to be applied to organizations operating the public telecommunications networks and/or publicly available telecommunications services as set out in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I, which have been notified by national regulatory authorities as having significant market power, and only to those organisations."
"The Commission's second declaration refers to the revised directive on 'ONP voice-telephony' ."
"The Commission has undertaken, when it comes to state its position in the European Parliament's amendments at second reading, to accept the principle of Amendment No 25 to the interconnection directive, but it will carefully consider the implementation of the provisions identified and, in particular, the fact that the new number must be communicated free-of-charge to the user."
"In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the achievement of the Conciliation Committee which has enhanced the common position and takes into account the important amendments by the European Parliament at second reading."
"The final text boosts the Community aspect of the directive and improves consumer protection."
"The Commission therefore urges the European Parliament to accept the compromise text arrived at by the Conciliation Committee so that this important directive can at last be adopted."
"Madam President, can I thank the Commissioner but just query one small point in his presentation?"
"In the Commission statement on Article 7(1) which he read out, the English translation omitted the final phrase."
"This is a very important phrase, over which we spent many hours of negotiation, in that it applies to organizations which have been notified by national regulatory authorities as having significant market power."
"This is the part that did not come over in the English translation: ' and only to those organizations' ."
"This is a very crucial phrase."
"Can I have an assurance from the Commissioner that it will be in the Minutes, as it is contained in the report that we agreed at the conciliation?"
"It may just have been the translation tailing off."
"Madam President, to make things easy, I shall read out the definitive English version of the Commission declaration to avoid problems of translation."
"' The Commission confirms that Article 7 paragraph 1 of the Interconnection Directive is to be applied to all organisations operating the public telecommunication networks and/or publicly available telecommunication services as set out in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I, which have been notified by national regulatory authorities as having significant market power, and only to those organisations.'"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Production and marketing of honey"
"The next item is the report (A4-0191/97) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down general rules for the application of measures to improve the production and marketing of honey (COM(96)0596 - C4-0031/97-96/0282(CNS))."
"Madam President, on 20 January 1995, this House unanimously adopted my report on the difficult situation of European beekeepers and proposed direct support measures to safeguard apiculture in our Member States."
"At that time we sharply criticized as inadequate the Commission's half-hearted 1994 discussion paper on the situation of apiculture in Europe and made specific proposals for, among other things, a pollination premium and compensatory payments for loss of income attributable to the absence of Community preference."
"Almost two years later to the day, we were consulted on a Commission proposal which took no account of our proposals and concerns and again provides merely for half-hearted, selective measures to improve the production and marketing conditions for honey in the EU, on the basis of individual State programmes."
"Those programmes are intended to be only 50 % EU-funded;"
"ECU 15 m is earmarked for this in the EU budget, with the bulk of that - ECU 11.6 m - being destined for measures to combat bee diseases."
"Commissioner Fischler, our feelings range from disappointment to anger at the lack of understanding shown for the difficult position of commercial or part-time beekeepers, and the serious consequences for agriculture and the environment if not enough bees are raised to ensure that the pollination that is so important from both an ecological and an economic point of view takes place."
"The Commission neither can, nor should it, ignore the fact that trends in apiculture are disastrous in many regions."
"I can illustrate that with statistics from my own country, Luxembourg."
"Within the space of a year - between 1995 and 1996 - the number of bees declined by about 10 %."
"Almost half of all beekeepers are aged 60 and over."
"Only 4.75 % are younger than 30, despite the many imaginative efforts made by the Luxembourg Beekeeping Association which, like its counterparts in many other regions, with which I am in contact as rapporteur, is humming with activity."
"The short-sightedness of those who refuse to make ECU 65 m available in the Community budget - that is about how much our proposals for direct assistance would cost - is almost criminal, bearing in mind that, through pollination, bees maintain more than 80, 000 different plant varieties, and that the loss of wild flora would also result in the disappearance of insects, birds and small mammals that depend on that flora for their food and habitat."
"Since 1985, that is for 12 years now, this House had sadly been a lone voice in the wilderness of European bureaucracy, which can cope with the misappropriation of ECU 60 bn but would have us believe that the EU budget would come apart at the seams if ECU 65 m were made available to preserve beekeeping, even though the economic contribution made by bees to agriculture is probably in excess of ECU 5 bn and possibly even more."
"That can and must not be allowed to continue, Commissioner!"
"We have therefore amended and supplemented the Commission's half-hearted proposal."
"We want the pollination premium; we want compensatory payments for loss of income but we also want apiculture included in the arrangements for compensatory payments in the regulation on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures."
"We have nothing against national programmes to improve the production and marketing conditions for apicultural products, but we want them to be exclusively Community-funded."
"To prevent the distortion of competition caused by the very much cheaper imported honey, we are calling for uniform marketing rules for Community and imported honey, as consumers need to know what they are buying."
"Unfortunately, our financial masters did not back us in their opinion."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cannot understand this lack of foresight over contributions which would amount to peanuts in terms of the EU budget."
"We do not want a market organization on the old model but the direct measures I mentioned earlier, and they have become all the more urgent because the opening-up of the market in honey as a result of the GATT agreement is increasing the pressure on European beekeepers still further."
"We are therefore making an urgent appeal to the Commission and the Council of Ministers and asking them to accept our proposals."
"Like the bees, Commissioner, we are intrinsically peace-loving."
"But when bees are provoked they sting, and the same applies to us."
"And that can be very painful!"
"So let me conclude by voicing the hope that the Commission and Council will learn a lesson from the bees' lifestyle."
"Bees are productive, cooperative, reasonable, reliable, generous and clever."
"And though, unlike the bees, the Council and Commission are not wisely ruled by a female, they should bear in mind that the might of the queen bee relies not on her sting but on the fact that bees perish unless they work for and with each other."
"And that too should be a lesson to you and to us."
"We in the Committee on Agriculture could not support the perverse proposal of the Committee on Budgets to limit to five years the in any case paltry measures, nor could we endorse the attempt to classify the expenditure as noncompulsory."
"Commissioner, you will have to put up with this stinging contribution from our European 'queen bee' because she is not wrong."
"In the first place, it is good news when European taxpayers are prepared to make available ECU 15 m annually for something where the money is being well spent, where much can be achieved at little cost: the fight against varroasis, for instance, continues, and one of the fundamental ills of European apiculture is thus able to be tackled."
"That money is not being frittered away, nor is it susceptible to fraud."
"The scale insects are not, after all, European bees and cannot wreak the same kind of havoc here."
"But I should like to urge both you and the Commission to take a further, long overdue step."
"Mrs Lulling made it abundantly clear that this is about finally giving beekeeping credit for the ecological service it provides in Europe. I want therefore to take up what has long existed in a peripheral region of the European Union, the Canary Islands, namely a hive-related premium."
"I think that what is possible in the Canary Islands must be feasible in the rest of the European Union also, although the existing justification for this special premium in the Canary Islands, namely that the climate is particularly difficult, is not of course so apparent here."
"I therefore urge you to take on board these long overdue and modest demands."
"This is a contribution in the environmental interest and marks further progress for Europe's agriculture."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was a little uncertain whether or not to speak today because Mrs Lulling has been so skilful, so efficient and so effective in defending this report that I did not want to ruin the work she has done. But as Italy is one of the major honey producers, with its 1, 350, 000 hives, I felt I had a duty to support the requests Mrs Lulling has put forward, especially the economic ones, because that is what is needed to make progress along lines that have long been clearly necessary."
"On this point I just want to emphasize - in a Parliament where rural development and development compatible with environmental needs are so much discussed - what a contribution this sector can make in this direction, even if it looks like a marginal sector in quantitative terms."
"Mrs Lulling has mentioned the structural features of the sector in her country."
"I have to admit that in Italy the active population in this sector is ageing, but there are also new generations appearing, actually linking the sector to agritourism, that is, an agriculture with income from a range of activities, one of which is beekeeping."
"These young people need help, especially when they operate in mountain areas."
"We know where the aid needs to be directed and how to implement it: the fight against varroasis, the problem of pollination, the problem of technological innovation in the sector."
"I invite Parliament to support Mrs Lulling's demands and I invite the Commission to respond positively to them."
"Madam President, one minute is not much time, but we are backing Mrs Lulling's amendments."
"In 1994, I was the rapporteur for a report on bee-keeping on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and I think, like her, that this sector is of importance for both the economy and the environment: there are around 500, 000 bee-keepers, 13, 000 of them professionals;"
"Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal are the countries with the most bee-keepers, and 90 % of all pollination is carried out by bees, working on over 80, 000 species of plants."
"Without bees, over 20, 000 varieties of plants would disappear."
"Europe has to make the most of that sector."
"We fully agree with Mrs Lulling in respect of the difficulties facing bee-keepers."
"I live in a region of industrial and farming decline, and bee-keeping complements those declining activities and greatly helps producers."
"We therefore support this pollination premium, support for training, support for bee-keepers' associations and promotion of honey consumption which, I think we all agree, is extremely healthy."
"Madam President, if you will forgive the expression, Mrs Lulling's report is definitely 'the bee's knees' and we should be giving it all our support."
"Members have already explained how important bee-keeping is in various parts of the EU."
"Perhaps one aspect on which Mrs Lulling is especially helpful is the variations in conditions between different parts of the EU."
"In northern climes, such as Scotland or Scandinavia, daylight hours and the amount of sunshine are very different from the south and, likewise, the warmth of the sun which means that climatic differences have to be built into the provision of sugar in some cases for the honey."
"I have one or two points to make which I think are significant."
"Firstly, I definitely support the idea of fifty/fifty funding from the EU which Mrs Lulling puts forward."
"This should be matched by the Member State governments."
"There is a particular worry about the growth of the varroa disease which can strike and have a catastrophic effect on the bee populations of various parts of Europe."
"In Scotland we are immune from this disease at the moment, but we have seen the effects elsewhere."
"It is very important that every measure be taken to prevent its spread."
"In particular, I hope that the newly elected British Government will at last set up a bee inspectorate in Scotland which is one of the few parts of Europe which does not have inspectors for this purpose."
"By and large, I welcome Mrs Lulling's amendments, although I have a word of advice for the Commissioner."
"If he intends to reject any of these amendments, I would suggest that he put on his protective clothing."
"Otherwise, he will be stung by this Parliament!"
"Madam President, it is now two years ago - I think it was January 1995 - that the European Parliament unanimously came out in favour of a pollination premium and the Commissioner came out in favour of a compensatory premium to offset loss of income due to the absence of Community preference."
"But even when we were unanimous, our demands fell on deaf ears."
"For mysterious reasons, the Commission does not like bees."
"The European Commission does not like European honey, it prefers Chinese honey."
"Perhaps there is a Maoist lobby at the Commission, I do not know."
"That said, we produce only 123, 000 tonnes of honey."
"Out of world production of 1-1.2 million tonnes. So it should be possible to protect our bee-keepers."
"You are proposing a false solution, a tiny crumb, a paltry amount: 15 million ECU on a fifty-fifty basis, a kind of poisoned gift and you will say: ' you see, we have done something for marketing, we have done something for quality' ."
"For a country like mine, that means sharing 15 million francs or so between 3000 professional beekeepers and some part-time bee-keepers, in other words not very much."
"We all know the problems and Astrid Lulling has stressed the sector's importance time and time again."
"The problems of Varroa, that little insect or mite; the problems of fraud - that has not been mentioned - using rice or corn syrups in feeders so that bees manufacture false honey; the problems of controls on entry into the Community; the problem, in France, of so-called biological honeys, according to a 1996 decree, but by definition honey is biological, and now we go and get biological pseudo-honeys from Mongolia; the problems of imports from China, Mexico, Latin America, goodness knows why, at world prices of 12-13 francs per kilo, compared with French production prices of 14-15 francs."
"The problem of labelling, too, Commissioner, because it should state on the label whether a honey comes from Mongolia, China or the Canaries, the Alps or my Languedoc-Roussillon."
"There is a more general problem of the survival of plant varieties, the survival of life in a nutshell."
"I shall not repeat Einstein's lesson about humanity's survival being dependant on that of bees."
"I come from a country where bees were adopted on the imperial mantel, as a sign of authority."
"That is why, Commissioner, you are a mystery for me."
"I do not understand why you do not like bees."
"Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Lulling on her report, in line with what we said when we held a debate on the reflection document presented by the Commission and also in line with Mr Böge's first report on the honey sector."
"When looking at this, I have the feeling - as other speakers have said - that the Commission report is rather remote from the expectations and desires of the European Parliament."
"It is true that the document and proposals for the Regulation head in the right direction, but I think that they have fallen far short of our expectations."
"This refers in particular to two subjects already mentioned - given the situation of the Community honey market, given the absolute deficit in the Community and given the lack of regulation - those of pollination premiums and compensatory premiums to offset loss of income."
"These are such important subjects because of the tremendous cost differentials to be found in the Community and external costs."
"I therefore support Mrs Lulling's proposal and believe that these aids should be given."
"Secondly, I should like to stress the need for the national programmes presented by the Commission, referred to by the Commission proposal, to be implemented with sufficient flexibility so as to take account of the different factors and realities in the different producing countries in the European Union."
"It seems to me that we should be sufficiently flexible to accept quite different situations in terms of bee feeding, hive maintenances, site maintenance, the different technical marketing management and support for transhumance; i.e. we should be sufficiently flexible in those national programmes so that these aids can be taken on board."
"I also think that an effort should be made to market and promote 'honey products' (market studies, new market studies, design, specialized publications, animal nutrition, diet, etc), so as at least to take into account the reality in the different honey producing countries of the European Union."
"Commissioner, Madam President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, whose determination extends to sporting a new dress that is the bee's knees to mark her birthday."
"It seems to me that had she not been so persistent we should probably not have been holding this debate on bees today."
"And it seems to me that we can only infer from what has already been said that we need to discuss bees, or apiculture will come to nothing."
"If a matter is not discussed, then there can be no further progress."
"Bees are valued in terms of the amount of honey and wax they produce but that undervalues them."
"The contribution bees make to the natural environment, to birds, to crop pollination, to fruit, berry and oilseed production cannot be overestimated."
"I myself grow rape and welcome every year the arrival of the beekeeper who comes and sets up his hives in my rape fields, because if he did not come or the bees did not fly, then the rape harvest would perhaps be only half of what it is now, as there would be only the wild insects to provide the pollination."
"And so we should attach great importance to this incidental effect on the natural environment and, above all, we should attach greater political value to apiculture."
"For that, clearly, we need not only older, experienced beekeepers, but young people who are enthusiastic about beekeeping."
"It is terrible thing, but if you have vast experience and there is no-one to follow in your footsteps and take up beekeeping, then there will be no more beekeepers and no more apiculture either."
"We have therefore to support the whole system - the bees, the honey, the wax and all involved with it - and the positive incidental effects of bees."
"Bees provide great benefit and that benefit can be expressed in more than just financial terms."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all who have made an appeal on behalf of the bee here, and particularly Mrs Lulling, the rapporteur, for her careful consideration of the Commission proposal and the suggestions she has made concerning a further review."
"Back in 1994, the Commission put forward priority proposals for improving honey production and marketing in its discussion paper on the situation of apiculture in Europe."
"Those measures include combating varroasis, rationalization of transhumance, technical assistance and promoting honey analysis."
"I am glad to hear that the House supports the Commission in those areas."
"I can, of course, understand that there are many here who would like to go further and would gladly do more, but the scope for that is, unfortunately, very limited."
"We can, however, certainly identify adequate common bases for the introduction of suitable regulations to support this sector."
"I have therefore read Parliament's position carefully and looked at all the recommendations in a constructive spirit."
"Unfortunately, I have also to say that the majority of the recommendations cannot be fully implemented for the following and, in my view, compelling reasons."
"Let me explain them to you briefly."
"Amendment No 1, which concerns institutional issues, cannot be accepted as it stands because it does not constitute a legal basis and, consequently, cannot be cited in a reference."
"Amendment No 1 could, however, be accepted as a recital, to take account of the joint declaration of 1 March 1995."
"Amendment No 8 on aspects of the committee procedure must be rejected because a recital should be used to give the reason for the corresponding provision in a piece of legislation, and in this case there is no corresponding article in the regulation."
"Amendments Nos 5, 11 and 12 call for greater flexibility as regards the individual State programmes and the priority measures."
"The Commission could accept the reasons for those amendments and inform the Council of this."
"However, they are not admissible in their current form because they go further than the priority measures proposed."
"Amendment No 4 is calling for the measures to combat varroasis to be transferred to veterinary legislation."
"That cannot be accepted because this is not an eradication measure."
"The measure is actually intended to help beekeepers to cope with the increased production costs that result from dealing with varroasis."
"Amendments Nos 6, 13 and 19 propose the introduction of further measures in future on the basis of regularly conducted structural studies on the sector and on price formation."
"We cannot accept those amendments because the proposed co-financing of the individual State programmes has to be linked to the condition that the studies be carried out before the programmes are approved."
"Amendment No 14 provides for the introduction of complicated rules for determining the co-financing ceilings for the individual Member States."
"Amendment No 15 is designed to change the proposed text, even though it provides for a simple and frequently used budgetary procedure."
"I am therefore unable to accept those amendments either."
"I am, however, able to accept Amendment No 16."
"In the final analysis, it makes the proposed text clearer."
"Amendment No 17, which relates to structural policy aspects, cannot be accepted because it would make it more difficult to supervise the application of structural programmes and could result in subsidies being paid twice."
"I should like to make the following points concerning those amendments which seek to introduce new articles."
"Amendments 2, 9 and 10 provide for the introduction of a Community pollination premium and a compensatory payment for loss of income."
"Those amendments cannot be accepted because it does not seem appropriate, in view of the general situation of the sector in the European Union, to introduce global arrangements for income subsidies or premiums."
"The Commission will, however, continue to support thorough-going surveys of the economic position of the sector."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 7 call for marketing standards for honey."
"The appropriate framework for that is provided by the existing directive on honey which is currently being considered by the House, together with a range of other foodstuff directives, as part of the proposed simplification process."
"Amendments Nos 20 and 21, which provide for the rules on compensatory payments for mountain and hill-farming areas to be extended to cover other species, need to be looked at more closely in the context of the Council regulations on structural policy."
"I am therefore unable to accept those elements in the existing proposal, but we shall consider them further."
"Amendment No 18 emphasizes that implementing provisions are needed not only for the supervisory measures but also in respect of Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Council Regulation."
"I prefer the text as it stands because implementing measures are particularly important for the supervisory measures, not least because the Council regulation does not contain any special supervisory measures."
"I can in any event accept Amendment No 22."
"The Commission is persuaded that the adoption of the regulation does constitute substantial recognition of the sector and will contribute to positive developments in it."
"Madam President, after all that the Commissioner has said to us, he accepts two amendments!"
"Those are amendments in which we say that the beekeepers, associations and cooperatives have, of course, also to be taken into account and that the famous report, which the Commission is supposed to submit, should be submitted not only to the Council but to Parliament also."
"The Commissioner condemned everything else, using arguments which we shall of course look at once again in the Committee on Agriculture, but which are not real arguments, because there is no doubt that it is possible to take our demands on board."
"We have, after all, made specific proposals."
"That applies particularly to the inclusion of apiculture in the structural directive."
"I could not explain all of that in my allotted five minutes, but the Commissioner should explain to me why Article 19 of the regulation cannot say that a beehive is as valuable as a sheep or a goat and that hives can therefore be included in the structural directive."
"You have the text there after all."
"This is not the first time that we in the European Community make changes to items in other regulations when working on a particular regulation; otherwise you should make a proposal if you think that would not be proper in legal or procedural terms."
"But you cannot say that that cannot be done!"
"It definitely can be done, there is just a lack of willingness to do it!"
"A pollination premium can also be introduced."
"You cannot expect me to believe that there is no legal basis for this!"
"Of course there is a cost involved, but it is feasible."
"I cannot be satisfied to hear you say that you want to look at various amendments and consider the issue once again."
"You will carry on considering until you are worn out considering and there is no beekeeper left in the Community."
"We have been studying the issue since 1985, and I think we know enough."
"It is, of course, possible to engage in even more detailed studies and improve the statistics, but everyone dealing with the problem knows that it is really the eleventh hour, the absolute last moment, if we are to rescue apiculture in the European Union, as all honourable Members here have proposed!"
"I do not agree with your so-called arguments, and I can also tell you that we do not accept that and that we shall therefore..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mrs Lulling, I cannot allow you to continue."
"You have our every sympathy here in the European Parliament, and the Chair's too, but I do not decide on the debating time and I would ask you to understand that."
"You have been here too long not to know that we are a special parliament and that speaking time is strictly limited."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Summer-time"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0180/97) by Mr Belleré, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of the eight European Parliament and Council Directive on summer-time arrangements (C4-0169/87-96/0082(COD))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Kinnock, when the Committee on Transport gave me the task of drawing up a report on the proposal for an eighth directive on the provisions relating to summer-time, I did not think it was an issue which would arouse such public interest across Europe. Like hitting the headlines as 'Belleré versus Juppé' in a French newspaper!"
"Earlier, in my report at first reading, I stated that I agreed with the aim of the Commission's proposal: harmonization of the dates for the beginning and end of summer-time to promote better functioning of the internal market and assist important sectors like transport and telecommunications."
"But we know very well that there are different positions on this issue, depending on the different experiences of each Member State, and on the basis of those considerations I considered that the decision whether or not to apply this time system should be the exclusive responsibility of each Member State."
"I am quite sure the great majority of citizens are in favour of maintaining summer-time, because it provides an additional hour of daylight for all kinds of activities, from sporting and recreational to services and tourism, especially in southern European countries, where the days are very short."
"But we have an obligation to consider cases where the application of summer-time, in particular in the countries of northern Europe, has different or less beneficial effects than in other Member States."
"I have dwelt on the issue of energy saving, which has minor impact in some Member States, while in others, like Italy, which are not selfsufficient in energy, the application of summer-time last year produced an estimated saving on consumption of 900 million kilowatt-hours, over 0.4 per cent of national requirements."
"I also touched on the health issue, the fact that the change in the circadian rhythm as a result of changing from summer-time to winter-time and vice-versa involves small quantifiable disturbances to sleep patterns, but these effects are certainly transitory and definitely negligible."
"As regards road safety, common sense clearly tells us there is a correlation between more light and greater road safety, but objective data from the Member States are needed to study this properly."
"I concluded in my first report by applauding the Commission's initiative in presenting its report, because it made an important contribution to evaluating the application of summer-time, but I stressed the responsibility of each Member State to make the decision."
"In their common position the Commission and the Council demonstrated, for all response, that their minds were firmly closed to Parliament's position as set out in its three amendments, in particular those relating to the principle of subsidiarity, basing this approach on the fact that acceptance of such amendments would not have made the application of a system of summer-time compulsory as such, and on the fact that they were considered contrary to the aim of harmonization, which is the fundamental purpose of the directive."
"At this point the Commission and the Council at least have a duty to make clear to Parliament how much store they set by the principle of subsidiarity or whether they are prepared to sacrifice it from time to time if they think fit, creating obligatory conditions with effects which fall, for good or ill, on European citizens."
"I am going to dwell on this point, because Europe and the values we seek to propose to the citizens do not take the path of compulsion or imposition, but the path of dialogue, mediation and respect for diversity."
"We need to bring the citizens closer to Europe, not put them in the position of suffering its effects, and we need to bring Europe - dare I say it - closer to the citizens."
"So in supporting a favourable opinion on the application of summer-time and harmonization of the date, I once again invite the Commission and the Council to draw up a detailed report on the consequences of the application of summer-time, by consulting representatives of interested sectors and national experts in the Member States, to bear in mind the principle of subsidiarity and the responsibility of each Member State, and to take greater account of the opinion of Parliament as the opinion of a freely elected assembly and the expression of the will of the European people."
"Madam President, to begin with, I would like, on behalf of the social democrat group, to express our support for the common position on summer time."
"We have heard previously many good arguments in favour of summer time from the rapporteur, but this concerns harmonisation of the dates for the beginning and end of summer time."
"We think this is a good idea because it will reduce hassle, particularly for the transport sector and will facilitate the free movement of the people of the EU and of goods and services."
"The majority of people in the EU, more than 80 percent, are also in favour of maintaining summer time."
"This further emphasises the wisdom of supporting and approving the common position now."
"So, once again, I would like to express our support for it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during the first reading of the draft eighth directive, I had the opportunity to express to the Committee on Transport and Tourism my feelings on this important subject: summer-time."
"Today we can only welcome the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of this harmonization text and I call on all members to approve the draft recommendation presented by Mr Spalato Belleré."
"It was a French initiative, in the early 80s, to ensure that clock changing dates were harmonized at Community level, once summer-time had been adopted by all Member States."
"As a reminder, that approach was intended to eliminate any risk of impediment to the free movement of persons, goods and services."
"Since last year, I am pleased to note that clock changing dates have been completely harmonized."
"Throughout the European Union summer-time now stretches from the last Sunday in March to the end of October."
"As the head of a French local authority located on a border, in the Nord department, I am fully behind the adoption of the eighth directive which is in line with fifteen years of regulations in favour of harmonization."
"My department shares a 370 kilometre border with Belgium."
"Think of the importance of a time difference for the daily lives of people living on either side of that border, especially employees and schoolchildren."
"The same is true of all border regions in France."
"This local example shows just how any reorganization of the time system must be carried out on the basis of an agreement and coordination between all the Member States of the European Union."
"If we adopt this directive, that is what will be done, at least until 2001."
"Madam President, allow me, before further ado, to congratulate you on your stunning election, with such a big majority, in your constituency, which has a common border with Spain and which nearly ended up suffering a time difference with people across the border."
"I subscribe to the idea of subsidiarity, provided that the time difference between two countries never exceeds one hour."
"The time difference between Britain and Ireland, on one hand, and Greece and Finland, on the other, is two hours."
"Nonetheless we survive and the sun still shines."
"This time difference between countries is not so serious, as long as the Member States change at the same time."
"We have reached that goal."
"We can therefore only welcome Mr Belleré's excellent proposal and report and support him, while regretting somewhat that we had to wait so long for the Commission to set the hour change at the same dates."
"Could we not possibly make a concession, in order not to upset the delicate rhythms of Frenchwomen and French children?"
"Madam President, may I begin by joining Mr Wijsenbeek in warmly congratulating you on your stunning election to the Assemblée Nationale."
"The only problem is that every silver lining has a cloud, in this case the fact that this is your last day in the chair presiding over this Assembly."
"I am certain my colleagues in the Commission will agree with me that the French Parliament's gain is the European Parliament's loss. In neither place, however, would Europe be the loser, because we are certain that you will sustain your vigour and your progressive sense of purpose in all roles."
"Personally and, on behalf of my colleagues, I wish you the very best of enjoyment and good fortune as your constituency's representative in the Assemblée Nationale."
"Madam President, I am grateful to Mr Belleré and his colleagues for their thorough and speedy work."
"Naturally I welcome their proposed approval of the common position on summer-time arrangements in the European Union."
"The House will know that transport operators are awaiting the new directive in order to set timetables for transport services and many other sectors whose activities are related to the dates of the summer-time period are eager for conclusive arrangements."
"In his recommendation Mr Belleré comments on the implications of summer-time arrangements in the present and future Member States of the Union, in many cases reinforcing points that have already been made by the Commission and by Members of this House."
"In anticipation of the future enlargement of the Union most European countries, both within and outside the Union, already operate a summer-time régime that is consistent with the Community directive."
"Our proposal was sent to all the countries concerned and the absence of negative reaction seems to indicate that harmonization of the summer-time period is widely accepted."
"The Commission emphasizes the need for the Community to take the necessary action to harmonize the summertime period in order to remove obstacles to the free movement of goods and people."
"We are, however, prepared to listen, as suggested in Mr Belleré's recommendation, to those who argue that the various aspects and various situations in the Member States need to be examined in depth."
"Accordingly, the Commission will take into account the advice of national experts and representatives of the economic and social groups concerned and will be submitting a report to this Parliament and to the Council in 1999."
"I believe that that is the wish of the House and I am very happy to give that undertaking today."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Combined goods transport"
"The next item is the report (A4-0130/97) by Mr Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the granting of Community financial assistance for actions to promote combined goods transport (COM(96)0335 - C4-0028/97-96/0207(SYN))"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that combined transport is not, as anticipated, being discussed here shortly before midnight, is a good thing; it is, after all, one of things we are pinning our hopes on to make mobility permanently acceptable, and time is getting on."
"Those of us involved in transport policy have always made sure that combined transport was writ large our speeches, larger than it was in reality."
"We sing its praises because we expect it to combine the advantages of the individual means of transport with shifting the rapidly increasing movement of goods to environmentally-friendly transport methods."
"The old PACT programme sought and the new PACT programme is designed to help bridge that gap between intention and reality, between statistically ascertainable and predictable traffic trends on the one hand and our knowledge of transport policy."
"At any rate, the ECU 22.7 m under the old programme were well invested between 1992 and 1996 in projects involving 16 international transport axes - incentives which allowed demand to grow."
"The current proposal for the granting of Community assistance for actions to promote combined goods transport will be based on a regulation and make available ECU 53 m over six years."
"That, in my view, is still too little, but a step and declaration of intent in the right direction."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism welcomes the fact that the new PACT programme focuses on direct measures."
"Innovative measures, be they investment in intermodal transport equipment, in transshipment facilities or for access to rail or inland waterway structures, are sensible and important."
"They are, however, to be promoted degressively."
"We do not want long-term subsidies."
"The commercial application of new techniques, which have previously been tested in European research programmes, and the measures to improve logistics and staff development reflect the fact that the programme of support is forward-looking."
"In its discussion of the proposed legislation, the Committee on Transport and Tourism placed particular importance on four aspects of the conditions attaching to the grant of resources."
"First: the projects supported will have also to develop further the European network structure for combined transport."
"It is clear from the guidelines for the Trans-European Networks that, while the networks of the individual carriers and of combined transport are designed sensibly viewed in isolation, they do not tie in with one another - a wasted opportunity for intermodal transport."
"The Commission's consideration of the construction of freight freeways does not fully compensate for that omission."
"Priority should therefore be given to PACT projects which help bridge the existing gaps in the networks."
"Secondly, even in the old programme, projects on three axes, which extended to non-EU States, were supported."
"The new programme too will be open to projects which promote combined transport with Eastern Europe."
"Given the political will to see the European Union extended to bring in some Eastern European States, we think that it is now necessary to take measures to shift the very rapid growth in the movement of goods from Eastern Europe to combined transport."
"We should earmark an additional ECU 4 m annually for the relevant projects or at least discuss the issue again thoroughly two years from now."
"Taking the right measures at the right time helps save on future spending."
"Thirdly: it makes sense to combine PACT projects with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe with transport projects to create the necessary infrastructure."
"That kind of synergy could be achieved using the cohesion fund."
"We are therefore expecting the Task Force on Intermodal Transport to engage in structured dialogue within the Commission so that synergy and complementarity can be achieved between all the funds and programmes in question."
"It is certainly right to make a distinction between PACT pilot projects and research projects."
"But we should like to there to be a specific sum to take special account of projects which put the results of research into practice, particularly in the area of telematics and logistics, as this is where we shall see the maximum impact."
"Finally, I should like to make one more point: all who believe that combined transport to be one of the existing possibilities for resolving our current transport problems must want to see all political measures brought together to promote it."
"That is why, in addition to this sound programme of support, we need a political effort to improve the policy framework, be this in relation to the monitoring of driving and rest periods or the implementation of external costs which we have just begun to discuss."
"The way we deal with combined transport or, looking further ahead, intermodal transport, will show whether those of us involved in transport policy are and remain capable of political action in the face of current and future challenges."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to follow a rapporteur who has already given a brilliant presentation of the issues involved, but I nevertheless take the opportunity to praise the report."
"I also praise the Commission for producing a good proposal, and I hope as well that I shall be able to praise the Council for taking the helping hand held out by Parliament and the Commission to make combined transport a standard feature of our transport system."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission communication is somewhat silent on the political feasibility of combined transport, but I am certain that, with Parliament's help, a way forward will be found."
"That said, we do note with satisfaction that the 1992 experiment now looks as though it is developing into a proper programme."
"The aims of the programme are, as has been said, to manage the EU's transport resources in an optimum manner, taking into account the demands of environmental protection, but transport habits will not be altered through the effect of market forces alone."
"The aims of the programme are thus a key factor in our progress towards sustainable development."
"It was so easy to use lorries when there was plenty of time and the roads were not congested."
"Now that we have the Just In Time concept and a massive increase in transport volumes, we are confronted with a task: how do we ensure rational development?"
"How do we transfer current traffic potential from the roads to more environmentally friendly modes of transport, such as the railways, inland waterways and the sea?"
"My answer is quite simple: the carrot and the stick."
"We must change patterns of behaviour in transport."
"We must calculate all the costs of transport into a fair and effective pricing system."
"We must impose rules for crossfrontier transport, driving and rest periods and, last but not least, we must remember Eastern Europe."
"Again I agree with the rapporteur."
"The proposal does not have any special focus on Eastern Europe, although the corridors into the Central and Eastern European countries are expressly eligible for assistance."
"It is not the first time I have mentioned the Baltic, but here we have a good opportunity to tell the applicant states that they must not make the same mistakes as we have done."
"We must tell them that transport today is a multimodal affair and that it is that we are seeking to achieve."
"I am reminded that, when we mention the Via Baltica, we are not just talking about a motorway, we are talking about railways and sea crossings as well."
"This concept can also be developed in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic."
"It is essential not just to look at individual areas in Europe, but to combine the experience we gather in one area and use it elsewhere."
"As I have said, I support both the report and the Commission's initiative, and I hope that in the end we shall also get the Council on board."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work his has done and for this really good report."
"The European Union is in need of a reliable, Europe-wide transport system that effectively guarantees trade and mobility."
"As an Austrian, I should like to highlight the importance of combined transport, that is to say the transport of goods using at least two carriers, with the goods being transferred between them."
"Because of Austria's geographical position as an immediate neighbour of the States of Central and Eastern Europe, it is particularly important to draw attention to the transport situation."
"Road traffic has already reached capacity, and, in view of eastward enlargement and the increase in traffic that will result, we face a total collapse of the system."
"We have, of course, also to take into consideration the increase in road traffic pollution."
"If we are to take pollution seriously, then it has to be combated and real ways of preventing pollution sought."
"This transport system, which embraces a variety of carriers, can play a key role in the way transport in Europe is organized in the future."
"The social and economic demands of the community as a whole must take proper account of environmental protection and the safety of users."
"The situation can be relieved only if road traffic is combined with transport by rail and on water, that is to say if the different carriers cooperate and what is called an intermodal transport network is created."
"That method of transport is, unfortunately, still undervalued, and its capacities and the possibilities it offers far too little used."
"The European Union researched and promoted combined transport through its PACT programme, a pilot programme from 1992 to 1996, and made available ECU 22.7 m for that purpose."
"That programme had positive results, and so the Group of the European People's Party welcomes the fact that the programme has been extended."
"PACT II runs from 1997 to 2001."
"Funding of ECU 35 m has been made available but, in my view, that is far too small a sum."
"I am therefore hoping for more financial support for the PACT programme."
"I am therefore also arguing for PACT to be interlinked with other EU programmes, such as PHARE for instance, as eastward enlargement takes its course."
"The Group of the European People's Party supports all of the amendments in the report."
"The amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party on project selection and the granting of financial assistance was rejected in committee by one vote."
"In selecting the projects, the Commission should take the regions and Member States into consideration in a balanced way and ensure that decisions do not cause any distortion of competition as between regions and Member States."
"I hope this proposal will be approved in plenary for the benefit of Europe's citizens."
"We know that we are all in favour of promoting combined transport."
"We all agreed on this when we dealt with the forerunner to Mr Stockmann's report."
"However, we have seen that combined transport is not really growing, either in percentage terms or in total volume."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could tell us whether, in the freight freeways project that he has put forward, combined transport can be promoted in such a way that - since this seems to be one of the main reasons why combined transport has failed to meet expectations - the forwarding agent can remain responsible for the goods during both loading and unloading onto the intermediate form of transport, usually the train."
"The problem is that whereas getting the goods on the train usually works well, because the train is waiting at a particular place and will not depart until a certain time, unloading can be a major problem, because the train stops only briefly and in any event goods trains never actually arrive on time where they are expected."
"In short, two things are needed: the establishment of responsibility at the points of departure and arrival, and at the same time greater cooperation from the railways and greater efforts to keep to the timetables."
"This is where the problem lies, in the fact that each national railway company has its own responsibility, rather than all of them sharing it jointly."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"Given the failure of the negotiations on transit with Switzerland, the report is all the more topical."
"As a Member for one of the most sensitive transit regions of the EU, the Tiroler Inntal or Brenner region, I particularly welcome the new and committed initiative towards combined transport, as we have already heard too much said but seen too little done."
"Further developing the substance of the PACT programme is an important step in the right direction."
"I am thinking here of the investment in intermodal transport equipment, the enhanced monitoring facilities and the increased promotion of specific projects as opposed to mere feasibility studies."
"The financial framework that has been established and the increase from ECU 22.7 m to ECU 35 m are best described as token. Moreover, in view of the enormity of the task that professionally combining European goods transport demands, technically and logistically speaking, and the advantages - consumer-oriented and speedier transport of goods as well lasting prevention of pollution - that avoiding unnecessary traffic could bring, it is, sad to say, extremely unsatisfactory!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Tourism"
"The next item is the joint debate on five oral questions to the Commission:"
"by Mrs Bennasar Tous, Mr Provan and Mr Sarlis, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (B40162/97 - O-0042/97) on tourism; -by Mr Wijsenbeek, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (B4-0167/97 - O-0049/97) on tourism; -by Mr Azzolini, Mr Pasty, Mr Parodi, Mr Danesin, Mr Santini, Mr Tajani, Mr G. Collins, Mr Donnay, Mr Kaklamanis and Mr Girão Pereira, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group (B4-0171/97 - O-0077/97) on tourism; -by Mr Novo Belenguer, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance (B4-0172/97 - O-0078/97) on tourism; -by Mr Novo and Mr Theonas, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left (B4-0173/97 - O-0079/97) on Community measures in favour of tourism"
"Mr President, your speed on votes is well known, but at least when there is a change of Commissioner and a change of report we request your indulgence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating an oral question on tourism, an issue that is of concern to all of the political parties."
"There are many aspects of tourism which, when we look at them, raise enormous questions."
"The European Parliament forwarded a proposal to the intergovernmental conference and to the Commission advocating the insertion of a provision in the Treaty stating that tourism is to be considered as a sector of the economy and that it should be governed chiefly by Article 130 so that many of its various aspects, such as the Philoxenia programme and several other programmes that have preceded it, can be approached in a legislative framework."
"To our great surprise - and all of the political groups here have been surprised given the importance of the matter - the Commission has not promoted the recommendation of the European Parliament that tourism be included as a separate chapter in the revised Treaty with its own separate legal basis and capital. And the Dutch Presidency, despite being fully aware of Parliament's recommendations on the subject, has itself done nothing to promote the inclusion of tourism, which makes an important contribution to the economies of the 15 Member States and provides employment for 10 million people, and has sat on its hands."
"There has been silence."
"Silence from the Commission. Silence not so much from Commissioner Papoutsis, but rather from the Commission as a whole, in that as a college it has made no real attempt to place tourism on the agenda of the intergovernmental conference."
"Tourism it not the same as foreign policy, defence policy, the common foreign and security policy or other things like that."
"It is different. It is closer to all of us, and just as there is a chapter for industry so, too, there should be a chapter for tourism."
"I would like to know how the Commissioner himself feels about the matter. Other speakers will be making the same request."
"What is the position of the Commission at least? What plans does it have to raise the issue of tourism again or to put it back on the negotiating table, albeit now, at this late stage?"
"Mr President, we have called for tourism to be included in the Treaty."
"I am delighted to have this opportunity to talk to Mr Papoutsis as the Commissioner responsible for tourism rather than as the deputy Commissioner for transport, although the dossiers are closely linked, and this was why we felt that they should be separated a little further by giving tourism its own title in the Treaty."
"However, the Heads of Government do not appear to be in favour of this, so perhaps Mr Papoutsis could tell us what the situation is at present."
"It is absolutely vital for tourism to have a separate title, because otherwise it will be impossible in many cases for the Union to exercise its powers in this field, powers which people already wrongly dispute."
"This is also why, without going into detail, Parliament has given its broad support to the Philoxenia programme, and we are also pleased to see that the Commission has now adopted a new approach to tourism and is setting about giving the Community tourism programme a little more body."
"In previous years, we have seen tourism allocated ridiculously low levels of funding, but considerably more has now been set aside for the programme for the next five years."
"From 1993 to 1995 it received ECU 20.5 million, whereas now it is to get ECU 70.3 m."
"It is therefore essential for DG XXIII to come up with a decent programme."
"However, I think the most important thing is for the Commissioner to ensure that tourism in Europe is presented to the outside world as a unified sector where the same rules and standards apply, which is why it needs to be included in the Treaty."
"Mr President, when we talk about tourism - in fact we have done so very rarely in this Chamber - it always seems almost as if we are talking about a marginal, occasional or optional issue. It seems we can talk about it or just as easily forget it."
"Instead, as others have already stressed, tourism is actually a highly valuable industry which indeed produces well-being and GDP, but above all produces employment."
"The nine and a half million employees - a 1992 statistic which no doubt needs updating - constitute a formidable platform of employment, especially as it provides jobs for people in areas often less fortunate."
"When we talk about tourism there is a serious risk of misunderstanding."
"We think of Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, hence big city tourism, a type of tourism which needs neither promotion nor attention, far less subsidy."
"It is an automatic, endemic tourism, which can have no need for extra investment."
"What does need concrete commitment from the Commission and this Parliament is peripheral tourism in depressed areas."
"Here there is another misunderstanding to be overcome: that famous subsidiarity."
"What does it mean? Leaving the peripheral areas the task and the burden of organizing, and of course financing, their own tourism sector?"
"They will never do it!"
"That is where there is a need to intervene with united action, with a serious programme which has good ideas, but also considerable funding, to provide incentives for the areas where tourism needs to be subsidized."
"So here lies the logic of taking up virtual, merely oratorical, positions, so far expressed in the tourism actions launched five or six years ago and extended only last year, but always as an experiment, something which still has to happen."
"And then at last tourism, too, found a programme with an eloquent name: PHILOXENIA."
"We were all a little under the illusion that this name would finally make it possible to pass ideas and financing that would give Europe's commitment to the tourism sector body and substance."
"In November came the cold shower: the 'no' from the Council, a rather icy 'no' , especially as it was backed by reasons that were barely credible and came from only three countries, whereas all the others believed in the need to intervene in this sector."
"This programme, with all its potential and its wealth of good intentions, is fortunately coming back in through the window now, and at last there also seems to be a reasonably concrete project beneath the financial aspect."
"So I ask the Commissioner to take the old proposals up again, for a cultural tourism, a social tourism, a tourism of the weakest, and finally give it body and robustness with new ideas, especially at the financial level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I do not want to be repetitive but we are dealing with an important sector; a sector where, unfortunately, as we all know, we shall only make progress if we really make a considerable effort."
"This is a sector representing over nine million direct jobs, an average of 5 % of GDP, and one third of the European Union's service exports."
"It is a sector which - and I think this is an important feature - helps the more and less favoured regions achieve something the European Parliament and all other European institutions are seeking: social cohesion."
"Reference has been made to the PHILOXENIA programme which was on the verge of being approved last year and in the end was not approved."
"We are convinced of the importance of tourism for employment and on the economy and want to know why and how the Commission is going to try and put pressure on the Council so that the programme can be approved next year."
"If not, we want to know the economic assistance that will be given to this vitally important sector for the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PHILOXENIA Programme, which involves a series of measures for tourism and which, basically, we supported, has unfortunately not been put into practice in the most appropriate and desirable manner."
"We therefore think that the European Parliament should take a political stance reaffirming the need to put into practice the actions which were envisaged for this field, which is a major source of jobs and which therefore plays a most significant role in the development of some less-favoured regions, thus promoting economic and social cohesion in the European Union."
"Another reason for taking such a stance is that the promotion of tourism tends at the same time protect the environment and the cultural and architectural heritage and to encourage occupational training and sustainable and stable employment, so that financial resources need to be stepped up within the framework of the current and future policy."
"We therefore consider it neither necessary nor appropriate to support the setting up of a common policy for tourism which might entail some centralization which is incompatible with national diversity and which offers little opportunity for transparency or participation."
"We do not therefore support the motion for a joint resolution due to be adopted at the close of this debate."
"It is important - and it seems to have been forgotten in this motion for a resolution - to reach the maximum level of consensus possible to press for the implementation in practice of measures approved long ago which the European Parliament already agreed to but which are still blocked."
"Then we should not have the impression that proposals were being made which were of doubtful effectiveness based on dubious reasons; what is essential and necessary is simply to make specific measures out of what is already envisaged and so essential for tourism in the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares the views of the Members of this Parliament concerning the economic and social importance of tourism, particularly as regards its potential for increasing employment in Europe."
"The Commission's approach on the matter is expressed in the first objective of our proposal for the multiannual programme to assist tourism in Europe, the Philoxenia programme."
"As the European Parliament has stated, tourism has substantial job-generating potential, and it does, of course, provide work, in particular, for vulnerable groups in society such as women and young people."
"It contributes also, in a very significant way, I believe, to the strengthening of economic and social cohesion and to development in remote and island regions."
"The Philoxenia programme has ambitious objectives, but it is also extremely important with regard to the creation of a legal basis which would facilitate the development at the European level of policies which can strengthen the national policies."
"We had no wish to duplicate national powers or to infringe the subsidiarity principle in any way."
"Indeed, when the programme was first presented to Parliament and whenever I spoke to the Council I made a point of emphasizing that the Commission had every intention of respecting the subsidiarity principle."
"The main thrust of the programme is that Community measures must improve the quality and competitiveness of European tourism."
"They must also focus on ensuring that tourists are provided with what they need and on promoting balanced and sustainable development of tourism through rational use of natural and cultural resources and of the tourism infrastructure."
"The Commission believes that these basic objectives provide a balanced and precisely targeted framework."
"As I told the House at the time of the debate and the Committee on Transport and Tourism when we discussed the Sarlis report, the programme had emerged after very difficult and protracted discussions between the Commission's directorates-general and in the college of the Commission."
"That had been the case because there are differences of view as to how this crucial sector should be approached at the European level."
"The problem now is how to get agreement on the existing programme in the Council."
"The Commission believes that the submission of an amended programme, as some sides are suggesting, would not increase the possibility that the Council would approve the proposal."
"On the contrary, it would, in our opinion, create additional difficulties and delay the taking of a decision even further."
"I must inform you that some Member States also wish to cut back on the present objectives of the programme that I have just stated for you."
"The real reason for the delay is that in one Member State there is considerable anxiety about the programme and a perception that it violates the subsidiarity principle."
"The more one talks with the Member States which have expressed reservations, the more one realizes that the discussion process is bedevilled by a host of misunderstandings."
"It appears that the programme has not been adequately examined and that insufficient time has been allocated for explaining its real orientations and objectives to those who are actually proficient for the taking of the requisite decisions."
"Mr President, I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to Members to take the initiative, in their own spheres, in their own countries, in their own fields of responsibility, in explaining the objective and potential of this programme to local and regional authorities and in making clear to them that the programme really does not infringe the subsidiarity principle."
"When I spoke last week with the President-in-Office of the Council, with the minister of the Dutch Presidency who is responsible for tourism, I had a very lengthy discussion about the details of the programme and possible alternative proposals that could be acceptable to the Council, and I realized that even at this late stage not all of the sides, all of the Member States, all of the COREPER representations, have understood certain substantive observations put forward by Parliament that the Commission has drawn attention to and which could find acceptance with all of the Member States."
"For that reason I appeal again to Parliament to play a part in this, to step up the political discussion, to approach ministers at the political level and everyone in the Member States with the capacity to promote acceptance of this proposal, so that we can find way out of the problem fairly quickly."
"We have tried, so far, to get the presidencies, that is to say each six-monthly presidency, to initiate action on the matter and to request and appoint COREPER to embark on a discussion process in connection with the programme."
"Over the course of this year we have used every opportunity that has come our way to explain our position to the Member States and to all of the social and political bodies and to convey our message at the major gatherings organized by the industry itself and by regional and local authorities."
"The Commission has put in a presence wherever that has been possible and has deployed every argument at its disposal, fortunately, with the support of many of you who are here today, and I take this further opportunity of thanking you for your help."
"Unfortunately, even now, this programme is still with the Council and it has not been possible to get a decision."
"We hope that during the Luxembourg Presidency there will be some development on the matter, given that the Presidency has already requested the Commission to help set up a large conference on tourism and job creation during the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I believe that this is a very important development and that we shall have your support in that endeavour. I believe that the next few months will bring some progress."
"Turning now to coordination of the Commission's activities, this Parliament, as you know, with many resolutions of its own, and, also, the Court of Auditors have urged the Commission to make Directorate-General XXIII responsible for coordinating its activities with a view to providing transparency and good use of the budget and to ensuring that the tourism sector is provided with a specific policy with priorities and objectives. That is what we have been striving for and achieving over the recent period."
"The new director-general of Directorate-General XXIII has already started things moving."
"In recent months six coordination meetings have been organized for directorsgeneral with responsibility for policies in other fields which have some connection with aspects of tourism. We are endeavouring to coordinate the other policies in areas in which they are relevant to tourism, in particular the structural fund initiatives and the more general actions on employment and training and in support of businesses and, also, of course, the single market policies."
"This inter-service group on tourism now meets regularly, and priorities for 1997 are being discussed with representatives of the industry and of the Member States."
"Like you I believe that efficient coordination of Community measures relating to tourism is vital."
"It was with that necessity in mind that we made cohesion and complementarity between the measures of the Philoxenia programme and the other Community programmes which have a bearing on tourism a principal objective when we drew up that programme."
"As regards institutional aspects, the clear support of the European Parliament for the insertion of specific provisions on tourism in the new treaty is very important."
"Just as it stated in its report to the Council of 3 April 1996, the Commission wishes it to be understood now, also, that it is not seeking new powers in the tourism sector, or in any other sector for that matter, and that it believes that it is up to the intergovernmental conference to deliver an opinion on the matter."
"I want to be very precise about this because Mr Sarlis has been kind enough to question me on it."
"Under the first protocol, under the first annex to the Maastricht Treaty, the Commission had an obligation to present a report at the commencement of the intergovernmental conference on the extent to which, if at all, the three policies - tourism, energy and civil protection - which are excluded from the Maastricht Treaty should be discussed at the conference, and we did present that report."
"At that time the Commission did not wish, any more than now, to seek new powers - and I think that it is being wise."
"However, in the report it expressed the view that something had to be done to create a legal basis to cover tourism in view of the sector's status as the largest European industry and its very considerable jobgenerating potential."
"In its report the Commission pointed out that the current absence of specific legal bases has not prevented the Community initiating and implementing certain measures to assist tourism, but that the measures that have been adopted have been based either on the provisions relating to other sectoral policies or on Article 235 of the Treaty."
"At the same time, the Commission stated - in the report to which I have referred - that it was aware that resort to Article 235 may be much more difficult or even impossible in an enlarged Community in which the principle of unanimity in decision-making is retained."
"How clearer could we have put the case when seeking at that time to progress to the adoption of a specific chapter in the Treaty to cover policy on tourism via that indirect method?"
"We have never sought a common tourism policy on the lines of the common agricultural policy."
"From the very beginning we stuck to the view and made clear that the principle of subsidiarity had to be respected."
"Nevertheless, it is a fact that certain joint actions to assist European tourism in general do need to be initiated at the European level."
"In that same report the Commission also emphasized the importance of tourism and pointed out that the continuation and cohesion of Community action in the sector would be facilitated by the inclusion of specific provisions in the Treaty."
"Provisions which, in our opinion, would have to ensure that measures to assist tourism are based on a cohesive and coordinated approach and are more effective and transparent."
"What can we do now, at this late stage?"
"We can continue to press for dialogue, on the assumption that the big problems that still remain can be resolved and while there is still some leeway for discussion concerning the new policies."
"However, judging by the objections that have so far been raised, I fear that this will be very difficult because only one Member State has formally lodged a specific proposal with the Commission and the others have shown no inclination to initiate discussion in connection with the proposals that have been put forward."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Wijsenbeek for his good words and to assure him that DirectorateGeneral XXIII is now very actively engaged in trying to make up for the time that has been lost and to achieve more rational use of the available Community resources, meagre as they are."
"We are doing this with the help that Parliament has given via the entering of the specific sum of ECU 4 million in the 1997 budget."
"Irrespective of whether the Philoxenia programme is approved, Directorate-General XXIII is preparing to use that appropriation for the general benefit of tourism in Europe through the promotion of actions to assist employment and in the fields of information-gathering, access to information, the information society and, contingently, statistics."
"Mr President, I am very glad that Commissioner Kinnock is going as a tourist to the Lothians."
"I am even more pleased that Commissioner Papoutsis, as the Tourism Commissioner, is coming to my constituency of Cheshire and Wirral and I can assure the Commissioner that I am taking up the matter of Philoxenia with the new Labour government minister for tourism, Mr Tom Clarke."
"Whenever we mention tourism to the Council, or indeed to the Member States, it seems to be that they collectively all go on holiday."
"Mention tourism and they leave their brains to broil on the beach."
"Speak about Europe's biggest industry and our decision-makers become indecisive."
"They sink back deeper in their deck chairs and tan themselves in complacency believing Europe's most successful industry needs neither help nor understanding."
"Most hopeless amongst these sunseekers has been the Dutch Presidency."
"They could not even be bothered to summon a tourism council."
"They have been a grave disappointment."
"But let me touch on four areas of concern, most of which are set out in today's resolution."
"Firstly, the IGC in Amsterdam next week."
"The failure to translate the unfinished business of the Maastricht Treaty into a title for tourism in the revised Treaty is madness."
"It is, in particular, a snub to the tourism industry."
"Many of them are small and medium-sized businesses."
"Any other industry - shipbuilding, automobiles, the chemical industry - rightly receives the attention of Commission, Council, and Member States."
"Tourism however has been abandoned."
"It must be given a title and a proper legal base."
"Secondly, Philoxenia."
"It is quite absurd for certain Member States to stall the modest multiannual programme for tourism."
"Tourism, of all industries, is one that functions and is dependent on the single market."
"In other words there is a clear added value in placing tourism in an EU context."
"This does not contradict the principle of subsidiarity and it is dumb to suppose it does."
"Thirdly, tourism and the Euro."
"If only the Council and Member States woke up - and indeed the Commission has been slow off the mark here - it should be realized that tourism is the best industry and activity to illustrate the benefit of the single currency to the man and women in the street."
"It is the consumer as tourist who throws away 2 % of their holiday spending money each time to go on holiday inside the EU."
"Rich Americans too have few bucks to spend in Europe because we retain national currencies."
"Those working in the tourism industry know only too well the frustrations of moveable exchange rates."
"Two-thirds of visitors to the United Kingdom come from the EU, but these tourists will be put off by the fact that the pound sterling has appreciated by 19 % against the franc and the mark in the past twelve months."
"Finally, Mr President, let me state the obvious which seems all too obscure to the Council."
"Tourism means jobs."
"We spend hours in the European corridors of power talking about unemployment but why do we ignore tourism as an obvious job generator?"
"It is time we stopped treating tourism like a holiday; it is time to come home, to jobs."
"Mr President, nobody needs to tell the Commissioner that we in this Parliament listen as closely to him as he listens to us."
"It is important that we have this synergy, because the blockage is obviously in the Council of Ministers."
"For a number of years now Parliament's position on tourism has been quite clear and we are becoming increasingly frustrated because, regrettably, many in the Council are not prepared to look at the opportunities which this Parliament has suggested to the Commissioner to mop up some of the unemployment Mr Harrison has just referred to."
"We are right to recognize the opportunities and the Council's difficulties."
"Subsidiarity in tourism is a very important aspect and nobody here would object to that."
"We must keep trying to find a way through the maze."
"It seems extraordinary that the Council refuses to endorse the Philoxenia programme, although we have agreed with the Council within the budget the amount necessary to promote the programme."
"How can the Council take such decisions, either budgetarily or from a policy point of view?"
"The two are not compatible."
"The main issue which the Commissioner has correctly identified and which is in the main part of this question is what we should do to get tourism recognized within the Treaty."
"We must have an independent and welldifferentiated common policy with a proper legal basis, in other words a chapter within the revised Treaty."
"The Commissioner must push for that."
"We recognize that perhaps he has difficulties within the Commission."
"That is part of the problem too and we want to strengthen his arm."
"Any advice on ways in which we can help him will be gratefully received, because the Commission is obviously very important in helping to push the Member States on the revision of the Treaty and to achieve what we have to achieve."
"Coming back to the main issue to which the Commissioner has referred in his remarks, common action within the Commission: we all want greater coordination and we must have it, otherwise tourism will never get anywhere."
"The Commissioner said that his new Director-General has already had six meetings, but let us see what action results from those meetings, as the saying goes, ' where is the beef, let us get on with it' ."
"We are looking to the Commissioner to deliver."
"Mr President, I am convinced, along with some of my colleagues, that in terms of tourism the Commission and the European Parliament are heading in the same direction."
"I think that, as a result, the problems that have bene denounced are the responsibility of the Council."
"I have no doubt about that especially since Mr Papoutsis, the Commissioner responsible for tourism policy, has highlighted its importance, with energy and firmness, within the Commission."
"I would like to know if my impressions are right. The current Presidency of the Council has attached too much to the problems over PHILOXENIA."
"This hope that is always placed in the next Presidency - does it mean that the problems lie with the country currently presiding over the European Union?"
"At any event, I think that Mr Papoutsis' demand is a good one in that we should explain to our fellow-citizens, our private companies, our public administrations that we do not want to replace national policies but to complement them."
"We should explain how good it would be to open up Community support schemes."
"It would be wrong to claim that a Community policy, with actions and resources, would not increase the overall competitiveness of European tourism compared with others, given the effects of tourism on employment, cohesion, the environment, the generation of resources, etc."
"This has already been said but it is worthwhile repeating it here - in terms of employment and the economy, tourism means more for the fifteen Member States than coal and steel did for the six founding members of the European Communities."
"Mr Papoutsis' demand is a good one and we shall bear it in mind, but it is also pessimistic about the possibility of reforming the Treaty on European Union."
"Let us wait until the second half of the year for the PHILOXENIA programme."
"However, Mr Papoutsis, when it comes to our pessimism over finding a legal basis for the joint motion for a resolution, I wonder whether the Commission might be ready in the current situation, without any reform of the Treaty, to elaborate a legislative proposal on the basis of the current Treaty on European Union, tackling tourism from the consumer's viewpoint."
"This is not a casual question, since the European Parliament is already making a request on those lines."
"Against that background, I should like to extend my warm thanks to Mr Papoutsis for his generous assistance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are always debating tourism in the European Parliament."
"There have been a series of good reports over the year and much energy and hard work has been put into the subject by you and my colleagues before me."
"We have all insisted on demonstrating the importance of tourism as a social, economic and cultural phenomenon."
"About 200 million European citizens leave their homes every year and become tourists."
"It is an industry that generates 9 million jobs and could generate far more."
"We must try and convince - you and us - the sector itself and the majority of the Member States that tourism is a horizontal activity and that the PHILOXENIA programme does not get in the way of subsidiarity."
"We must convince them that if we identify the aspects that can be run at European level, that would add value to the sector and ease the management of the SMEs to coordinate the relationship between tourism and the environment, stimulate the modernization of installations, conservation of the artistic heritage, rural tourism, reassess training, assist the search for new products that keep the industry in momentum and create permanent jobs, setting quality products and services as the main priority."
"You, Commissioner, and I know that this is the content of PHILOXENIA, rejected by the Council to everyone's great disappointment, especially mine as rapporteur."
"I am aware of the considerable effort put in by yourself and your colleagues into properly running DG XXIII, but we should like you to put in more effort and enthusiasm in order to convince the rest of the Commission and the Council of the importance of tourism and make the latter give up its reservations and give the PHILOXENIA programme and all of its content the green light."
"Transparent and open dialogue should then be continued over important matters such as VAT and the euro, prosaic but urgent matters, that if properly dealt with should help Europe become once again the leading tourist destination."
"For this we need a legal base and an instrument for taking action, and that is the PHILOXENIA programme."
"It is necessary so that you and your team can hold fluid and transparent dialogue with the sector, with enthusiasm, and along with the Council and the European Parliament, in order to establish a European tourism strategy, which we all need."
"We shall back you, Commissioner."
"Mr President, tourism is nothing more and nothing less than the sector capable of creating most jobs in the future in Europe - that is, the sector which could be the most helpful in solving our greatest problem."
"On the other hand, tourism is a very diverse activity with a great knock-on effect which makes an important contribution to economic and social cohesion in Europe."
"It therefore seems to us essential to give tourism a legal basis in the revision of the Treaty on European Union and, whilst the solution of including the tourism industry under Article 130 is not the ideal solution, it does have the advantage of being simple and possible and acceptable to the sector, especially Otreca."
"I know, Mr Commissioner, that you agree with us on this objective."
"I hope that it proves possible, for the sake of the economy and the citizens of Europe, to include tourism in the Treaty."
"I should like finally to put a proposal to you: why not ask the Commission to carry out a study on the effects on tourism of liberalizing air transport?"
"Perhaps the results of such a study would encourage those hesitant Member States to understand the enormous advantage which would spring from providing tourism with a legal basis in our Treaties."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that tourism is a major economic factor as well as being critical to employment policy."
"In Austria, for example, 17 % of GDP is earned from tourism."
"That means that if we really want to take tourism seriously in those terms, then we have, in my view, to focus on at least three points. Firstly, we should accord tourism the status of an autonomous Community policy, and that has been stressed by those who spoke before me also; secondly, we must do everything we can, that is to say, we must make available the resources to facilitate the PHILOXENIA programme, because that could in the end produce a Community policy that is to some extent a tourism policy for the Union; and, thirdly, we must create opportunities to improve staff quality through mobility and training programmes."
"Mr President, a few days ago we in the European Parliament held a meeting with those responsible for tourism and established that tourism is set to increase by about 10 % as a result of the introduction of the euro."
"I therefore believe that the euro can be one of the main incentives for what is qualitatively speaking high-value tourism in Europe, and if we also succeed in making progress towards tax harmonization, for example, in the area of value-added tax in particular, then we shall probably have the best possible start."
"Since tourism is very labour intensive, we ought also to consider whether reduced rates of value-added tax ought not to apply here."
"The most important area has already been mentioned by Mr Pirker, that is, in my view, training and further training, and the LEONARDO programme in particular."
"I believe that the LEONARDO programme offers many opportunities for our tourist industry and would ask that an even bigger effort be made here."
"Mr President, I apologize for being late, but I was involved in another meeting and I thought this debate was going to start a little later."
"On behalf of the Greens, I just want to restate a position we have already expressed on previous occasions: we believe tourism ought to have its own place in the treaty, and that is in line with the intention already expressed by the European Parliament."
"But we do not think it is enough to include only the commercial and employment aspects of tourism, although these are important. We think it should be valued for its cultural aspects and for relations between different people and cultures, as a means of getting to know them and their societies."
"So we believe it is very important to highlight not only the economic and commercial side but especially the cultural side and development of relations between the various cultures, to promote the construction of Europe."
"This is a first important point, frequently debated in the Committee on Culture."
"But as Greens we want to highlight the fact that tourism can also have great environmental and social impact, and that is why we have some doubts about the resolutions which have been tabled."
"It cannot be dealt with in isolation from the serious effects certain forms of tourism have had on the environment in Europe."
"Account must also be taken of the fact that certain types of mass tourism, with countryside and coastline being covered in concrete, have not only had an environmental impact, but have also reduced the potential for employment in the future and have blocked other activities more compatible with the environment."
"So in social terms, we believe the consequences of certain types of tourism need careful evaluation."
"There have been forms of tourism which have expropriated the inhabitants of certain areas, and tourism multinationals have imposed their logic and their personnel, totally changing the way of life in entire territories."
"Without careful evaluation of the environmental impact and the social consequences, tourism cannot be regarded as exclusively positive from the commercial point of view."
"So, yes to incorporation into the treaty, but with the proper precautions, including these environmental, social and cultural aspects."
"Mr President, allow me to emphasize to the House that if provision is made in the Treaty we shall be freed from the sort of trouble that we have had with the Philoxenia programme."
"Until it gets a proper mention in the Treaty, tourism will continue to be pushed about from pillar to post."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has appealed to us most urgently to bring pressure to bear on the Council."
"For our part, I would urge the Commissioner to attend the meeting of the tourism group at 3.30 p.m. this Thursday, where the President-in-Office of the Council is to make a policy statement."
"Commissioner, if you are serious about this, be there at 3.30 p.m. on Thursday, then we can have a joint discussion with the President-in-Office."
"If necessary, you can put your urgent request again."
"Can we count on your attendance?"
"Mr President, I will look at that possibility and try to be at the meeting."
"In the event of my not being able to be there, depending on my programme, a representative of the Commission will certainly attend."
"Whatever the case, however, I can assure Mr Cornelissen that I am constantly in touch with the Dutch Presidency about the IGC and developments concerning a specific chapter for tourism and the possibility of achieving an agreement on the Philoxenia programme even at this late stage, in the final weeks, through the COREPER framework, without a Council meeting."
"I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.25 and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item on the agenda is questions to the Commission (B4-0170/97)."
"Question No 32 by Mr Juan Izquierdo Collado (H-0347/97)"
"Subject: Suspension of the LEADER programme"
"Does the Commission acknowledge responsibility for the suspension of the LEADER programmes following a fax from Mr Legras, Director-General of DG VI, which has no real legal basis?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a communication of 15 July 1996, the Commission informed the Spanish authorities that accumulating structural fund resources in support of one and the same project cannot be approved."
"What was being asked for at the time was both a Community subsidy under the LEADER programme and, in addition, Community co-financing under a Community support programme."
"After detailed discussion of this matter with the Spanish authorities, the Commission is now able to approve the accumulation of aid that is being asked for, provided that effective and reliable project management is guaranteed, so that it is possible to make a clear distinction between the types of aid accorded for the project in question."
"Only in that way is the Commission able to guarantee that the Community resources are used in an efficient and transparent manner."
"As a general point, I should add that accumulating aid is not in itself a condition for the implementation of the LEADER programme."
"In the majority of the Member States the LEADER programmes progress absolutely normally with no accumulation of resources."
"Commissioner, the fact is that a good many LEADER programmes in my country are being held up for a year."
"The execution of those programmes has been paralysed and this has stopped jobs being created and innovations being fulfilled."
"Why?"
"Because the Council or the Commission have decided that LEADER II must be run in a different way to LEADER I and a Director General's fax has produced such a commotion that we have seen an perfect example of red-tape and its harmful effects on the dearest aims of the Union, i.e. efficiency and job creation."
"Commissioner, I hope that your answer will send a clear message to many mayors and councillors who are setting much store by your words that the LEADER programme's continuity is guaranteed in all transparency and, otherwise, that the Spanish Government is asked to take immediate action."
"I hope that your words will be quite clear."
"Mr President, Mr Izquierdo Collado, let me first thank you for agreeing with me that LEADER II is in itself a sound Community initiative."
"But when, in the case of a specific measure, it is not clear whether this is a single measure or two separate measures, as happened here, that is something that has to be cleared up."
"But it is not a reason for simply shelving that procedure."
"If, in future, you should encounter similar problems where, either for reasons similar to those you mentioned or for other reasons, the implementation of a LEADER programme has come to a halt, then I would simply ask you to let me know about it."
"I should be glad to look into the matter."
"Commissioner, how is it that abusive action by a Director General of the Commission can paralyse the LEADER II programme, just because of problems raised by LEADER I?"
"There were problems of an accumulation of Community subsidies in the case of the LEADER I programme and a lack of controls over the programme by the Commission."
"But the two things are not linked."
"Unblock LEADER II and control LEADER I. I think that we are down that road, given that under LEADER II there is now a payment body in each Member State."
"But I would still ask the Commissioner to make sure that the same things do not occur again. I hope that the Commission will control the excessive powers of some of its employees."
"Mrs Redondo, let me say it again: we are talking about LEADER II and not a mixture of LEADER I and LEADER II."
"One thing is absolutely clear: LEADER I has already expired and we now have the LEADER II Community initiative."
"I can assure you that it is not my intention nor that of my services to create additional bureaucracy here."
"What we actually need simply a proper system."
"And we have to have that system because we could otherwise come up against problems later when it comes balancing the books."
"I repeat: if there are problems here, for whatever reason, I am prepared to help solve them."
"Please tell me about them."
"Question No 33 by Mrs Mary Banotti (H-0409/97)"
"Subject: Abolition of duty-free sales"
"Has the Commission considered the implications of the possible loss of 140 000 jobs in the European Union on the abolition of duty-free sales?"
"Given the high level of unemployment in the EU at the moment, does the Commission not consider that the deadline for abolition of duty-free in June 1999 should be further extended to consider in particular its effect on regional development and employment?"
"Mr President, when the directives on the abolition of tax controls at borders were adopted, the Council decided to cease permitting duty-free sales as of 1 July 1999, although it made provision for a transitional period which has to be used for the taxation of intra-Community trade to allow the adoption of the measures necessary to cushion the social impact in the regions affected and at the same time regional difficulties - particularly in border regions."
"The Commission regrets the fact that the sector in question has not used the transitional period provided for by the Council to develop a strategy to cushion the effect of removing the tax advantage of duty-free sales."
"There was never any question of the Council decision, which actually dates back five years, being rescinded."
"In fact, the dutyfree sector actually increased its turnover between 1991 and 1995 by some 50 % and in so doing naturally created an unacceptable means of exerting pressure."
"That increase in turnover also shows the importance of the tax advantage to the sector, accounting for 35 % of turnover on average."
"With financial support of that nature, it would be possible for any marketing sector to create at least the number of jobs mentioned in the question."
"It is telling that the arguments - including the argument about jobs - cited here in support of extending the transitional period, are exactly the same as those which led to the 1991 Council decision."
"It is not therefore the Commission's intention to propose an extension of the transitional period."
"I am quite amazed at the Commissioner's answer."
"Clearly, the Commission has been remiss in assessing the damage both to the shipping and airline business resulting from the abolition of duty-free: its effect on costs and fares and above all, in the regions, its effect on employment."
"Already it is estimated that at least 1, 800 people could lose their jobs on the ferries in Ireland."
"Why is it not possible to do a proper study based on the realities we face today?"
"A huge number of jobs are involved and maintaining duty-free has particular relevance for regional development."
"You can argue that, simply because they have a tax advantage, they should not be allowed to continue in this line of business and that anybody else would be able to continue with that sort of advantage."
"I do not think that is good enough given the appalling vista we have before us of job losses in these areas."
"Would you agree that the Commission has been remiss in the way it did not conduct adequate studies into the effect of the abolition of duty-free?"
"Mrs Banotti, I have to be quite candid with you and say that: firstly, it has long been known that this decision was coming, but instead of preparing for this new and necessary situation, the sector has done exactly the opposite and used the tax advantage to increase turnover."
"And so it cannot be argued that jobs are now going to be lost because duty-free is no longer possible."
"You could equally ask how many jobs have already been lost in normal trading which was at a clear competitive disadvantage as a result of this situation."
"I would like to support what Mrs Banotti said."
"The UK also has a problem."
"As in Ireland, we will be facing many job losses in the ferry industries and in regional and local airports.The effect will be disastrous."
"Although the Commissioner said that this has been known for some time, the studies which have outlined the sort of job losses we are talking about have in fact been relatively recent."
"In the light of those studies, the Commissioner should give further thought to the number of jobs which will be lost and the effect on transport facilities both in the UK and Ireland and other countries affected."
"It goes without saying that a restructuring measure of the kind needed here is bound to involve problems and difficulties."
"We fully acknowledge that."
"But I do not believe that it is compatible with the principle of the internal market permanently to allow structures which clearly disadvantage normal trade, while special provision is made for some, according them a clear competitive advantage."
"The Commission is therefore in agreement with the Member States and the Council on this issue and does not intend to submit a proposal for amendment of the kind you are requesting."
"Thank you for your kind treatment of us, Mr President."
"I am very glad of it."
"Mr Fischler, I think your answer was a bad one."
"I think it was bad because there is unemployment. If there were no unemployment, it would be OK to abolish the system."
"But regions are affected. In my region we have the highest rate of unemployment in Denmark, and we shall lose 2900 jobs."
"People will really be devastated by this measure."
"It cannot be the Commission's intention to create unemployment."
"Create new jobs, before you start to close jobs down."
"I think it was a bad answer, and I think you could have been better prepared in the way you are answering us."
"Mr Blak, I thought you were going to be speaking on a point of order. But it is Mr Cassidy's turn and so I am now giving him the floor."
"If the Commissioner then decides to answer your question, it is up to him."
"Mr Cassidy, you have one minute."
"I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on his robust answers to Mrs Banotti and to Mr Truscott."
"The fact is that the very name duty-free is misleading."
"A more correct appellation would be tax-free."
"Secondly, it has been admitted by one of the operators in the United Kingdom that the ending of tax-free sales would mean an extra £15 on the average charter air fare."
"In other words, nearly ECU 20."
"The British exchequer loses several hundred million pounds a year on this trade."
"It has no place in a single market."
"It has an effect on other sectors of the retail trade as the Commissioner has pointed out."
"It is also hotly opposed by the Consumers Association."
"So will the Commission stick to its guns on this issue?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, it is not my personal responsibility to make proposals on this."
"That is for my colleague, Commissioner Monti."
"But in so far as I can judge or see from the Commission perspective, we continue to stand by what I already said, including as a Commission."
"Secondly, should problems of transport costs arise here or transport difficulties, then I should like to make it absolutely clear that that would have to be met from airport fees which, in Europe, are not exactly the lowest, compared with the international picture."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler."
"Mr Andersson, on a point of order."
"I would just like to state that it is a little unfortunate that the discussion on this important issue, which concerns so many regions in Europe, has concentrated on only one region."
"May I just say that there are many regions which will have the same problems when tax free shopping disappears and we would like to act as the mouthpiece for what will happen in these regions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission position on the obligations of the Member States, under Articles 5 and 30 of the EC Treaty, to prevent individuals disrupting the smooth functioning of the internal market and the free movement of goods has already on several occasions been explained to the House."
"In an effort to bring to an end attacks by French farmers on agricultural products from other Member States, the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, brought an action for infringement of the Treaty before the European Court of Justice."
"The aim of that action is to get the French Government to meet its obligations under Articles 5 and 30 of the EC Treaty."
"That case is pending before the Court of Justice under Registry number C-265/95."
"The deadline for the oral procedure has been set at 10 June 1997."
"Since the Commission has taken the court action available to it under the Treaty to enforce Community law, we must wait for the Court's judgment."
"Following fresh attacks on 24 April last and then again recently, the Commission urged the French authorities, on 24 April - after the first incident - finally to use their powers and guarantee internal security."
"In addition, Commissioner Monti wrote to the minister responsible for the internal market in France, drawing his attention, as a matter of urgency, to the fact that he had to secure the conditions necessary for the operation of the internal market."
"We have also made it publicly clear that the Commission is not prepared simply to tolerate such attacks, and we shall be considering whether the Commission can take further legal or administrative measures to put a stop to this situation."
"Commissioner, as you see this is indeed a very tricky problem and a very serious one, because these violent acts - taking place frequently, as you admit - against Spanish farm produce on French roads, have a terrible effect, destroy the single market and endanger people's personal safety."
"The most serious aspect of all, Commissioner, is that this aggression is achieving the desired results."
"According to news that has come to us over recent days, the overwhelming majority of exports of fruit and vegetables from my country to France has been diverted to other markets, which has obviously led to a sharp price drop."
"The damage done is therefore far greater than merely a calculation of the quantity and face value of the destroyed goods."
"My question is: do you think that the current measures and the action taken by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg will be enough to solve this problem or will you need new measures and new powers to take determined action and avoid these uncivilized attacks?"
"Mr Sanz Fernández, I should like to make it clear that the question of whether actions for damages are likely to be successful will depend, in the first instance, on the judgment reached by the Court of Justice."
"Apart from that, damages are primarily a matter for the national courts."
"Such claims have therefore to be brought before the national courts."
"Commissioner, I must insist on the attacks against Spanish farmers when their fruit and vegetables are being transported through southern France."
"These are repeated acts of violence."
"You only have to look at the number of European Parliament resolutions to see that - the number of violations of Article 5 of the Treaty, which obliges all Member States to adopt all the appropriate general or specific measures to ensure compliance with the internal market, i.e. the suppression of any obstacles between the Member States to the free movement of goods."
"In this case, however, there is an added dimension of unusual violence, of out and out vandalism."
"It is not enough to condemn these acts."
"We must compensate for the damage done not only to vehicles but also to the goods, because the loss of those goods in particular must be compensated for."
"I refer, Commissioner, in particular to the latest measures taken to deal with these acts, to which you and the previous speaker referred."
"What does the Commission plan to do in the future to deal with these incidents?"
"Mr Camisón Asensio, when you say that this also constitutes violence and vandalism - and that may very well be the case - it remains clear that such attacks have to be proceeded against under criminal law."
"But criminal law is in any event national law."
"Criminal proceedings would have to be conducted in France."
"What the Commission has criticized over and over again is that the French police authorities have been anything but active in intervening on-the-spot when such attacks are taking place."
"We have also been able to document that irregular conduct."
"We have just today - the oral procedure is today taking place before the Court of Justice - submitted videos and other documentation to prove this."
"I hope then that something will finally be done and that the new French Government will take up this matter."
"Commissioner, you know that the European Parliament has repeatedly protested, with the Presidency's blessing, in order to highlight the importance of farming and preserved food in the region of Murcia, against attacks on lorry drivers and products from Murcia in France."
"I thought your last answer was evasive."
"I would like to know whether the Commission is taking action or intends to take action to make sure that the loss of products is compensated for. But I see that this is a question that does not interest the Commission."
"My second brief question is this: if these questions demonstrate that the fruit and vegetables COM and the CAP reforms of 1992 are not properly functioning, perhaps these events should actually lead to a proper reform of the fruit and vegetables COMs and the common agricultural policy?"
"Mr Marset Campos, if I may begin with your second question, I should like to make it clear to you that those attacks took place specifically before the new organization of the market in fruit and vegetables entered into force, after the old organization of the market then."
"I cannot therefore see how the attacks are linked to the new organization of the market in vegetables."
"Far from it, I am actually expecting the new organization of the market in vegetables to result in new developments, as we further encourage producer groups."
"As regards your first question concerning the possibilities of the Commission intervening directly on site, I have, unfortunately, to say that the Commission does not have its own police or similar units, and I assume that the European Council in Amsterdam next week is unlikely to set up a Commission police unit of that kind."
"So - unfortunately, I have to say - we are always dependent on the forces of law and order of the Member States."
"Regrettably, all we can do is approach the Member State and ensure it meets its obligations."
"If it does not, then our ultimate weapon, so to speak, is to bring the matter before the Court of Justice."
"We have used that ultimate weapon and proceedings are now under way before the Court."
"Nor are there any further possibilities under the Treaty either."
"Question No 35 by Mr Roy Perry (H-0436/97)"
"Subject: Regional policy/islands"
"Is the Commission giving support to the proposal at the IGC from Greece and Spain to include a clause in the new treaty on islands?"
"Mr President, it was the Commission's understanding that suitable measures would be drawn up to resolve the special territorial issues that arise for certain regions, including the islands."
"These measures should of course not interfere with the internal market or free trade or, for that matter, the rules of competition."
"As one of the matters to be discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference, Greece presented a proposal over a year ago, when the negotiations started, to amend Article 92(3) and Articles 130a and 130f of the Treaty in order to take explicit account of the special circumstances arising in the island regions."
"The Commission had favoured the insertion of a text in the final declaration of the Conference, in which the special concerns of the island regions would be noted."
"In the Commission's view this political recognition is sufficient because, with it, the Treaty makes it possible in the future to take account of the situation on the islands."
"Finally the situation of the islands is different to that of the regions on the periphery of the Union."
"Here the three countries affected, France, Spain and Portugal, are seeking the inclusion of these areas under Article 227(2) and the addition of a protocol on how this Article should be implemented."
"I appreciate the Commissioner's response."
"I was somewhat relieved that it was not Commissioner Fischler, who comes from a landlocked country, who answered my question."
"I certainly hope that the IGC will be able to recognize the needs of islands."
"If that is included within the findings of the IGC and in the subsequent Treaty, can the Commissioner give me some idea of what sort of proposals the Commission might think it appropriate to come forward with to help islands and, in particular, the Isle of Wight, which I represent in this Parliament?"
"I think we all realize that we are now at a stage where the very last details of matters under discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference are about to fall into place."
"These are the last days of meetings between the personal representatives, then comes the summit, which means that I cannot go any further than I did in my first answer, that is to say that the Commission supported the proposals that had been put forward and that we think it would be appropriate if the final declaration contained a text which made it possible to give special consideration to the islands."
"I myself should guard against making any pronouncements on what should be done in specific cases and in relation to individual islands."
"That is something I should not venture into, given the many Members who are familiar with islands, which I, as a Commissioner, could of course not know with the same degree of detail as Members of Parliament."
"As we all know, Finland is the country with the highest number of archipelagos and waterways in the whole of Europe."
"We sing in our national anthem that we are 'the land of the thousand seas' ."
"In fact, we have 76 000 islands which are larger than 1.5 hectares."
"But still no attention is being paid, in the proposed Article or the proposal for the opinion from the Intergovernmental Conference currently underway, to the need which exists in Sweden and Finland, and perhaps even Denmark, for an archipelago policy."
"The opinion mentions 'island regions' ."
"Instead, I would like to see this become 'archipelago regions' , in other words, areas where water divides the land and brings with it the need for a totally different social structure."
"I also hope that when we specifically follow up on this report it may lead to a different view of transport aid in the regions."
"I am totally convinced that Commissioner Liikanen could give a very good account of what it is like to live in a country where water really does split the land."
"It is quite correct that, when we look around the European Union, we see many regions in which islands play a major role, and that is quite clearly the case, as the speaker pointed out, for the Finnish region."
"What we are talking about, and what today's question hinged on, is, first and foremost, whether we would support the proposal to take special account of the islands' problems in the final declaration of the Intergovernmental Conference, and I gave an affirmative answer to that."
"Clearly, as a Dane, I know some of the problems there have been in our region, and I think that people in any country where there are islands have a common view on many of these problems which, as the speaker indicates, can have to do with transport, but also education and all manner of things. I therefore consider it important that that possibility should be included in the new Treaty."
"The reply on the particular predicament of islands which are remote from the centre of the Community was positive and very understanding."
"However, I would like a clarification from the Commissioner on something that I am not sure about."
"She has said that the Commission has a grasp of the situation and that there may be an announcement."
"What the questioner asked, and what we are asking, too, is whether a clause on islands will be included in the Maastricht II text after the IGC. Whether, that is to say, as the final touches are added, as she puts it, there will an interesting announcement on the matter which would still, all the same, be non-binding and a pious aspiration."
"I would like her to clarify that."
"As I began by saying in answer to the first supplementary question, we are now at a stage in the Intergovernmental Conference at which it very much depends on what the Member States do and on what degree of priority they assign to particular questions."
"It is not possible for me, as a Commissioner, to give any guarantees on what the final outcomes of the Intergovernmental Conference will be. The information I can give is that the Commission has supported the concrete proposal put forward amongst others by Greece, Spain and Portugal, and we will continue to do so."
"I cannot say whether it will be adopted or what form it may take if it is, but I can say that the Commission has supported it in the negotiations so far, and we will also do so in the final stages."
"The time allowed for the firts part of Question Time has come to an end. Question No 36 will receive a written anwser."
"Question No 37 by Mr Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0425/97)"
"Subject: Exemption of EU employees from paying income tax"
"Staff employed by the EU in the Member States, e.g. in the Commission's and Parliament's offices, are exempt from paying income tax in the country in which they live, yet they and their families benefit from public services, such as health care, transport and education, which are financed by taxes."
"Does the Commission intend to try to change this state of affairs so that EU employees, too, have to pay income tax in the country in which they work?"
"Mr President, the Commission's representations in the Member States employ both Commission officials and workers recruited from the Member States in question."
"For example, on the staff of the Commission's representation in Sweden there are six officials and eleven employees recruited in Sweden."
"Thus two-thirds of the staff are locally recruited."
"They pay income tax in accordance with national taxation laws."
"As regards the income tax position of the Commission officials, it should be noted that the Community has its own taxation system."
"EU officials pay a progressive Community income tax."
"The Union also has its own social security and health insurance system, to which the EU officials pay insurance contributions and by which they and their families are covered."
"On the question of indirect taxation it may be noted that both EU officials and locally recruited staff pay indirect taxes."
"Thus within the EU representations there are staff belonging to two different taxation systems."
"It might of course be wondered whether in future the proportion of locally recruited officials on the representations' staff should be increased still further."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response."
"I would like to say that I think it reasonable that anyone who is working and located permanently in a Member State should pay income tax in that country."
"They not only receive the benefit of health care in that country but also communications and education etc."
"EU employees working in Sweden are also protected by the Swedish military and can enjoy the Swedish royal family and much more."
"I think that it is reasonable to pay tax in the country in which you make use of the public sector, regardless of the capacity in which you are employed by the European Commission."
"Furthermore, I think that tax exemption of this kind is provocative, as it also strengthens the view that there are huge benefits attached to employment within the EU system."
"I do not think that there can be any good reason why some people do not pay tax in the country in which they live and work."
"I wonder if you are going to take any steps to change this state of affairs so that everyone who is employed by the Commission is treated equally in this respect."
"I am also from Sweden where we have debated EU staff conditions; we have also debated the employment conditions for Members of Parliament, and both are of course equally important."
"I think that it is extremely important that the relationship between the general public and those of us working here as elected representatives, or at the Commission's office in Sweden or in other Member States should be as good as it can be."
"My next question is: does Commissioner Liikanen not think that it would be possible to improve this relationship by actively removing those instruments, or those rules which make it difficult for many people to feel comfortable with what goes on in the EU?"
"I would very much like an answer to this question."
"Of course we must improve our relationship with the people in all the Member States."
"Historically, employment legislation governing EU employees has been designed to treat all permanent staff in every EU country in exactly the same way."
"This has led to a situation in which anyone working permanently for an EU institution has the same rights in all EEC countries."
"I am well aware that this situation has been difficult to explain in Sweden."
"In general the problem with salary privileges is not so great."
"We have examined this quite carefully and compared the net salary level for foreign diplomats stationed in Brussels with the net salary level of an EEC member of staff also stationed there."
"I have to say that in the majority of cases the differences are quite small."
"This discussion has been more noticeable in those countries where people are working on their home territory."
"Question No 38 by Mr Bryan Cassidy (H-0439/97)"
"Subject: Age limits in recruitment to the European Commission and its associate organizations"
"Is the Commission aware that the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions does not use any age limits in its job advertisements because it stopped this practice a few years ago?"
"Will the Commission follow the excellent lead given by the European Foundation and stop using age limits in the Commission's own recruitment advertisements?"
"Mr McMahon, on a point of order."
"Mr President, I tabled a similar question but for some reason it was put way down on the list."
"It should have been taken with Mr Cassidy's question as it is on the same issue."
"This is the second month that this has happened."
"Mr McMahon, it is not the European Parliament services that decide which Commissioner answers the questions, but the Commission itself."
"Mr Liikanen wishes to answer you any way. You have the floor, Commissioner."
"I am very conscious of the fact that the Commission has made an effort, in particular since Commissioner Liikanen took on responsibility for this dossier and we welcome the fact that for A Grades there is now a limit up to 50."
"But the fact remains that one of the important institutions, the European Centre for Living and Working Conditions in Dublin, does not exercise limits in age."
"The parliamentary groups in this Parliament, thanks to the efforts of the Intergroup on Ageing in Parliament, no longer exercise age limits."
"It is a bit of an old-fashioned survival, I would respectfully suggest."
"I hope the Commissioner will press on with the negotiations with what he called the organisations syndicales . Am I correct in assuming they are the stumbling block in this affair?"
"Mr President, the trade union organizations think that independent public administration requires in principle that officials should start at an early age and pursue their career there."
"We have had some discussions on higher age limits where they have been more hesitant, but that is a discussion we must take."
"The second point that I want to make is that even with no growth in Commission staff in the future and despite extensive recruitment over the last ten years, it is plain that - even although I hope we will be more flexible in the future - we cannot stop recruiting young people because, otherwise, the Commission's entire staffing structure will become noticeably top-heavy."
"Thirdly, I am ready to try and find with an open mind solutions in those areas where this is possible."
"The only exception perhaps is that we should have a kind of basic grade for young people coming directly from university although we could try to find more practical solutions for those with professional experience."
"I understand the intergroup in Parliament on this issue is holding a small seminar on Thursday."
"My director-general will attend and contribute to the discussion with details of the problems concerned."
"The final point I want to make is that our real problem is the huge number of applicants."
"If we have tens of thousands of applicants and we can only recruit one or two hundred, we will encounter many practical problems in the running of such an operation in the future."
"I am sure that it will be useful to discuss the details later this week."
"I heard the Commissioner with some interest."
"Does he not think there is some hypocrisy here in talking about a flexible labour market while politicians are going around the world saying no-one will have a job for life and that people will have to adapt and have several careers?"
"In their own backyard the Commission are openly practising this job for life approach and, if you do not get on the bottom rung of the ladder then there really is a block on you."
"Is not hypocrisy being preached within the Commission when they are saying one thing to the general public about unemployment and about the economy, and yet, in actual practice, they are doing the complete opposite."
"When are they going to match their rhetoric with their actions within the Commission itself?"
"Similarly, on the IGC, is there not something wrong with the Commissioner proposing a non-discrimination clause on ageism at the IGC while at the same time the Commission and the institutions are practising what they are trying to abolish?"
"I am sorry that Mr McMahon did not have the chance to listen to my reply because I explained that a large part of the Commission officials are above this age limit."
"There are no age limits for temporary agents which is a type of recruitment which we are carrying out, for instance, for BSE."
"Secondly, as regards the new countries, where we have recruited most officials during the last two years, half of the recruitment has been of young people for the A6, A7 and A8 posts, but another half with staff who are older, up to the age of 60 in fact."
"I am certain that if we look at the recruitment practices of the public sector in general and how people are being recruited as new officials, the record of the Commission is not so bad."
"I am still willing to give thought to whether we can have a more open system for all those jobs where we need professional experience."
"For those young people who come directly to assistant jobs, whether we have age limits or not it is very clear that these jobs are for people without professional experience as a first step in the administration."
"Commissioner, I have read your written reply and I heard what you have said."
"I read between the lines a degree of personal sympathy for what we are trying to do."
"I do not know if you know, but Parliament voted in February to delete the reference to age limits from the Annex to the Staff Regulations."
"I hope you will do the same thing in the Commission."
"I find it surprising that anybody should be justifying an age limit by the fact that there are too many people applying."
"I cannot imagine that any business in this world would apply that criteria."
"Do you agree?"
"One thing in Europe today is clear: unemployment is a major problem for people of about 45 to 50 years old."
"Why?"
"Because they tend not to be recruited in the labour market."
"That is a fact."
"That is a real problem of unemployment, because employers prefer to recruit young people."
"Unfortunately, that is the case."
"I hope we can change it but that is the case in countries with high unemployment."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, we are ready to be more open in the future."
"We want to have young people also."
"We will recruit very few now because of budgetary constraints."
"We cannot forget total generations."
"We must recruit young people, but be open in areas where we need professional experience and also people who are not young and we will recruit without age limits."
"I would like to join those who express some amazement that those of us who have to meet the public boast about the non-discrimination and the law on that subject within the Union."
"And yet we have had really amazingly blatant and naked justification for a system which imposes effectively a ban on people who are very often experienced."
"I noted some of the justifications: young people would be happy, loyal and have a good career."
"Why does that not equally apply to someone over 50?"
"Indeed, they may be happier and more loyal because they would probably appreciate it and bring experience to bear."
"We are not asking the Commission to stop recruiting young people, we are asking it not to put a ban on recruiting older people."
"I do not understand how the Commission can possibly go on with this policy."
"Is there any timetable it has in mind when it is going to stop it?"
"Mr President, I am sorry I was not quoted correctly."
"As much as I would like to talk about happiness in life I did not mention that in my reply."
"As far as age limits are concerned, I said that I am presenting here an opening."
"I still hope that I can go forward with the line I have presented here today."
"The time allowed for questions to Mr Liikanen has come to an end. Question No 39 will receive a written answer."
"Question No 40 by Mr Josu Imaz San Miguel (H-0414/97)"
"Subject: Drift nets"
"The Presidency of the Fisheries Council suggested to the Commission at the last meeting (held on 14 and 15 April) that a new proposal be drawn up to tackle the problem of drift nets."
"As the Presidency suggested, the new proposal should include the latest, most up-to-date information on this subject."
"Italy's change of position, as publicly expressed by Minister Pinto in Venice on 29 November 1996, in favour of a total ban on drift nets, and the specific provision on using drift nets in the Baltic as opposed to other fishing grounds open the way for a majority within the Council in favour of a total ban on such nets in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean."
"Has the Commission drawn up a proposal along these lines?"
"Does the proposal include a total ban on these nets, with the exception of the Baltic Sea?"
"As the Honourable Member knows, the dossier referred to in the question is the one which has caused the Commission, and me personally, as Commissioner responsible for it, the most headaches."
"One matter remains: after the decisions taken in the Council on the plan to restructure the Italian fleet and especially on the position taken by Germany on a request from the Spanish Minister, there is the decision that the Commission initiate a series of informal bilateral contacts with the Member States to consider the feasibility of a new amending proposal which may be varied in nature: for example, there might be a split between the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, or similar actions."
"So the Commission is making the preparations and starting these bilateral contacts."
"But I have to say to the Honourable Member that it is not the Commission's intention to superimpose the 'drift nets' dossier on the 'technical measures' dossier, which the Commission intends to conclude in the Fisheries Council on 30 October."
"As the Honourable Member can readily understand, this is to avoid cross vetoes or more or less transparent attempts at bartering between the various dossiers."
"The Commission therefore means to end this round of consultations and settle the position or present a new proposal by the end of the year."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer."
"Although this is giving you and the Commission a headache, I am convinced that the Commission is doing serious work on this matter and working in the right direction, according to the timetable you have set."
"I should like to ask two further questions."
"Is the Commission going to make a practical proposal on this matter in the autumn, for October or just after?"
"Then it could plan on banning these nets by summer 1998."
"Secondly, does the Commission envisage in its proposal any reconversion plan as i think that that would be very positive for the French, Irish and British fleets, funded through the IFOP or any other type of European fund so that these fleets could be paid for the additional net investment required and so that they could be given the necessary training to convert to more selective fishing methods."
"I believe that the Commission will present a proposal by the end of the year."
"As you know, everything depends on the procedures in which the Council and the European Parliament take part, and as the Commission is not the only matter of this procedure, it will have to wait and see."
"As for your second remark, this is one of the subject of the bilateral consultation that we are holding with the Member States."
"I should like to point out that, in respect of Ireland, there is only one boat left fishing with drift-nets; that means there is no need for a major reconversion plan there."
"Once there is an agreement, the Member States using drift-nets in the Atlantic will have to send control vessels: you can imagine what the economic cost of that initiative would be."
"As for Britain, last year it had only five or six drift-net boats in use under the British flag."
"That too would not require a major reconversion plan."
"The question does arise in the case of France. It still has a fleet of 40 boats, an old fleet still using drift-nets."
"This is something that could be considered in the bilateral talks, in similar terms to the procedures applied in the Italian plan."
"I repeat, there are procedures and also financial aspects."
"Question No 41 by Mr Robin Teverson (H-0420/97)"
"Subject: Task force on future of CFP"
"In the recent round table discussion on the future of the CFP, Commissioner Bonino said that a 'Task Force' is being put together in DG XIV to deal with this."
"Has this been done, what is the timetable, who is on it and how will it work?"
"In addition, can the Commissioner outline its terms of reference and the European Parliament's role?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under the auspices of the Directorate General for Fisheries, a task force has already been set up charged with preparing the revision of the common fisheries policy, as provided for in the base regulation, through a report to be presented to the Commission by the end of 2002."
"The first task of this group must be to define the methodology of the work, and in this context a seminar with the European Parliament will be organized by the end of the year, in which all interested Members of Parliament can participate, to establish the content and above all the methodology necessary to make a good discussion possible before the proposal is drawn up in 2001."
"Personally, I think the whole process should be based on wide consultation of all the players and interested parties. So on the one hand, very close contact with your Committee on Fisheries throughout this whole process, which is a long term process, and on the other, obviously, consultation with the Member States and the sector."
"The idea we are developing inside the Directorate General is a questionnaire to be distributed as widely as possible, in other words trying to have a bottom-up approach, at least in the first stage of the process, so that we can take stock of all the concerns, and indeed suggestions, which emerge from various quarters of the sector, although some subjects, obviously, may be less controversial, while other ideas may be usefully taken into consideration."
"From the point of view of methodology, we feel the first important deadline for this task force is the organization of the seminar by the end of the year, with the participation of the European Parliament."
"Thank you Commissioner, for a very useful reply there."
"I certainly have been very pleased that such a working party is being set up and that it is going to be reasonably broad-based."
"The question I would like to ask going on from that is how broad do you think the questions will be that they will be able to ask?"
"Will it just be a question of how a common fisheries policy should change for the future, or will they actually consider the broad spectrum of alternatives which might go from complete renationalization - not something that I would advocate - but through regionalization and into a completely unified European fleet."
"Is all that spectrum within the remit of the working party or is it really within a new common fisheries policy as a common fisheries policy?"
"The idea - at least for those putting the questions - is for very broad questions to be asked."
"That does not mean that in the follow-up of the process we will be able to retain or accept all the suggestions."
"If we just want to ask what people want to change about the existing common fisheries policy, there is really no point to the use of a methodology such as a questionnaire."
"You can use other tools."
"But if we accept this use of a questionnaire, it has to be as broad as possible and address the questions you are asking: such as regionalization."
"Provided, of course, we understand quite specifically what we mean by regionalization because, as far as I can understand, throughout the fisheries sector the Member States have quite different views on what regionalization is supposed to mean."
"So on this particular issue, one question is not enough."
"The problem is to have broader questions with alternatives that can give us at least a broad idea of what everybody thinks."
"So we want to start in 1997 to give ourselves enough time for a full revision."
"Maybe at the end of the process we will remain with the same common fisheries policy or a slightly different one."
"This I cannot predict."
"But a revision is not a simple modification."
"The name itself means that everything can be called into question."
"Since we are trading and cooperating in a variety of ways with Third World countries and our fleets are operating in Third World country waters - will those countries be taken into the Commissioner's confidence when she is drawing up the new common fisheries policy?"
"Will we be permitting the Third World countries to have some kind of meaningful representation so that we hear their voices as clearly as we hear the voices of our own fishing people?"
"My reply is that from a strictly procedural standpoint, this is not possible."
"But what we are trying to do is to have informal consultations, mostly with countries with which we have development policies or fishery agreements. But I cannot get information from the legal service."
"We can only have informal consultations mostly related to international agreements."
"Mr Morris, listen for one moment."
"If it is a point of order, you have the floor."
"But your question must be about the same subject."
"I shall have to stick to the Rules and you know that you cannot open a new debate."
"But if it really is a point of order, you have the floor."
"I wish to be helpful."
"As you know, we now have an ongoing ACP fisheries working party."
"I was wondering whether or not the Commissioner could work through that agency?"
"Thank you for your help - but it was not a point of order."
"I think Mrs Bonino wants to reply."
"The Commission is in favour of having input from this working group, not with binding documents but in an informal consultation."
"The time allowed for questions to Mrs Bonino has come to an end. Questions 42 to 45 will receive written answers."
"Mr President, I can deal only with the factual issue concerning Directive 95/47/EEC and other directives that may be relevant here."
"I cannot, of course, comment on the political disputes that have begun and are continuing in Spain on this matter."
"The directive that regulates television standards, requires standardized transmission systems for digital television, and that is a clear technical requirement that is designed to guarantee that all broadcasters transmit in the same format."
"This is intended to prevent a number of standards, such as the Pal and Secam variants, existing side-byside in the digital age."
"The directive then regulates the way in which services are provided so that broadcasters are able to charge customers for programmes broadcast to subscribers."
"Those are the conditional access services."
"Customers are generally able to use those services by using a chip-card which they insert in their decoder."
"Under the directive, those services must be available to all broadcasters under fair, appropriate and non-discriminatory conditions, that is to say that the directive does not provide for any technical resources, it does not contain any standards, nor does it speak out in favour of any particular system."
"It is up to the market operator which system he chooses."
"The directive does not therefore opt for either simulcrypt or multicrypt."
"Both allow operators common use of conditional access systems."
"The common or combined use of conditional access systems means that a viewer, who initially subscribes to the services of one broadcaster, is subsequently able to use those of another supplier without having to acquire another decoder."
"That is the important point."
"The directive itself does not deal specifically with agreements and contractual relations between market operators."
"They have to regulate that among themselves."
"But it is made clear that such agreements must result in fair, appropriate and non-discriminatory conditions, that means then that where such agreements have to be made, this is not a serious disadvantage but a method that can be applied to specific technical solutions, to which the directive also refers."
"We are, of course, aware that this is very much a matter of dispute."
"We tried, first of all in talks with the Spanish Government, to ensure that its legislation was compatible with the directive, and we also invited both parties to the dispute along with a technical expert who made it sufficiently clear that both the systems that each uses are open systems."
"Both sides are currently in negotiation, though we remain under an obligation, should the negotiations prove unsuccessful - and we shall know the outcome next week - to consider the legal aspects and then decide whether the Spanish law is compatible with EU law."
"What we are looking at here is not only whether the directive is being infringed but also whether Articles 30 and 59 of the Treaty and directives 83/189/EEC and 95/47/EC are being infringed, the implication being that the other provisions may also be pertinent."
"Commissioner Monti is partly responsible for this, and we are working together."
"I told Minister Arias Salgado personally about this review and pointed out that if the parties cannot agree, the Commission will take a decision."
"That will have, of course, also to ensure that no decision is taken in favour of one party or the other."
"If, contrary to what we decide, that does happen, we shall have to take legal action, and, if necessary, if the Spanish Government has not acted legally, it will have to compensate for the damage its actions have caused."
"Commissioner, the Simulcrypt system needs pacts. That is it main defect, because all the owner would have to do is make difficulties over the pact and the whole agreement would collapse in ruins."
"That would create an owner-dominated market, a de facto monopoly, to the detriment of media pluralism and free competition."
"The Member State cannot allow such an abuse as it would not be fulfilling its obligations, as you said, to create non-discriminatory conditions, as we are obliged by the Directive you have mentioned."
"Until the pact between the first two operators is unblocked, the problem will continue for the others and other undesirable duopolies or oligopolies will emerge."
"That would lead to the harmful situation of market collusion."
"This pernicious situation in Spain has been solved by the recent law banking on the Multicrypt system."
"That enables immediate compatibility if there is no agreement within two months."
"The Commission does not share that view because what is currently provided for under Spanish legislation is in fact a monopoly, with only one system being accepted."
"An alternative, which already exists on the market in Spain, by the way, is being excluded."
"How anyone can consider that a prime example of free trade, I fail to see."
"On the basis of our own directives, only a system that does not permit access to another broadcaster can be excluded."
"We also brought in a technical expert, whom many describe as the king of decoders, if you do not find that description a little over-the-top, and that technical expert made it absolutely clear in the talks we had with both parties to the dispute that both systems are open, although they use different technologies and that the fact that it is necessary to negotiate in the case of the one system does not mean preclude a fair outcome."
"The directive actually provides that the negotiations must be fair and non-discriminatory."
"Let us just assume that the negotiations that have taken place this week were conducted by one side in an unfair and discriminatory manner."
"That party would not then be acting in accordance with the directive."
"But it is not possible to prescribe a single technical solution which, moreover, is not yet on the market."
"That is not compatible with the directive."
"The situation is, I venture to say, a little bizarre."
"There is a system in Spain that already operates; thousands of viewers are working with that system and are completely satisfied."
"The system is technically open, as the expert confirmed to us, but a different system, that is not even on the market, is to be made compulsory."
"That is a situation in law or in fact that we do not find credible."
"I understand that the Commissioner does not want to enter into Spanish domestic affairs, but the situation is such that you should know that the day after a representative of the affected company appeared before the court, it decided that he should not be able to leave Spain."
"But I understand that you do not want to get involved."
"Mr Bangemann, there has been no agreement."
"Yet the Commission will have to take a decision on Spanish legislation because it is seriously harming this company which has run the risk of innovating, of launching its product on to the market."
"I go along with your interpretation."
"I do not go along with the interpretations of the Partido Popular and the interpretation of their Minister who on his return from Brussels said that you - or Brussels - were violating the Treaty of Rome in the case of digital TV."
"Do you agree, Commissioner, and when will the Commission finally deliver its decision on this matter?"
"Mrs García Arias, I have made myself very clear here, and all we have done is to try to bring about agreement, including with the Spanish Government, by the way, because it makes no sense for us all to find ourselves before the Court of Justice again."
"Someone would have to pay compensation, and the viewers would be no better off."
"In Germany too, we brought the warring factions together, and they reached agreement."
"That is why we tried to do the same in the case of Spain, but that does not, of course, mean that we want to shirk our duty to take a decision."
"I have said that if agreement is not reached - and we shall know next week whether or not it has been - then we shall take a decision based on the directive I have quoted, but also based on Articles 30 and 59 of the Treaty of Rome."
"I do not know whether it was the Spanish minister or someone else who said that we are not applying the Treaty of Rome."
"I cannot understand that, since we are applying Articles 30 and 59, and so our decision will, naturally, be based on the directive and the Treaty of Rome."
"Commissioner, I too understand that you do not want to enter into political differences in my country, but I must insist on this."
"We have already spent quite a while on this and, knowing how the Commission works, this matter should be settled and concluded today."
"My concern, Commissioner, is quite legitimate."
"Whereas Simulcrypt meets the requirements and the Directive's provisions, if Spanish law prohibits it that would harm not only the company producing it but also large numbers of citizens - potential and actual consumers of that products - and if it is alright for other European countries it should also be for Spain."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I again ask you to deal with this matter as quickly as possible and prevent legitimate interests from being harmed: those of the media company promoting the system and those of the consumers who have already chosen it."
"We do not want a situation in my country where public opinion - as is already beginning to be the case - is unsure whether the two decoders are legal and is even beginning to think that Simulcrypt is illegal, fraudulent or something of that ilk."
"This doubt can only be cleared up and the rights of the company and the consumers will only be restored once the Commission takes a decision."
"This is an example of the attack I mentioned earlier."
"Mr President, I have already said that we shall be taking a decision next week."
"That is swift work for the Commission!"
"I think that we are looking at this askew."
"What the Spanish law proposes is that an agreement be reached and it sets a timetable for that agreement; if an agreement has not been reached within that time, it proposes that a universal decoder be adopted."
"But I think that this is neither the time nor the place to discuss this matter."
"The place to discuss differences over the arbitrary adjudication of the previous government is not the European Parliament: it is the national parliament where those problems should be dealt with."
"As he rightly said the Commissioner can only say that Community law must be complied with and we shall know whether or not the agreement has been reached."
"The Commissioner will tell us next week."
"Mr President, you are casting me into despair here, because when I get a question from a Member of the House - three of them - which the President allows, I have to answer."
"You would not perhaps have put the questions, nor did you, but when members of the other groups put them, the Commission has to deal with them."
"Factually you are incorrect because our directive contains specific provisions on what is and is not permitted in relation to decoders."
"That is the only issue here and that is why I have confined myself to it."
"The directive does not, for example, say that there should be only one decoder."
"We deliberately avoided that."
"We did reserve the right in the directive to set a standard for a single decoder."
"Were we to do that all of the parties involved would be very dissatisfied and suffer severe economic disadvantage, as the standard would probably not be met by any of the decoders currently in existence."
"We have reserved for ourselves this ultimate weapon, if I may so describe it."
"We did not allow the national governments to have it."
"And so what we have here is a European problem and not just a Spanish problem."
"I concede that the Spanish affair is livelier, but our problem is also a difficult one."
"It can, however, be resolved."
"Mr Bangemann, we shall remain with the same question but break up this Spanish momentum and open it up to a wider European area."
"Mr Caudron has the floor for a supplementary."
"Commissioner, I wanted to speak in this debate as I was the rapporteur for this directive, and I wish to confirm what you said."
"I have no particular technical question to ask, as I was partly responsible for the choice of solutions made in order to avoid monopolies or oligopolies, to avoid hold-ups and to enable numerical TV to be launched in Europe, as has been done."
"I therefore fully agree."
"The only question I wanted to ask, Commissioner, is a real one: you have set a timetable, i.e. you and the Commission will take a decision within a week."
"Could you tell us what the rest of the timetable is?"
"Where will it lead us?"
"What is the timescale available for unblocking this situation?"
"As far as the Commission is concerned, we shall be telling the Spanish Government next week what our legal opinion is and where, in our view, the Spanish law is incompatible with the directive and the articles I have cited."
"The Spanish Government may accept our view but it may also discard it."
"In that case, we shall have to go to the Court of Justice and that is bound to take rather longer."
"The question that we have not fully considered is whether we should ourselves then take a temporary measure or seek an interim order from the Court of Justice, since the Spanish law provides for a deadline, namely 7 July, after which no other decoder is to be permissible."
"To prevent economic disadvantage, it might be appropriate to apply to the Court of Justice for an interim order, so that the deadline does not mean that an existing decoder has suddenly to be withdrawn from the market."
"We shall look into that, but I can make no other promises."
"If the Court of Justice decides that we and not the Spanish Government are right, then that government will of course have to pay compensation to the company that it has disadvantaged as a result of its decision."
"That is clear but it is not particularly productive."
"That is why we have tried to reach an agreement and we are still trying to ensure that if agreement cannot be reached, then the Spanish Government will at least agree not to apply the law but wait until the Court of Justice has reached a decision."
"Then both systems will be able to develop alongside one another in Spain."
"But I cannot, of course, tell you what the Spanish Government will say."
"We are doing our best to arrive at a balanced and sensible solution."
"But I cannot guarantee that all involved have adopted the same approach to the dispute."
"It is, as I have said, a lively one."
"In the bullring, there are bulls that will simply not be pacified."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"We return not to bulls but to the Spanish momentum with the last two supplementaries."
"First of all, Mr Hernández Mollar."
"Mr President, a Spanish momentum is a European momentum."
"What is happening is that certain members from the Socialist Group want to destroy - yes, destroy - the general interests of European citizens and Spanish citizens in particular."
"You at the Commission probably know that, in respect of digital TV services, the Governing Board of the DVB decided to postpone application of the Simulcrypt cable system as a European standard."
"As a result there will probably be no European Simulcrypt standard until the end of 1997 or early 1998."
"On the other hand, the common interface for digital receivers was approved in May 1996 by the DVB, after its ratification by the National Standards Organizations that year, and its formal adoption as the European standard in February 1997 by the Cenelec."
"Faced with such a problem, i.e. the degree of standardization of the Simulcrypt system, I would like to ask the Commissioner what his opinion is of this disadvantageous situation and what negative effects it could lead to, in terms of the aim of offering all citizens as quickly as possible digital TV services by means of a universal system, while keeping the maximum amount of media pluralism."
"When we lay down a universal solution - and the time will come - then both of the systems currently on offer in Spain will have to go."
"That is a difficult technical issue."
"I do not know whether you are clear about it."
"There are two possibilities: either you have a uniform decoder, through which all services, including conditional access, pay-TV etc, are able to be supplied."
"That, if you like, is the ideal solution."
"For that, there has to be a technical standard."
"We shall get there one day, as the industry is working towards it."
"But we do not want to dictate it; were we to do so everyone now commissioning or offering decoders would suffer enormous economic disadvantage."
"They would have in fact to take their decoders off the market."
"And so we said we would stipulate only a minimum."
"That minimum is: anyone using a decoder must use one that is accessible to others."
"That is not a matter of laying down a special technical procedure, it is simply ensuring access."
"The Spanish legislation is not doing that, it is prescribing a decoder - not even a uniform decoder, by the way, but a decoder with a common interface."
"That is another technical system."
"That is not the ideal solution, namely that there should be only one decoder in existence, but it is a decoder that can, using a technical device, be made open to others."
"Other decoders that are also open are not allowed."
"That is precisely what the directive does not permit."
"Do you follow me?"
"If you read the directive through once again - Mr Caudron confirmed this and what Mr Caudron says is true - you will see that what I have described to you here is the legislation in force."
"That is the problem with the Spanish law."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann, but just one last question, again in the Spanish momentum."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo has the floor for the last supplementary question."
"My question is not the same, because I put it in a European key and with an extremely constructive intention."
"Commissioner, this afternoon you have been very clear."
"You know that on many occasions, when faced with a Solomon-like decisions, the introduction of a few keys can open the way to a solution."
"You said that if there is no agreement next week, the Commission will adopt a decision and position."
"With a constructive intention and in order to avoid such a Solomon-like decisions, could you not propose - if there is no agreement and the Commission had to take that decision - the terms of the Commission position?"
"I am sure that if you could put forward those terms, an agreement might come about. That is my question."
"The difference between you and Solomon is that he was far wiser than you, if you will allow me to point that out here."
"Were I now to tell you how our decision looks, then both the parties currently engaged in negotiation would probably withdraw from those negotiations."
"One side would be so certain of being acknowledged to be in the right that it would say: ' I do not need to negotiate any further!'"
"That concludes Question Time to the Commission. Questions Nos 49 to 53 will receive written answers."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Agricultural prices 1997-1998 - Arable crops - Improving agricultural structures - 1998 set-aside"
"Mr President, first of all I should like to take this opportunity to welcome Mr Fischler and the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, Mr Van Aartsen, to our Chamber."
"It is a pleasure to see you both here for this report."
"It shows how important it is."
"I have great pleasure in presenting the price package proposals as amended by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I should like to take this opportunity to go through the amendments in order, put a little bit of meat on them and say why the Agriculture Committee has proposed them and then perhaps look at the costs and talk that through."
"First of all, moisture content for cereals."
"We have proposed that the 15 % moisture content for cereals should be extended; in other words, it should not just last this year but continue."
"One of the major problems for northern Member States is the moisture content of cereals."
"It is extremely costly and the misuse of a valuable resource to have to try and bring cereals below 15 % moisture."
"Therefore I hope the Commission will stay on 15 %."
"That is budgetary-neutral."
"On protein crops, there has been a great decline recently - in fact, in the last two years - in the amount of such crops."
"I would like to see some sort of improvement in the support system to help protein crops."
"It is particularly relevant at the moment because we have just had a great debate for almost 18 months over BSE and the problems of animal protein."
"This is therefore a great opportunity for the European Union actually to produce more of its own protein and a vegetable protein at that."
"I feel it is important that we seriously consider the opportunities opened up here."
"The committee proposes to help the paddy rice industry."
"This is by way of assisting some of our southern Member States."
"One of the things that I have learnt since I came into this Parliament is that we are 15 Member States."
"I therefore have to look at all Members and all their regions and their problems."
"The rice sector has had a particularly difficult time in recent years."
"I am proposing a simplification of the present legislation."
"It provides the opportunity for quick support for the rice industry without great or long-term costs."
"The cost of these proposals will be somewhere in the region of ECU 60m and that includes all its accompanying measures."
"With regard to sugarbeet, we have recommended that the Commission review the fixed element of sugar storage refund."
"It is more than 10 years since we made these changes."
"This arrangement should now reflect the present changes in costs and probably should be reviewed, if possible, every three years."
"I am also proposing help with production costs in Spain and Portugal."
"This must, quite specifically, come from the national budget and not from the European budget."
"With flax and hemp I propose to bring hemp back into line with flax."
"Hemp is a useful alternative crop, it is environmentally friendly and it would cost only ECU 1m."
"On wine, if the ban on distillation were brought in as early as has been proposed by the Commission, it would cause undue hardship for southern vineyards."
"We are therefore proposing delaying application of the ban for one year."
"The approximate cost is again ECU 1 million."
"I am almost disappointed to say that, unfortunately, these measures and my report actually cost ECU 170m."
"That money must be found somewhere."
"We are in a situation of budgetary constraint."
"We have to understand the fact that in the Committee on Agriculture we cannot continue adding to the budget."
"There are a number of possibilities."
"Two have been proposed within the present price proposal package."
"One is an amendment concerning monthly increments for cereals."
"This has been re-presented in the amendments."
"The deletion of monthly increments would reduce the budget by ECU 160m."
"Having spent ECU 170m in the budget, this was one way of making the package virtually budget-neutral."
"For those who do not understand, monthly increments are an increased monthly payment paid to farmers for delaying sending their cereals into intervention."
"It would be popular in some respects because I see intervention generally being used as little as possible and being an emergency proposal."
"I also support another proposal which is to make the budget neutral overall."
"It comes from Mr Böge who has put down a number of proposals."
"It is a question of finding the money from the budget."
"In my explanatory statement, I call upon the Commission to fix the rate of set-aside, I put a date of July and I suggest the rate be 5 %."
"At this point, I would add that I believe that set-aside has been a brilliant option under the MacSharry reforms."
"It has been a good balancing measure."
"It has stopped over-production."
"It has stopped intervention and it has been good for the environment."
"One of the things that was said against it initially was that it would be environmentally unfriendly."
"This has not proved to be the case."
"However, the Commission at the moment has placed an export tax on cereals from the European Union because, in theory, we are short of cereals."
"This tax is something like ECU 10 per tonne."
"Therefore I see little point in raising set-aside above 5 % for next year."
"Whatever measures are agreed by the Council, agriculture can come to terms with them provided we have sufficient time."
"That was why I suggested that the Commission and the Council fix the set-aside rate as early as possible and, if possible, by July, as stated in my report."
"I was given a price proposal with a 0.45 % increase."
"One of the problems as a rapporteur is that you try to find a little money for everyone but at the same time to stay within sound budget principles."
"If we want more power for this Parliament and more respect and responsibility, we have to be responsible in our approach to the budget."
"I hope that I have made some responsible proposals and I look forward to the Commissioner's reply."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, my report deals with the postponement of the advances for oilseeds and the reduction of the per hectare compensatory payments for arable crops."
"There are a few points I should like to make."
"The MacSharry agricultural reform was conceived as a U-turn in agricultural policy, involving a reduction in surpluses and an adjustment to bring us into line with the GATT agreement, with radical price cuts for cereals, oilseeds and protein crops."
"At the same time, livestock premiums were introduced for dams and male bovines, and the intervention prices were reduced sharply."
"It was on this basis that the per hectare compensatory payments came into existence."
"So it was no coincidence that - in France, for example, and in some other parts of the European Union - the highest earning regions also received the highest compensatory payments, though I should make it very clear that, on this occasion, this had nothing to do with a European Parliament resolution."
"This, however, was the carrot with which farmers and their organizations were persuaded to accept this agricultural reform."
"Commissioner Fischler has also, on several occasions, promised to continue compensatory payments until 1999."
"In your current proposal, you have envisaged linear cuts, justified first on the basis of the BSE crisis and then by the good cereal harvest."
"Those arguments have now collapsed, as the 1997 agriculture budget is sufficient to meet the financial obligations in full and on schedule."
"A linear reduction in aid is unimaginative and, in most cases, unfair - that much is apparent."
"It makes no allowance for the natural conditions existing locally or the farmers' potential yields, and it also completely disregards the unfavourable trend of incomes affecting certain sizes of farm."
"A young farmer who has invested in a mixed operation, combining stock and arable farming, has his back to the wall as things stand at present."
"The only way forward available to young farmers is tenancy, and the tenancy agreements are generally based on this firm promise that the per hectare payments will be available until 1999."
"Commissioner, I am sure that you have excellent specialist staff at the Commission."
"If they had looked more closely at the different kinds of problems facing farmers in the various regions of Europe, I feel sure that this undifferentiated approach would never have occurred to them."
"It is completely unbalanced and will inevitably result in a serious loss of trust among farmers."
"I unhesitatingly reject the Commission's proposed radical reform of the financing of the cereal market."
"I myself come from a German Land where farms - with an average of 20 cattle - are much smaller than in many other regions of the European Union."
"In general, they cover between 20 and 50 hectares."
"This is another point I wish to bring to the attention of the President-in-Office."
"I have today obtained figures from my Land government."
"It seems that 49, 143 of our farms receive compensatory payments averaging DM 8, 595 per year."
"No Commission official would work for a single month for that kind of money."
"Commissioner, these farming families have a hard struggle."
"It will be a slap in the face for them if you were to regard them as 'over-compensated' ."
"Any reduction in compensation would be particularly damaging to the mixed farms."
"Cutting back the per hectare payments for arable crops does not do anything at all for the forage growers, who are particularly hard hit."
"This is the critical weakness in the Commission's proposal."
"If there really is overcompensation, then it must be judged objectively by reference to the prices the farmer can command in his market and in his local currency."
"Countries that have benefitted from continuous devaluations can command very high prices for products covered by market organization."
"So we do need a revised proposal on the form to be taken by the compensatory payments."
"The Committee on Budgets also supports our proposal that the payments for oilseeds for 1997 should not be postponed because the budgetary resources are available."
"Our proposals fall within the agriculture guideline."
"Mr President, I hope you will let me finish."
"We were ordered to speak here this evening - normally I would have been called at 3 p.m. today."
"The previous speaker was allowed eight minutes."
"I am a rapporteur too."
"I believe I am entitled to another three sentences."
"Please be kind enough to let me finish, because it is necessary."
"The President-in-Office has come here to listen to what I have to say - or at least, I hope he has!"
"To prevent any wrong turnings, it is absolutely essential that proposals for the period after 1999 should be submitted very soon, because the credibility of political decisions and confidence in a united Europe are at stake."
"I ask the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to withdraw its proposal to postpone the advance payments for oilseeds and to guarantee payment in full of the per hectare compensation for the years 1998 and 1999, as envisaged in the agricultural reform."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I think this evening may result in a further contribution to ensuring that Parliament discusses the merits of certain important proposals from the Commission, but I also the debate will give you encouragement, Mr Commissioner, to pursue the policy of reforming the CAP."
"I have been following your work carefully, including at the recent conference, but I think we need to do more."
"In a word, we should not wait for the market to be opened up to the new countries - Poland, Hungary - we should start accelerating reform immediately."
"If these debates can help the process along, that will certainly be positive."
"To some extent that is also the reason why, as rapporteur, I have dealt with the Commission's proposal in a waya which not only takes account of the legal side, but also looks at an overall restructuring of the system of organizing agriculture at Community level."
"Agriculture and related activities, especially Mediterranean ones, are now increasingly suffering a kind of ostracism."
"This related production is very important because it provides the opportunity to maintain income in difficult and marginal locations, especially in areas where economic and social cohesion is very important: Objective I areas."
"Durum wheat is one of these forms of production, olive oil is another, tobacco is yet another."
"Specifically looking at durum wheat, I think the proposals should be rationalized to provide for a maximum area for durum wheat set by the individual countries and then distributed at territorial level."
"I believe that is an intelligent and serious proposal, which also seeks to counter a series of frauds possibly present in the management of durum wheat farming, but above all it is capable of providing marketing strategies for this product, because some producers very often grow it just for the premium."
"So this method is important because it anchors the production to the territory."
"I also think the proposals approved by the Committee on Agriculture are important."
"I should add, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, that those proposals were approved unanimously and have two basic aims: one relates primarily to the possibility of widening the 5 per cent limit, so it is substantially about lifting the national, and therefore the regional, quota ceiling for young farmers."
"Quotas are a rigid instrument."
"We believe young farmers should have an opportunity to enter the market and, above all, achieve a turnover which no longer exists in the agricultural sector."
"So making 5 per cent of the quotas available to young farmers is very important."
"We consider it a choice the Commission and the Council must accept after the united support of Parliament and its Committee on Agriculture."
"The other proposal relates to certified seed."
"We agree with what is happening, but we are also convinced that biodiversity must be maintained as a fundamental factor."
"Maintaining biodiversity and also some of the special characteristics of seed, especially durum wheat seed, is very important for small farmers."
"We have added Germany and Austria to the list of traditional producers because we think there is a market need, and at the same time we have updated the quotas of durum wheat allocated to the traditional producer countries."
"I think it is a pretty well-balanced proposal, which takes account of the united opinion of the committee, and will make a good basis for you, Mr Commissioner, for a discussion in the Council."
"That is all I have to say, and I just hope this will be accepted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the oral question to the Commission on my initiative and supported by the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development, is fully justified because it is vital that the Commission take a decision on set aside in the framework of the 1997-1998 price package."
"The set aside rate, when it differs from that provided for by the basic regulation, should be made known within a sufficiently short time so that European Union producers can proceed to their land planning and seeding in full knowledge of the facts."
"Given the sowing periods, in certain Community regions, the Commission should make a proposal as quickly as possible."
"Since the CAP reforms of 1 July 1993, the cereals market has recovered its balance as a result of the production cut and, above all, the recovery of the internal market, especially for animal food."
"This situation has led to a major reduction in European Union cereal stocks."
"Two of the reform's main aims have therefore been achieved."
"However, these results need to be kept up by ensuring the maintenance if not an increase in intraCommunity consumption."
"Later on, we noted the emergence of Asian demand which seems to be lasting."
"The European Union must ensure that it regularly meets demand from its traditional non-Community customers."
"During the 1995-96 farming year, we noted that the inadequacy of our cereal production hindered the fulfilment of some of our commitments, especially to the Middle East and North Africa."
"The Commission even had to impose export taxes on cereals in December 1995 to protect internal supplies."
"We also saw that the record harvest in 1996-97, some 202 million tonnes, was easily absorbed by the internal market and exports."
"Before the 1996-97 harvest, Community stocks were assessed at 24 million tonnes; now they have risen to barely 28 million tonnes, not enough when you consider that 30-35 million tonnes would be needed to guarantee Europe's food safety over two months."
"Today, the drop in world cereal stocks is threatening the planet's food safety."
"These stocks are currently assessed at 55 consumption days."
"In 1996, they had dropped to barely 51 days."
"Experts reckon that, below 70 consumption days, world food safety comes under threat."
"To conclude, I should ask the Commission to fix the set-aside rates by 30 June 1997 and take into consideration unexpected weather conditions, increasing market demand and relatively low stocks."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad to see that the President-in-Office of the Council, Jozias van Aartsen, has been able to join us for this important debate, and I hope this will become regular practice in agricultural matters under the various Council presidencies."
"Since I am expected to comment on three reports, one oral question and quite a number of amendments, I hope you will appreciate that it is bound to take up a little time."
"I should like to start by giving details of a few circumstances that are important as an aid to understanding the Commission's price package for the 1997-98 budgetary period."
"A number of market organizations need to be reformed in order to prepare the European Union for the challenges of the next ten years."
"Specific Commission proposals already exist for some areas of production, and others will follow in the course of the year."
"The reports on the olive oil sector and the tobacco report are currently the subject of detailed discussions by both the European Parliament and the Council."
"To enable the additional work of reform to begin, the Commission has produced a number of analyses providing information on the present position, the structure and, especially, the long-term prospects of the markets for cereals, milk and meat."
"Similar documents for agricultural development are also in preparation."
"We should establish clearly that, as regards the price proposals for the coming year, we are going through a kind of transitional period."
"The price proposals are therefore essentially based on prolonging the period of validity of the existing rules."
"Where we think it necessary, however, some regulations will be adapted to reflect changes in the economic environment."
"The downward trend in interest rates is resulting in an adjustment of the monthly surcharges on the intervention price for cereals and rice and on the storage cost compensation for sugar."
"As the Council cut the flax subsidy by 7.5 % last year, without at the same time adjusting the subsidy for hemp, which can replace flax in the rotation of crops, we are proposing that the hemp subsidy should be reduced in the same way this year."
"The subsidies for fish farms, introduced in 1992 to compensate for falling prices, should also be brought more closely into line with the actual price trend."
"According to a study by the British Department of Agriculture, the last four years since the introduction of the reform have seen over-compensation totalling ECU 14.3 billion."
"Not in the United Kingdom, sir, but in the European Union!"
"I had serious doubts about the conclusions of this study and the methods used."
"I therefore instructed my staff to examine this matter very carefully."
"The result is this: according to the Commission's services, the extent of the over-compensation is about ECU 8 billion over the last four years."
"I should prefer not to pursue this argument further at this stage, but I would point out that the Commission's proposed ECU 1.4 billion annual reduction in the compensation payments seems quite modest in comparison with past over-compensation."
"I now come to Mr Sturdy's report."
"The actual price proposals encompass 16 Regulations, 9 of which were accepted as proposed by the Committee on Agriculture."
"I should like to thank the Members of the Committee on Agriculture, and especially Mr Sturdy as the rapporteur, for their constructive assistance in drawing up the report on the price package."
"Let me now take a closer look at the amendments to the other seven proposals for regulations."
"First, in some of these amendments you are asking that the monthly subsidies should be retained at their present level."
"But the agricultural sector, like other sectors, is a beneficiary of falling interest rates, something we cannot ignore in our price resolutions."
"Therefore, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 7, 11, 15 and 17."
"On the other hand, Amendment No 47 calls for the abolition of all monthly subsidies for the cereals sector."
"From our viewpoint, however, this would be a major change which would not be consistent with the idea of continuity of the price proposal."
"Secondly, Amendments Nos 6, 8 and 9 refer to the rice sector and are intended to expedite the reform agreed upon last year."
"The major problem in this sector at present is the large quantity of tax-exempt imports from the overseas territories of the EU."
"However, this problem can only be solved in the context of Council discussions."
"The consequence of any such change would be to reduce protection and budgetary costs by raising the subsidy."
"As far as Amendment No 5 is concerned, it makes little sense in this situation to support imports by setting the import quotas in advance."
"Thirdly, Amendments Nos 12, 13, 14 and 15, relating to the sugar sector, are intended to reintroduce government subsidies in Spain and Portugal."
"This question was examined in detail in 1995, when the market organization for sugar was extended by six years."
"The Commission is therefore against re-opening this matter again at present."
"Fourthly, Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 20 regarding flax and hemp."
"We reject these amendments for the reasons already mentioned."
"Fifthly, Amendments Nos 25 and 26 on the tobacco sector. Although it is true that the issue here is to match production to market demand, this problem can only be solved by a revision of the existing regulation."
"Sixthly, Amendment No 2 on protein crops envisages improving the competitiveness of protein crops as compared with other agricultural crop plants."
"The Commission is sympathetic to the aim of this proposal, but has already proposed an improvement in connection with the resetting of the agricultural premiums."
"If I may remind you, the compensatory payments for protein crops are being retained, whereas those for cereals and oilseeds are to be reduced."
"Seventhly, Amendment No 30 on olive oil. The radical changes proposed should, in our view, be discussed in the context of the reform proposals."
"Eighthly, Amendments Nos 27 to 29 on the beef and veal sector: the premium regulation for bulls provides only for a payment at the age of 10 months."
"At that age, however, no distinction can be made between bulls intended for the bullring and other bulls."
"The second premium for bulls at the age of 22 months has been done away with in the meantime, as you know."
"Ninthly, Amendments Nos 1 and 4 on the extension of the exceptional regulation on moisture content - Mr Sturdy has already mentioned this. This decision is within the competence of the Commission, so that the amendment is superfluous."
"I do recognize, however, that this kind of exceptional arrangement has always been granted in the past and would be compatible with the overall concept of this price package."
"Tenthly, Amendment No 10: although I cannot accept the wording of this amendment, I think that the idea of including rice seed in the new common organization of the market is worth consideration, provided that all necessary precautions are taken to prevent serious disruptions of the seed market."
"Eleventhly, Amendments Nos 21 to 24 relate to the wine sector and their purpose is to postpone by one year the resolution adopted as part of last year's price package excluding dessert grapes from distillation."
"These amendments are not acceptable to me."
"A resolution exists, and it must now be implemented."
"I do however accept that this change may cause local market problems when it is first implemented, so I shall pursue these reflections further;"
"I believe a reasonable temporary solution might be found within the framework of the common organization of the market for fruit and vegetables. Twelfthly, Amendments Nos 48 to 50 relate to increasing the total surface area for new plantations for the budgetary years 1997-98 and 1998-99."
"The new plantations for the first of these years are already laid down in Regulation 15/92, so that any further increase would be unjustified."
"Amendments Nos 49 to 51 call for the abolition of obligatory distillation, but in my view it would be more sensible to clear up this question in the course of the reform of the wine sector."
"Now let me come to Mr Funk's report, and my thanks go to him also."
"This report deals with the problem of the advance payments for oilseeds and the proposal to reduce compensatory payments for arable crops."
"With regard to the proposed postponement of the oilseed payments, the latest information on the implementation of the 1997 budget makes it clear that adequate savings would probably be achieved."
"Those savings will be sufficiently high to create the possibility of affording the next advance payments for oilseeds out of the 1997 budgetary funds on the basis of the existing regulations."
"This, however, does not solve the problem for 1998 and 1999."
"On the assumption that the Commission's draft budget for 1998, rather than that of DG VI, is correct, we need to achieve savings of ECU 1.353 billion from the reduction in compensation for arable crops; otherwise we would have to carry forward the 1998 advance payments for oilseeds to the 1999 budget."
"The only effect of this, however, would be to postpone the problem until the 1999 budget."
"Another possibility, which in fact has already been mentioned here today, would be to reduce all the 1998 budget estimates to the same extent, but that would create problems of its own, especially with those estimates where resources are in very short supply, while the over-compensation in the cereals sector would remain."
"This shows clearly that the effect of postponing the advance payments would merely be to achieve apparent savings, since the savings achieved in one budgetary year would result in expenditure in another budgetary year."
"By reducing the compensatory payments for arable crops, however, we achieve genuine savings in all future budgets."
"I should like to emphasize that the EAGGF budget, by its very nature, must be subject to fluctuations."
"For example, who at this early stage could predict the size of the autumn 1998 harvest?"
"The implementation of the budget, as a matter of compliance with the principle of budgetary discipline for which the European Parliament, among others, has so often called, requires that the Commission should avoid unnecessary expenditures where possible."
"The European Court of Auditors also regularly emphasizes this aspect."
"If there is over-compensation in one particular sector, something that the calculations mentioned initially indicate has occurred in the arable crop sector, the Commission must take the necessary action."
"On that basis, the Commission simply cannot avoid maintaining its proposal that the compensatory payments for arable crops should be reduced."
"Regarding those amendments which relate to modulating the compensatory payments for the various producers by reducing the set-aside premium, but without any change in the cereals premium, I would say that this idea is already reflected in the Commission's proposal."
"A detailed analysis of the breakdown of the compensatory payments in the arable crop sector will be one of the key points of the future sectoral study."
"The development of set-aside has had an important influence on cereal production in the Community in recent years."
"Setting the level of compensatory payments for set-aside at the same level as compensatory payments for cereals would bring about an indirect modulation."
"I should also like to say a word or two about Mr Baldarelli's report."
"First, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Agriculture for their positive attitude to the Commission's proposal for changing the special arrangements applicable to durum wheat."
"The proposal corresponds to the efforts to simplify the market organization, which is also supported by the Council."
"It is very clear, however, that this simplification must not result in an increase in budgetary expenditure."
"In this context, I would also remind the House that, among arable crops, the durum wheat sector is the best equipped with budgetary resources."
"In this case, I must endorse what Mr van Aartsen said when he drew attention to the financial consequences of trying to please everybody in this area."
"Regarding Amendments Nos 2, 7 and 10 on increasing the maximum guaranteed areas, especially for young farmers, the Commission does share the feelings of the Committee on Agriculture, but the change in the arrangements governing the entitlements of individual farms to maximum guaranteed areas already meets these concerns."
"The introduction of a special arrangement for young farmers would not only further complicate the administration of the regulation but would also conflict with the principle that the maximum guaranteed areas are available to all farmers in general."
"The amendments whereby the obligation to use certified seed would be phased in gradually are entirely in line with the Commission's views as far as their content is concerned."
"However, the Commission regards this as an administrative matter, to be settled within its own jurisdiction."
"In conclusion, I should like to say something about the oral question regarding the set-aside rate for the 1998 harvest."
"As far as this question is concerned, I am of course well aware that farmers want to have a clear picture before sowing - before the autumn, in other words - of the proportion of their land they are going to have to set aside for the 1998 harvest."
"I admit that this year has been a particularly good one for exports, resulting in the introduction of export levies for wheat and wheat products at the end of the budgetary year."
"The intervention stocks at the end of the budgetary year are likely to be no more than about 2 million tonnes, consisting mainly of rye and barley."
"However, this is no reason to jump to conclusions, because there is no undertaking and no legal obligation to make a proposal or reach a decision before 30 June 1997."
"I would however remind the House that, in the absence of any Commission proposal or if the Council adopts no resolution on such a proposal, the all-in rate of 17.5 % would apply."
"I will, therefore, naturally make a proposal. However, there are two questions which I regret I cannot answer at present: the question of what rate we are actually going to propose, and the question of timing."
"The reasons is that I should prefer to act in full knowledge of the facts."
"As soon as we have a reasonably clear picture here, I will submit a proposal as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I should like to request a clarification."
"I think the Commissioner was mistaken when he spoke about the proposals for sugar and said that he did not accept amendments No 12 to 15 since they would constitute a reintroduction of national aid."
"That is mistaken, because for Portugal it is not a case of reintroduction - it is being introduced for the first time and we are only going to apply the quota now."
"Mr President, this year's agricultural price setting is like a Chinese box. There is a packet inside a package."
"The packet is minuscule. It is the most absolute status quo ever seen in this Chamber in terms prices and related measures, and is examined in the report by Mr Sturdy."
"But the package weighs a ton, it is about cutting aid for arable land by ECU 1.4 billion for 1998, and is examined in the Funk report."
"I shall begin with the packet."
"Mr Sturdy has done solid, realistic, rigorous work, eschewing all demagoguery."
"I have to say that we Socialists are going to go a bit further: we shall vote against any increases in expenditure, even those approved in the Committee on Agriculture."
"The various outstanding problems in the agricultural sections are going to be dealt with by the reform under discussion, not in the price setting forum."
"Here we are in agreement with you, Commissioner Fischler."
"But let me make one exception - wine: because the proposal for reform you say is on the table, is no longer on the table in reality."
"Since 1994 it has been shamefully left in the box, and Parliament can no longer close its eyes to that fact."
"We now want to ask for the abolition, with no increase in costs, of obligatory distillation, as a sign that certain inadequate instruments which have been overtaken by circumstances will be cut by half once and for all, giving producers and the market an opportunity."
"I now move on to the package."
"Mr Funk has lost an opportunity by opposing every cut to arable land proposed by the Commission absolutely head on, pretending not to see the real problems and relying on his accountancy skills."
"Payment in advance or in arrears for oil seeds is part of a vanishing act which lasts a morning. But then, at the heart of the budgeting, he gets there despite himself."
"Mr Funk, I think it is a little convenient to put your trust in the chronic generosity of the Commission's agricultural spending forecasts, which looks like turning up again in 1997 as well and in the end all the adjustments will be made painlessly in 1998."
"As a Parliament, are we or are we not a budgetary authority?"
"Are we or are we not demanding a voice in the chapter on obligatory spending too?"
"That is why, with a report this armour-plated and ultra-conservative, Mr Funk has lost an opportunity to make the European Parliament's voice heard more strongly on the objective problems which exist in our agricultural budget."
"I envy the Minister-in-office of the Council, he already knows how the vote will go on Thursday."
"My only regret is that if he had listened to the debate and not just the opinion of the rapporteur, he would have understood that not everyone shares the opinion of the rapporteurs on these delicate reports, especially not the opinion of Mr Funk."
"Our group wants to support the farmers, but the best way to do this is not by burying one's head in the sand."
"We know that the imbalances in the CAP are generating serious problems, including financial ones."
"The cohesion report informs us about the redistributive problems of the CAP."
"Nothing new was added in the estimates of overcompensation provided yesterday by the Commission."
"The need for new rural development policies is there, staring us in the face, and the Commissioner's announcements are no longer satisfactory."
"And we are not convinced that the fate of the farmers and their future should only be decided by the Fifteen at the ECOFIN Council."
"Parliament needs to give a signal and the Socialist Group has put forward some proposals: for example, starting to bring certain distortions in aid into the discussion, reducing compensation for voluntary set-aside, which carries an increasing risk of undermining the overall operation on obligatory set-aside, and no further postponement of the issue of reshaping aid, starting immediately by at least bringing the amount of the set-aside premium in line with income support."
"I do not agree with the 7 per cent cut in income support, not because cuts are involved, but because they are linear cuts, piling injustice on injustice."
"The Socialist Group's amendments should save about ECU 500-600 million on the 1998 budget."
"That is not everything, but it gives a first signal, takes a first step towards responsibility."
"We shall see if the other groups follow us, but we shall put difficulties in the way of accepting the rigorous Sturdy report or the lax Funk report."
"The right thing to do is come down hard on the little packet and send the package back to the sender."
"As for the sender, Commissioner Fischler, I do not understand why you told the agriculture ministers there were no further budgetary reasons to cut arable land."
"In my view that was not very wise."
"We have here in front of us the preliminary draft of the 1998 budget adopted by your Commission."
"The cut is there, if I am not mistaken, and it is there to ensure a balanced budget for 1998. And after listening to the Minister-in-Office of the Council, I feel moved to say this: Commissioner Fischler, if this is all a smokescreen, be good enough to say so honestly."
"If, on the other hand, you want to do battle on serious issues, you know that, even where there are justified differences, the Socialist Group is ready to discuss those issues seriously."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Sturdy for his report which is full of good sense and highly responsible in the view of this Parliament."
"I should also like to thank Mr Baldarelli for the hard work he put in on durum wheat and, particularly for the understanding he showed for the specific problem affecting Portugal - rather a delicate one which he and the Committee on Agriculture have understood."
"I hope also that the Commission and the Council will come to understand it."
"In the first place I should like to go into greater detail as regards the Funk report."
"We must agree, for the sake of intellectual honesty, that there is in fact a delicate matter facing us and that the Commission is right in saying that the cereals sector is receiving too much compensation."
"To deny that would be tantamount to calling day night!"
"And above all we would have to agree that as regards the set-aside payments that there is no reason why they should not be equal to aid."
"But other factors which are also important must equally be taken into account."
"First because this cut in aid would be justified at this time and at this stage only if there were no margin for manoeuvre within the CAP budget; and that is not the case."
"The budgetary trends do not indicate that."
"On the other hand, we know that as from 1992 the CAP has been approximately 5 % below the guideline and that money has been returned to the Member States."
"I should now prefer to see that money remaining with the farmers, albeit badly distributed, rather than see it returned to the Member States for purposes other than farming."
"In the second place we must say that the problems of Europe's farmers will not be solved by this simple cut now which is detached from rather than linked to aid for arable crops."
"The CAP is highly unbalanced and it is essential for the Commission, the Council and all of us to face up to that."
"We are working on the assumption that the GATT will have the same impact on all European agriculture - and that is not true!"
"There are less-favoured regions which will suffer greatly!"
"Nevertheless, the next reform of the CAP will have to consider very carefully in its aid system the question of equity in incomes support."
"I agree with the Commissioner."
"It must be a system of aid which is not linked to production, quantities or productivity."
"That is the only way we can respond to the real problems of Europe's diverse agriculture, which is heterogenous and not homogenous."
"Mr President, Mr Minister, Mr Commissioner, as we have already seen, the price package adopted by the Commission for the 1997/98 financial year makes no great innovations to the situation as it stood, and in that connection I would like to express appreciation for the effort made in the Sturdy report to try to revitalize a platform that has become so rigid and flat, with such crystallized positions."
"And crystallized they remain, especially after the Commissioner's announcement. As usual he has been pretty heavy-handed in cutting our amendments."
"In fact, apart from certain exceptions, the proposals again take up the provisions on prices and the organization of markets in line with the stability policy applied the day after the 1992 reform."
"As a partial excuse for this dearth of proposals, there is also the ongoing revision of the common organization of some important markets, such as tobacco, olive oil, meat, and soon - we hope - milk."
"Alongside this immutable base there are some minor adjustments which it is fair to record."
"First, the reduction in the monthly increments in intervention prices for cereals and rice and storage refunds for sugar to take account of the fall in interest rates."
"Secondly, the level of aid planned for flax promotion, which should have been set at zero given that funds exist representing larger sums than the promotional actions warrant; hence the total aid per hectare is reduced by the same amount."
"Thirdly, aid per hectare for hemp is reduced by 7.5 per cent to prevent hemp becoming more advantageous than flax after the reduction in aid for that product."
"The impact of the budget on all these proposals translates into a saving of ECU 82 million for 1998, according to the Commission's estimates."
"It should also be recalled that this same Commission has already proposed reducing aid for arable crops, which should free up an amount of ECU 1.4 million, as others have mentioned."
"This will naturally be used to relaunch beef."
"The economic forecast for the 1997 financial year borrowing requirement, as established in February, amounts to ECU 41, 050 million, which exceeds the budget credits by ECU 245 million and leaves a margin of ECU 755 million as compared with the guidelines."
"This is a decrease - announced in the budget - which is very important to the credit needs of the sheep and goat meat sector, essentially due to market prices being higher than the budget forecast."
"There is also an important reduction in the milk and milk products sector, particularly in the supplementary withdrawal rate which remains to be declared for 1995/1996, and is estimated for the period 1996-1997."
"The reduction in the requirements for arable crops is principally due to oilseeds."
"A reduction in requirements is also planned for other sectors, particularly sugar, dry forage, fruit and vegetables, tobacco, eggs and poultry, and also food aid."
"As we have seen, this debate is a concoction of the traditional report on the agricultural price package and two other reports, one by Mr Funk and the other by Mr Baldarelli, which can be said to complete it, revitalize it and project it into the future."
"I think the Funk report should be supported, especially on the stabilization of beef, the proposal not to postpone payments for oilseeds but to pay, as from 16 October, only that part of the advance for which there is no possibility of coverage in the 1997 budget."
"The Baldarelli report is right to stress the proposal to increase the national areas earmarked for durum wheat cultivation to help young farmers and readjust out of date valuations."
"On areas, I have an appeal to make on behalf of Mr Rosado Fernandes who is sorry not to be here today - he is in Portugal receiving a decoration from the President of the Republic - but he has left me this message: ' Today Portugal has a guaranteed area of 35 thousand hectares, the reality is 90 thousand and the potential, as a historical average, is over 100 thousand.'"
"Mr President, the Sturdy, Funk and Baldarelli reports all share one feature - they are all limited by the same financial restraints."
"It is worth noting that in recent years farming expenditure has fallen below the limits set by the budgetary guidelines."
"If the aim is to achieve a financial margin for other political aims, then things should be made clear."
"In the case of the Funk report, the situation is fairly complicated since, behind the problem, lies a very delicate circumstance, which has been the subject of a committee of inquiry and on whose funding recommendations have been issued."
"I think that Mr Funk's report has a long history and has the virtue of having concentrated from the beginning on a balanced way of dealing with an extremely difficult problem."
"My Group therefore supports the Funk report."
"As for the report on the prices package, I must say that in its original form, as presented to committee, my Group had many reservations."
"I think that the final result has not been improved all that much by the committee's debate."
"I hope that the final outcome of the votes will enable my Group to consider that it has substantially improved certain aspects of the prices package: but I have considerable reservations right now."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate Mr Baldarelli on his report which gains my Group's full support."
"Commissioner, I believe that budgetary problems are not the main issue as far as you are concerned."
"That was the case six months ago."
"But the arguments have changed."
"Even if budgetary problems were your main concern, though, there are other ways of achieving savings."
"I have already pointed out to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that a linear reduction is somewhat unimaginative."
"It is also ecologically unsound."
"And socially unsound."
"You keep telling the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that you want the premiums to be both ecologically and socially beneficial."
"So why not start with this proposal, if it's cuts and savings you want?"
"Incidentally, you displayed a very curious turn of logic today in saying that because we've cut back on flax we must also cut back on hemp, otherwise hemp will have an advantage and the oilseeds have an advantage because we cut back on cereals."
"The fact of the matter is that you always regard price cuts as the automatic line to follow."
"Mr Funk, I must inform you that we, as a group, naturally support your report."
"But you don't make it easy for us."
"After all, we tabled an amendment - it's still on the table, and I can hardly wait to see how your group will view it and vote on it - to try to shoot down this idea, but with the proviso that we arrive at a reform of the compensatory payments in a way that takes account of social and ecological criteria, with a gradual reduction, a staggered reduction, and more of a shift towards ecological methods of farming."
"You always flatly refused this in the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Similar amendments were tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"So you are making it difficult for us."
"You as a group - not you personally, but you have to answer for the others - are just as contrary as the Commission: they say 'Cut it!' and you say 'No!' but there must be possibilities somewhere in between, at least for the future."
"The same applies to set-aside."
"There is one amendment, Commissioner, which you failed to discuss: the amendment that the set-aside areas that are under clover should be permitted to be used next year."
"As you know, the European Parliament adopted that amendment by a majority last year, and although that doesn't necessarily mean that the Commission must act on it, I should be most grateful if you would take a look at this problem."
"Here again, I can hardly wait to see how your group will vote on our present application."
"Who knows, we in my group may even make our voting decision conditional on yours."
"If the socialists vote differently, you need us to secure a majority on this point."
"That might be one way of coming to an arrangement."
"Overall, though, Commissioner, I believe we are on the eve of reform - as you made clear - and the estimates would then have to be clear."
"I believe we must make it clear that we want to move away from a world market orientation towards a single market orientation."
"We must make it clear that we are not going to grant compensatory payments for all farmland."
"We must make it clear that we want no more export subsidies, and we must make it clear that what were formerly flanking measures are becoming the focal point of agricultural development, where of course we need money."
"I understand all that, but of course we can't completely axe something somewhere else just so that we can finance it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a strange feeling that in this debate we are swimming in a sea of incoherence."
"Budgetary and economic considerations, the so-called operational needs of free trade, the so-called and inevitable globalization, all paralyse any deep thought on the definition of genuine political guidelines."
"Since 1992 we have spoken about the reform of the CAP, the integration of requirements to protect the environment, rural development policy, the maintenance of communities and employment in country areas, etc. But what is the use of these fine declarations of principle if they are followed up by no practical initiative to alter the machinery of the CAP?"
"Commissioner, you have repeated to us your attachment to a more harmonious CAP, designed to become the real vehicle of rural development."
"Yet, in reality, you only leave the choice between lowering prices or set-asides to guarantee the CAP's future."
"I am sorry but I think you lack a little imagination if you limit yourself to accounting solutions whereas the countries of central and eastern Europe are looking for tangible signs about the next CAP and the forthcoming negotiations on the COMs are looming."
"Increasing pressures are being exerted on the European Union to accelerate the liberalization of its farm markets."
"To deal with that, the CAP needs new founding principles."
"The prices package seems acceptable in the current context of strict budgetary rigour."
"We must all take part in those efforts and it is in that spirit that my Group agrees to accept the Commission's proposals."
"That said, the fact that this package contains no political guideline is unacceptable."
"It is intended to be neutral, but its accounting neutrality reveals a lack of political thought to the basics of the matter."
"Without spending more, it should have been possible to spend better, by redirecting Community aids at the political priorities that have so often been announced."
"It is again this accounting spirit that leads the Commission to finance BSE related measures out of the producers of certain arable crops."
"It is indeed urgent to strike a fresh balance between aids for different crops and it is true that the cereals sector has for a long time now been doing excessively well out of EAGGF."
"But I must oppose the techniques used as they mix up types and risk the setting of a precedent that might be used to deal with budgetary emergencies."
"Could not the same result be achieved by striking a better overall balance of general savings and in particular by resorting to unused credits?"
"As for the set-asides, determined accounting is again lord of the day."
"My Group has always opposed this system."
"Every year we decide the overall number of hectares to remain unproductive."
"That is what shocks me."
"We now only reason in terms of the global regulation of the market, the only priority being to produce less."
"What about producing better?"
"It is possible to regulate production by turning to quality products or supporting exports, as it is not only a matter of quality."
"Real fallow land is not unproductive."
"Fallow has a function of ecological restoration, whereas set-asides are just an unimaginative form of production management."
"It seems absurd to separate the question of prices from that of set-asides."
"How can producers plan their activities in such conditions?"
"To conclude, if we can go along with most of the Commission's proposals on prices and other measures, we must deplore the fact that they are not part of a determined approach to retarget aids so as to meet the aims of a lasting CAP, the only way to ensure the survival and profitability of small farms and maintain a social fabric in the countryside."
"Commissioner, if we do not want a productivity-based CAP, one day we will have to stop using its revenues."
"Mr President, I should like to take the opportunity, first of all, of congratulating both rapporteurs on the reports they presented here tonight."
"I agree with everything Mr Funk has said."
"He put forward his arguments very clearly and succinctly and we could all understand them."
"This is a roll-over budget and brings in very little change."
"In fact this price package has little or no effect as far as the farmer is concerned at all."
"The rapporteur told us that it is going to cost ECU 170m."
"After listening to the Commissioner tonight I wonder how much of their reports are actually left because he seemed to be casting aside all the proposals."
"What has been left?"
"We can speak all we like in this Parliament but at the end of the day it is what is happening down on the farm that really counts."
"I come from a region of Northern Ireland."
"The Commissioner knows this only too well for he is tired of listening to me about it."
"If you are a farmer there, especially a beef farmer or cereal farmer, you have very little hope or future left."
"Beef prices, because of the BSE crisis, are at an all-time low."
"That has nothing to do with Europe."
"The European Commission has been very good in the support it has given through intervention."
"But if you are a cereal farmer or a beef farmer involved in those areas, you have no chance at this moment in time of making a profit or surviving."
"You have to take this on board and bear it in mind."
"There is little hope at this stage, this year, of recovery."
"I can see little hope for the future as far as our farmers in that area are concerned."
"The farmers are now paying a terrible price for the BSE crisis."
"It is now hurting, it is biting deep and hurting them in their pockets, where it hurts the most."
"One of the other issues that is really affecting them at the moment is the strong pound against the ECU, against the green pound rates."
"That is certainly the responsibility of the UK Government."
"I hope my colleagues on the other side of the House will put pressure on the new Minister of Agriculture to make the request to get the support."
"Mr President, we have the excellent report by Mr Baldarelli on durum wheat; we have the equally excellent report by Mr Funk; we are mostly in agreement with them."
"As for Mr Sturdy, he poses a problem, because he is an Englishman, a nice Englishmen, which is not common, a warm, human Englishman."
"Unfortunately, Mr Sturdy's anti-farming positions are those of Anglo-Saxon bleeders of the land."
"Technically, of course, he is proposing, as always, the great mass, the sixteen regulations on wine, pork, flax, etc, with price freezes at the centre and a reduction in compensatory amounts for major crops, i.e. 7 % less for cereals, 4 % less for oil seeds, 26 % for set-asides, proposals all made to make cereal farmers bear the costs of mistakes made by British industrialists."
"Mr Sturdy has tried to make up for the reduction in monthly premiums, but always playing this game of tight-fisted rigour. Then he came up against a better accountant than he is, Mr MacSharry, who rejected the whole package."
"In reality, behind this technical arrangement, which is rather tight-fisted, hides the essence of the political choices and I would even say philosophical choices."
"First of all, we are being subjected to Maastricht austerity, rationing - we cannot go above the maximum limit of 41 million ECU - and prices."
"Mr Cunha explained to us last year that there were 5 % budgetary reserves."
"Then we are preparing for enlargement eastward, to central Europe, which is why we must make savings."
"We are sacrificing the agricultural budget, agricultural policy, to the structural funds."
"For regional policy, we refer to November's European Conference on Rural Development."
"We are also preparing for the Delors III or Santer I package, i..e in the persecutive of the 1999 multiannual budgetary programming we are cutting agricultural spending every year."
"But, above all, the prices package is preparing for the package-deal for the year 2000, in the trade negotiations with the United States and in the Geneva framework."
"Older members will remember that, in 1990-91, Mr MacSharry explained to us that stocks were too big, that that was expensive, that cereal farmers were getting rich and that the CAP would have to be overhauled."
"Now, we are being told that the stocks are going to be big, that that is expensive, that cereal farmers are getting richer all the time and Mr Sturdy now says that we shall have to reform the reform."
"That is tantamount to saying that all the measures taken from 1990 to 1992 only prepared the way for Blair House and that all current measures - Sturdy included, as it were - are for preparing the negotiations in the year 2000, when the six year peace will be over."
"We are beginning to give in to the United States even before they ask us."
"Mr Sturdy, who is very intelligent and very subtle, tries to mask this problem."
"He says: ' Yes, but for farmer security, we need a five-year multiannual programming' ."
"Mr Sturdy forgets that Joseph told the pharaoh that there were climatic variations and that setting prices for five years is really very, very curious."
"In reality, Mr Sturdy, and you know I like you a lot, we have a philosophical divergence over this."
"There is the Anglo-saxon model with its well-known success: 160 000 cattle slaughtered."
"This Anglo-Saxon model is a model of the invisible hand, but it is really the visible hand of capitalism."
"Then there is the model of the family farm, the balanced farm, the human enterprise, which is not that of Adam Smith."
"This is the divergence that separated Keynes from Adam Smith and Cambridge from Oxford."
"That is the opposition that separates us, Mr Sturdy."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"Mr President, first of all, in this debate I go along with what Mr Fantuzzi said, as his words were fully in line with the Socialist Group's way of thinking."
"Secondly, I should like to point out that there is some confusion in this debate, especially over the Funk report, initially because the proposals to cut aids to cereals were linked with the need for funds to solve the meat problem - the reasons behind these Commission proposals."
"However, at this moment, it seems that the Commissioner is presenting them separately, as if in the framework of a possible reform of the farming policy."
"I seem to have heard that, given that there is excessive compensation in the cereals sector, aids have to be reduced, completely regardless of the beef question."
"On this matter - accepting that this is the plan - I think that there should be more clarity as to whether this is a reform or whether we are dealing with the BSE crisis."
"I say that because if at this moment in time the Commissioner's ideas are separate from the beef problem, I think that we have to be far more realistic, as Mr Fantuzzi was saying."
"I do not think that we can deal with the reform of the compensatory amounts for cereals by saying 'coffee all round' , because that over-compensation to which you referred, has not occurred throughout the Community at an equal rate."
"It is possible that some regions have seen an over-compensation. But that is not the general case throughout the European Union."
"Therefore, I think that we should begin to introduce some elements of discrimination."
"On those lines, the proposals made by the Socialist Group head in that direction."
"We go along with the idea that certain rectifications are needed, but not in the same way for everyone, because that is the defect that we faced when the Council rejected the original proposals made by Commissioner MacSharry."
"We do agree that some rigour is called for, but the various positions need to be distinguished if this reform is to have a real meaning."
"Not only that: we should also enhance certain social aspects, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf recalled earlier, not forgetting the ecological aspects."
"It seems to me that it would be a good framework for beginning to discuss some of these ideas."
"To sum up, as Mr Fantuzzi said, I think that we should end our discussions and fine words and start taking practical action."
"We agree with your aims, Commissioner, but start work so that in the coming months we can have some elements that will enable us to know where we are heading with your ideas on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I address the House on these three reports as the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets for the 1998 budget."
"First, the Funk report."
"In view of the large sums in the 1997 budget that were left unused in the agricultural sector, the Committee on Budgets, in its opinion, agreed with the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Funk, on this, and Mr Funk very largely adopted the proposal contained in the Committee's opinion, but unfortunately not the parts relating to the amendment to the Regulation."
"With regard to the deferment of the oilseed payments to 1998-99, or their suspension in 1997, the Commission has expressly stated that it is not prepared to contemplate this, at least at present."
"I believe we shall have to discuss this further in the course of the ad hoc procedure."
"I am more inclined to favour the Commission's proposal."
"As regards Mr Sturdy's report, I would at least like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"He has, I think, taken the right line, even if Mr Martinez sees it differently; his proposal really is budgetary-neutral."
"With regard to the present motion for a resolution by the Committee on Agriculture, it should be noted that the Committee on Budgets gave its opinion on the Commission's proposal and not on the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture in the present report, envisaging an increase by ECU 170 million."
"From the procedural standpoint, therefore, it would be appropriate for Mr Sturdy's report in its present form to be referred back to committee, so that the Committee on Budgets can give an opinion on the basis of the new situation."
"The amendments proposing that this increase should be covered by savings elsewhere in the agriculture budget, as is proposed by the Committee on Agriculture, is a cosmetic solution, because it is not really budgetary-neutral and ultimately it still amounts to an increase."
"There are two points I should like to single out from what the Council presidency said."
"I hope that you will succeed in creating a flexible structure for the budget in the agricultural sector, and I wish you every success in your efforts to do so."
"But something else you said did reawaken my feelings of pessimism, and that was when you referred indirectly to horizontal cuts."
"Although such cuts would be effective, and would undoubtedly be the simplest solution, it would run counter to what Honourable Members have said: that we should look at the items and make cuts where over-compensation has already existed for many years."
"I believe, though, that we can and must conduct lengthy further negotiations on this."
"The simplest overall solution, both for us in this House and for the Council, would certainly have been to accept the Commission's proposal."
"That would have been the most logical course from the standpoint of budgetary policy."
"Commissioner, you too cannot escape totally unscathed here - I have some criticisms of you as well."
"It is somewhat comic, of course, that we should receive from your services, two weeks after the proposal for the draft budget, an oral correction saying that you have miscalculated by 329 million."
"That, of course, will be another matter to be discussed during the ad hoc procedure."
"That procedure will have begun by late autumn, and then it will be up to all of us to commit ourselves to the kind of budgetary stringency that we resolved upon in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Guidelines."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to say that this debate shows, as the President of the Commission has said, that the powers of the Parliament on agricultural matters need to be strengthened and that we need co-decision."
"As far as the agricultural prices are concerned, it is obvious that the budgetary discipline imposed on the Community expenditure must be upheld."
"Nevertheless, we should recognize that the freeze at 1997 levels that the Commission is seeking is really pitched at 1992 levels, if account is not taken of average Community inflation and when there are no compensatory mechanisms for making up part of the income."
"So the biggest income loss will be borne by the markets that have not been reformed since 1992 rather than by those, such as cereals market, that have been reformed."
"Strangely enough these reformed markets for which compensatory mechanisms exist encompass only products of the north."
"So one asks: should we perhaps not be attempting to freeze the prices for the main Mediterranean products?"
"I can think, for example, of about 15 different fruits and vegetables for which the markets have been reformed but for which no compensatory mechanisms have been provided."
"It is right that we should propose a small increase in the support prices for 1998 for these products, smaller, or at the most, equal to anticipated average Community inflation, because it is likewise not coincidental that agricultural in the south of the Community is coming to believe more and more that it is being persecuted."
"Allow me to add, lastly, that when the support prices and the related measures are adopted consideration should given to devising a special policy to serve the Community's interests with regard to the products which are greatly in deficit."
"Freezing the prices of products which are in surplus makes sense, but it does not make sense to impose a freeze on products which are in deficit and in respect of which the Union has to import more than 50 % of its needs."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I congratulate the authors of the report."
"If implemented, the Commission's price package would cut the per hectare aid and set-aside support for cereals and oilseed plants."
"The relative effects of these cuts, particularly on the viability of agricultural production, will be greater in the Union's remote areas than in the better production areas."
"For this reason, I cannot approve these cuts."
"A cut of almost a third in set-aside support would be contrary to the objective of reducing surpluses in the cereals sector."
"Market deveopment assessments show that over-production in the cereal sector will be a growing problem in future."
"The cutting of set-aside compensation is a measure which will be poorly received given the current situation on the cereals market."
"The CAP reform was implemented and it was relatively of most benefit to the farmers in the better production areas."
"When the Commission proposes making cuts in support to bring about savings, these cuts should be targeted taking account of the relative effect of the cuts on the viability of production."
"Within the European Union each country tries to produce as much as possible of its own food itself."
"Consumers appreciate food produced near home, because over-long transport lowers the quality of food."
"In the USA's industrial-scale agricultural production system, where specialization has been taken to extremes, food has to be transported thousands of kilometres to the customers' tables."
"I warn against this type of development, particularly in the context of the forthcoming free trade negotiations."
"Free trade does not necessarily suit us very well, because its risks are often greater than its benefits."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I have to be very frank. With its proposals for 1997-98 prices, the European Commission is not content with freezing price and aid levels, but is also preparing for new adaptations to the CAP with a view to the COM negotiations and enlargement of the European Union to the eastern European countries."
"Pursuit of an alignment of Community with world prices is aimed at adapting the CAP to the American model, with further drops in income, an acceleration in the concentration of farms, and the implementation of over-intensive production methods."
"This prices policy comes after the signature with non-Community countries of agreements doing harm to Community preference."
"Farming plays the role of an exchange currency in relations with non-Community countries, as on the internal market, and priority is given to the principle of free competition."
"Producers are made to compete which only profits major distribution companies and international business."
"This is the case at present in the fruit and vegetable sector."
"Apart from the acts of violence against goods and persons, which I wholeheartedly condemn, farmers' demonstrations are sounding the alarm signal on the deterioration of their situation."
"Other sectors - milk and beef - have not been spared."
"It is not enough, as the Committee on Agriculture proposes - and even if it is fair - to oppose the reduction in premiums for cereals."
"We must urgently commit ourselves to a process of renovating and improving the CAP."
"The change of government in France might contribute to that in the framework of the reorientation of European construction proposed by the joint declaration by the socialist and communist parties."
"That CAP reform should learn the lessons of the mad cow crisis, which revealed how harmful the policy is to the interests of producers and consumers alike."
"It is thanks to the joint action of producers, consumers and workers that we count on showing the French Government and the Community institutions that we could impose other guidelines that would respond to the food needs of the population and to the needs of producers themselves."
"Mr President, farmers need a stable and predictable working framework if we want to put a stop to the loss of jobs in the sector, where a further 230 000 jobs were shed in 1996."
"Our Group therefore regrets the fact that we still have no Commission proposal for set-asides for next year, even though farmers already have to prepare their land use plans."
"I should point out that last year we had to impose an export tax for the first time in the Community's history."
"This year, since 14 May, the Commission has again had to impose that tax in order to guarantee internal European Union supplies."
"It is therefore vital not to go beyond the current compulsory rate of 5 % and to abolish the extraordinary set-aside imposed after any excess."
"As for the agricultural budget, we know that the EAGGF-Guarantees budget will only be increased by 0.5 %."
"In relation to the compromise guidelines agreed on at Edinburgh, that is translated into a total loss from next year's agricultural budget of some 2.4 billion ECU."
"The real reason is the introduction of the single currency and its corollary, the respect of the Maastricht convergence criteria."
"We all know that but the farmers do not."
"Perhaps it is a good thing for a few of us here to speak out and say that."
"As for durum wheat, I should like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5, which we tabled and adopted in committee, for durum wheat areas to be set at an inter-regional level."
"The management of a production needed for supplying a specific agro-foodstuff sector must be flexible."
"I should also emphasize the vital nature of the obligation agreed on by the committee to use certified seeds for durum wheat."
"This is especially important for the seed sector and I had to stress it."
"We have tabled another amendment that was also adopted in committee, making things as flexible as possible for farmers."
"I hope that the Council will agree to our proposal on that point as well."
"Mr President, the EU agricultural policy has in many respects outlived its usefulness."
"We now have a farming industry that uses unheard-of amounts of poison in order to achieve maximum possible yields."
"The results are unfortunately major environmental problems and food of which consumers are becoming increasingly critical."
"We are now on the brink of an enlargement of the EU to include the Eastern and Central European countries, which also have a large agricultural sector."
"For many reasons - not least economic reasons - we have to face the fact that the price package proposals must be reformed before these countries become members."
"In addition, there are the demands from the World Trade Organization for us to fall into line with world market prices."
"We must therefore view this proposal from the Commission as a challenge that has both economic and environmental advantages."
"In the same way, it is an advantage that many Member States wish to apply strict budgetary discipline in the future."
"I think that the Commission proposal shows a realistic attitude to the problems of world market prices."
"It would be nice if we could now get right away from lines of production that do not belong in the EU."
"An example is tobacco production."
"I support the proposal of the Environment Committee to cut the premiums in that sector by 10 %; otherwise we have no consistency between agriculture, health and the environment."
"Let us hope that in the future time and money will not be spent on price proposals in the EU."
"Instead the support would be given a social focus by allocating money for landscape management and for environmentally friendly production."
"Organic farming also urgently needs help."
"All things considered, we must ensure sustainable agriculture with quality products in the EU."
"That is the only way we can be sure of winning back consumer confidence in the common agricultural policy, and that is necessary if it is to survive at all."
"Mr President, I shall say immediately that I am in agreement with the conclusions reached by the Committee on Agriculture, and I am therefore in favour of upholding the kind of solution we adopted there in this House."
"But having said that I must immediately add - and I am speaking mostly to Members, but also to the Council and the Commission - that in my opinion we would be mistaken if, at the end of the debate this evening and in the voting tomorrow and the next day, we were to abandon the very important discussion that has been opened here this evening."
"I refer to the dialogue difficulties existing between Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers, and to the speech by my friend and colleague Mr Fantuzzi, who seemed to be trying to open a dispute inside Parliament itself between reformers and conservatives on the issue of agriculture."
"In my view we made an error when we gave the price package a significance and a role it should not have."
"Here I agree with Mr Mulder when he brings us back to reality."
"I do not agree with Mr Sturdy's attempts to redistribute expenditure between sectors through the 'price' package, or with Mr Fantuzzi, who starts from a correct analytical assumption but then arrives at the wrong conclusion that, here, now, today, we can find the solution to a general approach to agriculture, although it must certainly come into being and we must try to make a contribution to it."
"I do not know if the Commission has an idea in mind about general reform of agriculture, but I feel sure it is pursuing a design of its own through the COM, the price package and so on, and we in the European Parliament need a strategy, which has not been clearly defined yet."
"I hope the lesson of sorts that we are learning in this debate will help Parliament find the right road in its relations with the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, from an agricultural perspective, farm prices are central to the viability of the industry."
"Farming is about producing food but also about managing the rural environment of which farmers are the main custodians."
"Unlike other professions, farmers do not have a guaranteed income and the industry has been bedevilled by fluctuations in both prices and production costs."
"While it is true that the CAP and accompanying measures have made a significant contribution to market stability and to managing production to market requirements, direct payments have been of immense benefit in ensuring the economic survival of many farming families, in particular those with small and medium-sized farms."
"Any review of farm prices or the CAP must take into account not only the economic viability of agriculture as a food producer but also the environmental and social significance of retaining the maximum number of farming families."
"In his report Mr Sturdy understandably highlights the need for budget management, in particular in the context of EMU."
"While acknowledging that the agricultural budget represents a significant proportion of the overall EU budget, it seems wrong that proposed restrictions are based more on what remains after we provide for the agreed 8 % annual increase in structural funds rather than the actual needs of European agriculture."
"It should also be noted that the roll-over in farm prices represents in fact a reduction in farm prices when inflation is taken into account, not to mention the problems associated with currency revaluation."
"Guarantee funds are a crucial element in the overall agricultural budget and the proposed restriction of 0.5 % increase will put considerable pressure on a sector already reeling from the impact of BSE."
"European agriculture faces many challenges in the context of CAP reform and the world trade talks."
"If the industry is to expand it can only do so in the context of competitiveness in the world market."
"Serious decisions will have to be taken on the farming structures of the future."
"Either we allow the pressures of the marketplace to push us in the direction of New Zealand-style ranches, with disastrous consequences for the human side of farming, or we introduce policies to build and develop Europe's farm family tradition."
"I understand the rapporteur's view on farm price support at this time, in particular as we enter negotiations on a new world trade agreement, CAP reform and further enlargement to the east."
"I repeat that the only way forward for European agriculture, and Irish agriculture which with other colleagues I represent in the broader European context, is through greater efficiency and competitiveness leading to an increased share of the world market."
"In the context of planning for the future we must ensure that goals are achieved within the economic framework of the traditional family farm."
"Mr President, first let me congratulate the rapporteurs on these reports."
"I think they have conveyed the seriousness of the situation and recognized that the reform of the agricultural policy must continue."
"I also think that the Commission proposal is correct as regards price stability."
"But I have a few objections to the Commission's arguments for the reduction of support per hectare for cereal crops."
"I cannot accept the argument that compensation has been excessive in this area."
"I merely refer to what Mr Funk said about the figures from part of Germany, which presumably apply to all countries with a strong currency."
"At all events they have not noticed any overcompensation on the cereal market there."
"That is one of my points."
"The other question is whether it is politically right to continue applying cuts in payments per hectare for cereals in the future."
"If we are to contribute to satisfying cereal demand on the world market, it does not help to pull the rug from under the cereal growers' feet, so that it is no longer profitable to grow cereals."
"So I do not think the Commission has got its sums right on this point."
"Otherwise I think the Commission's policy is correct in moving from price support to hectare support."
"If we are to have an agricultural policy in the future, it will be necessary to abolish price support completely and apply hectare support exclusively."
"That is the future for agriculture in Europe."
"Mr President, a deluge of words and a dearth of meaning - that is what one could say about the debating of this whole matter."
"Council proposals, Commission proposals, long-winded speeches by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, three reports and an oral question."
"I interpret them them not as they are, not in terms of their words, but in terms of their meaning."
"All of them, in their own way, reaffirm the antifarmer, anti-social, anti-economic and inhumane character of the Community's agricultural policy."
"This is evidenced by the freeze in prices and the price cuts, the freeze or reductions in aid and other support measures and the freezing of production volumes even for the deficit products, in total disregard of inflation and of the fact that production costs are rising sharply every month and every year."
"So one asks how this agricultural inflation in the Community is to be contained, in the south especially."
"No one seems to be addressing that."
"Let the budgetary god and the tight monetary policy take care of it."
"So instead of the budget providing farmers with a decent human standard of living, the farmers are being asked to suffer and make sacrifices for the budget."
"Mr President, the point is that the whole situation needs to be taken apart from top to bottom."
"If the Community does not do it, the farmers themselves and the workers will, and you can see the beginnings of that now."
"Do not let things come to that."
"You still have time to adjust this inhuman policy to some degree if want to."
"Mr President, according to the preliminary draft 1998 budget agricultural expenditure can only increase by up to 0.5 %."
"Furthermore the 1.3 billion extra ECU earmarked for the BSE crisis also have to be financed from this tight framework."
"But is this fair?"
"This means that the bills for the EMU criteria and the BSE crisis have been sent to farmers."
"I find it difficult to accept the controversial proposal to reduce income compensation for cereal growers."
"It is not fair to reduce overall subsidies by targeting cereals because, in certain Member States, growers have been overcompensated."
"We should not lose sight of the fact that is mainly due to a devaluation of the national currencies concerned."
"In countries with a strong currency some growers have even been slightly under-compensated."
"Like Mr Funk, the rapporteur, I think that as an alternative to reducing income subsidies the 1998 budget should be discharged using expenditure which was not used in 1997 for payments targeting oil-seed growers."
"If that is not enough, then we should abandon the 0.9 % maximum."
"I recall that promises were made during the 1992 reforms and I should point out that the agricultural directive allows for a supplementary increase of 2 billion ECU."
"As far as the Sturdy report is concerned, I agree with the freeze on agricultural prices."
"Given the inflation rate, that possibly means a decrease in real terms but market prices and farmers' incomes depend more on management of the European market than the rate of intervention prices."
"I also support the amendments opposing the proposed decrease in the cereals and sugars scales."
"Current allowances barely suffice to offset storage costs and interest."
"To conclude, thanks to the withdrawal of aid to flax fibre, considerable amounts have been saved to promote the sales of that product."
"But this cannot lead to a reduction in promotional activities."
"I should like the Commissioner to tell us whether he wants to use the millions of ECU which have been saved to promote sales."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one point that must be clearly established in this debate: the contributions made to it, today and previously, by members of the Group of the European People's Party on the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development are notable for what they fail to say and so, basically, for the way they twist what they do say."
"Because it was not the Commission that, at the start of these discussions, deleted massive savings running into billions; it was the European Finance Ministers and the Council, using any arguments they could find to inflict deep wounds on the operators of small- and medium-sized farms."
"That is a fact, and we need to acknowledge it."
"And, Mr Funk, you ownr Finance Minister also supported this policy."
"So you should have the courage and the resolution to write a letter to your own Finance Minister, even if he is a member of your own party, and tell him that his policy is basically unprincipled, posing an unacceptable burden on small farmers."
"This has got to change."
"Instead of that, you actually voted down any mention of this fact in the Committee on Agriculture and I think that shows that a policy is being put forward here that may well be acceptable in Germany, and perhaps in various other States too, but is basically a bad and un-European policy."
"Yet again, you are trying to cast the Commission as the villain of the piece, a convenient all-purpose scapegoat to conceal your country's responsibility."
"I think that the underlying cause of this whole attitude is partly attributable to the fact that some - and I emphasize, some - sections of the PPE are fundamentally opposed to a radical, sensible reform of the agricultural policy, a reform that is not only overdue but has actually been planned for the near future. Their stubborn attitude is intended to create the impression, not only here but at home - in domestic politics, in other words - with a big lobby, that everything is going to stay the way it was."
"This policy is basically directed against owners of small- and medium-sized farms, and the social democrats cannot support it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the issue today is not to do with documents, nor is it to do with disagreements about the structure that is to take us into the next millennium - the issue is the very important one of farm prices and compensation rules, though these things are not as controversial as they were in the past."
"But this third subject of the 'special arrangement for durum wheat' is an important one for farmers in certain regions."
"Sufficiently important, I think, to receive timely treatment."
"Many thanks to the rapporteurs."
"A little colour has now been brought into our debate."
"I can only speak today about the durum wheat arrangement, and in this case the new proposal simplifies the changeover from individual premium entitlements to guaranteed maximum premium areas for each Member State."
"This change is also welcome."
"There was broad agreement on this among the Committee on Agriculture, as there also was on the particular proposals made by the rapporteur, Mr Baldarelli."
"He has taken a great deal of trouble."
"The 5 % reserve for young farmers and the increases in which it results receive our approval."
"We do appreciate, however, that some countries - Austria and Germany, for example - do have justifiable claims for so-called non-traditional farming areas to be taken into consideration."
"The cultivation of durum wheat has a long tradition in Germany."
"Before the current premium rules came into force, Germany already had 25, 000 hectares of land under cultivation, and this would remain necessary."
"Mr President, this debate on farm prices has been very much eclipsed by the financial effects of BSE in which the repercussions of a disaster in one sector being imposed on another is only part of the scourge."
"In my view, Europe is facing a fresh financial debacle, namely that of swine fever, a disease which regularly crops up here and there and has currently hit my country where costs, in the Netherlands alone, have already reached 150 million ECU."
"I think that this situation is horrific and I am making an appeal to the Presidency and Commissioner Fischler to look for new methods to combat this disease so that vaccinations provisionally combined with preventive culling can be tested."
"It is my opinion that the Council and the Commission, with or without the agreement of the Standing Veterinary Committee, must rapidly work out an action plan aimed at avoiding any further animal suffering, any further harm to trade and any increase in Euro-scepticism."
"Of course, I also appreciate the work carried out by Mr Funk and Mr Sturdy, but this evening I felt that I had to talk about this particular problem."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, my colleague Mr Salvador Jové Perez has already expressed the view of our group on the Funk and Balderelli reports."
"The resolutions on agricultural prices proposed by the Commission for the 1997-1998 marketing year are still incomprehensible to farmers in general, above all to those in less-favoured regions."
"Although it is true that in some cases such reductions even pose a threat to what was envisaged in the 1992 reform, it certain that for over 80 % of farmers - for instance those in Portugal - and it should be remembered that Portugal is the only one of the four cohesion countries facing a net loss in agricultural terms - such proposals will surely annoy Portuguese farmers whose income has already been reduced so much."
"In some cases the European Parliament, through the Sturdy report, made no changes."
"In other cases it made proposals aimed at keeping prices at the levels for the previous year - which was moreover the method we used for this current marketing year."
"These changes do not however mean that there will be no real reduction in incomes affecting everyone equally, whether large-scale or small, rich or poor, but it is clearly the poor whose survival will be threatened."
"If we support the parliamentary amendments which seek the lesser of the evils that does not mean that we are in any way supporting the overall line of the Commission's pricing policy; it indicates that we might be in agreement with continuing agricultural forecasting which does not pay attention to the differences and specific aspects, or to the less-favoured regions, or to the size of the holdings or to the scantness of incomes."
"Mr President, today's debate gives us the opportunity to discuss farm prices for 1997/1998 and, at the same time, matters relating to the level and distribution of the agricultural expenditure appropriations."
"The parameters of this joint debate extend far beyond the 1997/1998 prices package, the set-aside changes and the support system for certain arable products."
"The new priorities of the Union, the stringent financial programmes and the proposed enlargement, for which the timetable remains unclear and the cost undetermined, are, essentially, at the heart of the problem."
"This does not mean of course that there are no problems with the prices package itself."
"I could describe the Commission proposal as a management exercise. It has no proper perspective and it will generate uncertainty among producers because they are being placed in an annual planning framework and forced to put up with an inadequate time horizon while waiting for the new arrangements."
"The ECU 1.4 billion saving on arable crop support and the linear distribution of the support to all producers will have its worst effect on the small producers."
"It is, of course, the solution that the Commission habitually opts for when looking for a way out of its problems."
"Its proposal for generous funding to stabilize the beef sector is something that I, personally, oppose."
"I am pleased that the President-in-Office is present because we can say, in all sincerity, that we do want to support the efforts to achieve budgetary discipline and, if you like, savings. Mr Fantuzzi expressed that very well."
"But in order to win our support for this policy the Commission must abandon its prevailing reasoning about good products and bad products, with the bad products being generally those from the south."
"To endow the cereals regime with generous funding while cutting all of the appropriations and getting the saving from products of the south is wrong."
"Not all of us can support this policy."
"Mr President, it seems important that we should also look to the future during the annual debate on agricultural prices."
"The Sturdy report raises these issues."
"He also suggests that we should simplify the system of intervention for cereal crops by setting one price and removing the monthly increments."
"Apart from the fact that this proposal is required to balance the budget, it is also a small step towards adjusting to the conditions of the world market, an adjustment which I welcome."
"It is a small step which corresponds to 0.5 % of the cereal sector's turnover."
"This cannot be considered a threat to the Common Agricultural Policy."
"If we take a more long term view, I am convinced that European agriculture, if it is to play a part on the world market, must adjust itself to that market."
"In the forthcoming trade negotiations we should aim, along with other countries, to abolish export subsidies and quota systems which restrict production."
"It is only by doing this that we can develop a dynamic agricultural sector."
"I would, in fact, be more concerned about the future of European agriculture if we continue with an unchanged agricultural policy than if we take the bull by the horns and really take the CAP reforms to their logical conclusion."
"I sometimes think that Commissioner Fischler is also arguing along these lines, but he is doing so extremely cautiously."
"If he is doing this, he deserves Parliament's strong support."
"A drop in prices ought, at least temporarily, to be compensated for through fixed subsidies but it ought to be possible to phase these out when price levels increase, which they will according to OECD estimates."
"It will be dangerous for European agriculture to continue with an outdated regulation system."
"European Agriculture deserves a better fate than this."
"Mr President, the Funk reports are about actions to limit the production of beef and ways to pay for those actions."
"Last September the Commission asked Parliament to give urgency to consideration of its proposals."
"We gave urgency to the activities but we still have not agreed how to pay for them and that is what this report is about."
"The activities include calf slaughter, more intervention etc., but we must agree how we pay for this."
"Some people are saying the projected underspend this year will pay for it."
"We have to act here with some sort of morality and say: OK, maybe the underspend will pay for it but we actually have to find a way."
"Let us hope we can."
"Whatever we decide this evening will not change the fact that the activities have not cut beef production, so we have to think for next year and the years beyond of more effective ways of cutting beef production."
"The drop in consumption Europe-wide has been between 10 % and 15 %, so we have to cut production or we have to promote the eating of beef."
"An important part of the budget we have to consider later in the year is putting money into the promotion of beef-eating, to take it out of intervention."
"For every ECU 50m we invest in this way we will make a saving of ECU 100m."
"I hope we will decide this week and that we will not have the third and fourth Funk reports next year."
"We British would like to know the United Kingdom's real contribution to the common agricultural budget when considering the cost of BSE eradication in Britain and the cost of compensation to farmers because of the revaluation of the green pound in the light of the Thatcher-negotiated refund."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad to see that the President-in-Office is with us today."
"In basic terms, Austria is a traditional durum wheat growing area, although that was not accepted or demonstrated in the accession negotiations."
"So there is a tradition of durum wheat production in Austria, that can be traced back to the early 1960s and proved by planting entitlement certificates."
"Furthermore, extensive exports confirm that Austrian durum wheat is also in demand on the international market because of its high quality."
"I therefore particularly welcome the fact that the Committee on Agriculture has reassessed the situation and voted in favour of granting the durum wheat growing subsidy for 9, 600 hectares of land in Austria."
"The 1992 plan to reform the agricultural policy has already improved the Community's agricultural situation."
"The attractiveness of farming and rural areas, with all their varied functions, must be preserved."
"The care and maintenance of natural resources, greater attention to environmental issues and the adaptation and continuing development of agriculture are important aspects of an integrated policy, in my view."
"We must therefore offer farmers the certainty that the next WTO round will not be anticipated and that Europe will pursue a policy of stability."
"The confidence of the farmers can be gained only by a policy planned on a relatively long-term basis."
"I should mention in this connection that it is important that farmers are able to earn an income from their own original production, and that compensatory payments are only compensation."
"The Common Agricultural Policy cannot be dictated by budgetary stringency alone if we want traditional farming to survive throughout Europe!"
"Mr President, I am tempted, having sat here for two-and-a-half hours to do my monetary speech again, that is, money does not grow on trees."
"But since I have done it once I will not repeat it."
"Seven years ago I was in the Parliament in Papua New Guinea having a far better time than I am here."
"During the debate which was being conducted in pidgin English, one of the speakers who was talking about a great mess that the Government of Papua New Guinea had got themselves in used a beautiful word."
"He said: ' You have made one big bugger-up' ."
"That word 'bugger-up' encompassed so much."
"I am reminded of that word when I look at Mr Sturdy's report which was actually going down the budgetary-neutral approach, doing everything OK and then the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development applied the principle of 'bugger-up' and made a right bugger-up of Mr Sturdy's report."
"Commissioner, you, in effect, have said the same thing but in a more eloquent way."
"What you have said, in fact, is that we really should ignore all the amendments and support the Sturdy report."
"At least that way we would get a budgetary-neutral position."
"One of our problems in this Parliament is that not many people will take notice of you, especially on that side of the House. That is where the monetary speech comes in."
"The one thing they have to learn is that you cannot defy the laws of mathematics."
"The money has to be found somewhere."
"We do not conjure it out of mid-air."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for being here."
"I support him in saying that the ECU 170m should be removed and so do a lot of my colleagues, as Mr Fantuzzi said."
"You also said that Parliament has a responsibility in supporting the reduction of ECU 1.4b."
"I agree with you."
"Mr Fantuzzi made that point."
"On this side of the House we are as one."
"We try to live in the real world."
"That is what we are trying to do with the amendments that have been put forward from our side."
"If Parliament does not act responsibly, it will not be taken seriously."
"That is the point that we have to remember time and time again when it comes to agricultural matters."
"Mr President, the question about set-aside prompts me to mention two or three things."
"First, the debate regarding the set-aside rate for the end of 1998 is still merely speculative, although farmers are supposed to know where they stand as soon as possible."
"For example, France is calling for a zero set-aside rate."
"The Commissioner talks about a maximum of 17.5 %."
"From the German standpoint, I am bound to say that we cannot share these views."
"Why?"
"We must expect the cereal harvest to reach a similar level to that of 1996, but there are already indications that the enormous increase in the use of cereal feeds last year is being reversed, while export projections are, as you know, anything but a reliable guide."
"Whatever happens, then - and I particularly emphasize this for the benefit of members of the Socialist Group, though Mr Rehder has unfortunately left - we must adhere to the instrument of cyclical and, especially, voluntary set-aside."
"Any reduction in voluntary set-aside, especially, would be impossible to explain to our farmers at home."
"As you know, we can offset 85 % of any voluntary set-aside against overcultivation of the major crop."
"In the autumn of 1995, Commissioner, you told the Council of Agriculture Ministers that a national offsetting option for the basic land area would be in existence by as early as the end of 1996. You then deferred your latest proposal on this problem until after the 1996 harvest, and it was the subject of proposed amendments by the Member States concerned, including Germany and France, which the Commission has not yet accepted."
"I ask that you finally put into practice the political promises you made in autumn 1995, and that you do so in time for the 1997 balance."
"And a final word on your over-compensation, which I have mentioned before."
"Create the same situation as for the oilseed subsidy, and then take all the money left over for improvements in livestock production."
"Then you'll find we're on your side!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Mr President of the Council, the current CAP is severely out of line with the different political, economic and social realities of the European Community and lacks integrity in its thinking."
"It gives priority to financing all production which costs jobs, with one scandalous exception - the tiny tobacco-growing area."
"It allocates 47 % of the whole Community budget to a highly privileged minority of 20 % of European farmers who receive approximately 80 % of all aid."
"This encourages rampaging production which threatens the environment, the health and welfare of animals and public health."
"The CAP is today a political aberration which needs to be radically changed."
"All production aid should be stopped and transferred to holdings under specifically determined rules."
"Such aid should be made conditional upon the use of production techniques which are compatible with environmental protection, the health and well-being of animals and public health."
"It is essential in social terms to tailor production aid in inverse proportion to the size of the holding; for the sake of cohesion allocation should be on a regional basis with amounts increasing as a function of the underdevelopment of the region; there should also be an increase for each stable job existing within each holding and some practical application of the Community priority to combat unemployment."
"A top quality rigorous campaign should be mounted and open to consumers to take part and take stock of matters financed by the EAGGF-Guarantee Section."
"The implementation of this rigorous control should become a commercial emblem which is highly prized by the Community's internal and external markets."
"The report by Mr Funk takes the opposite line from what is wanted. Its sole objective is to increase the unfair aspects of the CAP and to channel further financial resources into production which is already swallowing up 45 % of all aid which is losing more jobs and leading to more desertification in the Community."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their work, in spite of the criticism."
"The collapse of the market and the collapse of consumer confidence due to BSE has caused a huge income drop for farmers."
"In Ireland this drop is somewhere around 19 % with livestock farmers suffering even greater reductions in income."
"In spite of what Mr Wynn has just said, this is a very human problem and one which needs to be addressed."
"I fully acknowledge the work of Commissioner Fischler in softening the market blow and I thank him for the help he has provided."
"I hope his support will continue until the industry recovers."
"Turning briefly to the reports, the proposal from the Commission to allocate an extra ECU 1.4 billion to the beef sector is very welcome but I cannot accept the method of funding proposed, namely to reduce aid to cereal farmers by the same amount."
"I reject this method of paying for BSE, a crisis which cereal farmers had nothing to do with and for which they should not be asked to pay."
"I believe the necessary funding can be found elsewhere, perhaps from savings and some delay in payments."
"I note what the Commissioner told us earlier."
"I support the proposal that set-aside be fixed at 5 % for the 1998 harvest but without reducing payments for land taken out of production."
"As rapporteur on an earlier set-aside report I asked that the rates be set each year in July at the latest to enable farmers to plan properly."
"There is general agreement on this."
"I am now asking the Council and the Commission to make an immediate decision at 5 % set-aside with the current level of area aid maintained."
"Finally, an important element of this debate should be the future of EU production."
"We need to start work on the longer term position of agriculture, vis-à-vis the present CAP reform end in 1999 and also the next WTO round."
"We must explore the possibility of additional farm production to manufacture products separately for the growing world market without export refund or other cost to the EU budget."
"I think this is worthwhile."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Sturdy for his report."
"I disagree with his basic proposal which is that because the Member States have to exercise strenuous restraint in budgetary matters, we in the European Union must do the same."
"The Maastricht criteria is the business of the Member States."
"It is not the business of the common agricultural policy."
"The farmers of Europe and their incomes are our responsibility."
"Over the years it was the Member States who over-borrowed."
"It was they who over-spent and ignored their budgetary guidelines."
"We did not."
"We lived within our budgetary guidelines all through the years."
"We not only did that, we stayed within the 75 % of growth that Mrs Thatcher insisted on."
"We not only did that but we sent back money every year which we saved with good budgetary policy."
"Mrs Thatcher would be proud of the way we have carried on and she would be particularly proud of Terry Wynn this evening if she recognized the way he is defending what she fought so long for in relation to the European Union budget."
"This year, of the money which is available to us, we are sending back ECU 2.27 billion."
"And this at a time when European farmers' incomes are dropping."
"Never mind the 20 % spoken about by the previous speaker, we are sending back ECU 2.27 billion which we could apply to the needs of the 80 %, the 5 million European farmers, whose income is only half the average industrial wage."
"I agree with Mr Kofoed."
"I accept that we ought not to increase prices indefinitely and we should relate it to area aid or the number of people on the land who protect the environment and maintain the rural fabric."
"Therefore, I believe we have set out in the wrong direction and I so not support the basic proposal that because there is stringency at national level, it should be applied here."
", President-in-Office of the Council. (NL) Mr President, I should like to make a very brief comment because I have not been asked any more questions in this debate, but I should like to tell you that it has been a great pleasure for me to follow it."
"I also think that, in July, the Council will be able to take advantage of this debate and I would like to tell Mr Fantuzzi that I have not only listened to what has been said by the rapporteurs and paid attention to their reports, but I have also followed tonight's debate in the European Parliament in full."
"If possible I should like to ask you, Mr President, and the European Parliament through you, to issue an opinion on the prices package."
"I think that it is obviously necessary for the decision-making process in the Council for it to receive an opinion from the European Parliament because, without it, the Council cannot do its work and I think that it would be in the interest of farmers and farms throughout Europe for a decision to be taken at the end of June on next year's prices package."
"As for us, we shall do everything we can to conclude the prices package procedure, but without the opinion of your Parliament that will be impossible and therefore I am waiting for it with bated breath."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by thanking the House for this debate."
"I think the price package has been discussed in a very constructive spirit."
"This is not the time or place to go into details, but there are a few general principles to which I should like to return."
"The reason the price package actually exists is in order to define the appropriate production conditions for the next financial year, to the extent that those conditions are within the jurisdiction of the Council and Parliament."
"So, by definition, it is asking too much of a price package that it should at the same time be a reform package."
"But I have already promised you, and I stand by what I said, that the Commission will also be presenting appropriate reform packages and proposals to Parliament before the end of this year."
"As you all know, the Commission's services published analyses a few weeks ago clearly showing where, and to what extent, reform is needed."
"In addition, the question of the budget and the question of reducing the arable crop premiums have played an important part in this discussion."
"I admit that our proposals, in the form presented, may have overemphasized the budgetary argument on the basis of the budget situation at that time."
"But we did call attention from the start to the fact that cases of over-compensation exist, and these cases have also been quantified in the interim."
"In any case, the Commission has no need to apologize for its economical conduct of the budget, which indeed has been very much in line with Parliament's wishes."
"There is one thing I must say to you, Mr Funk: if, as you suggested, there is absolutely no willingness for something to happen, it cannot happen."
"The body representing the farmers, the COPA, is now showing greater flexibility with regard to the future development of the compensatory payments."
"Regarding the argument advanced by the hard-currency countries, our calculations have certainly shown that cases of over-compensation have occurred in hard-currency countries, too, not just in countries that have seen devaluations in recent years."
"The proposals made in connection with modulation are, in some cases, very interesting and worthy of discussion, but in my opinion they should more properly be discussed in connection with plans for the reform of the sector."
"Mr Fantuzzi, I freely acknowledge that your idea whereby the first step should be to equate the set-aside premiums with the standard cereal premiums does imply a degree of modulation."
"On the other hand, though, I feel I should draw your attention to the fact - as has already been mentioned here - that we should take due account of the fact that any such measure should also be accompanied by precautions to safeguard, in particular, the future production of energy-generated crops."
"As for Mr Goepel's proposal regarding the striking of a balance, that is certainly something that can be discussed."
"The critical point for me, though, is that we should actually get round to what the Regulation intended from the beginning: the adjustment of the compensatory payments to the existing economic conditions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon on Thursday."
"Novel foods"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"(B4-0175/97) by Mrs Breyer, Mr Lannoye and Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Green Group, on the implementation of Regulation (EC) 258/97 on novel foods; -(B4-0176/97) by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the application of provisions on the labelling of products covered by Regulation 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients; -(B4-0177/97) by Mrs Schleicher, Mr Pimenta, Mr Liese and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the application of provisions on the labelling of products covered by Regulation 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients; -(B-0178/97) by Mr Eisma, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the application of provisions on the labelling of products covered by Regulation 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients; -(B-0179/97) by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the application of provisions on the labelling of products covered by Regulation 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients; -(B-0180/97) by Mr Weber, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the application of provisions on the labelling of products covered by Regulation 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients."
"Mr President, we are once again meeting here to discuss the regulation on novel foods."
"As almost everyone now knows, the novel foods regulation has failed."
"It has created a confusing situation."
"There are at least four different labelling practices in use for genetically altered foodstuffs and more are being planned."
"The authorities in the Member States do not know how to deal with this regulation which has just entered into force."
"The consumers are worried, they are uninformed."
"Retailers, too, are calling for clear guidelines to ensure that they will not need to be ashamed of their customers."
"Has the Commission ascertained whether the WTO has anything against the EU creating a new stricter packaging labelling practice than had been planned?"
"Has the Commission received any reply from the WTO?"
"I should also like to know whether the Commission's cardinals have met yet to decide who is to be elected Pope."
"What I mean is that the many Commissioners, as is well known, have made their own proposals as to who should really coordinate labelling practice and who should be elected 'Pope' in the Commission on this matter."
"How many more days will the Commission still need to appoint this Pope and does it intend to create any uniform labelling practice for these genetically altered foodstuffs?"
"Mr President, it is of course a pleasure once again to be discussing novel foods with my fellow Members and with Commissioner Bangemann."
"Mr Bangemann, we have had many opportunities to fence with each other in the past, and indeed we have assured each other, more or less indirectly, of our mutual esteem."
"What I do find a little disappointing is that in the supplement on novel food and on novel food legislation I have the impression that you, all of a sudden, as the representative of the Commission, might be a bad loser."
"One reason I find that disappointing is that I have made a mistake in my own judgement of human nature - I took you for a pragmatist, a stubborn one certainly but still a pragmatist."
"The things I have heard the Commission say in the past, and my own experiences too, suggest to me just this: you, Mr Bangemann, know as well as I do, as a properly trained lawyer, that a Regulation must be implemented."
"In the text of the Regulation adopted by the mediation committee - and nothing could be more democratic than that in the European Union nowadays - it says that it is possible for the Commission to issue implementing provisions."
"It is also perfectly within its rights if it chooses not to."
"But if it exercised that option, then its duty would be to ensure that this legislation is applied in the Union."
"You can't have this both ways."
"Either the Member States do it for themselves, in which case the Commission issues an instruction, and says what it wants to some extent, or the Commission does it, and that is why I hope to hear you say this evening that the Commission is indeed working on implementing provisions."
"In that case, though, just to be difficult, I shall ask you why you didn't do that work back in early May, since the regulation came into force on 15 May, and I shall moan and groan a bit more and say you could have known, it's nothing new after all."
"But I shall be satisfied if I hear you say that you feel certain that, in the light of the conclusions of the mediation committee, consumers now have the right to receive comprehensive information on genetically modified foods when they differ from conventional foods, and not just in the accumulation of all the things they will find in the regulation, when nutritional value, nutritive characteristics and many other things are taken together."
"That is not cumulative, otherwise it is an alternative, and the text of the law says that quite clearly."
"I am also perfectly willing to have it checked by the Court of Justice."
"Even though I, as a politician and a lawyer, certainly do not take the view that the Court of Justice should be making policy."
"I should like to hear you say today, Mr Bangemann, that you are working on implementing provisions."
"If you can't tell me that, then I should like you to tell me how the Member States are supposed to label these foods clearly, and I should also like to hear - and I must admit that I still have a deep and unshaken confidence in your good intentions - that no labelling will be allowed that can mislead the consumer."
"I am far from being the sort of person who declaims against genetic engineering - quite the reverse."
"I believe that genetic engineering offers huge possibilities, but I also believe that if food is genetically modified it must not be labelled 'produced by modern biotechnological methods' ."
"I know that there are some Member States that want that."
"But I hope that you will support the European Parliament in preventing anything of the kind, and I confess that even this late in the day I should be glad to hear something to that effect from you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the PPE Group I would like to give the reasons for the questions we put."
"The Novel Food Regulation has created legal certainty for consumers, retailers and manufacturers regarding the licensing, in particular, but also the labelling of novel food products, including genetically modified products."
"That was and is a major achievement by all the European institutions."
"But an EU regulation becomes directly applicable law in every Member State on the day on which it enters into force - 15 May, in this case."
"Every regulation which becomes applicable from a certain date in 15 Member States of the European Union inevitably causes problems of interpretation and implementation in the early stages, especially with such a difficult subject as this."
"Even if the implementation and application of a regulation, in particular, were to be handled uniformly in every Member State, we do see difficulties with practical application in a matter as complex as this."
"I think those problems relate to three points: how, and especially in what wording, products are to be labelled; which products are covered by the regulation; and, finally, what happens to those maize and soya products that were approved even before this regulation came into force."
"There is evident uncertainty here, caused by differences in interpretation, and so we regard it as urgently necessary for agreement to be reached at Community level on a uniform interpretation."
"As I see it, these problems are certainly solvable, but the issues must be addressed in an objective discussion with the experts at European level, as a matter of urgency."
"I say urgency because foods produced from approved genetically modified soya and maize are already to be found on supermarket shelves, but now, according to the provisions of the regulation on novel foods, they have to be labelled."
"This of course makes it especially clear that a review of Directive 220 on labelling is more than overdue."
"However, these problems cannot be solved in the manner favoured by certain Members of this House, who create the impression that media impact and the prevention of genetic engineering are more important to them than effective consumer protection."
"A good example of what I mean is the questions put by Mrs Breyer and the Greens, because that group is saying that the whole regulation has got to be amended or even replaced."
"This view is not only nonsensical but contrary to the wishes of the majority in the European Parliament."
"The issue here is not scaremongering but resolving perfectly ordinary difficulties, and we hope our questions will encourage the Commission to do so."
"Mr President, I should like to insist that we must be particularly circumspect concerning subjects such as new food products in Europe."
"After swine fever and BSE, consumers want more than ever to be informed about what they are eating."
"Although a regulation came into force on 15 May of this year, we absolutely do not know how this regulation is to be interpreted by the Member States in certain areas."
"I should like to ask Mr Bangemann why the Commission did not adopt a directive in good time to deal with this problem so that there can be a uniform and clear regulation concerning labelling?"
"How, Mr Bangemann, is the labelling of genetically modified food products currently regulated?"
"Who takes responsibility for this labelling if the Commission has not issued a regulation on it?"
"Is it up to manufacturers?"
"In short, there is a great deal of uncertainty and we feel that the Commission has been very negligent over this and this has seriously affected consumer confidence and we now would like to know how the Commission intends to deal with this problem because it is becoming a very urgent one."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, we are naturally delighted at the entry into force, on 15 March last, of Regulation No 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients introducing new provisions covering appropriate labelling. This is an important step forward in a sector which is not yet familiar to the consumer and is a source of great confusion and bewilderment."
"This is precisely why there is a need for guidelines that are clearer and more transparent than the text of the regulation."
"In fact it is unclear whether the regulation has retroactive effect."
"Indeed, what is its actual field of application?"
"For example, is labelling of genetically modified maize and soya, which were authorized entry to the Community market back in December, obligatory or not?"
"And if it is, must the provisions of the regulation be respected or not?"
"And how should countries which already have national standards in this sector act?"
"How strictly should the rules be applied?"
"Is it too much to ask for clear and precise guidelines on the implementation of this regulation, on its scope and on labelling?"
"Have the different national standards, for example Italy's, been taken into account?"
"And finally, has there been any consideration of the confusion experienced by the majority of consumers who, for the most part, are still too ill-informed to be able to interpret the words on the labels about genetically modified organisms correctly and therefore harbour understandable and fundamental misgivings."
"In conclusion, it seems appropriate to stress that, even if we are looking at a regulation which is the fruit of a compromise between the conflicting interests of Member States, organizations and interest groups, and corrects the total lack of control in the sector, this does not mean we should be content with incomplete and unsatisfactory provisions, which lend themselves to various interpretations and may actually be generating bewilderment and confusion."
"Mr President, before I deal with the individual comments that have been made I should first like to make a general observation that may clear up a few misapprehensions."
"We have all accepted the result of the conciliation procedure, except for Mrs Breyer and a few others who pointed out at the time that it was not enough to provide the consumer with appropriate information."
"So no one here - not Mrs Roth-Berendt nor Mrs Schleicher and especially not Mr Eisma, who as far as I know did not participate in the debate, in which the Liberal Group did not particularly distinguish itself - should now suddenly hold the Commission responsible for something which you brought about yourselves in the course of the conciliation procedure with the Council."
"Mr Eisma, I object to the way you are now simply turning the tables and saying that the Commission failed to do such and such."
"This legislation dates from May this year."
"It is true that the discussion produced what is somewhat pompously referred to as a paradigm shift, and indeed I called attention to it at the time, a shift away from the traditional principles of labelling, for which I argued at the time."
"If a change takes place which is significant to the consumer, then labelling is necessary."
"If a change takes place which is not significant then labelling is not obligatory , and in my view that change should not be shown on the label, because if we label absolutely everything the consumer is in the position of the emperor with the new clothes, confronted by a whole mass of labels that amount to absolutely nothing."
"And that, Mrs RothBerendt, is the basis of the achievement you were so proud of."
"You were proud of it, Mrs Breyer was not."
"Nor was I. You said at the time - I can still produce the Minutes - this resolution is a slap in the face for Mr Bangemann."
"And now you're trying to make me responsible for it."
"I am more inclined to agree with Mrs Breyer - if any breast-beating is called for, you do it!"
"No, I want to start by getting this clear, so that the dividing lines are not blurred and so that the wrong impression is not created that the Commission is responsible for something which you, at the time, celebrated as a great victory for Parliament."
"I can still remember your appearance on German television!"
"(Heckling) My dear madam, if Mr Eisma and Mrs Roth-Berendt and other speakers behave as if the Commission were responsible for everything under the sun, then you are going to have to accept - it's called democracy - the fact that a Commissioner who has been involved in these discussions and suffered these discussions from the start is allowed to say what actually happened at the time."
"Anyone here who wants to debate honestly and frankly must admit, ' I accepted the result of the debate at the time.'"
"It essentially corresponded to the principles, because it was in fact based on three substantive criteria."
"I never said, Mrs Roth-Berendt, that they all had to be present at the same time!"
"The Commission never said that."
"I don't know where you got that idea."
"If the composition of a food changes, if the nutritional value changes or if its intended use changes - and if one of those things happens in an individual case, which we have never contested and never viewed differently - then it has to be labelled."
"That is the first point, and that is crystal clear."
"But these three criteria mean, Mrs Schleicher, that there is an objective basis: whenever a change is significant to the consumer then the product must be labelled."
"Well, Mrs Roth-Berendt - and this is the background to this whole debate - a completely different debate on soya and maize has been launched, not just in Parliament but also within the Commission, on the question, irrespective of the three substantive criteria: Is labelling not generally necessary."
"No, don't shake your head at me!"
"There are many people in this House - as is apparent from the questions - saying, for example, we want labelling for maize or for soya or for some other food that is not even covered by the Regulation; because, after all, the regulation applies only to foods which are sold to the end consumer, which maize and soya meal generally are not."
"But if you now insist that these things have to be labelled, irrespective of whether one of the three criteria has been met, then it is absolutely clear to me that you are abandoning the principles which we all defended at the time by saying that, never mind what the effect is, we must say on the label if a particular technology has been used, even if the effects disappear completely somewhere along the chain."
"Everyone knows that genetically produced soya beans or maize, when they are processed, do not have the effects described in the Novel Food Regulation, and need not have those effects, so from that point of view this is a paradigm shift."
"Now, I am perfectly happy about this - I said so before, I am democratic here - and if Parliament and the Commission adopt that by a majority then of course it will be done."
"I will be in a minority of one, and bow to the majority."
"But I am going to take the liberty of saying again, this evening, that I regard it as fateful for the consumer."
"Because virtually anything and everything is going to labelled, and ultimately that means that labelling will become totally meaningless to the consumer."
"Again, I think Mrs Breyer is right - we can all pat each other on the back, but the consumer derives no benefit whatever."
"So that is the situation."
"The Commission is working on it."
"We have set up a group of Commissioners to review this fundamental change."
"I am against it."
"I think the three criteria are absolutely essential - or, in more general terms, that the principle of a substantive change affecting the consumer is essential."
"I am not acting as a spokesman for the industry, because the industry favours the same thing as you."
"I do not!"
"I believe the consumer will derive more benefit if he is given relevant, clear information about things that are significant to him."
"But if the majority wants it and if it helps us to ascertain the truth, then we'll do it, which in practical terms would mean that we would have to amend the Novel Food Regulation because it would no longer make any sense."
"The idea of having stricter rules for the labelling of animal feeds - granted for the sake of argument that maize and soya beans are feeds - than for novel foods is something that would be beyond me to explain."
"Because, for heaven's sake, in that case we will change novel food itself, drop the three substantive criteria, and whenever a genetically modified constituent turns up somewhere in the chain we put a label on!"
"That is the real problem."
"Mrs Roth-Berendt was kind enough to say that I stand up for my views in issues like these, and that is what I am doing now."
"If a majority of you want to change it, then, as I said, there is nothing I can do to stop you, nor would I want to."
"I just want to make sure you understand what the result will be, and that result is not good for the consumer."
"Now let me deal with the individual questions, and I shall be very brief."
"The Regulation has been in force since May."
"We defined the exceptions from the scope of this directive very clearly in Article 2, so that no guidelines are needed on that."
"The same applies to Article 1, even though under Article 1(3) there are a good many questions that need to be cleared up in the committee procedure, but after all that was why we set up that procedure - we did not want to introduce guidelines to do something that should be done by the committees."
"As far as Article 8 is concerned, we are going to have to review the situation as I said earlier, in other words reconsider the form this fundamental decision is to take."
"But irrespective of that decision by the Commission, and later by Parliament, the absence of guidelines does not imply carte blanche for the Member States; they can't just interpret the provisions as they see fit."
"In any decision on approval, the provisions of Article 8 are applied to the specific case and the labelling arrangements and forms are defined."
"So there is no scope for unilateral action by Member States, or of course for the individual."
"He does have a certain freedom of choice, but ultimately we shall make the appropriate decision."
"We also want an ad hoc measure covering soya and maize products."
"As I said before, this will have consequences of its own, because in principle it has nothing to do with the applicability of the Regulation on food and food additives."
"So a certain amount of logic would have to be applied in that case."
"Those, essentially, were the questions asked in this House."
"We are quite willing to continue debating with Parliament on what we are doing."
"But, Mr Eisma, there is one thing I would like to make completely clear: I am not going to take the kind of charges you made this evening lying down!"
"Like Mrs Roth-Berendt and many others involved in the conciliation, I was of the opinion that the result was an acceptable one."
"It did not violate our principles."
"It introduced changes in matters of detail."
"Mrs Roth-Berendt was very pleased and proud of that."
"Parliament celebrated it as a major victory over the Commission."
"And now everything is being turned back to front and you are holding us responsible for that result, and even this late in the evening I must say that I am not particularly pleased about it!"
"Mr President, Mr Bangemann has explained to us at great length why things that should have happened long ago have still not happened."
"Today, Mr Bangemann, we are discussing implementing provisions for the Novel Food Regulation and, if I may quote from the Green Paper for Food Law, Regulations are always to be used to increase the transparency of Community law and facilitate the application of its provisions within the single market so that implementing regulations by individual states are unnecessary."
"What that means is that there must be implementing regulations at Community level, so that every Member State, when approving products, must do precisely what the other Member States are also required to do."
"If we want a single market, then we need to construct that single market very carefully for products which are viewed by consumers with some mistrust as something new, something strange, we can't just say, ' We've had the legislation since 15 May and it's only 15 June now so there's still plenty of time.'"
"Mr Bangemann, you have had plenty of time for your services to prepare this, and I should think that the DG III administration would probably also be capable of it."
"Mr Bangemann, basically, I cannot fully understand what you are saying."
"There are things I do understand, but in April 1997 you wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that 'labelling contributes absolutely nothing' , and that of course rouses our curiosity."
"We believe that labelling definitely does contribute something."
"It contributes something to the consumer and it contributes something to the industry, and that is the opportunity we want to take."
"After the grim experiences of BSE, we should take the opportunity offered by the Novel Food Regulation and put it to good use."
"I think it has become clear here tonight that we are talking not about the content of the directive but about what we have made of that content."
"You say that it only came into force in May, and in legal terms that is correct."
"I am no lawyer, as you know, but you knew as long ago as January that this business was coming and what form it took."
"We would have liked to see you making some effort to make it clear to the 15 Member States of this Union in which direction they were supposed to be heading."
"All right, there can be no definitive documents for us to examine at that stage, even we understand that, but I think we really should consider it beneath us to grind out the kind of superficial campaign of accusation we have heard on this occasion from the Greens, who can be unimaginative themselves sometimes."
"I believe in all seriousness, Mr Bangemann, that the Novel Food Regulation is a good first move in this new direction."
"So buckle down to it, and then we can tell the Member States where things are heading!"
"Mr President, I believe Mr Bangemann has been honest with us this evening, and we should be honest too."
"The Novel Food Regulation was indeed a joint creation of Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"I pointed out the absence of any implementing provisions, not only in January but also in the conciliation committee."
"Among those Honourable Members here who are now complaining about it, everything was crystal clear at the time, the Novel Food Regulation was the best of all possible regulations and it covered everything."
"Well, I want to look not backwards but forwards."
"I am grateful to Mr Bangemann for the fact that, despite the wording of Article 8, where it does say that the Commission may issue rules for implementation - Parliament didn't want it to say that the Commission must issue rules for implementation - he has nevertheless declared his willingness to arrange implementing provisions on labelling."
"I believe those are important, because there is criticism here not just from environmental groups and consumer associations but even from the industry itself."
"What we need now, therefore, is a form of words to label those products which are covered by the regulation."
"I would once again strongly urge the choice of the wording 'produced using gene technology' , because 'modern biotechnology optimized by food physiologists' would mislead consumers and offer them little in the way of clear information."
"Also, we would lay ourselves open to the charge that the Novel Food Regulation is a labelling swindle."
"If the industry uses the method, then the industry should also have the courage to say so on the label, so that eventually genetic engineering becomes a hallmark of quality in the food industry context."
"Which brings me to the subject of the 'quality mark' ."
"The positive aspect of the Novel Food Regulation is that we make provision, in Recital 10, for positive labelling."
"Mr Bangemann, particularly in view of the fact that the industry is planning to declare everything not covered by the Novel Food Regulation as being free of genetic engineering, I would have liked to hear from you whether you are prepared to do as we did with organic farming, and now with animal products too, and to work out criteria to enable us to have positive labelling."
"Because one thing has to be clear: we must not shake consumer confidence."
"What we should be doing, at last, is ensuring clarity."
"Mr President, I want to put a scenario to Commissioner Bangemann."
"If a consumer in a Member State suffers as a result of inadequate labelling, in normal circumstances when the law is clear, that consumer may well have a remedy under the Francovitch judgement against the Member State concerned for its failure to implement European law."
"The Commissioner knows that and I know that."
"This new law, as we have all regarded it, has received widespread publicity."
"Most European Union citizens who take an interest in this matter will have assumed that there is a new law providing protection from 15 May."
"Surely a Member State Government in circumstances such as now arise can say to any disgruntled consumer in a court case: ' But we do not know what the position is."
"The Commission has failed to inform us' ."
"So there is a responsibility on the Commission."
"The Commissioner dealt well with the argument this evening in terms of Parliament's responsibility and, as a member of the conciliation team, I take part of that burden of responsibility."
"But I would point out to the Commissioner that there are three readings under co-decision."
"The Commission is involved in the proposal when it first comes to us."
"It is involved in the second reading."
"It is only when we are not able to agree with the Commission that we move on to conciliation."
"Therefore, there is a responsibility on the Commission now, as there was at the beginning of this legislation, to ensure there is adequate protection for consumers."
"In my submission, and that of most of the people in this Chamber, that has still to be provided."
"Mr White, this regulation came into force on 15 May."
"Today is 10 June, so less than a month has passed."
"We have not had a single case so far, and as far as labelling is concerned we laid down detailed labelling requirements in the regulation that apply immediately and mandatorily in the Member States."
"Because that, Mr Florenz, is the purpose of a regulation."
"You referred to a directive."
"But this is a regulation, which applies immediately in the Member States, and if there are any disputes as to whether the labelling is correct the Food Committee can decide - that is stated in the regulation."
"Apart from that, as I have already said, we are currently reconsidering matters in general - yourselves and the Commission, jointly."
"Once we have arrived at a result the Commission will, obviously, present the new ideas to you, and perhaps you will then say: ' We are going to abandon the criteria of the Novel Food Regulation, because we want to say on the label whenever genetic engineering is involved, even if it does subsequently vanish somewhere along the food chain, because that is the existing situation with soya and maize.'"
"But that goes without saying!"
"The requirement is that anyone who uses those two substances in the processing chain should indicate that they have been genetically modified, irrespective of whether or not the three criteria apply."
"Mrs Schleicher, the reason I have been so involved in this issue of the Novel Food Regulation is that I believe that we shall be doing the consumer a disservice if we abandon these labelling principles."
"But if that is what you want, then we must at least be logical."
"It is out of the question to apply stricter labelling rules for soya and maize than we do for a novel food which is going direct to the end consumer, and that is why we are going to have to reconsider this matter."
"You know me. If I make a mistake, I accept it."
"Anyone can make an occasional mistake, but when you come to me after three weeks have passed without a single case arising and say, as Mr Eisma says, that I have forgotten it all and I have failed to meet my obligations, I am not going to stand for that!"
"Especially not when I have had to listen to Mrs Roth-Berendt saying on a news broadcast, ' Well, Commissioner Bangemann has had his ears boxed.'"
"OK, if that was what happened, maybe you should be wondering whether you might not have boxed your own ears."
"Because that is the real problem!"
"The joint debate is closed."
"I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon on Thursday."
"The sitting closed at 00.20 a.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, yesterday, in one of his rare speeches, Mr Tomlinson referred to the sovereignty of the House in coming to decisions."
"Early this year, when voting on the transit inquiry report, the House decided that the follow-up should go to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In yesterday's Minutes, apparently, we approved a report on telematics in transport - which is all part of the transit system - going to the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"However in a document circulated by Distribution yesterday called 'Activities' , it says that the Commission's action plan for the new transit in Europe customs policy should go to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"Is the House sovereign or not?"
"We will check it and take the necessary measures."
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor on a point of personal explanation."
"Last Monday, when the session opened, Mr Ford spoke on a very serious matter, the fact that, since the last session here in Strasbourg, someone had torn down a poster he had put up on his office door commemorating the resistance of the German people against Hitler."
"But Mr Ford then made comments which I consider decidedly unfortunate and out of place: he said he was not surprised that such acts of political vandalism could occur in this Parliament since it includes people like Roberta Angelilli, that is myself, whom he blames for alleged neo-Nazi activities, organizations and initiatives in Italy."
"Frankly I have no idea what inspired those accusations, insinuations and associations of ideas."
"Perhaps Mr Ford, a leading light of this Parliament, is actually prepared to use the methods of the basest and most defamatory political demagoguery, born of the worst intolerance, to gain more applause from the House."
"Well, I just want to say one thing: at least in Italy, making unfounded insinuations is in fact a criminal act, and it is called defamation."
"I therefore invite Mr Ford to inform himself better before making unfounded insinuations, and in any case I invite the President, or whoever is responsible, to investigate the incident fully."
"Personally I intend to take some kind of action, possibly even legal action, to shed light on this event."
"Mrs Angelilli, I must point out a couple of things to you."
"First of all, you must reply to any personal remarks or comments immediately following the remarks or on the same day."
"Secondly, all Members are free to speak in plenary session and neither the President nor any other authority can stop them."
"That, as you know, is what is meant by parliamentary immunity for words used within the Chamber."
"Nobody can censure another Member nor can they take legal action either in Italy or any other country over something said in this Chamber."
"That is why, if someone says something that is erroneous you must reply at once, in order to clear up a misunderstanding or put the facts right, as you are trying to do today."
"Mr Ford, you have the floor. However, this is not the time to continue a debate on this."
"But you referred to Mr Ford."
"Please could I ask you to be brief as we have far more important issues on the agenda."
"Mr President, Mrs Angelilli made comments on what I said on Monday."
"It was on the basis of a press report in the United Kingdom."
"I will provide her with a copy of the press report on what she was alleged to have done."
"Obviously I expect her to take legal action and, if she does not, one can only draw the appropriate conclusions."
"Mr President, I should also like to speak on a personal remark."
"I was not there on Monday but I cannot allow Mr Ford to get away with what he said. He is always provocative and he once again confused issues and scandalously accused me of racism."
"I should like to tell Mr Ford that I know France and the racism that my assistant has been victim of."
"Mr Stéphane Durbeck, my assistant, is a black West Indian and he has been beaten up and called a 'genetic freak' , just because he does me the honour of accompanying me in all my activities."
"The Vietnamese godchildren whom I am bringing up have been attacked and hurt just because they are my godchildren, and I treat them like my other children."
"I have also helped out some three thousand Lebanese orphans over the years and they too have been attacked and the victims of vendettas, just because they are Christians."
"If there is any racism here, it is Mr Ford's, whose thought-masters have murdered 200 million people in the world, because they were peasants, middle class or Christians."
"We are not impressed by Mr Ford's Stalinist accusations!"
"Mr Ford, you are a provocateur!"
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Mr Antony, please allow me to remind you of the rules on personal matters."
"Speakers can only express their views on the basis of the debate."
"They may only refute remarks made during the debate concerning them personally, e.g. opinions attributed to them and/or rectify their, own declarations."
"You rectified the remarks concerning you, but it is not the time to open a debate that has nothing to do with them, or to start attacking someone else."
"I can no longer accept speeches like that."
"(The Minutes were adopted)"
"Thank you Mrs Green, you are quite right because people have worked very hard all night and again from 8 o'clock this morning to make the vote possible."
"I think everyone will be understanding about any possible errors and I ask for everyone's cooperation so that we can have a smooth vote on this crucial issue."
"We understand that it is absolutely exceptional, we cannot do this every session."
"This is just for one occasion and only one occasion."
"Preparation for the European Council of 16/17 June 1997"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparatory work for the meeting of the European Council on 16/17 June 1997 in Amsterdam, including the Commission's action plan for the internal market."
"You have the floor, Mr Mierlo, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr Santer, President of the European Commission, you have the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in less than a week's time, the Amsterdam European Council will have to overcome the final obstacles to the reform of the treaty."
"We shall then see whether the IGC has met its triple challenge: to narrow the gap between the European project and the citizens, find the resources to exist in the international arena and review the institutions in order to bring about enlargement in good conditions."
"Four successive presidencies have worked on this project in turn."
"The time has come to conclude."
"Further waiting at best would change nothing and at worst would lead to a move backwards."
"The current text drafted by the Dutch Presidency is a point of balance and, I hope, a meeting-point too."
"I would have preferred more boldness here and there but I do gauge the difficulty of marrying ambition and realism and I think that the Dutch Presidency team has largely succeeded in meeting the challenge."
"If I remain concerned today, it is because there are too many attempts to undo, at the last minute, such patiently completed work."
"I would like to tell all of those who, concerned at the gap between politics and ordinary people, are tempted to take a thousand precautions: ' Be daring!"
"I also call on the heads of State and Government to resist the temptation to take advantage of the final home sprint to settle, through protocols and various amendments, problems that are ill-suited to constitutional improvisations."
"I would rather expect them to take advantage of the final negotiations to constitute a coherent and ambitious institutional package."
"It is on that score that the shape of a final solution is still vague, even though a good outcome is vital."
"I repeat what I have often said: an ill-prepared enlargement would turn into a nightmare what I think in reality is a historic chance for Europe."
"Mr President, a few remarks about the key points of the negotiation and the 'Union for citizens' ."
"The new treaty offers the chance to create a genuine area of freedom, security and justice."
"In this area, the accomplished work is remarkable and the text of this Presidency ambitious."
"The citizens expect no less, tired at seeing how the current system is deficient and that no convention - yes, no convention - has come into effect."
"We can only welcome the broad communitarization envisaged for the third pillar."
"After a three-year transitional period, we should now switch to qualified majority voting and the Commission's exclusive right of initiative."
"But we should go to the conclusion of Community logic, i.e. introduce the codecision procedure."
"(Applause) As for criminal and police cooperation, it is legitimate at this stage to stay at intergovernmental level, provided that the effectiveness and democratic nature of that cooperation is increased."
"Integration into the treaty of the Schengen 'acquis' is a good thing."
"The share-out between the pillars must be clear if the Union's action is to be as coherent as possible in areas linked to the free movement of persons."
"Certain Member States have specific difficulties over this, I recognize."
"Let us find specific solutions for them, but not at the cost of blocking real progress as a whole."
"It is now a fact that the treaty will include a chapter on employment."
"Of course, it cannot be expected that this measure would directly reduce unemployment - I shall come back to the broader problem of employment later - but this chapter is vital for at least two reasons."
"Firstly, because it shows that the endemic nature of unemployment has brought some of the concerns to the heart of the European project, along with the hopes of Europeans."
"Secondly, because the provisions included in that chapter are useful ones."
"Once our States have set as an aim a broad convergence of their economic policies, they also need a coherent and coordinated employment strategy."
"For that we must set up consultative arrangements and the possibility to take incentive measures."
"That is what the Dutch Presidency's draft text proposes."
"Integration of the social protocol into the treaty will make it possible to restore unity and coherence to social policy."
"But we must seize the opportunity offered to us to improve it and strengthen its provisions, or we shall run the risk of replacing an already difficult action for fourteen countries with an impossible one for fifteen."
"We must also strengthen consumer health production to allay people's concerns."
"Unlike 1992, nobody now contests the Commission's proposals."
"They will rightly make it possible to involve the European Parliament fully in the adoption of measures aimed at by Article 129, extended to the veterinary and plant health areas."
"(Applause) We, i.e. the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission must then show that we can act in the interest of consumers, on the basis of the arrangements we have had made available."
"Mr President, the second main aim of the IGC can be summed up in five words: existing in the international arena."
"There is a time to regret our collective powerlessness, but there is also a time to react and I should like Amsterdam to be the opportunity for a quantum leap in political will."
"First of all concerning CFSP proper."
"The arrangements proposed by the Presidency are an important step forward."
"They provide for qualified majority voting for implementing strategic decisions taken at European Council level."
"The restrictive possibility of referring to national interest (in exceptional cases) - I prefer to speak of security interests, as it happens - is a price to pay for this advance."
"The new troika, comprising the Presidency, the Commission and the Secretary General of CFSP, is a promising tool in that it brings together all aspects of external policy and combines periodic renewal with continuity."
"In my view, it should play a coordinating rule and act as an agent of coherence throughout the process, by relying on the analysis cell."
"I also welcome the agreement on the funding of CFSP."
"But apart from the instruments, we must also have genuine political will and use it effectively to develop a common policy."
"One final word on CFSP, ladies and gentlemen, I do not see how Europe can claim to become a major actor without a military role."
"That means that it should set a deadline for integrating the WEU into the European Union, as six of the Member States have proposed in a joint position."
"(Applause) In modern life, the economic, financial and monetary factors are playing a growing role in external relations."
"It is clear that the arrival of the euro will change the situation and lead to a new balance of international financial and monetary relations."
"Commercially speaking, the Commission is asking for the adaptation of the treaty to current realities."
"It is a simple position of common sense, common sense that sometimes disappears in the diplomatic jousting and bureaucratic reactions."
"I say this clearly: refusing to make progress on services and intellectual property, the defence of the Union's interests, the Member States and companies run an acute risk of going backwards."
"(Applause) Everyone must take their responsibilities."
"The text proposed by the Dutch Presidency is a progress, since it provides for an extension, albeit limited, of Article 113 to services."
"But there are delegations which want to water it down or add to it, even in other articles, supplementary conditions, at the risk of emptying this progress of all substance, even ending up in a step backwards compared with the current situation."
"I shall oppose that."
"I now come to the institutional questions, which are vital as they condition not only the support of Europeans but also the future of the Union itself, just before its enlargement."
"The Presidency's text provides, as the Commission has always demanded, for a strengthening of the European Parliament's role as co-legislator."
"It is a sign of confidence that corresponds to the development of your institution."
"Only the European Parliament can ensure the democratic controls that the European Union needs at the stage of development that it has reached."
"We only need to recall the recommendations of the Karlsruhe Constitutional Court to realize that and the Presidency's approach is a real progress since it aims to cover most areas of a mostly legislative character."
"Furthermore, simplification of the codecision procedure, and the abolition of third reading, will put the two legislative branches on an equal footing."
"We should resist any last minute attempts to reverse that decision."
"(Applause) In that context, I think that the time has also come to define an electoral system that brings representatives closer to the voters and a European parliamentarian status."
"I think that this is a vital factor for strengthening the legitimacy of the Community institutional system."
"(Applause) As for the functioning of the Council, the vital point is that of extending voting by qualified majority."
"The Presidency has dealt with this question with the necessary openness, which means inroads into the second and current thirds pillars and a consolidation in Community areas."
"A further effort could be made to foresee adoption of qualified majority voting on social provisions and some measures in taxation areas, but it has to be said that the Member States' attitudes leave little room for hope over that."
"It is a shame, because unanimity in a European Union of more than fifteen Member States will only lead to hold-ups and even paralysis."
"As for the reweighting of votes, the Commission is open to alternative proposals by the Presidency, provided that the final solution does not make decision-taking more difficult and that it opens the way to more qualified majority voting."
"I finally come to the membership of the Commission."
"The solution that will be found will probably be not that far removed from the one we proposed for preparing our institution for enlargement."
"The appointed President will have to be approved by the European Parliament."
"His or her role will be strengthened, I hope, especially over the appointment of the other Commissioners."
"As for the number, that has not yet been decided, I think."
"The Commission continues to believe that a maximum number of Commissioners should be set."
"As far as we are concerned, we are going to do what we announced for internal reforms and that includes the regrouping of tasks."
"Mr President, allow me to conclude on the IGC."
"I told you at the outset that the draft treaty that we are debating today meets, on many points, the expectations set out by the Commission in its opinion of February 1996."
"Everyone will judge the final outcome by his or her own yardstick."
"It is the fruit of a lengthy labour."
"If we can improve it, let us do so, but let us not call into question the level of the project by making last-minute demands that would change the balance already struck."
"It is not easy to achieve a quality treaty with fifteen Member States."
"It will be even harder after enlargement."
"Mr President, if there is a question that concerns all European, it is that of employment."
"The people of Europe expect the Union to offer answers to their main concern."
"The inclusion of an 'employment chapter' in the new treaty will help."
"But this is urgent."
"Why not anticipate the implementation of this arrangement?"
"It is not tomorrow that we should learn from each other or work out a coordinated strategy on jobs."
"It is today."
"It is today that we must translate the best practices into recommendations."
"In less than a year, we shall be taking the decision on the entry into the third stage of EMU."
"The setting up of a stable macro-economic framework has progressed a lot in recent times."
"Inflation and interest rates are at very low levels, and public deficits have considerably shrunk."
"At the Amsterdam summit, we shall have to complete the final preparations for the euro, the new exchange rate mechanism, the euro's legal status and the stability and growth pact."
"The latter is important for guaranteeing sustainable growth."
"That growth must still be rich in jobs."
"I welcome the fact that the ECOFIN Council, the day before yesterday, recognized the need for EMU to walk on two legs, monetary and economic."
"If the monetary aspect is clearly defined, we still need to make an effort to use all the potential of the procedures provided for in Article 103 of the Treaty and aimed at coordinating economic policies."
"An ambitious monetary policy only makes sense if it goes hand in hand with a policy for higher employment that everyone can understand."
"(Applause) I should once again like to emphasize that the stability pact, as its new name implies, is also a growth pact, therefore a job-creating pact."
"All the Member States wanted that."
"Without calling into question the stability pact's substance and arrangements, it is therefore perfectly possible to highlight employment still further and thereby overcome a concern expressed by one Member State at the latest ECOFIN Council."
"That concern is and always has been ours."
"I therefore very much hope that the contacts under way will make it possible to reach full success at Amsterdam, including an agreement on the stability and growth pact."
"I also hope that the European Council will send a strong signal on the completion of the internal market by the end of the century."
"The potential of the internal market for competitiveness, growth and employment, is huge."
"The action plan proposed by the Commission defines four main areas for maximizing that potential: strengthening the effectiveness of the rules, ending distortions to competition or fiscal distortions, ending sectoral obstacles and putting the single market to the service of all citizens."
"Practical commitments will have to be made and clear deadlines set."
"Reforming and modernizing labour markets is the third axis of a coherent and integrated strategy for jobs."
"The role of the social partners is especially important here."
"I therefore welcome the agreement signed at the end of the last social dialogue summit, last Friday in The Hague, on part-time work."
"This is an encouraging sign that shows that flexibility and the defence of workers' legitimate aspirations are far from being mutually exclusive."
"The very positive reaction of the Member States, all the Member States, to the idea of territorial pacts for jobs is another reason for satisfaction."
"A new form of partnership is being forged on the ground and will be turned into a practicality by the launch of some 90 pacts, which will be hotbeds for job creation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Amsterdam European Council will mark the future of the European Union."
"It will, I hope, be a historic meeting and proof of the desire of the fifteen Member States to advance towards unification, while respecting their different identities."
"A good agreement on the IGC will give Europe a new boost and enable it to meet the EMU deadlines and handle enlargement in good conditions."
"Let us not miss the opportunity."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Santer."
"You have the floor, Mrs Green."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission for their frank contributions here this morning."
"We have been in this process now for over two years and when we began, for my group the essence of it was that we should try and do our best in this Treaty process to reconnect the European Union with its citizens and, secondly, that we should prepare the Union for enlargement."
"Those were the two fundamental prerequisites of this round of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"My group believes that the Treaty changes had to be based on four concepts: openness, democracy, clarity and effectiveness, and those were the goals which we believe we have set ourselves for this Treaty round."
"Many of my colleagues will report in detail on some of the issues Mr Van Mierlo and Mr Santer raised."
"I want, and was mandated by my group, to give a short political message within days of the Amsterdam Summit so that my group's position is absolutely clear."
"I delivered this message with great clarity to the congress of my political party, the Party of European Socialists, last week meeting in Malmö and, in particular, to the nine prime ministers within the Council who are from our political family and who were all present in Malmö."
"The message is that we recognize all the intricacies of the Treaty, but now in a few days' time there are three major areas where my group feels we will be looking to see that more progress should be made. In saying that, we recognize and have been quite clear about the progress that has been made in the Treaty."
"We are not overly cynical and we see that some changes have been made that are positive and respond to our demands."
"But we want more and we will be looking to see how much more can even be gained in the final few hours of Amsterdam."
"Our three priorities are as follows: firstly, we want to see the strengthening of the draft employment title in the Treaty on European Union."
"It is not good enough and is just pious rhetoric."
"It must encompass the coordination of economic and employment policies."
"Secondly, we want to see included in the Treaty fundamental social rights and the strengthening of the social chapter, not just the incorporation of social policy into the Treaty."
"Thirdly, we believe the enhancement of democracy in Europe is crucial and we are looking at the extension of QMV and codecision across the legislative field in the first pillar."
"Mr Van Mierlo mentioned the anti-discrimination clause."
"We welcome that but it is not good enough that it is based on unanimity."
"It must be based on qualified majority voting and co-decision with this House."
"Finally, we made clear in our group that what we want to see is that those issues to be transferred, as we hope they will be, from the third to the first pillar must also be subject to QMV and co-decision as Mr Santer has already made clear for the Commission."
"It cannot be that those issues are transferred without proper parliamentary scrutiny."
"Only progress in those areas will make sure that the Union is ready to enlarge and will have something serious to say to its people."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, both of you have offered us a serious and remarkable introduction and I should like to thank you sincerely for that as well as for the work that has been completed."
"The intergovernmental conference has been working for more than 18 months now."
"The European Single Act needed only five months of preparation and the Maastricht Treaty one year."
"We have always adopted a positive attitude."
"You mentioned, Minister, the troubled circumstances and we are not hiding our heads in the sand for we will have to deal in Amsterdam with a political problem which I shall be tackling as a priority, despite the meeting of six heads of government from the European Popular Party, which took place yesterday in Strasbourg."
"The French government is insisting that we set up an assessment period for the stability pact and is calling into question the time allowed after the signature in Amsterdam."
"What is our position?"
"'Pacta sunt servanda' , the Dublin commitment to the stability pact must be stuck to."
"We cannot accept any changes to this Pact which is also a pact for economic growth."
"Furthermore, the criteria and the deadline set in the framework of monetary union must be applied as they were agreed upon and we want the Amsterdam IGC to be a success."
"We are nonetheless of the opinion that the stability pact must be complemented."
"Yesterday, Mr Lamfalussy described the fundamental revolution carried out by monetary union in Europe."
"The reduction in inflation below the 2 % level, reduction in budgetary deficits."
"This is an essential base, especially for creating jobs and for economic prosperity, but we have lost ten years."
"I might perhaps add that, when I was President-in-Office of the European Council in 1987 I tried, in conjunction with Jacques Delors, to create a common social base and to establish dialogue between the social partners in Europe and conclude collective bargaining agreements at European level."
"We did not succeed."
"We have wasted ten years and at the Maastricht Summit we failed to integrate the social chapter into the Treaty, something which will now take place."
"Now we must reinforce it. We all agree on this."
"But it is also of vital importance that employment should become an objective of the European Community. We therefore approve the Dutch proposal to include a six-point title - the number is irrelevant - on cooperation between the Member States, which it encouraged, supported and possibly complemented."
"The Dutch Presidency has pointed out that the setting up of an employment committee has been accepted and that is something we welcome."
"We also still bank on the implementation of Jacques Santer's confidence-building pact."
"According to us the stability pact cannot be withdrawn but it should be strengthened."
"It must be complemented and Jacques Delors recently emphasized that Article 103 of the Treaty authorizes this."
"We would therefore insist on this point and we hope that, in these circumstances, the stability pact will be signed in Amsterdam just as the PPE heads of government decided to do yesterday."
"That at least is our position."
"I now come to the IGC."
"The Dutch Presidency's proposals make up a remarkable document in our view."
"I would say that it is a valid minimum, Mr President-in-Office."
"However, we cannot accept that, as we have been told, and as the European Commission's President emphasized, the big countries should take various initiatives, including diplomatic ones, in order to undermine it."
"This project represents for us a valid minimum provided that it is not reduced."
"You have emphasized certain points: the communitarization of major elements of the third pillar with the Community pillar."
"In our view, integration of the Schengen acquis into the Treaty and implementation of Europol are essential elements for an area of freedom, security and justice."
"As far as the second pillar is concerned, we recommend integration of WEU as has been proposed by six Member States. We also support your attempt to introduce a system of majority decisions for this pillar, for common actions and positions and on the basis of a common strategy as you have stated."
"The third main point: integration of an 'employment' title into the treaty."
"Fourth point: amending Article 113 of the Treaty, on services and intellectual property; then the institutions."
"I am fully behind what the President of the Commission has just said: I understand the enormous difficulties which you have to deal with but I also note a strong political will in that the head of the Dutch Presidency is determined not to allow the European Union to collapse but is set on seizing the challenge - historic challenge - of enlargement to 20 or even perhaps 25 members."
"That is why it is so important for the institutions to be reformed."
"Mr Van Mierlo, in order to have a good car you need a good garage."
"How the garage is organized is of no interest to me but what is of interest to me is to know that it is a good garage, and that I will therefore have a good car which will be properly repaired, because at the moment it is jolting along."
"That means, in our view, that majority decision taking in the Council and the codecision of the European Parliament in this area are capital."
"We also feel that we should adopt a strengthening of majority cooperation rather than unanimity."
"Dear colleagues, I shall end with these comments: we shall never approve - and we never have - of Mrs Thatcher's intention which was to reduce Europe to a free trade area, mere intergovernmental cooperation."
"For 12 years I opposed this with many others in the European Council."
"We cannot tolerate the opportunist decision by the Swedish government which did not ask for opting out in the framework of the monetary union and which for opportunistic reasons, because the single currency is unpopular in Sweden, has decided not to take part in it."
"This really is an opportunist decision which does not help us to progress."
"I hope that the great statesmen, the late Mr Mitterrand, Mr Delors, as well as Mrs Guigou and all of the others alongside what we have defended for Europe for the last ten years, will enable it to pursue its course."
"But they must also take advantage of their considerable influence in the French government to turn the Amsterdam Summit into a success and to achieve the signature of the stability pact, especially so that Europe can let the ordinary people have a say. So that it can become a social Europe with a human dimension."
"I hope that, by reuniting our forces, we shall achieve that aim."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the next Amsterdam Summit will be the first of a series of meetings that will fashion the architecture of 21st century Europe."
"We hope that it will be followed by the setting up, on the scheduled date, of economic and monetary union, enlargements to the south and the east, that will draw the boundaries of a finally reunited Europe and assert the identity of our continent in the international arena, the only prospect enabling European citizens to face up to the challenges of globalization that, quite rightly, worries them."
"It must therefore be seen as one step in a long journey and not as an end in itself."
"It is in the light of these challenges that its outcome should be assessed."
"Europe first of all needs effective institutions, i.e. able to take the decisions that have to be taken, at the right moment, and democratic and transparent procedures involving national parliaments and the European Parliament as the co-holders of democratic legitimacy."
"Those who rightly refuse a bureaucratic and undemocratic Europe must give it the means to acquire its political legitimacy."
"The acquis communautaire must be strengthened, be it the single market, external trade policy - as Mr Santer proposed - which must be more offensive, common agriculture and fisheries policies which must be made more efficient but also fairer."
"Social cohesion must also be strongly reinforced, e.g. by inclusion in the treaty of an improved social protocol, as the French Government demanded in March 1996 in a memorandum on the European social model and by the inclusion of a chapter or a new title making employment of all one of the main aims of European construction, along with the guarantee of our internal and external security, without which there cannot be a genuine democracy."
"Europe is often criticized, ladies and gentlemen, less for what it does, which is often little known, than for what it does not do, and should do."
"It would be seriously incoherent to denounce the paralysis due to maintenance of the rule of unanimity that certain States legitimately want to retain when they think that superior national interests are at stake and at the same time to refuse to develop stronger cooperation between those States that want to go further ahead."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we should also beware of restricting the exercise of that flexibility or stronger cooperation with such tight rules that they would make it practically inoperative."
"If we want European construction to continue to make progress, let us retain the pragmatism and flexibility that have enabled it, so far, to develop and which will be all the more necessary in a Europe extended across the continent."
"We expect the heads of State and Government to show the political will to go full steam ahead so that the European Union can finally acquire the political identity that matches its economic weight and its cultural influence."
"If Europe now arouses fears among a growing number of our fellow citizens, it is because its institutions have not sufficiently borne in mind their worries about a seemingly uncertain and menacing future."
"Amsterdam, Mr President-in-Office, should not just be the title of a Brel song, but it should be a hit."
"The outcome must give Europeans fresh hope as they are expecting practical responses to their worries, mainly about employment and security."
"That is the signal we are waiting for and let us hope these expectations will not be disappointed."
"To conclude, I should tell you, Mr President-in-Office, that I particularly appreciated your introductory speech, which was full of realism and pragmatism."
"I think that you have tried to fill the plate - to take up your own culinary metaphor - and I hope that your colleagues in the Council will not prove to be fans of nouvelle cuisine."
"Thank you for your results so far and good luck!"
"Mr President, rather than continuing with the fairly down-to-earth comparison of the garage and garage-mechanic, I should like to remind you of Robert Schuman's definition of Community rules back in 1950. He said that Europe would not be achieved in one go or in the construction of a whole, but by practical achievements creating de facto solidarity."
"It is in that spirit that strong institutions and rules were created to enable the States to live together, to acquire a common spirit and guarantee effectiveness."
"That is what is more prosaically known as the step by step approach."
"Referring to those principles, which are still fundamental for the Union's progress, I should like to speak about the draft treaty in three areas."
"As far as employment and social affairs are concerned, the draft text prepared by the Dutch Presidency takes into account the demand of European citizens by introducing into the treaty the fight against unemployment, the creation of new jobs, the maintenance of a system of social security that is in keeping with the European model."
"Even if some think that these commitments are not enough, the door is now open to further developments: the step by step method."
"The result on a common foreign and security policy is quite different - something else seen by citizens as a manifestation of Europe's existence."
"On this there are neither tiny steps nor any real progress. The tools that have been created - I am sorry, Mr President-in-Office - are intergovernmental."
"Unanimity, i.e. the right of veto is going to control all decisions."
"The Council's authority is strengthened to the detriment of the Commission's."
"Constructive abstention is made fragile by the right of veto, possible even bad tempered veto, of one of the Member States. And that is with only fifteen Member States!"
"As for strengthened cooperation, it is obvious that the conditions of its implementation will be vital for the overall assessment of the Conference's outcome, i.e. the future of European construction."
"The condition of unanimity for CFSP is a real nonsense and cannot be justified by any argument."
"Faced with these predictably modest results of the IGC, respect of the EMU deadline and the stability pact seem an absolute imperative."
"Any delays or calling into question of the conditions and timetable would return us to the darkest hours of the Union's history."
"We have reached times of considerable challenge and dangers."
"We therefore welcome the courage of the Dutch Presidency."
"Madam President, the IGC ought to win the citizens of Europe over by meeting three challenges: restoring meaning to European construction, democratizing the institutions, clearly sharing responsibilities."
"Just before the Amsterdam Summit, we are far from achieving those aims."
"I am pragmatic and am not asking for the moon, but I think that we could do better and that we should try to do so, before the single currency and enlargement both of which are necessary in my personal view."
"It is not enough to have such a weak institutional framework."
"If we do not make enough progress in another week, let us work another two or three months over the summer so that three or four vital questions can be resolved; a more serious treaty could then be signed."
"With my Group, I ask that the conclusion be delayed until the autumn, unless a few vital improvements are made by the time of the Amsterdam summit."
"What needs to be improved?"
"First of all, we should clarify the mandate to be respected by the States and the Union on employment."
"Too many doubts are blocking the implementation of clear-cut actions."
"The French initiative for setting new conditions of growth and employment, without of course refusing the challenges of competitiveness and stability, is timely and courageous."
"But how can it be put into practice?"
"A protocol of further intentions added to the stability pact is not enough."
"It is the Treaty that must include clear commitments and operational tools so that the coordination of economic policies really does take on board the requirement of cooperation over jobs."
"To that end, the decision on certain fiscal, financial or industrial questions must no longer be blocked by unanimous voting; if each State can veto decisions, there will never be a common growth and employment policy."
"Let us not be satisfied with a cosmetic agreement when things are actually being blocked."
"Secondly, the democratization of the institutions calls for more efforts and on this point I approve of the European Parliament's proposals on codecision, controls over the executive authority and transparency in particular."
"Thirdly, concerning the fair share-out of responsibilities and the strengthening of the Union prior to enlargement, the draft Treaty shows very serious deficiencies."
"Each State is sticking to its prerogatives."
"It is the intergovernmental Europe that is advancing and not the Community."
"The legitimacy and efficiency of codecision will not be boosted."
"The States have the necessary means but are balking at committing themselves and are rejecting democratic controls."
"We cannot expect the IGC to remove all these obstacles and it would therefore be wise at least to see this Treaty as a precursor to the institutional reforms of the year 2000."
"We then will need a constituent procedure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Committee on Institutional Affairs on its work under the leadership of Mr Biagio de Giovanni."
"But there is some hesitation over the political conclusion."
"Let us overcome that and ask the governments to continue their efforts."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that there is much that can be learnt from history, so here is today's history lesson."
"Prince Grigor Potemkin, the favourite of Catherine the Great, had conquered the Crimea."
"When the Empress visited her new territory, Potemkin deceived her regarding its actual state with hastily built villages, false fronts and military charades."
"That was in 1787."
"Today, 210 years later, Prince Potemkin and the Russian Empire are long gone, but Potemkin-style villages are still being built."
"The biggest ever is to be inaugurated next week in Amsterdam with the Maastricht II Treaty!"
"The false front is attractive and welcoming - freedom, security, the rule of law, the Union and the citizens. Mr van Mierlo paints all this in the most glowing colours, and I really do wonder whether he actually believes what he is saying!"
"Because what is hidden behind the false front?"
"A masterpiece of empty paragraphs, as in the case of the non-discrimination article, escape routes as in the case of transparency, lip service as in the case of the so-called employment chapter, a verbose vacuum."
"Maastricht II needs to make the necessary corrections to make the European Union viable for a pan-European future, for democracy and social ecology."
"What we have now is not just inadequate but actually at variance with all the hopes, requirements and justified expectations we have expressed!"
"Maastricht II completes the first step towards the abolition of democracy in favour of the extension of executive power."
"There is no other way to describe the pseudo-communitization of parts of the third pillar, the incipient erosion of basic rights and rule-of-law principles such as the individual right to asylum or data protection!"
"Instead of finally establishing the Union on a foundation of civil law, where security means legal certainty and not law and order!"
"The preamble talks about sustainability, but then the rest of the text becomes bogged down in the allpervading logic of growth which, as we know, is the very opposite of a responsible blend of ecology and economy."
"A start is made on the militarization of the EU, instead of promoting the demilitarization of foreign policy."
"Our task must be to push aside this false front."
"We are very much given to talking about transparency and credibility."
"But in that case we must not let ourselves be exploited, we must not describe something as success and progress when it is nothing of the kind!"
"We are not the star witnesses of the latter-day Prince Potemkin, whether his name be Helmut Kohl or Jacques or Hans van Mierlo or whatever."
"Our job is to make it clear to the national governments that democracy is an essential for European integration, not an inconvenient obstacle!"
"We need to make it clear that there are new expectations of a change of direction in economic, social, environmental and ecological policy."
"The citizens, Mr van Mierlo, want more than just bread and circuses - they want to know what's cooking, and who is cooking it, and how, and what with."
"They want to help the cook. That is called participation, and it's called democracy, in Europe too!"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office - I congratulate you on your frankness - Mr President of the Commission, the variety of political changes in Europe and the short time between now and the Amsterdam Summit make the exercise especially difficult to achieve."
"For our Group, it is clear that nothing should thwart the process of European integration and the need to take into account social demands and employment should not be a brake on that integration but on the contrary a further argument in favour of strengthening the Union."
"As for the issues on the Summit agenda, apart from the reform of the institutions proper, our Group supports the compromise resolution to be voted on later, be it for economic and monetary union, social issues or employment, the single market, the action plan proposed by the Commission, or other issues."
"A word on the stability pact, now the subject of discussion for several days."
"We feel that this pact is the corollary of the creation of the single currency and that its adoption should not be delayed, otherwise we would run the risk of delaying the introduction of the euro, which would be a serious political error."
"However, we understand the need to add to this pact economic and social provisions, with jobs as the target."
"We hope that by the time of the Amsterdam summit, a compromise will be found so that nothing can hold up introduction of the euro."
"For that, it is perhaps not vital for these economic and social provisions to be included in the pact."
"They could be placed in another supplementary document."
"As for the institutions themselves, we regret that a few days before the Summit there are still doubts on important points."
"The President-in-Office confirmed that."
"We are therefore forced to give an opinion on a proposals made by our Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"The first version of that proposal, drafted by Mr De Giovanni, was demanding and rather strict."
"The second version presented by the Commission itself is more optimistic and less demanding."
"For our part, we regret this development since we want the Summit to go as far as possible in the reform of the institutions and on the road to integration, be it the voting arrangements in the Council, the membership, role and strengthening of the Commission, the European Parliament's prerogatives, such as generalization of codecision, the piloting of a genuine CFSP, or the elaboration and implementation of the Union's economic and social policy, what some call the Union's economic government, alongside the future Central Bank."
"The European Parliament has been saying this for two years."
"Unless our wishes are met, there will have to be another IGC, as the President-in-Office himself said."
"Madam President, the preparation of the Amsterdam European Council is being dominated by an artificial polemic about the stability pact, which will end up masking the meeting's real challenges."
"It is an artificial polemic because, as we know well, the employment aspect, demanded by the French socialists to re-balance the pact, is already found in the draft treaty prepared by the IGC and it will not be possible to do much better."
"It is also an artificial polemic because the single currency, since there is no optimum monetary zone in Europe, can only work against employment and, alongside that great reality, all the rest is nothing but political hot-air or window-dressing."
"And it is also artificial polemic because the first and real employment policy at European level was the common trade policy, which Europe buried when it launched itself into all-out free trading."
"But this artificial polemic on the stability pact is distracting attention away from what is really at stake at Amsterdam."
"First of all, the very strong progress towards federalism in the draft treaty, which is going to subordinate nations still further and worsen the democratic deficit."
"Then there is the more immediate hijacking of the debate on the single currency, which concerns radical constitutional changes that would have to be decided for it to function properly, but that nobody dares to deal with frankly out of fear of raising problems that cannot be dealt with."
"When we see these cares and cautions, which are rather ridiculous, it has to be said, about the draft treaty, in order to skirt around the basic question of the viability of the single currency, we cannot help thinking of JeanJacques Rousseau's words: ' It is the weapon that must be left in the wound, in case the victim expires when it is taken out' ."
"Mr President, unfortunately we will not be able to hail the definitive shape of the European Union at Amsterdam."
"In fact, the work of the IGC has not yet led to the consolidation of political union, and it could hardly be otherwise, as the Union still lacks an institutional, democratic and operational base capable of supporting the destiny of an enlarged Europe."
"How can we expect to have political union, a common foreign policy, a common defence policy to guarantee peace, a policy pursued inside the Union, and outside with the partner countries, or a policy of respect for and defence of human rights, in the absence of a solid and efficient institutional base?"
"What authority will there be to receive a part of their sovereignty from the Member States, so that all these problems can be convincingly resolved?"
"The absence of political union means that economic and monetary union is causing our countries immense and innumerable difficulties because, just as a new house is built from its foundations, so economic union should be completed by monetary union as the direct result of political union, and not vice versa."
"For these reasons the Alleanza Nazionale believes it is important that the work of the IGC does not end with Amsterdam, but continues until a consolidated and institutionally well-constructed political goal has been achieved."
"The question of the enlargement also needs to be viewed from this perspective."
"The gap between the candidate countries and the 15 Union countries is vast, and in some sectors it seems downright unbridgeable."
"For this reason, as well as justifiable concern about the operational effectiveness of the future Union, it seems absolutely indispensable to have a transitional period for serious discussions within the scope of the negotiations."
"From this point of view it seems clear that delaying the decisions of the IGC for several months would not constitute a grave danger for the future of the enlarged Europe, indeed it is the only way to achieve an enlargement which will have profitable results, and through which political Europe will finally be created."
"Madam President, I welcome the progress in drawing up the new European Treaty and the agreement that has been reached, which is roughly along the lines suggested."
"That will be a modest but significant step forward for the European Union."
"But even at this relatively late stage I would urge the Dutch Presidency to do everything possible to strengthen the text, particularly with regard to the employment chapter and selective areas of qualified majority voting."
"At the moment, the text is rather vague; we need greater precision and emphasis."
"But the Amsterdam Summit will also consider other issues, particularly the moves towards economic and monetary union, the stability pact and the single market programme from the Commission."
"The point I wish to make this morning is that job creation should be the central priority."
"There are 18 million people unemployed in Europe today, 21 % youth unemployment."
"That is a disgrace and we need coordinated action to tackle the problem."
"We need a growth and stability pact."
"When we talk about support for industry we should do everything we can to stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We need to put the Essen proposals into effect, complete the single market and make Europe truly competitive."
"All these are important issues which need to be considered at the Amsterdam Summit alongside the institutional changes."
"I believe that if this is done, the Amsterdam Summit will be seen as an historic landmark in the development of Europe, not only because of the new European Treaty but also because it puts jobs at the top of Europe's agenda."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, thank you very much for your words."
"I think that they augur well for the outcome of the Amsterdam European Council."
"I think that at this time the European Parliament's work should be to make sure that you and the governments actually achieve those results."
"I can concentrate on some practical aspects thanks to the brilliant speech by the leader of our Group, Mr Martens."
"The first one, which we set out in the motion for the resolution that is going to be voted on by the European Parliament later this morning, refers to something quite vital: preservation of the Community approach."
"What characterizes this rare and complex thing, as Mr Van Mierlo said, is that the Community or the European Union do things together through a supranational body which at all times decides what is in the Community's interest."
"I therefore think it is extremely important that the Commission's work should be preserved because, without the Commission, we would have created an organisation of intergovernmental cooperation which would lack the necessary integration."
"I also think it important to maintain the Court of Justice's jurisdictional powers, as it has done such important work and is an efficient democratic guarantee."
"I think that we should also find an appropriate role for the European Parliament."
"I think, Mr Van Mierlo, that if you look at the motion for a resolution that we are going to vote on, you will see that it changes the role of the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament has for many years been an inciting agent because it has not had its own powers."
"Since the Treaty on European Union the European Parliament has taken on deciding powers in certain fields."
"I think that the motion we are to vote on today demonstrates this new role for the European Parliament: a parliament that decides, a parliament that looks, at all times, for the direction in which the Community should head."
"This motion, which looks backwards, as you can see, differs from our motions passed in the last decade and has highlighted a positive aspect of the Dutch draft treaty which is considerable, and we wish to support you because it seems that, like the previous Presidencies, the Dutch Presidency seems to be going in the right direction."
"We also wish to point out some areas where a last minute effort could be made. I think that, if we make an effort, we can achieve a good result."
"I think that this effort must focus on two points:"
"First of all, the third pillar."
"There are some colleagues here, of course, who think we must go much further, and I think that the Dutch Presidency's proposal to integrate the third pillar in the first in relation to certain matters heads in the right direction, even in the longer term, and we can support you on that."
"As for the social chapter, I think that we must act."
"Undoubtedly, the best social policy, the best employment policy, is a good national economic policy - I am happy to say that and I think that my Government in Spain is in a splendid situation - but I think that we must also send a clear signal to our fellow citizens that the European Union does deal with those matters too."
"That clear signal should be sent in the new Treaty."
"I should also like to point out that in the final straight before the Amsterdam European Council, if we can achieve those aims, if we are daring - I think daring is necessary - if we stick to our ambitions, I think that we will create a good Treaty that will serve for enlargement."
"It should not be forgotten that if we fail to produce a good treaty it will be impossible to implement."
"Madam President, I wish to express my thanks to the President-in-Office and to the Commission President for their contributions to this debate here this morning."
"The current negotiations on a revision of the European Treaties are taking place in parallel with the preparation of the creation of a single currency."
"It is perhaps understandable that the preparations for the single currency have received considerably more public attention than the IGC in view of the direct and obvious impact which the Euro will have on our daily lives."
"Nevertheless, the IGC and the new Treaty which will emerge from these negotiations could have an even more significant impact on the lives of our citizens, provided that the Member State governments keep those negotiations firmly focused on tackling issues which are of most concern to the general public."
"The elections which have recently been held in a number of Member States should ensure this is the case."
"The issue of most widespread concern is employment, both the provision of employment opportunities for those without work and the improvement of job security for those currently at work."
"The unemployment rate in the European Union is twice the level of the United States and three times that of Japan."
"This is unacceptably high, and governments must focus their attention on job-creation measures, particularly for our young people."
"Security of employment in the future for those who are fortunate to have employment at present is an equally important issue."
"The Union must ensure that European companies remain competitive in the international marketplace and that our countries remain attractive destinations for mobile investment and job-creation projects by overseas companies."
"The best available method of ensuring job security for workers is by maintaining and, in many cases, improving the competitive advantages enjoyed by European-based industries."
"We must guard against the tendency to introduce new legislation, particularly at European level, which increases the overall costs of production in our industry and threatens the job security of everybody ultimately employed in the industry."
"The Union should aim to minimize the bureaucratic and administrative burden placed on our industry, particularly by Union directives and regulations."
"It should assist in improving competitiveness through investment and in improving skills training for our workers and for the temporary unemployed."
"Finally, we must aggressively defend our interests on the international marketplace by basing our trading policy on the premise that overseas companies will only have access to our markets provided that we have equally good access to their home markets."
"There is little or no point in the European Union developing a trade policy based on liberal, free-market principles if our competitors continue to operate restrictive practices in their domestic markets."
"The Intergovernmental Conference should address the job-creation and job-security issues by ensuring that the proposals for revising the Treaty include specific commitments to give increased priority to measures to improve the competitive position of EU industry in the international market."
"Madam President, the Intergovernmental Conference which is now in its final stages is of particular interest to the new Member States."
"It is now that we will be able to see whether membership of the EU is what it was made out to be and what it was promised to be by those who recommended it."
"I would like to say that there are big differences between what is now being proposed and what was promised to the Swedish people, for example, before the referendum."
"Before the referendum, one of the principle arguments concerned the extent to which we would be able to influence the Union."
"We can now see that we will probably have fewer votes in the Council of Ministers and that the veto will be abolished in a number of areas."
"Another argument was that Swedish border controls would remain in place."
"In the new proposal for the Treaty this will be effectively forbidden."
"In addition there will be a comprehensive harmonisation of legal matters and asylum policies."
"A further argument was that the Swedish nonaligned status would remain in place."
"But now a number of steps have been taken towards a common defence system."
"In view of the extensive changes which are now being proposed, my party will be voting against the Treaty amendments and will also propose that a referendum on them take place in Sweden."
"Madam President, after what we have heard from the Commission and the Council I am not exactly tempted to conjure up visions of the unity of Europe."
"Their speeches, with their blind, small-minded pragmatism, their timidity and their technocratic thinking, are far removed indeed from the historic challenge of unifying Europe."
"Even so, I believe that this Intergovernmental Conference will have to be measured in terms of that historic aspect."
"And I believe that we, too, in this House will also have to be measured against it."
"If we are agreed that we want to build Europe as a house founded on democracy and civil rights, then we must recognize that this Intergovernmental Conference has done nothing to strengthen the foundations of that house. The foundations become more fragile: starting with the rights of Europol and then with the lack of codecision, the lack of basic rights and the lack of any democratic structure for this technocratic assemblage."
"If we are agreed that the engineering principles by which the house must be built are social cohesion in society and fair shares in prosperity for all, then this Intergovernmental Conference has done nothing to improve that engineering."
"In the face of mass unemployment, rising poverty and a deepening divide between rich and poor, the instruments that this Intergovernmental Conference has offered us are incapable of strengthening this engineering."
"If we are agreed that the central pillar of this European house should be peace throughout Europe, not a military pact, then the thinking that the President of the Commission has put forward here is misguided."
"To hear the way you have spoken here, President Santer, I feel you may be unable to imagine that Europe can play a leading role in the world without a military presence."
"But this Europe has already built on that very idea in the case of coal and steel, the idea of unity without military force and unity through peace."
"And if we are agreed that this European house is being built not for a political elite but for Europe's own citizens, then I ask you this: where are the citizens to find any spark of enthusiasm for Europe when they consider the results of this Intergovernmental Conference?"
"If Parliament is to represent the citizens for whom this European house is being built, then it must act energetically today to counter the timidity and pragmatism of this conference."
"Madam President, I have listened this morning with great interest, in the hope that a realistic response to the concerns of the citizens of Europe would come forward."
"Sadly I found none."
"Both the Council and the Commission seem determined to drive forward in a belief that only they know best."
"There are clearly many concerns sincerely held by millions of our citizens on the future of the EMU."
"They are concerned with the pace and speed with which we are moving and they observe the manipulation and massaging of national reserves by national governments to meet the Maastricht criteria."
"The citizens of Europe are paying the ultimate price in terms of high unemployment and very little hope of improvement in the near future."
"If we were to put the same energy into creating new jobs, new security, then I believe our citizens would be more confident."
"The area of national interest and majority voting must be resolved with clarity."
"I fear we are on our way to creating a new fudge by having even further grey areas."
"The role of the national parliaments must be increased, not decreased."
"I do not believe we can move forward to any enlargement until we are clearer about what we want for ourselves."
"If we do not have structures firmly established before enlargement, well-tested and tried, there will be no chance of enlargement succeeding."
"You must be careful at Amsterdam that you do not destroy what we have achieved and what has been created to the present time."
"Madam President, the draft of an amended Treaty must be assessed in the light of the European Parliament's positions."
"First, priority for active employment schemes and social justice; secondly, a workable foreign and security policy; thirdly, joint measures in the fields of internal affairs and justice; fourthly, democratization of our structures with a new institutional equilibrium; and fifthly, doing everything possible to make the European Union really capable of expansion."
"The proposals made by the Dutch presidency are, as a whole, important steps in the direction the European Parliament wants to follow."
"But further progress in that direction is needed in Amsterdam, because we want and need this Intergovernmental Conference to be a success."
"The European Parliament has a very special part to play here."
"May I remind you that the Spinelli draft constitution was the essential precursor of the Single European Act of 1986, that the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 was itself influenced by important proposals made by this House, and that two Members of the European Parliament are now involved in the present discussions."
"Even today, there is no denying the fact that many of the proposals on the negotiating table were born in the European Parliament."
"We have been a driving force behind this conference, and the European Parliament must also be a full party to the negotiation and ratification of all the further stages of reform that will follow the turn of the millennium."
"The responsibility now lies with the Heads of State and Government."
"They are all deeply committed to the further development of the EU in their speeches; but now the time has come for them to make real decisions that will help to improve the reality of life for all our citizens!"
"Madam President, giving the European Union the ability to act, and hence the ability to expand, was one of the primary tasks of this Intergovernmental Conference, and the Dutch presidency - like its predecessors - did its very best to make progress in those areas."
"But, more's the pity, the distrust between the governments of our Member States is so great in many areas that only limited progress is possible, and I should like to thank President Santer for his reference to Article 113."
"If in the services sector - to take just one sector among many - we provide for three pages of exceptions in a protocol on copyright and direct investment, we are ultimately not so much reforming the article as reversing it."
"I can only encourage the Dutch presidency to use this example to make it clear that a breakthrough must, after all, be achieved in Amsterdam, so that we are not worse off than we were before, with governments defending positions which mature reflection would show are against their own interests, as in the case of negotiations in the WTO round."
"The same applies to policy on legal and internal affairs."
"I think it is urgently necessary that the areas proposed by the Dutch presidency that are to be transferred from the third to the first pillar really do make that transition, to give us the ability to act."
"And that ability to act must be underlined by an automatic transition from unanimous voting to majority voting, to enable us to take a genuine step forward."
"I am tired of hearing political leaders say that Europe wants to combat international organized crime and then refuses Europe the instruments to do so, which is what has happened!"
"It can only be done by this automatic procedure, which must be integrated into the first pillar."
"That this also involves the rights of Parliament is something I need only mention in passing."
"The same applies to the foreign and security policy."
"Some marvellous ideas have come to light here - I am not sure whether they will really give us more ability to act in practice, but I am sure that the possibility will be examined."
"The second point was concerned with more democracy, and with bringing Europe closer to the citizen."
"I believe, Mr President-in-Office, that you will last the course, with the support of this Parliament, and achieve progress in the field of codecision."
"I hope that we shall be able to thank you next Wednesday for ensuring that this has happened."
"There are a few adjustments needed, such as with the antidiscrimination clause and in one or two other areas."
"Maybe there will be a moment of generosity on Monday or Tuesday that will enable one or two of these questions to be improved even now."
"That could also include the right of Parliament to make changes to treaties, as Mr Schäfer mentioned a few moments ago."
"I think that the great pressure brought to bear by the European Parliament in recent years has achieved something with regard to the third point, and we are arriving at a better social equilibrium."
"The employment and social protocol is being incorporated."
"I hope that we will also obtain improved decision mechanisms in this area and greater cooperation, than has been the case in the past, including codecision procedures for example, if the previous strategy can be sustained."
"I also believe that we need an employment chapter offering genuine co-ordination of national employment policies."
"We do not need any new European powers - just co-ordination, because differing or even conflicting employment policies cancel each other out because of our interdependence in the Common Market."
"This is in everyone's interest."
"What matters here is not the new finance programmes - they are completely unimportant here, we might just as well use the Structural Funds."
"What matters is getting the mechanisms moving and getting employment moving."
"That is the starting point."
"Employment is a macroeconomic objective, together with others."
"This will also enable us to overcome the problems associated with the ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the Netherlands have adopted a logical position, a pragmatic, realistic and slightly idealistic one."
"Mr Van Mierlo speaks of a more dynamic, more effective Europe closer to the ordinary people, as well as a kitchen in which it is possible to prepare better dishes."
"But what is the interest of a well-equipped kitchen in which delicious dishes are prepared if the latter are served in a location which is in ruins."
"The Council continues to hold secret meetings behind closed doors in this inadequate building."
"No open doors, no democratic openness, Commissioners rushing about in confined spaces, while the President prepares his little dishes in the kitchen."
"Ordinary people want facts, work and security."
"According to the President, employment cannot be guaranteed by the Treaty."
"We shall probably see more anti-European feelings unless the dream of employment which you are inserting into the Treaty becomes a reality."
"As for security, the action taken in order to promote it is not clear."
"The Netherlands are taking measures which actually hamper security. Let us take the example of Prosecutor Van Der Voort who had all the proof on cocaine traffic from Surinam passing through the Netherlands."
"This is not a very encouraging case, Mr President."
"We should also mention the cases of drunken drivers or drivers who have committed speeding offences and who have escaped criminal proceedings because they forgot to convey to Brussels the technical provisions relating to this matter."
"Where is the security which the ordinary people have been promised?"
"The Dutch representatives in the European Union do not want bread and circuses or window-dressing but facts."
"Nevertheless Amsterdam is not lost and I am banking on a good Treaty."
"Madam President, I think that it is very clear that the separation of economic and monetary union from the intergovernmental conference cannot continue."
"Economic and monetary union must go ahead of course. But the IGC must restore the balances."
"It must restore the role of economic union, and also the role of some form of economic government vis-à-vis economic and monetary union."
"And therefore it must restore conditions of political democracy."
"No one is going to cede major decision-making rights to organizations without being sure that social, employment and environmental policies can be implemented in the Union."
"This will depend, of course, on the political complexion of our future leadership."
"But in all circumstances the politicians and citizens must regain their role and their say in things."
"We cannot surrender these things to an organization like the Central Bank and allow it to operate in a vacuum and carry out experiments free of responsibility."
"Madam President, the grand speeches which were made before the text of the proposal was written, that the Treaty would include a programme of reform as the basis of a new Europe, of the future, and that this would help people overcome their scepticism of the EU, were, in my view, totally wrong."
"It is clear from the proposal that the emphasis definitely has not been placed where it was said it would be placed, on democracy, openness, social security and sustainable development."
"Furthermore - and this is the most important point - preparations for admitting the new members have been postponed to a later date I think that the proposal will serve rather to complicate enlargement and in so doing will create a permanent division in Europe, which is a great disappointment."
"We have also heard Mr Van Mierlo commend the IGC for achieving democracy and openness and meeting the demands of the people through the chapter on employment but unfortunately this is just a cosmetic solution."
"The people themselves will soon realise that the soup which they are being served from the EU soup kitchen is very, very thin."
"Let me give some examples: The achievements with regard to the demands for openness, transparency and the principle of publication are unacceptable."
"First, people are given the right of access to all documents but then this right is withdrawn because the Council of Ministers has the right to restrict such access."
"Each institution is also able to determine their own rules on openness."
"What does this mean?"
"If you add to this the EU's Archive Regulation, it is easy to see that there will be nothing left of this openness."
"It will be just fine words and faint hopes."
"The same applies to the environmental guarantee which, having been defined in more detail, appears to have been improved."
"But a Member State wishing to maintain or introduce tighter environmental requirements must notify their reasons to the Commission who can then reject these on the grounds that they form a barrier to trade."
"We might just as well delete the issues of sustainable development and environmental improvements."
"I am, above all, obliged to the President-in-Office of the Council for having succeeded in a very difficult period in finding the time to justify himself because I think that this is the only place where he could do so."
"Several points."
"Concerning the IGC, kitchens and a citizens' Europe."
"Perhaps ordinary people are not interested in the building of the kitchen but nonetheless would like to know whether the new Europe is going to become closer to them."
"It can also be asked how that kitchen functions and if there are head cooks to make it work, a particularly relevant question."
"No doubt the process has been started but we still want to know the outcome."
"Perhaps, therefore, we should not make immediate judgment."
"Secondly."
"I think we all agree that the IGC must make enlargement possible."
"We must avoid Ioannina-type situations - which then was relatively simple - and we must make sure that enlargement will enable us to progress rather than retreat."
"I think that we can still give our approval to the German Secretary of State, Mr Hoyer, who declared here, in the institutional committee, that the draft Treaty will not enable us to have enlargement, for the time being."
"I am also of the opinion that we must not expect the situation to be simplified during the negotiations on enlargement."
"There is, therefore, a major problem which might not be resolved in Amsterdam and that is why, despite the declarations made by Mr Van Mierlo, I am still wondering about the way in which to react to this situation."
"Thirdly: democratization."
"I admit that, in terms of the European Parliament, considerable progress has been made in the texts."
"But there are still risks of regression."
"However, I am particularly interested in the overall situation of parliamentary democracy in respect of the draft Treaty."
"In my view, there are still considerable risks that national parliaments will lose ground and that this will not be compensated by any ground gained at European level."
"Finally, I should like to talk about the IGC system."
"I think that this long-term negotiation has shown that this system could not function within this great Community, which is increasingly resembling a sort of Von Münchhausen strategy aimed at getting the Community out of a tight squeeze."
"Is it not possible to think up a new system?"
"Mr President, the draft treaty that we have before us has aroused in many of us mixed feelings of hope and fear."
"Hope because the limited progress which has been made in the meantime will somewhat improve the former Treaty."
"But also fear because some aspects are doomed to failure and we are probably going to end up with a failed Treaty, just before opening up negotiations with future Member States in central and eastern Europe."
"As far as the limited progress is concerned I will be brief."
"This progress is not negligible but nor is it really significant."
"However, we welcome the fact that employment and the environment have been taken into consideration to a greater extent and that progress has also been made in the fight against international crime, that decision-making procedures have been simplified and that the European Parliament will have more clout in terms of legislation."
"But we are especially concerned about what has not been achieved."
"I am particularly referring to the openness of administration, the democratic nature of the European Union, foreign policy and the weighting of votes."
"As far as opening up administration is concerned it would be positive if, in the future, documents on Union legislation were made available earlier."
"That is important for the public, for national parliaments and for us."
"What is regrettable is the absence of any prospects of opening up the Council of Ministers."
"It also means that, when the Council acts as legislator, it continues to make laws in camera."
"In fact, this behaviour is an attack on parliamentary democracy and I think it is inadmissible - the Council of Ministers should put an end to this practice."
"We must also note that, in other areas too, some points of which Mr Dankert has just mentioned, this parliamentary democracy is ailing."
"When I see, in the file on internal security and the file on foreign policy, that national parliaments are losing powers which are not being transferred to the European Parliament, I ask myself if we are not actually going backwards."
"If we cannot manage the budget problem or the budget as a whole - it is not always the case for 50 billion ECU - we still cannot say that we have filled in the democratic vacuum."
"This is one of my main concerns and I know that Mr Van Mierlo has good intentions on this."
"What I would ask you is to fight in order to achieve this aim."
"We really cannot undermine parliamentary democracy at European level!"
"I would just like a few more moments in order to look at the problem of the weighting of votes."
"I have noted in the proposals that the sum total of the points for big countries is larger than that of small countries."
"I think that it should be emphasized that the Netherlands do not do too badly."
"However, I wonder whether this might not be a weak spot if referendums are held and when the new Treaty comes to be debated by the national parliaments."
"I think that the compromise adopted in the days of Ioannina was an excellent one and I wonder whether it might not be wise to retain the same ratio in the framework of the new weighting of votes."
"In other words, we have made progress on a certain number of points but not all of them."
"I wish the Dutch Presidency a great deal of strength, wisdom and a dose of good luck."
"Madam President, the new draft treaty, despite its imperfections, contains many novelties."
"I think that the negotiations have taken new demands into account."
"What can we therefore do at this stage of the debate?"
"At most, we could give it a few little boosts in the closing days of the negotiations, because they would make it easier for the public to accept the new provisions."
"I give three examples."
"The first, is the chapter on employment."
"That is the subject that concerns everyone."
"People are ready to demonstrate in the street."
"It is therefore a good thing for employment policy to be mentioned in the treaty."
"However, if we do not specify the practical means, in terms of economic policy, that Europe is to give itself to contribute to an employment policy, the chapter will be more disappointing than rewarding."
"We should therefore welcome the Commission's insistence, under President Santer, and that of the French and other Governments, to ensure that this aspect of the growth and stability pact goes through."
"Second example: public service."
"The new Article 7D is still fairly vague."
"There too, the expectations not only of public service workers but also their users are great."
"We should not go on dismantling the public service while spouting fine words about their social value."
"It should be made more specific, as the European Parliament demands."
"Third example: the serious crisis due to the mad cow disease still worries us."
"I have just left a meeting - that is why I was not here before and I apologize - with Commissioner Oreja, on the institutional provisions concerning the veterinary field and public health."
"This crisis could, unless the Commission and the Council take stiff action, lead to a major institutional crisis."
"There too we want more precise and more practical proposals."
"Madam President, Mr van Mierlo has given us the picture that is emerging as the IGC nears the end of its life, five days before the summit in Amsterdam, and he has mentioned the endeavours of the Dutch Presidency."
"It would be amiss of us not to acknowledge them."
"However, we are not engaged in a race, for which endeavour alone can suffice."
"We are engaged in politics in which the thing that counts most is the outcome, and the best scenario of the Amsterdam outcome is a modest common denominator if some compromise can be reached in advance with the French Socialists who promised much before the election and are now having to face up to the reality of their pledges."
"That is yet another reason why we ourselves should measure our words carefully."
"As the citizens of Europe struggle for employment, security and peace the challenges are truly historic."
"Unfortunately, Mr President-in-Office, there is a severe lack of political will to rise to those challenges, and as we hasten to prepare Europe for the twenty-first century we are just running on the spot with new and half-complete compromises."
"There is a very good case now for the new title on employment."
"It will certainly be useful."
"However, we should not engender in our fellow citizens the false belief that provisions of that sort suffice for combating the scourge of unemployment."
"Big policies are required for that, and we seem incapable of getting to grips with and implementing such policies."
"We should be careful in particular about the question of institutional balance. It must not be thrown overboard at the last minute to the disadvantage of the smaller countries."
"The European Union is made up of equal Member States. If that equality is not retained at Amsterdam our peoples will be very disillusioned."
"We look forward to economic and monetary union, which is a truly revolutionary development."
"Its path must not be blocked at Amsterdam."
"As Chairman Martens has said, we have already lost 10 years."
"Let us make sure, Madam President, that we do not lose any more."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, surely there is still a rather serious void in the draft treaty of 30 May."
"All the European balances which are being drawn up will be no use, and a new equilibrium between monetary union and economic and social union cannot be established, without that profound institutional transformation which is needed and which was, moreover, in the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would like to underline two points."
"The first has already been stressed by others: it is the enlargement, the core of the Intergovernmental Conference's mandate."
"The President of the Santer Commission has said that if we do not prepare properly for the enlargement we may be heading for a rather negative situation."
"Well, I ask the President-in-Office this: what has actually been done about it, and what hope is there that something can still be done?"
"I noticed that the subject of qualified majority was not even mentioned in the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, except for the CFSP where it is substantially an illusory issue."
"We all know that the decision about the Commission has been put off, but it is obviously essential to move forward on these matters with a view to the enlargement."
"The other point is the issue of democracy, Mr Dankert has already spoken on this."
"We appreciate more co-decision, but we also wonder whether this will be co-decision on the new policies."
"The whole question of the third pillar and the move from the third to the first pillar simply must not take concrete form in a weakening of the Community pillar, because this would definitely be regression rather than progress."
"If you will allow me, Mr President, I would like to make a final point about article 113."
"It is true that article 113 has increased the powers of the Community, but at the same time it has reduced the powers of Parliament, and reducing the powers of Parliament in this respect strikes us as rather dangerous."
"Madam President, three years ago almost to the day, on 12 June 1994, we held a referendum in Austria on our country's accession to the European Union."
"Not all our citizens were satisfied with all the details at the time, and indeed not all our citizens were even told about all the details of that accession."
"Even so, the citizens voted 'yes' in principle to the European project, and did so in the awareness that no ready-made, communal Europe exists as yet and that we would all have to continue working to advance the progress of deeper and wider European union."
"Today, new and important decisions about the future are being made."
"They are a challenge to us all."
"For some time now, and indeed for some time to come, our whole political system, our citizens and politicians, have been and will be confronted with the challenge of taking another important step towards Europe by the introduction of the single European currency."
"So let us ensure that our economic policy, too, is in line with this stability pact!"
"Today, it is up to the European Parliament to make its contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"After the weekend, the Heads of State and Government will be called upon to put the successful finishing touches to the work they have done so far."
"The results achieved hitherto are far from valueless."
"Some things have been achieved."
"Some things remain to be done."
"Let us all rise to this challenge!"
"Let us bring greater depth and breadth to Europe, to enable us to meet our citizens' expectations."
"The question which Elmar Brok wanted to put to the President-in-Office was as follows: if Amsterdam really is not sufficient to allow full expansion by another eleven States, will there at least be a new Article N as a result of this Intergovernmental Conference?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Netherlands Presidency on its constructive work."
"I note, however, that Intergovernmental Conferences are taking ever longer to decide ever less, proving that a long time spent cooking does not guarantee a good meal."
"That is perhaps one of the reasons why, in the course of this IGC three governments have already fallen, even though they were achieving good results in the economic field."
"It might be symptomatic that this is the first time that Europe and the single currency have been the main issue in national elections."
"Such facts demonstrate that the first responsibility of today's leaders is to find a way out for this new European question facing new historical challenges which cannot be solved with the methods of yesteryear."
"In particular, making enlargement a viable proposition, setting the single currency on a legal and stable basis, negotiating about globalization on an equal footing with the major powers such as America."
"The progress already made in the Intergovernmental Conference meets these objectives."
"Perhaps we are moving in the right direction but it falls short of the historic feeling that there would be political and pan-European union on the eve of the turn of the century."
"It is even feared that the draft treaty already presented by the Netherlands Presidency will make things even more complicated instead of strengthening fresh coherence."
"Finally, we cannot have a Europe which is united monetarily and economically yet divided in all other spheres, in particular on internal and external security, on which economic confidence itself depends in the first place."
"It is interesting to note that the greater the insistence on unanimity the greater the openness to flexibility either in fact or directly."
"The more we refuse to democratize the institutions the greater the threat to social and political cohesion."
"A lot of time spent cooking again, but a lousy meal."
"It does not seem to be far from Maastricht to Amsterdam."
"I hope, however, it will be understood that this road spans a century and a new chapter of history."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make two requests for the Council and the Commission to take with them as they leave for Amsterdam."
"The present draft Treaty provides for a step backward in terms of freedom of movement."
"It no longer refers to freedom of movement but only to free movement of individuals, and that in turn is further differentiated into free movement of individuals for Union citizens and for third country nationals - in other words, people who are living among us permanently but do not have naturalized status."
"If what we fear does come to pass, and a distinction is made between Union citizens who enjoy freedom of movement and third country nationals who are legally resident here but have restricted freedom of movement, then we shall be in danger of re-creating a two-class structure within the European Union in the area of civil rights, which is a dangerous business."
"I therefore ask that the Conference should not lose sight of the approach adopted in the previous treaty and should ensure the implementation of that freedom of movement which was, in fact, guaranteed in the previous Treaty of 1 January 1993."
"My second point is this: visa policy, customs policy, customs co-operation, asylum policy and immigration are to be communitized without full powers being given to the European Parliament, but if powers are withdrawn from the national parliaments the result is a democracy-free zone in central areas of civil rights within the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please do prevent this, because it really would be a tragedy."
"Madam President, I would never venture to criticize your handling of these proceedings, but I would like to make one comment."
"This Parliament, too, has to undergo reform in connection with the revision of the Maastricht Treaty and the debate on revision."
"If, as I hope, this Parliament is really to acquire additional powers, then this Parliament must change its way of working."
"It cannot be right that men like Mr Brok, who represented this Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference for more than two years, and Mr Dankert as a former president of Parliament are not allowed to finish what they have to say and are cut off on the pretext that we have to begin our midday voting orgy at 12 noon."
"I simply cannot accept that."
"We should be able to conduct a debate like this flexibly!"
"Thank you, Mr Schulz, for giving me the opportunity to explain myself."
"I cannot do any colleague a favour on this."
"There were 42 speakers on the list and if each speaker spoke only for an extra thirty seconds, the debate would not finish until 12.30."
"Work it out for yourselves. The Chair could not take that responsibility."
"You all know me and whenever we have the time I let you have as much time as you need to speak. In this case it was not possible and to make an exception even for Mr Brok would not have been justified, to be frank."
"We would have liked to have more time for this debate - starting with myself."
"I now give the floor to Mr Bourlanges."
"I think you have understood that you have two minutes and no more."
"That is how it is."
"Madam President, I want to address the section on the CFSP."
"The presidency will be surprised to hear me say that I recognize the difficulties it has in this most sensitive area of national sovereignty."
"It is caught between those like me who believe we should learn to walk before we run and those who believe that we should be thrown in the deep end and either sink or swim."
"I, therefore, wish to pay tribute to the efforts of the Dutch presidency to try to get agreement in this section."
"Let me come straight to my most important point: my Group attaches great importance to the interinstitutional agreement on financing the CFSP."
"We want to see that cemented in the Treaty at Amsterdam."
"If it is not, I suspect that my Group will find it very difficult to support the conclusions of the Amsterdam Summit."
"I hope the presidency can take that message to any Member States which have doubts about that area."
"On the other aspects, there are many positive areas in the CFSP: the Petersberg tasks, the new arrangements for the Troika, the policy and planning unit - all provide us with an opportunity for greater coherence."
"Positive abstention and the greatest scope for qualified majority voting will lead the way to the development of the CFSP, although, of course, the section on qualified majority voting is really no more than a slightly more ambitious version of what we already have in the Maastricht Treaty and, ultimately, will depend on political will to see it carried out."
"Reservations are clearly that Parliament has almost no role in CFSP."
"There is no provision for the Council to respond formally to our recommendations and, while the Commission can make recommendations to the policy and planning unit, Parliament cannot."
"I would like to see Parliament be able to engage more fully."
"On the WEU: clearly, we still have to work on that relationship."
"We do not have a single Treaty, we are cooking a pig's ear."
"Let us hope that afterwards we can turn the pig's ear into a silk purse."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of European Union, I think the institutional question can be summarised as the mother of all questions."
"Perhaps the more complex points and sophisticated details of this may escape the grasp of public opinion, but like the governments, which must guide the people towards ever higher and more ordered development, we too, who are elected to represent those people, understand it very well and we cannot pretend that we do not."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, certainly the product counts and there is no doubt that how the European Union functions does not matter so much to people as seeing their own lives improve with the progress of the European Union, in terms of own welfare, personal and collective security, the opportunity to work, social security, the extension of freedom, of expression, of movement, of initiative and so on."
"Here I too find it positive that there is unanimous consensus about including the social protocol and new provisions on employment in the treaty."
"Perhaps this will make it possible to relaunch, in a different institutional context and with a different perspective, the stability pact which President Santer proposed in Florence, but without finding the consensus he was hoping for."
"But in a Europe where overall growth is slower than forecast and than was hoped, and which is not yet succeeding in fighting unemployment effectively, even at national level, this is an important turning point."
"Yet we know that without real European democracy, without transparent and simplified decision-making processes, without an improvement in the procedures and methods of the Community institutions to put them in a position to neutralize what has been very effectively defined as the renationalization of minds, the Europe we want will not come into being."
"Madam President, two matters that are of central importance and great sensitivity for Europe's citizens have been dealt with completely inadequately in the present draft Treaty. One is the new so-called nondiscrimination article, and the other is the future legal procedure on asylum, foreigners and immigration."
"The non-discrimination article is worded in such a way that it only takes effect if the Council unanimously takes the appropriate precautions."
"The European Parliament has only a right to be consulted."
"That means this article is virtually ineffective."
"But the democratic process does appear to have been abandoned in other areas, too - those areas which are now being transposed from the third pillar to the first."
"The national parliaments are being cut out, but they are not being replaced by the European Parliament."
"This is a denial of democracy, and we will alert our colleagues in the national parliaments to that fact."
"It is important, though, for minimum standards to be safeguarded not only in respect of democracy but also in respect of the rule of law, and that includes ensuring that the European Court of Justice has full jurisdiction in the areas in question."
"However, there is one positive point I should make: the new provisions, especially in Article 119 on equality for women, are much better regulated in the present draft Treaty than they were in the Dutch presidency's first draft."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if I may I should like to comment on two essential points: the stability pact and Professor Monti's action programme."
"First, the stability pact."
"You will recall that the stability pact was the subject of very intensive negotiations between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"I must say to President Santer and the President-in-Office that we had an exceptionally fruitful dialogue on this matter."
"Parliament has proposed a few amendments, and I would like to recall the most important points that were made by Parliament."
"The first is that we believe that the so-called golden rule whereby investment must be higher than new net indebtedness should be taken into account in the structuring of the stability pact."
"This rule is already enshrined in the constitutions of some Member States, whereas in others that is not yet the case."
"Those Member States whose constitutions include this rule are currently experiencing certain difficulties with it, which shows that it is a strict rule."
"I believe that it will be valuable for this rule to be incorporated into the stability pact."
"I should also welcome it if this rule were to be phased in to the constitutions of the Member States, because this would not only comply with the principle of subsidiarity but also offer an additional guarantee that all Member States would pursue a course geared to stability."
"That is my first point, one demand made by Parliament, and I must say that the President-in-Office, Mr Zalm, basically took a very positive attitude to it."
"I should be very pleased if it were to be proved possible to achieve a result here."
"The second point, on which we are negotiating, is that we believe that money from fines that are paid must be treated in accordance with general principles of budgetary law, in other words it must go into the budget of the European Community."
"I know that the Finance Ministers are looking for some arrangement outside the budget."
"But, gentlemen, I have the impression that no legal basis has yet been found for this."
"I do not know whether the Council, in its search for the legal basis, has yet succeeded in finding a solution outside the European budget."
"We in this House are of the opinion that the solution must lie within the European Budget."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Budgets has again confirmed that very emphatically."
"As to how these monies are distributed, we can worry about that in due course."
"This is a question we can talk about."
"The European Parliament is ready to play its part in a process of creative thinking."
"People like Mr Christodoulou have been involved in the negotiations, and he has already distinguished himself as the inventor of the negative reserve."
"There is a need for creative thinking here."
"I should be very pleased if we could achieve a result."
"Madame Chairman, in the IGC document, employment is once again reduced to mere rhetoric, the social sector lacks method and democracy is hindered by bureaucracy."
"Under these conditions, the Union will not gain the confidence of the citizens."
"Enlargement on this basis will not be possible."
"The euro will not become a stable currency if it is built on mass unemployment and inequality."
"It is quite essential to obtain socio-economic supervision over the structurally inward-looking European Central Bank."
"The European institutions are important when each nation of the Union feels that it is represented."
"The Parliament, which unfortunately has little power, is for ordinary citizens the only representative body whose activities they can pubicly follow and identify with. This should be the case in the Commission too."
"If the small Member States are deprived of the opportunity to have their own Commissioner, the credibility of the EU will fall in the citizens' eyes. The Euro-icon will be removed."
"Tightening cooperation between the WEU and the EU is appropriate when seeking to improve the efficiency of the common foreign and security policy."
"However, the rapid unification of the WEU and NATO is not to the liking of the Finnish social democrats."
"Military neutrality and credible defence have a longer and from Finland's viewpoint just as successful history as military alliances."
"Now the attempt is being made to adapt the alliance to Nordic geopolitics, which under the current circumstances would create uncertainty in the latter."
"Madam President, on principle and for the sake of sexual equality, I shall make no reference to kitchen equipment, cooking utensils or meals - I leave that to the men."
"All thirty or so speakers so far have said much the same thing."
"Since we have no ratification power, you could say that after all you will not take it into account."
"I would say there are two reasons for taking it into account."
"The first is that we are very often in touch with the citizens and I think that what has been said here reflects what they want."
"They have had enough of a Europe that gives them the impression that their every day problems are not taken into account."
"The second reason is that, while we have no ratification powers for the IGC, we have to deliver our opinion on enlargement."
"Furthermore, national parliaments will also have to ratify the enlargements."
"Quite frankly, if the enlargements are not prepared in the right conditions, I am not sure that our public opinions will adhere to them."
"For these two reasons, I think that this final European Parliament should be very useful for you."
"We are profoundly attached to democracy and the powers of the European Parliament."
"If forty-two speakers are taking part in this debate, there is a good reason. I should like to say that we do not have enough legitimacy."
"Quiet frankly if, when I stand for reelection, the voters had the impression that I had a real legislative power and genuine influence on European decisions, I would not have asked to speak here today."
"I would be able to say that the European Parliament does represent something of importance for ordinary people."
"Madam President, the proposal is insufficient and does not meet the slightest expectations."
"We cannot keep on condemning to the hold-up of unanimity the fight against discrimination suffered by European women."
"As for the treatment of asylum among the Member States, in Spain it was said that Aznar had already achieved everything: that kind of bragging is soon cut down to size when we see the proposals and the texts."
"Now we can see the substance of the new French socialist government - good French cooking - which is a macho stew, yes it is macho, Mr President-in-Office."
"What hypocrisy to say that European women are being defended!"
"This is unacceptable: the texts condemn all these subjects to unanimity."
"This is disappointing and we can only hope that next week this text will be improved because otherwise the citizens of Europe are going to be extremely disappointed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this debate I should like to make it clear, on behalf of the French socialists, that we are attached to European construction, we want to see Amsterdam give it a new lease of life, and we hope that all of our efforts will make it possible to stick to the original timetables."
"It is absolutely vital to send a loud and clear signal to the people of Europe, indispensable to include a social chapter in the Treaty, indispensable to set an immediate priority for employment and against unemployment."
"It is also indispensable to strike a balance between monetary stability and economic growth."
"The Dutch Presidency - whom I thank - is making every effort and I hope that by the 16-17 June, we shall be able to overcome the final difficulties in order to be able to meet our people's expectations."
"I know and can tell you that the French Government will do all it can."
"One last word. I welcome inclusion of the public services in the Treaty while regretting nevertheless, at this stage, that they remain under the competition heading."
"A change there would be most welcome."
"I just hope that Amsterdam will succeed and replace in Europeans' hearts and minds the tarnished image of Maastricht."
"Madam President, allow me to use an expression from history: ' a spectre is rising over Europe' - the spectre of changing economic policy."
"In the new European era which began after the British and French elections what should the new economic policy be?"
"We say that it should have the following characteristics: it must retain the positive achievements of the policy that has been pursued up until now - because there have been achievements -, such as control of inflation and restoration of business profitability."
"At the same time, however, it must throw off the one-sidedness which has led us to the present levels of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion."
"For that to happen we need to abandon our idolatry of market omnipotence and to restore a balance between the market and state intervention."
"In the new era that is beginning state intervention cannot have as its objective the achievement of full employment via wasteful consumption or via the packing of the public sector with pointless jobs."
"We do not wish to make civil servants of the whole population; that is not our thinking."
"What we want to see is a new flowering of productivity, and that can only come through concern for the needs of working people and greater justice in the distribution of wealth."
"Madam President, it is clear that there will be a need to negotiate another treaty in the next five years."
"In fact, the text we have before us is just a pitiful cover for some of the inconsistencies and weaknesses in the Maastricht Treaty."
"The major problems still remain unsolved."
"There is not yet a political structure capable of controlling and directing the power of the future central bank: to say the European Council will take on that role is, in my opinion, the wrong answer."
"There is no real complementarity at Community level between economic policy and monetary policy, and one more declaration and one more protocol will not make the present construction any less lame."
"Despite statements to the contrary, we still do not have a real common foreign policy."
"The idea of entrusting power in this field to the Secretary General of the Council is not only an anti-democratic solution - at least the Secretary General of the United Nations answers to the General Assembly - but it is also unlikely to be effective."
"There is no real intention of reviewing the Union's powers."
"The protocol on subsidiarity looks like a fine catalogue of principles but, despite the commitments made, the Member States have not reviewed the rules on commitology, which means they will continue to be submerged every year by thousands of minute and detailed decisions."
"Could a solution be found to these problems?"
"Theoretically, yes, in reality the national diplomatic services, and even this Parliament, have never really believed it."
"I would like to close on a note of optimism: good news seems to be coming from social Europe, to judge from the demonstrations in progress in the last few days."
"Madam President, I would like to propose inviting the Managing Director of Renault to Amsterdam because, unlike this Parliament, he succeeded in getting the provisions of the social agreement into the treaty."
"Madam President, it would be helpful if the President of the Commission could listen to what I have to say."
"This is an extremely important time for the European Union."
"In the last couple of years the citizens of the European Union..."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like everyone to listen to the last speaker, Mr Alan John Donnelly, in the dignity of our Assembly, followed by the Council and Commission's answers."
"I would also suggest to the Conference of Presidents that they look into the possibility of allowing more time in future for debates of such importance."
"I know how unpleasant it has been for you to be cut off and it has been no less unpleasant for the Chair to do so."
"(Applause) Please return to your seats and listen to Mr Donnelly, the Council and the Commission without talking among yourselves."
"Madam President, we all welcome that statement and hopefully the Conference of Presidents will address this matter."
"The citizens of the European Union clearly feel that Europe has moved away from them in recent years."
"Therefore the IGC in Amsterdam is absolutely crucial so that we can return to the sort of agenda that people understand."
"That is why I say to the Council that the chapter in the Treaty that deals with employment policy must not be a cosmetic chapter."
"It must deal in detail with the sort of instruments the Commission and the Council will use to tackle the unacceptable levels of unemployment in the European Union."
"Linked to that we have to ensure that if there is to be a pact for growth and stability, like Mr Caudron said, it must be a balanced pact containing elements for stability but, more important, elements for growth."
"Having passed through the Amsterdam summit meeting we then need to have the Council instruct the Commission to come forward with measures that activate the policies that would be available to bring down the levels of unemployment."
"This House is desperately disappointed that nothing has happened since the Essen Summit meeting to tackle the problems of unemployment and while Mr Santer said we should do less better, the one thing we cannot renege upon are measures that will bring down the levels of unemployment."
"I would urge the Council to instruct the Commission at Amsterdam, once we have the chapter on employment and once we have a pact that balances stability with growth, to come forward with a new model of development that ensures that we can tackle the unemployment problem and social exclusion and to try to help make this a Europe worthy of our citizens."
"Madam President, thank you for the generosity with which you are directing this meeting and the place that you have granted me in it."
"Nonetheless, I am aware of my duty of discretion after this debate."
"I also know what your agenda is."
"I am very grateful for the European Parliament's support for two reasons."
"First of all, because the statements by one member of your Parliament, Mrs Dury, I think, are quite right: the European Parliament is close to the ordinary people."
"It could grow even closer to the ordinary people but its members are still often far closer to them than members of the Council of Ministers."
"That is why I paid particular attention to what has been said here."
"Unfortunately, it is not possible for me to give everyone a reply because of the time that we have available."
"But it is not really necessary."
"I have told you what I wanted to tell you and you have told me what was on your mind."
"I now come to the second reason for my gratefulness: the Presidency must say that we feel very much comforted by the European Parliament over various essential points such as extending codecision, extending the majority decisionmaking process, transferring the third pillar to the first, strengthening the role of the Court of Justice, the attention paid to fundamental rights, to employment and the environment, to mention just a few."
"You have mentioned them all."
"Of course, the European Parliament wants more."
"I myself have been a member of parliament for 30 years and it is precisely the role of the European Parliament to demonstrate a certain professional dissatisfaction vis-à-vis the progress made in the process of forming Europe."
"Thank God, you have the magnanimity to recognize that progress has been made but you must also be dissatisfied because we are in a process of integration and we need the European Parliament's pressure in order to bring down the difficult frontiers which separate the Member States, of which today I have the honour of being President - but I am sometimes fenced in by existing frontiers."
"Communitarization has to be achieved gradually by challenging the history of our states and that is a task in which the European Parliament plays a vital role, not only today."
"I must also mention the role of your President and your two delegates who have followed the process almost constantly and who have been of precious help to us during the debates."
"I shall therefore just make a few general remarks."
"If we reach an agreement in Amsterdam - and once again the situation does not seem so bad - it is possible that the results will not match our expectations as someone has already emphasized."
"But I would say, at once, that it will be more than expected."
"Less than hoped for but more than expected."
"When we met six months ago the European Parliament's tone was far more negative in terms of the expectations. I listened to you with humility as becomes an interim director, but nonetheless it was a relatively negative image that I was presented with."
"Now hearing you today I felt relieved at hearing such encouraging attitudes and seeing that you support so many aspects of the proposals that are being made."
"You have all tackled a number of points."
"I am going to refer to the EMU situation."
"I can perhaps once again repeat that the emphasis of EMU has really been placed on the monetary aspect but it is obvious - and I should like once again to recall this - that, when we opened the debate on employment, two years ago, more than half the Member States thought it was ridiculous that Europe should even consider pursuing a genuine employment policy."
"That is how we started out. We have made considerable progress even though we have not yet reached a consensus; this is also, of course, explained by the terrible unemployment statistics in Europe which now show us that we have no alternative."
"The question is obviously one of determining the degree of feasibility of a European employment policy."
"It would be a serious mistake to think that the European Community is responsible for the high level of unemployment in Europe."
"Let us not forget that it is, above all, the duty of the States to tackle the problem of employment but that the Community can help."
"I should again like to add that, if we are disappointed by Europe, we should remember that the current European crisis is in many respects the sum total of all of the crises in the Member States themselves."
"Here the term 'crisis' means the ability to resolve one's own problems and I am not referring to all of the problems which cross our frontiers."
"Because western European democracies have a problem of authority."
"The process of forming Europe based on 'give and take' requires a great authority within nations. This authority is rightly controversial in all our countries and is not wielded in a very obvious way but it is has to be conquered from the public."
"That is the problem that we are currently facing in preparing the Summit and we are trying to make progress on this."
"The French elections placed EMU on the agenda."
"Again I would like to emphasize that the French are not the only ones asking for measures to be taken in terms of employment but I think that this demand is now being made on all sides."
"In recent days, during my tour of Europe together with Prime Minister Wim Kok I noticed that many other Member States thought it would be good to put more emphasis on employment aspects."
"That is why yesterday we agreed with the French government and the President of France that EMU measures, and in particular the stability pact, should not be withdrawn - otherwise we would just be messing around and lead to a very confused situation."
"But, even if France did not do so, other countries would ask for the same."
"Nonetheless we have to add a counterweight to employment in the measures which means that it should not be regarded as an isolated fact but as a measure which is linked to the stability pact."
"Everyone agrees with this, as far as intentions are concerned, and I hope that this is going to make it possible to complete all of the regulations, even if they do not have to be defined in Amsterdam - we have another six months to do this."
"If the process is successful that will be very important psychologically."
"If it is not, then we still cannot say that the Summit is a disaster because we still have six months to play with."
"But it is worth fighting and so far I have noticed that everyone is ready to do just that."
"I should also like to mention transparency which is a major point for all of you."
"Everyone will have access to the documents in accordance with the rules worked out by the Council and the European Parliament. The European Parliament plays a key role in the application of transparency."
"We would have appreciated more openness in Council meetings. But we were unable to reach a consensus on this subject."
"Nonetheless the outcome of the votes, the reasons for votes and other declarations will be made public. Mentioning these two points I note that a certain progress has been made in terms of transparency."
"From time to time, the debate has had a culinary flavour because I used the image of kitchens."
"Using images is not inoffensive: images plague us sometimes or come back to haunt us, so that we can even end up wondering why on earth we said this or that."
"Mrs Roth declares that all citizens want to cook."
"That may be a profound desire but I do not think that the food will be any the better for it."
"I understand what Mrs Roth wanted to say and I agree when she said that the citizens want to understand how the Community in which they live actually works."
"I hope that we are going to be able to make a contribution to that which perhaps does not meet all of their expectations but nonetheless we are making progress towards that."
"A final remark on democracy, which has often been mentioned here."
"I have already said that I think a certain amount of progress has been made and a good many of you recognized that in your speeches."
"This is a process that can only make gradual progress."
"It is a fact that, in terms of strengthening the Union's powers, the general thrust has been one of codecision, which is more democratic."
"When the European Parliament's powers are not genuinely strengthened, there is nevertheless a relationship with national parliaments - I aim my remarks at Mr Dankert."
"Then a lady said that the second pillar and the majority decision process do not come before the European Parliament."
"But in the second pillar there is still the possibility of using the right of veto both in the European Council and the General Council, and failure to use the vote of veto may be submitted to Parliamentary criticism and debate."
"In other words, there really is Parliamentary control over this."
"Whereas the third pillar is inclining towards the first, with asylum, immigration and visas, a transitional situation provides initially for national parliaments and consensus - and then a drift towards the European Parliament, in the second period, during which decisions are taken on the subject by means of a majority decision process."
"In my view, it is more of a transfer of control than a reduction of it."
"Mr President, I could go on for another half an hour if you wanted me to, but I know that you have other interests."
"I therefore propose stopping here."
"Thank you very much, Mr van Mierlo."
"You have well interpreted our interest."
"I give the floor to Mr Santer."
"Thank you very much, Mr Santer."
"I have received nine motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"VOTES"
"Amendment 47 is listed both in our voting list and in the Swedish translation as an amendment proposal to point 4 c and not to point 1 which we are now discussing."
"I apologise, and I ask the President to repeat the vote on this point or to check where the PPE group thinks that the proposal is to be found."
"Mrs Thors, there was indeed a mistake in the heading of the amendment, but the vote did take place in accordance with the corresponding text."
"Once the vote has taken place, the result cannot be changed."
"Mr President, please excuse me, but I do think it would be better if we followed the order of the amendments."
"Amendment No 47 that you have just called a vote on refers not to Recital C but to Paragraph 4(c), if I have seen the texts properly."
"Nobody seems to be following and it does not even seem to be of any importance to our colleagues."
"Since the vote has taken place, but obviously not at the right time, perhaps you could have another vote?"
"Mr fabre-Aubrespy, I am sorry but it was very carefully checked that this amendment did not refer to the paragraph in the heading but another amendment."
"That is why we voted on the text to which that amendment referred."
"Mr President, as the author of this amendment, along with Mr Anastassopoulos and Mr Lucas Pires, I believe that there has been some confusion in the Chamber due to the fact that, in principle, our services had us vote on this amendment in respect of Paragraph 4(c)."
"Although the mistake was rectified, it seems that various Groups were not informed."
"In my opinion we should therefore vote again on this subject."
"I think that is pure common sense."
"Mr President, there was confusion."
"I accept that because I had it out of order in my voting list, but we did find it and we did vote according to the way certainly my group wanted to vote."
"I do not think we need another vote."
"We found it in time thanks to you just giving us a few seconds to do that."
"As Mrs Green has just declared, this was no confusion."
"The vote was held on the amendment in question without the authors expressing the slightest objection at the time. Once the vote has taken place, the result cannot be changed."
"On amendment No 50"
"Mr President, we now come to paragraph 8."
"It contains an important demand of the European Parliament, i.e. the demand to have a common electoral system in time for the European elections."
"Amendment No 50 by the Socialist Group seeks to weaken our call for a common electoral system."
"I would point out to the House that yesterday, in the House of Commons, the new British Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook, had this to say: ' It is our wish and intention to introduce a new electoral system based on lists and proportional representation for the next European elections.' ."
"(Applause ) In view of this important change on the part of the British Government, will the Socialist Group agree to withdraw Amendment No 50 so that we can adopt paragraph 8 undiluted?"
"(Loud Applause )"
"Mr President, I think Mr de Vries ought to understand exactly why the Socialist Group has tabled this amendment."
"Every member of the British Labour Party in this House is aware of the policy of the Labour Party."
"That is not a problem for us."
"It may be a problem for the British Conservatives but not for us."
"We are very happy with that position."
"I have to tell you that the reason we tabled this proposal is because the word 'essential' , in the view of the whole group, means that if these items are not covered in the Treaty, we should not be supporting the Treaty."
"We wish to be a little more equivocal about that and it is the position Mr de Vries has always accepted, not to threaten."
"Mr President, in the House of Commons the day before Mr Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, and therefore responsible for electoral rules, said that there was no manifesto commitment to introduce PR or the regional list system by the 1999 European elections."
"So, with Labour you can take your pick."
"Good."
"Now you all know what goes on in the House of Commons."
"But this is the European Parliament and we must now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I am concerned that the leader of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in this House sought to misrepresent the position of the British Government during that debate."
"The Foreign Secretary did not say that we will be having proportional representation in time for the 1999 elections, he said: ' It is our wish and intention to introduce a new electoral system, based on the list and proportional representation for the next European elections.'"
"However, he said: ' I said at the time that the timetable is very tight and we will be examining whether this is possible."
"We have certainly not ruled it out.'"
"So you ought to be clear about what the Foreign Secretary said."
"Mr Titley, that is not a point of order: it is a point of order inside your political group and not a point of order for the House."
"The European Parliament must give its opinion, today, at second reading, on the common position on the eighth directive on summer-time."
"It is an important act for our fellow citizens, proof of practical construction of a Europe of citizens."
"For my part, two points must be tackled: application of the subsidiarity principle and the implication of changing the clocks."
"The declared aim of this eighth directive is to harmonize the period of the application of summer-time. I subscribe to that."
"But it is also to assess time differences between the Member States. That is where the subsidiarity principle comes into its own."
"The Council and the Commission must abide by it and let the Member States decide whether they should change the clocks in their countries."
"I come to the second point: the implication of changing the clocks."
"As elected representatives of European Parliament citizens, we are sent petitions, remarks, comments and suggestions on whether it is wise to change the clocks."
"To assess the wisdom of this measure, in particular in the perspective of enlargement of the European Union eastward, to be accompanied by an enlargement of time zones, it is urgent to draft a detailed report, in consultation with all the interested parties."
"All aspects must be fully analysed in the light of experience."
"I think that before we impose any obligation, we ought to listen, we ought to look into the pros and cons."
"Until then, let us just harmonize the dates of the beginning and end of summer-time."
"We are examining the Belleré report on summer-time at second reading."
"I wish to recall some of essential elements: until now the Commission has always presented application of summer-time as the free choice of each Member State, a perfect application of the subsidiarity principle."
"Yet the latest developments of the debate on summer-time, launched recently by the last French Government, seem to indicate that the Commission is no longer content with indicating the dates and times for the switch to summer-time, but also is judging whether or not it should be applied to the whole of the Union."
"The Commission advances as an argument the difficulty of envisaging a single market where time would vary from State to State."
"Yet Britain, Ireland and Portugal would not accept that argument."
"Since today the Commission tell us that the European Union must have a single time and that numerous expert reports have shown that the advantages of the switch to summer-time are marginal and the disadvantages substantial, I call on the Commission and the Council to think about simply abolishing summer-time in the European Union completely."
"Read report (A4-0171/97)"
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of the Read report today."
"Securing access for citizens to high-quality telecommunications services at reasonable prices is of crucial importance to us."
"We are, however, concerned over how Article 7(2) of the Directive, the wording of which is not unambiguous, will be interpreted."
"If established telecommunications providers can be said to have 'significant market power' , according to Article 7(2), they are subject to a number of restrictions and obligations which will create easier access to the market for potential operators."
"In Denmark a number of established telecommunications companies can be said to have 'significant market power' , if we regard the fixed network and the mobile network as separate markets."
"If, on the other hand, we regard the networks as a combined market, the companies cannot be said to have 'significant market power' and will therefore not be subject to these restrictions and obligations, which might have helped to break up monopoly positions on the telecommunications market."
"It is thus important that Article 7(2) be interpreted in such a way that fixed networks and mobile networks are regarded as separate markets."
"I am happy to support my British Labour colleague Mel Read's call to approve this conciliation agreement with the Council of Ministers."
"Whilst we should all look forward to the personal and business benefits which a more liberal telecommunications market will bring, we must be careful to guarantee consumers' interests."
"Ensuring that a universal service is available to all our citizens and giving them the chance to take their number with them to a new address are practical benefits to the public."
"After all, the potentially great profits to be made by telecoms companies will be financed by consumers paying their bills."
"Similarly, the idea that large telecoms firms should not be able to abuse a monopoly position is crucial."
"In return for allowing firms to compete in the new market, it is right that they should meet their responsibilities to their paying customers."
"It is nice to see the new British Labour Government's approach to markets and consumers gaining acceptance at EU level, another sign of the potential for constructive British involvement in the EU."
"European Council"
"Point 4 c of the Amsterdam resolution was passed relatively quickly."
"It was fortunate that it was passed, but we must gain a broader understanding of what is involved, both here in Parliament and elsewhere."
"The most important thing that the Union can do to create a solid, durable policy for more new jobs is to introduce measures which will increase competitiveness."
"We are talking about deregulation and increased flexibility on the labour market."
"Measures which harm the investment climate in the Member States would be devastating."
"Europe must prove itself strong at a global level and must do away with out of date and obsolete policies."
"There has recently been an election in Great Britain based on this issue."
"Flexible regulations for the labour market were discussed at the time."
"Now it is up to us to fulfil them at a European level."
"There is a need for strong, joint measures, increased competitiveness and deregulation along with national measures to increase flexibility on the labour market."
"The Intergovernmental Conference has demonstrated that the EU majority is not interested in real every day issues - the EU ideologues are more interested in turning the EU into an instrument of power politics."
"There may, of course, be some elegant words on equality, employment, sustainable development and openness."
"But elegant words are all there is, nothing more."
"There are to be no legally effective employment targets as a balance against EMU's financially restrictive requirements."
"The text of the environmental guarantee is insufficiently clear to be of use to a Member State wishing to impose tighter environmental standards than those established at EU level."
"The Commission will continue to be able to prevent those countries who wish to impose tougher standards from proceeding."
"Europol is to become an 'operational co-operation between police forces ' - not just an administrative co-operation between police authorities ."
"Police from Europol will also be able to operate on 'another Member State's territory' (and in so doing enjoy diplomatic immunity)."
"So, a big step has been taken towards a federal EU police force, an 'EU-FBI' ."
"The Schengen Agreement will be foisted on the EU, and the whole of this area of legal co-operation will be moved from the inter-state level to the supranational level."
"It will be the EU which will be making the decisions on everything connected with immigration, asylum, borders, passports and visas."
"At the request of Spain, a protocol has been incorporated which dictates that asylum cannot be granted to a citizen from another EU State."
"But is it not possible for a democracy to oppress certain groups?"
"Is it reasonable, and in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention, that all EU States undertake never to grant asylum to Basque, Irish or Corsican freedom fighters?"
"Is this regulation not the same as saying that the EU is a State?"
"The EU will 'strengthen and develop its mutual political solidarity' , in other words, it will speak with a common voice on matters of foreign policy."
"The EU will have a Foreign Minister who will be called the General Secretary and a Foreign Office which will be known as 'the unit for political planning and for early warning' ."
"It will definitely be no longer possible for the small states to speak out loudly in world politics in defence of human rights above the noise of the super powers and their commercial politics."
"The objective of the EU is now being fine tuned to a 'gradual development of a common defence policy with a view to the development of a common defence system' ."
"The Military alliance the 'WEU' shall 'gradually be integrated into the Union' , and EU States 'shall support the gradual development of a common defence policy through co-operation in the armament's sector' ."
"How is it possible for a country wishing to maintain a credible policy of neutrality to go along with this?"
"For a Swede this is unacceptable!"
"It is claimed that openness will increase with the new Treaty as all citizens will have the right to view all documents."
"But this right is then withdrawn because it will be up to each EU institution to determine which documents shall be available and to whom."
"As a log is not kept on incoming post it will be impossible to request a document - no one knows which documents exist."
"In respect of the above we wonder where the principle of subsidiarity and regard for the people of Europe have disappeared to."
"So, we will vote against the resolution as a whole and will urge the Swedish people not to ratify the results of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The resolution contains a number of proposals which increase the power of the EU to the detriment of national parliaments."
"There is EMU which will greatly centralise economic policy in the European Central Bank in Frankfurt under weak democratic control."
"There is the strengthened Common Foreign and Security Policy with its majority decision making and the integration of the WEU into the EU Treaty."
"There is the integration of the Schengen Agreement into the EU Treaty and the transfer of decisions concerning asylum, refugees and visa issues etc. from the Third to the First Pillar."
"Instead, more emphasis should have been placed on enlargement and the democratic process towards an all European co-operation, towards employment, a better environment and long term sustainable development."
"The relationship with our people would have been greatly eased if the changes had been directed more towards these areas."
"In view of this, I have voted against the resolution."
"Is this the last possible moment to persuade the European Council to be sensitive to the needs of Europe's citizens, or has that last possible moment already come and gone?"
"At a period when there are 18.5 million people unemployed in the European Union, the Member States must accept a common European responsibility to create more employment."
"We Christian Democrats, in particular, as supporters of the social market economy, cannot allow social progress to be impeded, any more than sustainable economic progress."
"One of the most essential elements of the Maastricht II Treaty, then, will be the employment chapter."
"It will only deserve that name if it consists neither of non-binding declarations nor of job creation programmes that would cost millions and are impossible to finance."
"It must point the way out of the Community-wide employment crisis, without changing the principle that the Member States retain the primary responsibility for combating unemployment and changing structures in the regions."
"The European Union provides a synergistic effect by co-ordinating measures by the Member States, allowing a regular and intensive exchange of experience and supporting the implementation of model projects."
"An essential requirement for success is that the Member States should agree to secure a high level of employment and be willing to undertake regular evaluations of progress towards this common objective."
"A progress report is to enable an annual public debate to be held - in the European Parliament and elsewhere - on what has been achieved and what has not."
"The European Council itself has laid the foundations for the joint approach to combating unemployment."
"At the Essen summit it adopted a comprehensive strategy for co-operation between the Member States on labour market policy."
"The concentration of schemes on employment-intensive sectors - from investment in vocational training through the advancement of problem target groups to an increase in employment intensity - is to be continued."
"This specific policy holds out hope for the citizens of the European Union."
"It comprises a political commitment by all Member States to a long-term investment in Europe's most important resource - its human resources."
"This could and should be the turning point needed to bring the past of the European Union closer to the will of the people and to the real needs of today."
"We think that the fight against unemployment should be adopted unequivocally as the foremost priority."
"We need to fight against the most radical causes of unemployment, not merely to express some vague intentions, even if they are written in the Treaty."
"It is therefore essential to finally turn away from the monetarist and neo-liberal lines currently being followed, in particular the nominal convergence criteria, and to replace them with guidelines centred on economic growth, job creation and social dialogue; on giving form to cohesion; on preventing speculative movements of capital; on preserving public services and environmental conservation."
"We are aware however of the indisputable importance of enlargement and the commitments made in this field, in particular in terms of the opening of negotiations."
"But that must not present any threat to the essential adjustments referred to above, which for their part need to be thought through thoroughly."
"We roundly condemn the introduction into the Treaty of amendments in the institutional field which are harmful to the interests of the smaller countries under the pretext of giving specific form to that policy; similarly we demand that due account be taken of the economic indicators which that might produce in those very countries."
"The elections held in some countries recently, particularly the recent elections in France, leave no room for doubt about the deep longing for change in the different peoples of Europe."
"The time has come to respond to that longing."
"Since the joint resolution does not take that line we cannot support it."
"The Amsterdam summit will be a low point in the recent history of European integration."
"None of the major tasks confronting the EU is even being addressed, much less solved: compliance with the Rio commitments, defeating mass unemployment, preparation for the promised eastward and southward expansion, democratization of the EU, the socio-ecological regulation of the internal market - nothing can be done about any of them at their current state of preparation."
"In this situation, our Parliament is trying to whitewash the increasingly critical situation into which the EU has manoeuvred itself under its neo-liberal leaders - instead of taking the historic opportunity to change course that has been offered by the elections in the United Kingdom and France."
"Once again, this House is undermining its own foundations!"
"Draft Treaty"
"Mr President, the Maastricht II Treaty, in the form to be adopted here on the 17th, at least if things go according to plan, is not a constitution for a new state, but it is close to that."
"Maastricht II is not a supranational structure for independent countries, it is a structure in its own right."
"An autonomous structure founded on democratic principles, which can punish countries that are not democratic."
"There will be human rights and freedoms, there will be non-discrimination on the grounds of sex, age, sexuality; these are things normally found in a constitution."
"There will be blanket authority for it to create new powers for itself."
"The individual countries will be authorized to regulate certain matters for themselves: wage agreements, culture, education and hospitals - also things that are in ordinary federal state constitutions - media, public service enterprises and freedom of speech."
"There is a subsidiarity protocol, in which the principle of precedence is established."
"There is foreign policy with majority decision-making, a kind of incipient common foreign ministry; defence is added; legal policy and the police; the states lose control of their territory."
"Means of coercion are acquired, coinage, military and police."
"The only thing missing is democracy, and that is why I voted against it today."
"Mr President, I have voted against because this text of the Dutch Presidency on which the Amsterdam Council will have the final say is a construct which leaves the people of Europe out in the cold."
"They are not in the know."
"According to Eurostat, only about 2 % of the people really know what is going on."
"Furthermore, the text offers absolutely nothing."
"It is just talk, talk, talk. It mentions unemployment but promises shackles and deprivation."
"The representatives of the Council and the Commission have paid homage to employment a hundred times, but they have only just managed to insert some form of protocol, some form of provision, on unemployment in the Treaty."
"As if the 20 million people who are out of a job are there because that word has not been in the Treaty."
"But the reasons lie elsewhere: in the socio-political system to which the Community is beholden."
"Mr President, this text, this construct, proffers a rich menu for the multinational monopolies to gorge themselves on, and all the resolutions are like the waiters at the table, which is why I have voted against them as well."
"Mr President, I voted against this text because it offers no prospect or contribution to a democratic Europe, favouring an authoritarian centralized state."
"The text of the Maastricht Treaty constantly refers to an area of freedom, safety and justice."
"But we are offered no prospect of transparency in public life."
"Not only are no new mechanisms for democratic control being introduced, but existing ones are being weakened."
"The language adopted is very interesting here: where the term 'freedom' always used to be used in European policy, we now have the term security - internal security and the foreign security policy."
"But security is being created not through more democracy, not through an employment policy or social security, but in a form controlled internally by the national governments, via Schengen and Europol, and guaranteed externally by a new foreign and military policy."
"Mr X is not under the control of Parliament but that of an inter-governmental machine, in which human beings - including Members of Parliament - are not involved."
"The superpower dreams of this integration reach their climax in the integration of the WEU, and that too is not under democratic control."
"Therefore, no democrat can vote in favour of such a text."
"Faced with the draft Treaty presented at the Amsterdam European Council, the European Parliament is pretending to be sorry that the text is not sufficiently federalist."
"In reality, the European Parliament is only resorting once again to its time-old tactic of asking for the maximum and then backing down, while protesting, at compromises which are nonetheless major federalist advances which secretly satisfy it."
"On their side, the national governments habitually fall into the trap with such unbelievable facility that it can only conceal voluntary renunciations."
"This is the exactly the case we are facing here."
"Let us, for example, take the proposals in the draft treaty in the areas of security, justice and immigration."
"The European Parliament's resolution declares that the draft treaty is not enough as it does not provide for the possibility of referral to the Court of Justice by individuals."
"But that protest serves mainly to distract attention from the federalist reality of this text; if adopted, the questions of the movement of persons, asylum, immigration, would be removed from national competences and fall within the Community scope, with the Commission holding the monopoly of initiative, the Court of Justice the power of interpretation and majority decision-making with the Council (unless it acts unanimously with codecision by the European Parliament)."
"These proposals would represent an extraordinary federalist leap since, in future, for example, immigration issues would be decided in Brussels."
"The French people could no longer decide for themselves their own policy in that area, and the parties could simply delete the 'immigration' chapter from their manifestos, with a view to national general elections."
"And how would that fit in with the French Constitution."
"In order to make this huge pill easier to swallow, the Dutch Presidency is using a perfectly hypocritical strategy, but it has often turned out to be expensive in the past: a principle is inscribed in the Treaty, by application is deferred for some years to give citizens the impression that they might, in the meantime, benefit from the right to repent, which in reality is absolutely no the case."
"The current draft text provides that the Council, for matters of circulation, asylum and immigration which would be communitarized, would continue to decide unanimously, for three years after the Treaty comes into force; personal controls at borders will be maintained, but for a maximum of five years;"
"Europol would receive operational powers on the territories of the Member States but only after five years have lapsed."
"In other words, the lamentations of the European Parliament designed to distract attention from the vital points are accompanied by the Presidency's manipulations designed to have dangerous principles adopted, making us believe that their consequences would be far off or hypothetical."
"The great federalist strategy is under way, to hoodwink the peoples!"
". (DA) We have certain objections to the resolution."
"Recital C and paragraphs 1(c) and 12 read as though some would like to postpone enlargement, but we favour the timetable adopted."
"The real difficulties are the budget and agriculture, rather than institutional matters."
"Subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 is not entirely correct, (b) is tendentious and (c) is, as already indicated, a possible threat to enlargement."
"We cannot vote for paragraph 3, as it is affected by a Danish reservation."
"We vote against paragraph 5, because it is affected by a Danish reservation."
"We cannot vote for paragraph 6 because of the references to the third pillar and the allusion to the composition of the Commission."
"Despite this we vote for the resolution, because it supports the areas that are most important to us, namely openness, democracy, human rights, the environment, consumer protection and employment, and because we do not have a wholly negative attitude to a transformation of the EU that patently sets out to achieve transparency in so many areas."
"I voted against because the unanimity rule should not be abolished and Parliament should not be involved in deciding where the seat should be, since things should stay as they are."
"As the President of the session deviated from the voting list which I had, I and many others in the Chamber did not really know what we were voting on when amendment proposal 47 suddenly came up for discussion."
"So it was not clear in the vote that I supported amendment proposal No. 47, which stresses the importance of maintaining the balance between large and small countries, although this was my intention."
"I would also like to stress that the resolution which has now been approved should, in my opinion, mean that Parliament can view the forthcoming enlargement negotiations positively."
"The Amsterdam Treaty does not mark a step towards a European democracy."
"Quite the reverse: the revision of the Maastricht Treaty provides for a proliferation of procedures conducted between the Member States without adequate parliamentary or judicial control."
"The principle of power sharing is being made a mockery of."
"Without codecision, the otherwise desirable extension of majority voting in the Council becomes highly dangerous."
"The Treaty does not introduce openness of legislation, nor is the EP being given rights of codetermination and control in key areas of integration, such as monetary union."
"The new Treaty does not create equilibrium between the Union's political and economic integration."
"Despite its protestations of being committed to sustainable development, the EU still cleaves to the logic of unrestricted competition."
"Maastricht II offers no guarantee that Member States will retain or be able to introduce higher environmental standards."
"No mention is made in the draft Treaty of the introduction of eco-taxes."
"The employment chapter is verbose and empty."
"No mention is made of the objective of full employment."
"The Amsterdam Treaty provides no financial or institutional instruments for carrying out an active employment policy at EU level."
"Instead, it talks about co-ordinating the employment policies of the Member States, but they have long since lost any budgetary room for manoeuvre for employment offensives because of the tight corset of the convergence criteria."
"In its present form, the Treaty undermines democracy and civil rights, which are the true foundations of European Union."
"Now it is up to the EP and the national parliaments to cement an alliance for European democracy and take action to have the Intergovernmental Conference deferred."
"Because, as the Treaty stands at present, it is unacceptable."
"Results should be more important than sticking to a timetable."
"Europe is at a crossroads."
"The closure of the intergovernmental conference is the first main deadline."
"In order to pursue completion of the European Union and its preparation in view of the next century, treaties, the rules and the institutions must be adapted."
"The outcome of the governmental conference will be judged according to three criteria:"
"1.The paralysing unanimity rule must be restricted as much as possible."
"The European Union cannot act efficiently as long as one of the Member States can put its national interests before the general interest of the inhabitants of the Union as a whole.2.The social aspect must be reinforced."
"The European Union must listen to its members and respond to the demand for employment dignity for all."
"That is why the social chapter must be improved."
"That is also why we are recommending integration of an effective chapter on employment into the Treaty."
"The balance must be struck once again between monetary policy, on one hand, and social and economic policies, on the other.3.The European Parliament's democratic involvement in the second and third pillars must be strengthened."
"The European Union must be able to intervene in order to maintain peace and security both inside and outside its borders."
"The European Parliament must take a more active part in this procedure and must be able to resume the democratic prerogatives lost by national parliaments in a certain number of vital areas.As far as we know, the Dutch Presidency's proposals offer too few prospects in terms of these three criteria."
"On behalf of the PS delegation, I would like to insist that efforts be made in Amsterdam in order to improve the texts and for measures to be taken in order to come closer to the positions frequently taken by the European Parliament, in particular in the resolution that we have just adopted."
"If not, if significant progress proved impossible because of a lack of time or political restraints, a slight delay will be preferable to a negative outcome."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Progress in CFSP 1996"
"The next item is the report (A4-0193/97) by Mr Spencer, on behalf of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on progress in implementing the common foreign and security policy (January to December 1996)."
"We are very glad that the President-in-Office is still with us, and we are glad to take this opportunity to hear Mr van Mierlo's views on this report by Mr Spencer, on behalf of the Council."
"Madam President, I am very much obliged to Mr Spencer for giving me the floor."
"It would be logical for him to take the floor first, but as often in the final days before a summit of this type, logic is overridden by the events and I must travel quickly to Bonn in order to meet someone who is playing a key role in the problem concerning us just now. That is why I welcome this generous gesture and I am very grateful to it."
"Since we are approaching the end of the intergovernmental conference, which is designed to prepare the European Union to meet future challenges, it is vital not to lose sight of our current position and the results that we have already obtained, not only in terms of European integration in general but also in respect of its common foreign security policy."
"The reports which Mr Spencer drafted on 1996 and the draft resolution attached to it sketch a varied image on the ground."
"It is also pointed out that we need to improve the effectiveness and coherence of the CFSP."
"The Council shares this opinion and that is why we are aiming at a structural improvement of the functioning of the CFSP and that this on the agenda of the IGC."
"But we must not forget that the Union still has a long way to go even if progress already made in recent years is not negligible."
"It is in accordance with this situation that we must express our expectations and form our judgment."
"As you know, the Maastricht Treaty threw down the bases of a common foreign and security policy for the European Union."
"This matter also obviously confronts the traditional powers of national states with the reality of European integration."
"The modelling of the CFSP expresses that reality very well."
"A strong CFSP can be forged thanks to the feeling of proximity of the Member States of the European Union."
"Fashioning a common policy on the ground means that reality is becoming aware of the need to express shared common interests."
"In certain areas this awareness is stronger than in others but a process of gradual evolution is clearly emerging here."
"This evolution is reflected in institutional terms in the growth of European political cooperation from 25 years ago until implementation of the CFSP following Maastricht."
"The institutional reforms with regard to the CFSP, currently envisaged as part of the intergovernmental conference, are a further stage in this process and must be regarded as such."
"Only ten years ago it was obvious that the economic giant that the European Community was had feet of clay when it came to foreign and security policy and that that ground was insignificant."
"In reality this situation, inspired by geopolitical relationships, was an artificial one."
"However, the fall of the Berlin wall and the wave of democratization in central and eastern Europe have placed the Community suddenly and unexpectedly up against new challenges."
"Europe was, in any case, going to have to affirm its political identity and weight more markedly."
"The way of making progress is gradually emerging although it is obvious that this process is going to need more time."
"The IGC is examining, as it were, the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty vis-à-vis the CFSP in the light of the experiences that we have gained over recent years and the needs that we have pinpointed in looking towards the future."
"It is true that the CFSP's tools have seldom been used and public opinion often had the impression that the Union still cannot react firmly."
"Let us be realistic!"
"Is this situation due to the instruments or to the will of the Member States to use them?"
"In fact an efficient and firm common policy in this area calls for a desire and will to collaborate, justified by an awareness of the fact that our common interests are at stake."
"The Union is in full evolution and is preparing for its future, including that of the CFSP."
"Our relations with associate countries in central and eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean are being strengthened."
"Moreover, we are working on lasting relations with our neighbouring countries in eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean basin."
"As far as problems on our continent are concerned, such as Belarus, former Yugoslavia and Albania, the Union is beginning to play the role allocated to it and which it is its duty to play with increasing success."
"It is trying to fulfil this role in conjunction with organisations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the organs of the European Convention on Human Rights, by implementing every available means."
"That does not mean that the Union can advance or impose short-term solutions, but that it exercises an influence in terms of foreign policy in the respect of its own interests but also in the light of the importance of its economic relations with the countries in question."
"It is obvious that the rehabilitation and promotion of political and economic stability go hand in hand with this and are of major importance for the Union and its Member States."
"To this effect, tools such as the pre-adhesion strategy, PHARE and TACIS are very important."
"Recently the European Union has also been very active in the field of relations with other neighbouring countries."
"For example, let us mention the pursuit of dialogue with Mediterranean countries."
"The process begun at the Barcelona Conference has led to a system of closer economic links and a more intense political dialogue of strategic interest for the Union, its Member States and our neighbours to the south."
"Links with eastern European countries have also been strengthened."
"On the basis of general action plans, the Union is endeavouring for example to transform its relationship with the Russian Federation and Ukraine into a lasting and significant partnership."
"The Union is thereby contributing to the formation of a stable European security structure."
"The Union has also made considerable efforts concerning developments in the Middle East and the region of the Great Lakes in Africa."
"Representatives have been specially appointed for both of these regions, namely Mr Moratinos and Mr Ajello, in order to express the Union's commitment and to pursue the Union's policy more effectively."
"You will nevertheless understand that the Union's role in these regions is limited to support."
"Initially, conflict based problems have to be tackled by the parties themselves, but the Union can lend support."
"Arbitrage and preventive diplomacy can also complement support in terms of humanitarian aid and any other kind of aid."
"I myself was able to see the importance of appointing Mr Moratinos for the Middle East question. In fact, at that moment, and following the very specific manoeuvres of the Presidency, it was recognized for the first time that Europe can play not only an economic role but also a political role in the peace process in the Middle East."
"It is vital that we continue to try and complement efforts by the United States."
"Too often and for too long we adopted a childish attitude aimed at sharing our powers - who could do what in the Middle East."
"The Middle East is very special for Europe."
"I think that American diplomacy would fail unless Europe were supporting it."
"In my view, we have exploited this point carefully and harmoniously."
"However, we could act even more coherently."
"Relations between the Union and its trans-Atlantic partners have evolved."
"Even though sometimes we have differences of opinion over the use of means - we often, for example, have different conceptions of the usefulness and efficiency of isolation or boycotts - we do share the same objectives, standards and values."
"This understanding may be seen in the extent of cooperation in the framework of trans-Atlantic dialogue."
"Only recently, at the Summit, relations between European Union and the United States led to good results."
"As I have just said with respect to the Middle East, cooperation is called for."
"That was also important in the framework of the unfortunate story of a common resolution in terms of human rights policy over China but, as far as Europe and the United States are concerned, there was excellent cooperation."
"In this case cooperation within Europe was less evident."
"Closer cooperation in the field of political dialogue has just complemented our economic relations with the countries of Latin America as well as our main Asian partners."
"The European Union - ASEAN Summit is an example of the framework of cooperation which enables an exchange of open and constructive ideas to be held."
"No-one would have thought, at that time, that we could discuss the Burma situation for two and a half hours in a very open way."
"We have managed to make some progress but not that much."
"I think that a well studied diplomatic manoeuvre might prove more profitable than we tended to believe."
"In other words, the Union is no longer a simple trading partner but is also increasingly becoming a major partner in external political dialogue."
"It is obvious that the policy to be pursued must reach a consensus within the Union."
"We will only be listened to if we adopt a single position."
"This unanimity, emerging from an awareness of shared common interests, cannot be obtained through institutional structures."
"That is why it is all the more important that we exchange ideas and try to reach an agreement on the external political challenges to be met by the European Union and in the framework of the Council, but also dialogue with you, representatives of the peoples of the Union."
"The structures can, of course, help us in this process."
"So far we have chosen the least restrictive structures, intergovernmental decisions and consensus."
"Everyone can, therefore, act as they wish and block the process at the last moment."
"We have to make this option more difficult and that is what we have tried to do in the new Treaty."
"I admit that the structures are not decisive but they can help us to avoid weak points."
"That is exactly what we are examining just now and where all of our efforts are being placed."
"I shall stop here. Thank you for allowing me to address the European Parliament."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for those remarks on the foreign and security policy."
"Madam President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his comments."
"I am always happy to oblige the presidency in the hope that we will see both the Dutch presidency and other presidencies perhaps a little more frequently in front of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"As you have indicated, this is the annual report on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy that is specified in the Treaty."
"As this is the third such debate, I have this year provided comparative tables showing the trends - and in some cases the lack of trends - in the instruments of the policy."
"I am grateful to our excellent secretariat for the accuracy of this complex data."
"The third part of my report represents, for the first time, this data on a geographic basis, spiralling out from countries in the rest of Europe and nearby to every other region of the world."
"I look forward to the time when we can lift our eyes from the institutional development of the CFSP to an undistracted debate on the substance of Europe's relations with the world; a state-of-the-world debate on a par with our successful state-of-the-Union debate."
"I was very pleased and attracted by the President-in-Office's reference to kitchens and dishes in this morning's debate."
"That is absolutely right."
"On foreign policy we need to get to the food and stop worrying about the plumbing."
"Sadly we are not yet in that happy position so the second part of my report lists, once again, our criticisms of how the CFSP has failed to develop as was anticipated at Maastricht."
"It is a story of institutional timidity and occasional failure of European solidarity under commercial pressures."
"I would not wish to concentrate solely on the shortcomings and failures of the policy because we are making progress."
"Twenty years ago our inability to act together on foreign policy matters was not regarded as either surprising or culpable."
"Ten years ago we felt guilty about our failure."
"Five years ago we had developed aspirations and rhetoric but had neither institutions nor ground rules."
"After Maastricht we had some mechanisms but we have not been good at using them."
"We have played with them at the margins but we have not used them to guide our way forward on the great issues that confront the Union."
"I am most worried by the impact of this failure on our public and in particular, the impact of that failure, both political and technical, in the wars of Yugoslav succession, where our public expected us to save lives and we failed."
"The lesson of Bosnia, it seems to me, is that in the last resort, the Union must have the ability to intervene militarily."
"If we shy away from that responsibility we are doomed to being merely the paymaster for the peace-making efforts of non-European powers."
"It is in this context that we need to embark on a process of bringing the European Union and Western European Union closer together."
"My report contains a section, again for the first time, on the role of this Parliament, its President, its committees and its delegations."
"I am an unapologetic enthusiast for parliamentary involvement, both national and European in the CFSP."
"I do not accept the doctrine that foreign affairs is the prerogative of the executive."
"In my view, the executives of Europe are already far too strong and parliamentarians too weak."
"This approach seems to be based on theories about the primacy of the Crown in foreign affairs, an argument which was rejected by the US Senate from the very early years of that great republic."
"It seems to me proper to aspire to such influence, but it requires us to be self-critical of our own performance as an institution, not least in our tendency to shoot from the hip in urgency resolutions in this plenary."
"I echo President Santer's concerns this morning about attempts to restrict the coherence of the Commission's role in negotiating on behalf of the Union under Articles 113 and 238."
"There is important foreign policy in the first pillar and we should not dismiss its usefulness."
"For me, foreign policy, as understood by the electorates of Europe, is not limited to the classic diplomacy of the kind which absorbs the attention of those involved day-to-day in the CFSP."
"For any power, but especially for a predominantly civilian superpower such as this Union, foreign policy must be a mixture of trade and economics, of environment and development, of security and human rights."
"It must grow and be rooted in the genuine fears and perceptions of our citizens."
"It is not just the completion of the technical process of Treaty revision."
"It is not just a game for diplomats."
"It is about trade, jobs, drought and hurricanes."
"It is at least as much about what goes on in Kyoto and Geneva as what goes on in Moscow and Washington."
"We have hopes for progress in Amsterdam."
"In the jargon we will not be holding our breath."
"But we will stand ready to do our part in making a political reality that lives in the minds of the people of Europe of whatever the Member States bring forward as a reformed and improved CFSP after the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Madam President, I should like, on behalf of my Group, to thank the Rapporteur, Mr Spencer."
"I think that he has emphasized all of the relevant points in this report and in the attached resolution."
"My gratitude also goes to the Minister, Mr Van Mierlo, for his detailed apology of the CFSP in 1996."
"I found it excellent."
"I also noted that the debate which has been held here today was a debate after the event and without conviction whose conclusions unfortunately have already been drawn."
"The CFSP is not going very well and the European Parliament should try to influence to a greater extent its development rather than holding this kind of post mortem debate."
"This institution has no doubt about the interest of the common foreign policy."
"But now all that we can do is assess it."
"The members of my group would like to look at the various aspects of the policy."
"It must be said that, in terms of foreign policy, the Union did not meet the expectations of 1996."
"It is true that, in a certain number of areas, progress has been made - especially in areas belonging to the first pillar - I am thinking of humanitarian aid and stepping up relations with central and eastern European countries, including the former Soviet Union."
"In various other situations, however, the European Union has not been able or has not succeeded in contributing decisively to solving conflicts and tense situations."
"In many cases, a common human rights policy was out of the question especially since the larger Member States in a good many major situations have remained faithful to their own conduct and orientations."
"Furthermore, as has already been said, the United States have interfered on several occasions in situations that we ought to have been able to solve alone."
"It is a shame because the European Union is a major factor and it is also an important sponsor of very many international activities and we do not reap the fruit of that enough. These actions are not sufficiently well known to the public."
"I am thinking in particular of the European Union's role within the United Nations."
"As far as security is concerned, we must await the outcome of Amsterdam, but there too I find that the European Union's image is a pessimistic one. What we see is that it is really NATO which has been doing very well in recent years at the expense of the development of the European Union."
"The Spencer report clearly tackles those aspects which need to be changed."
"We support this approach."
"We need to create better institutional conditions for the European Union's foreign policy, especially when it comes to conflict prevention."
"But that will only have any meaning and will only function if the Member States also demonstrate more ambition when it comes to collaborating over foreign affairs."
"Madam President-in-Office, I very much welcome the publication of this report."
"It highlights the ineffectiveness of the European Union's policy in this particular area."
"I find it somewhat ironic that we refer to the common foreign and security policy."
"On many issues we have no policy and when we do it is rarely a common policy."
"This report highlights a number of critical areas where we have failed."
"It talks about the failure to respond to the continuing problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina or taking any initiative on Kosovo, the lack of effective response to the continuing problem of Cyprus and our relations with Turkey and the absence of a long-term policy for the Middle East or Africa."
"It must also be admitted with some shame and embarrassment that our response to the recent Albanian crisis has been somewhat defective."
"Various reasons are suggested for this."
"We often hide behind structural deficiencies and I would certainly acknowledge that there are structural deficiencies, not least the requirement for unanimity."
"However, that does not tell the whole tale."
"Look, for example, at the failure of the European Union to act as one with regard to the continued breach of human rights in mainland China - an issue which will be debated later on."
"There, economic interests have overtaken political principle and if we fail to act as one, particularly where principle is involved, then we will have no meaningful role in the geopolitical world."
"So certainly let us address the problem of structural deficiencies but let us also recognize that there is a lack of principle involved in some of the ways we shape our policy."
"I hope that this IGC deals with the structural deficiencies, that we end unanimity and replace it with QMV, that we strengthen the relationship with the Commission and the Parliament in this whole area and move away from intergovernmentalism and that we promise to start a real debate on the framing of a defence policy, hopefully incorporating the WEU and the EU pillar."
"I once again pay tribute to the rapporteur."
"The report shows where we are weak and let us hope that, especially in the rest of the week and in Amsterdam, we will make a start on rectifying that."
"Madam President, as everyone is aware the CFSP is a bone of great contention in the European Union; not because of its existence, but rather because of its absence."
"The Union's inability to implement a real common foreign and security policy, which has been lamented very often in this Chamber, means that while it is always willing do its share of the paying it cannot act effectively in the international arena."
"The Spencer report, which is meticulous, honest and clear-sighted, underlines that reality in many of its points."
"It also indicates what needs to be done in order for the Union to be able to assume its role in this field at some juncture."
"It calls for the European Parliament to be given a bigger say with regard to the adoption of common actions and positions and for it to be afforded a participatory role in international negotiations."
"It defines the concept of common security as having to do above all with economic and social stability, the defusing of ethnic tensions and the promotion of ongoing integration; a security, that is, which extends beyond military confrontation and conflict and must be the model for the twenty-first century."
"In addition, the report insists on the need to maintain parliamentary control of the financing of the CFSP, and it is a well known fact that not all of the Member States agree with that."
"Even so, it is an important general point which remains unresolved."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Spencer on his excellent work."
"Unfortunately, the record of CFSP is rather disappointing and current events do nothing to belie that."
"Mr Spencer draws lessons from European powerlessness, not to say Europe's absence from the international diplomatic arena."
"The crisis in former Yugoslavia revealed the European Union's inability to act."
"Now the same is true with the Albania situation."
"For the lack of a genuine common foreign and security policy, Europe cannot play the role that should be its, including that of restoring peace."
"How could it be otherwise if the CFSP remains the expression of the Member States at intergovernmental level?"
"The IGC must put that right by strengthening the principle of political solidarity, while enabling the Member States not to take part actively in certain common actions."
"The Council has so far resorted too seldom to common actions and positions and has demonstrated obvious sloth."
"I regret the weakness of Community diplomatic action in Cyprus and Turkey, for example."
"I deplore our paralysis vis-à-vis Algeria."
"Our absence of a common policy in respect of Africa is dramatic. I am afraid of what is in store in central Africa."
"Since the failure of the European Defence Community in 1954, for the first time, the basic conditions for the emergence of a European security policy now seem to be in place."
"Let us not miss this opportunity."
"Madam President, the record of the CFSP this year shows, as on previous occasions, that the European Union's international activities are marked by a lack of political will, the non-existence of common aims and an insufficiency of institutional mechanisms."
"This was so in Bosnia and more recently in Albania. What happened there has led to dissatisfaction of public opinion despite some truly positive efforts, such as those of our special envoy to the Middle East, Mr Moratinos."
"But the immediate future does not suggest that the situation there is getting any better."
"We saw how NATO and Russia signed an agreement over which Europe simply applauded and waited."
"We will see in early July in Madrid how NATO, an institution with its origins in the Cold War, is enlarging to the detriment - of whom?"
"Of the European Union's own capacities in the security field."
"Despite some positive aspects, what is proposed at the IGC is clearly insufficient."
"We shall quickly have to change this situation."
"We lack an autonomous external policy, a European entity for its own, independent security and defence, an ability to prevent conflicts and take decisive action to narrow the gap between north and south."
"Otherwise, we shall be forced once again to mouth immodest and unreal phrases, that could even be qualified as gracious, as presented by Mr van Mierlo, over the fact that US diplomacy is sometimes wearied when Europe fails to act."
"That is not true."
"Madam President, the annual report on the progress of CFSP, as my group deplores, is unfortunately more of an occasion for a ritual celebration of integrationist fundamentalism than a far-reaching examination aimed at confronting aims and realities."
"This report, despite its undeniable documentary quality and the wealth of its facts and figures, is no exception to that rule."
"It takes the same ideological approach as last year's, developing a conception of the CFSP that would set out to absorb all of all our nations' external means of action, constantly conceived in opposition to national diplomacies, as if a successful initiative by one or more Member States could not, by its very nature, benefit Europe as a whole."
"On the contrary, the competent and efficient national diplomatic services on which such actions rely are presented as an obstacle to the development of the CFSP and, during the debates, serious consideration has been given to their recycling, not to say their re-education."
"The lack of consistency in today's CFSP is attributed to the continuation of an intergovernmental dynamism reflecting the fear of the Member States to relinquish the fantasy of national power."
"After Mr Lamers' empty shell, now we have Mr Spencer's fantasy."
"The national State now plays in the new dominant ideology the role that used to be attributed to the class enemy in the ideology immediately before it."
"Setting the CFSP against national foreign policies, is condemning it to sterility."
"The CFSP will only be effective if it plays a complementary role and not that of replacing national diplomacies."
"When we have genuinely common interests, which are properly inventoried, acting together to make them work undeniably brings added value."
"In other areas, our attitudes differ."
"The CFSP process can then make it possible, by means of concertation, to reconcile to the maximum the diversity of our approaches."
"But we also have to recognize the existence of divergent policies linked, in certain vital areas, to the protection of vital national interests that are perfectly legitimate and respond to citizens' wishes."
"Wishing, for the sake of CFSP, to deny those realities can only do a disservice to the very aim being sought: affirming Europe's place on the new international arena."
"I regret that the Spencer report has not taken the realistic approach to the CFSP which is a necessary condition for its success."
"That is why our group will not be able to vote for its adoption."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, every year since the Maastricht Treaty entered into force on 1 November 1993, our Parliament has produced a report on the progress achieved in the elaboration of the common foreign and security policy, defined in Article J7 of the Treaty."
"Every year, the European Parliament has deplored a disappointing progress report, the absence of a common policy in international crises."
"The Spencer report is no exception to that rule."
"According to its author, the beginnings of the CFSP are still unconvincing in the eyes of European citizens."
"Reviewing the crises in 1996, the report regrets in particular the absence of common proposals and initiatives by the Union for former Yugoslavia, the enlargement of NATO, and relations with Russia, its ineffectiveness in Albania, its diplomatic weakness over Cyprus and Turkey and its divisions over China."
"Curiously, the report offers a positive appraisal of the action by the Union's special envoy to the Middle East and thinks that there are still possibilities to be exploited in central Africa, Zaire, or the Great Lakes region."
"No comment."
"The measures proposed, as usual, to remedy these gaps are the following: integration of the WEU into the European Union, inclusion in the Community budget of CFSP operational non-compulsory expenditure, enabling the European Parliament to exert controls, and systematic consultation of the European Parliament by the Council before the adoption of common positions."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs is relying on the IGC to implement these reforms."
"Whereas it increasingly dismantles Member States' sovereignty in terms of foreign policy, it unfortunately brings with it hardly any harmony or peace between nations, and that is why we shall not be voting for the report."
"Madame Chairman, when three new Member States joined the EU at the beginning of 1995 the tradition of military neutrality in the Union was strongly reinforced."
"What is at issue here is a tradition, not the invalidity of security policy, as surprisingly often seems to be thought."
"In post-war Europe the history of military neutrality is at least as long as that of alliances."
"This should be remembered."
"I should like to stress that Finland, for example, does not wish to be politically neutral."
"We wish to support and strengthen the European Union's common foreign and security policy."
"In this area, Finland, together with Sweden among others, has been very active in recent times."
"We do, however, wish to remain militarily neutral because this informed choice, in our opinion and according to our experience can best secure stability and peaceful development in northern Europe."
"If Finland and Sweden now declared that they were going to give up their military neutrality, this would very probably result in the increase of military tension in our area and along the 1300 kilometre long border between the EU and Russia."
"Why should we pursue a policy which increases tension?"
"It would, amongst other things, make peaceful border cooperation considerably more difficult."
"Against this background, we have followed with some concern the calls for the unification of the EU with the WEU."
"This would mean that we would have to give up our military neutrality."
"We understand that a majority of the EU Member States have wished to resolve their security problems by entering into military alliances."
"We respect these solutions."
"We would wish, however, for our decisions too to be respected in the same way."
"The way from the division of Europe towards more peaceful development has been be preserved precisely by good cooperation between militarily allied and neutral countries."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the credibility gap between the standing and economic strength of the European Union and its weakness and impotence as regards external security and defence policy is ever more striking."
"This disparity arises because the Treaty on European Union was not implemented."
"The scant progress made with regard to implementing external security and defence policy is disappointing, as mentioned in the excellent report by Mr Spencer, which we should support and vote for."
"We do not in the European Union possess any strategic information services which would enable us to make analytical forecasts of world political trends. In Europe we do not have the power of decision on external policy within an acceptably rapid time."
"It is well known within the European universe that there is no operational capacity or resources within the sphere of security and defence."
"For the urgent implementation of these measures we need to set up a solid and coherent institutional framework, as this Parliament has recommended and is still recommending in this report, which drew very little attention from the Council."
"We are very concerned about the timid progress made in this matter and, I repeat, about the timid progress proposed in this matter proposed for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Madam President, we all know that the threefold strategy which could lend credibility to an external policy supported and framed in a common European Union security and defence policy would be to provide a basis and knowledge so that we could decide swiftly then act effectively."
"Without these structural conditions the European Union will continue to lack prestige as regards external policy - it is a hard truth - and it will not in the medium term provide the appropriate support for the development of economic and financial policies and the relevant social progress."
"Nevertheless, I hope that the operation of economic and monetary union as a whole, an operational Central European Bank, a single currency as a positive factor and a factor for greater cohesion will provide us with a basis for launching a European Union (but that will certainly be a matter for a new generation of European political leaders - this one is already exhausted - and possibly within a new institutional framework - this one already being exhausted); the objectives should be, in addition to improving living conditions, a little more pride in the life of the European citizen."
"Madam President, I too would like to compliment Mr Spencer on an excellent report, but I also want to express my disappointment at the fact that, once again, this Parliament is just having a nice chat."
"And I want to say, once again, that a common foreign policy is needed, but the reality is we are not going to do anything concrete to achieve that objective."
"I ask myself - and I ask you - whether anyone still cherishes the illusion that, as Mr Spencer rightly mentions in his report, the old nation states can play a leading role in a strongly and sharply evolving international scenario."
"I ask myself whether Europe, which certainly has a role at the highest level on the world scene, prefers to continue in the role of fifteen political dwarves, fifteen political gnomes who continue to argue about every important foreign policy issue which arises at international level."
"The events in former Yugoslavia are an obvious case, but we can cite many others, like the policies on Russia, China, which we shall be discussing later, and the Mediterranean too."
"Actual common actions and positions can be counted on the fingers of one hand."
"So I believe a specific and strong position should be taken after this debate through a specific intervention by Parliament."
"Madam President, Mr Spencer deserves our thanks for his efforts, if only because his report makes it clear that any report on the implementation of the EU's common foreign and security policy must, nowadays, quite simply amount to a list of missed opportunities and failures."
"And, since the Intergovernmental Conference is producing no genuine progress in this area, I fear that such reports are going to take the same form in the future."
"In order to find practical examples of this failure, we need not look very far afield: even among the Member States of the European Union, present or prospective, threats are being openly backed by military force."
"I regard it as an unforgivable failure of the European Union that it has not been able to resolve the crisis between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus."
"Indeed, if we look around we can see economically weak countries investing economic resources in totally disproportionate armaments -resources that they urgently need elsewhere."
"I believe this should be a clear priority of all the European institutions, so that what is nothing less than a European scandal can be brought under control."
"Madam President, the Spencer report makes some accurate observations. However, I see things in a slightly harder light."
"It is, of course, true that the development of a common foreign and security policy is being impeded by an institutional deficit. But there are other deficits as well, and there is an absence of solidarity."
"We saw that in the essentially neutral stance taken by the European Union during the crisis over the Imia islands in 1996, even though one of its member countries was involved."
"Secondly, the principle of equal treatment does not seem to count for much."
"The European Union took one approach to the rights of the Chechens and is taking another, at the present time, to the rights of the Kurds, and it says nothing about incursions into the territory of other countries by the Turkish army."
"Thirdly, there is a lack of self-confidence."
"In foreign policy the Union displays an enduring inferiority complex, and it has become reconciled to following in the wake of the United States."
"Cyprus is a case in point. The Union did whatever it could to downgrade the status of its special envoy vis-à-vis the United States and now the United States has just appointed Mr Holbrooke as its own special representative."
"I think that the tragedy of the Union's foreign policy was illustrated also by the situation that developed in Albania in 1996."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome this report because we want to see the swift implementation of the CFSP with regard to Austria's accession to the WEU and to NATO."
"Matters we regard as particularly important are improving the working conditions between the WEU and the EU and the development of a European security system that is not dependent on the USA."
"The primary purpose and objective of a European security system must be the prevention of military conflicts; the resolution of conflicts, even by the use of military force if necessary, is a secondary priority."
"In view of its history during the present century, Europe has a special responsibility to adopt an active security policy."
"That policy must not be jeopardized by a naive form of pacifism, because there is one thing that none of us here should ever forget: adherence to the principles of unilateral pacifism, anti-militarism and military neutrality would have meant that Auschwitz was never liberated."
"Madam President, I would like to say the same as everyone else here is saying that this is a very good report."
"It contains a good, broad concept of security policy and is not restricted to narrow military areas and military issues."
"I also welcome what Mr Spencer himself has said that there is a need for a long term strategy to tackle global problems including poverty, the environment and ethnic and social conflicts."
"I think this is excellent."
"Above all, in the background documents for the report I see a good description of how a common security policy could be developed; there is an analysis of shortcomings but there is also a description of what could be done."
"They form a good reference book for anyone who is interested."
"Even the sun sometimes has its spots."
"And so has this report in some places."
"I support instead what Mr Paasio said on the situation of the non-aligned neutral States."
"These spots are still present in points 15 and 19."
"I hope that they will disappear at the vote when we support amendment proposals Nos. 1 and 2."
"Otherwise: Congratulations on a good report."
"Madam President, congratulations are due to Mr Spencer for his report."
"The great absentee, the great unknown, the great guilty party: the so-called but, in reality, non-existent common foreign policy has been described as all of those things at one time or another, and not without justification."
"After the historic events of 1989 it should have become the dominant concern of our Union, but still, today, on the eve of the revision of the Treaty, it remains a distant dream - albeit an undesirable one for some people here."
"Sad experience, starting with the Gulf crisis and followed by the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Bosnia-Herzegovina drama and the tragedies in Africa - leaving aside the confusion with regard to Turkey - should have taught us that the growing trend in European foreign policy is more towards renationalization than communautization."
"The biggest trading power on earth, as our Union affects to call itself, seems to confirm the views of those who mockingly describe it as a voiceless diplomat, a blind general and a lame soldier."
"Certainly, there is no lack of pious aspiration about the CFSP in the Maastricht Treaty, and nor will there be any lack of it soon in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"What is really lacking though is the unanimous political will to forge an effective foreign policy."
"Various technical solutions are being searched for."
"There is, in fact, a desire, within the diffuse economic perception that grips us, to substitute money for our political and strategic absence."
"As Mr Van den Broek said perceptively yesterday, in all of the trouble spots, from Sarajevo to Palestine, the Europeans are doing the paying and the others are doing the action."
"If we want find the root cause of this inability we have to look back to the thing that in recent years we have been sedulously keeping quiet about: the abandonment of the federal idea."
"Madam President, I too wish to congratulate Mr Spencer on his report."
"I agree with him that progress on the common foreign and security policy has been disappointing."
"It is true that the EU has been unable to implement human rights and democracy clauses in its agreements."
"The Commission has, as Mr Spencer outlined, failed to make proposals as it could do under Article J.8."
"I particularly welcome his reference to the analysis unit, which would assist the EU in drawing up a more effective common foreign and security policy and help with conflict prevention."
"It is true that we need a closer relationship between the EU and the WEU."
"However, like Mrs Theorin, I disagree with paragraphs 15 and 19, on the integration of the WEU in the EU and more majority voting in the common foreign and security policy."
"As Mr Lambrias said, the common foreign and security policy has clearly failed in certain areas, such as former Yugoslavia, Albania and other areas of the world."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Spencer for including a reference to antipersonnel mines, and to ensure that we all work together to see that they are eliminated from the face of the earth, because they cause so much damage and hurt to people across the world."
"Madam President, whatever the result of the Intergovernmental Conference may be, one thing is certain: applause for that conference will be muted."
"However important it may be to give our citizens the feeling that they live in an area of freedom and internal security, which includes social security and the right to work, external security is a necessity too."
"Particularly for countries like Austria, which are frontier states of the EU, it is important that the European Union should carry weight in its foreign and security policy and so become a stabilizing factor in Europe."
"So far we have seen mainly the shortcomings of the CFSP, in Bosnia and also in Albania and the Middle East."
"The Spencer report makes this painfully clear."
"Let us not deceive ourselves: without the commitment of the USA in these crisis areas, nothing could be done."
"They show up the shortcomings of the European Union."
"This makes it all the more important to us that, with regard to the CFSP as elsewhere, majority decisions should make it easier for the European Union to act."
"The fact that the EU accepts the Petersberg undertakings, peace-keeping and peace-making missions in other words, is positive."
"The fact that there is still no date for the integration of the WEU, so that the military backbone is lacking, is negative."
"A clear CFSP line would also facilitate the national debate in neutral States such as Austria."
"While uncertainties remain regarding the CFSP, it is an easy way out to take refuge in neutrality, which has lost its meaning as a result of the changed political scenario in Europe and should be replaced by solidarity in favour of a common security policy."
"Madam President, it is customary on these occasions to congratulate the rapporteur."
"What may be less customary is that in congratulating Mr Spencer I actually mean it, because previous chairmen of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy have produced the annual report on a very absolutist basis: they have talked about the world they would like to see rather than the world that exists."
"Mr Spencer's report, however, is practical and concrete, and that is precisely the basis on which we should address this subject."
"After all we have a common foreign and security policy not because we want some sort of status symbol to prove to the rest of the world we have grown up as an organization, but because we believe that our economic and political strength can, through CFSP, produce benefits not only to EU citizens but to citizens of the broader Europe and, indeed, of the world, and it is on providing those positive benefits that we have to be judged."
"At the moment the CFSP is very piecemeal: it owes more to the inspiration of Heath Robinson than to the modern, computer-driven technological age."
"What we need is a clearer definition of what we want!"
"What is a common foreign policy and what is it trying to achieve?"
"We have no judgement of what we define as a common difficulty, a common challenge, and we have no idea of a common approach."
"How could anybody decide on a strategy for Albania when the Council of Ministers had 15 different briefing documents?"
"You cannot even begin to attack the problem."
"While national governments are still briefing their civil servants, we cannot have a common foreign security policy."
"That is why we need an analysis unit, which I hope we will see in Amsterdam."
"It is also why we need more coherence in funding the CFSP."
"Passing the hat round and trying to move things from pillar to post is not the model way of doing things."
"I hope that the interinstitutional agreement on the funding of the CFSP is cemented into the Amsterdam Treaty, and not before time!"
"We need a decision-making structure which respects the sensitivity of national sovereignty and the sensitivity of some of these issues to our Member States but still allows us to make progress."
"The idea of constructive abstention and more majority voting within commonly agreed strategies is a new way of moving forward."
"The IGC will address some of these issues."
"What it cannot address is the lack of political will."
"The biggest disgrace of the common foreign and security policy is what happened in Mostar, and what happened to Mr Koschnick, who was our administrator in Mostar."
"The Council of Ministers betrayed him because of a lack of political will."
"What we have to build is a political will."
"We have to improve Parliament's role in a common foreign and security policy."
"Having said that, I am delighted that Mr Spencer has been critical of Parliament."
"How can the Council trust us and take us seriously if we are incapable of making coherent recommendations and produce urgencies which are inaccurate and contradictory?"
"We have to look to ourselves if we are really to take a major role in the developing foreign and security policy."
"Madam President, I hope that the compliments that I shall make to the Spencer report and which will be added to those of former speakers will also be seen positively following Mr Titley's introduction."
"I think, in particular, that Mr Spencer has provided in his very serious report an almost perfect analysis of the lacunae in the European Union's foreign policy and he has analyzed the possible improvements to it."
"In this sense and following this morning's debate on the intergovernmental conference, it might be said that there is a consensus emerging on possible improvements to the tools of the common foreign policy."
"On this score, we are also very anxiously awaiting, along with this institution, the outcome of the Amsterdam Summit and we will then see to what extent the Treaty really has given us instruments and improvements to procedures and structures which might possibly enable us to reach a truly more effective and more dynamic common security and foreign policy, as has been demanded by so many speakers this afternoon."
"Without wishing to undermine the just criticism of the common foreign policy, I should also like to issue a warning against the possible tendency to attribute, in some way or another, all of the international conflicts currently raging and all of the suffering still present in the world to the European Union's inaction or the lack of means enabling us to bring them to an end within a reasonable time."
"Unfortunately, there are still many examples of big countries, world powers still with considerable diplomatic, military and economic capacities, but unable to find an immediate solution to any conflict, be it the Middle East conflict or the wars raging in Central Africa."
"The European Union's foreign policy presents, happily I would say, a number of positive elements too: we are the world's number one donor, Europe supports countries and people who are suffering throughout the world and we are also ready to explain to our publics that it is necessary to pursue the huge international effort in order to reestablish and reconstruct former Yugoslavia, a situation which we did not sufficiently react to at the time, in terms of political and diplomatic activity; but, nevertheless, we are now genuinely trying to consolidate the Dayton Peace Agreement."
"As for the global strategic environment, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, we have reviewed our individual relations with each of these countries and strengthened our links with them."
"The same goes for a country which arouses so much controversy in the European Parliament, namely Turkey, with which we concluded a customs union, two years ago, and with which we are still trying to strengthen links; it needs to take clear and practical measures rather than condemning to 21 years in prison a political activist who did nothing more than lower a flag."
"In brief, there are also positive comments to make about the European Union's foreign policy."
"However, I should like to come back to the beginning and the nerve centre of the Spencer report - namely - as Mr Titley also just emphasized - that regardless of the structures of the procedures to be adopted shortly in Amsterdam, they can never replace the genuine political will to defend common interests at Community level."
"On this score, we obviously are lagging behind."
"Finally, Madam President, I should like to emit a cry of distress."
"I think that it would be beneficial if all our Member States conscientiously re-read the existing Union Treaties in terms of a common foreign and security policy and that they echoed the words of the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, namely pacta sunt servanda . They should remember that, in 1991, in Maastricht, all of them declared that they should not only aspire to a common foreign policy but also to a security policy and, in the end, a common defence policy and all of the necessary tools for that purpose; their remarks made on this subject on strengthening WEU and the acquisition of tools which might also be used or exert pressure when diplomacy looks like failing - that all of subjects - also ought to retain our attention."
"Madam President, I should like to conclude by expressing once again my considerable regard for Mr Spencer and my hope to see, in the coming years, numerous debates on the European Union's common security and foreign policy in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, as well as in the plenary session of the European Parliament."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"EP-national parliaments relations"
"The next item is the report (A4-0179/97) by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments."
"Since the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union has made genuine progress in political terms. The ratification procedures which followed then showed the strength of the call for a duty to justify."
"This appeal has never been denied and the current changes to the Treaty will only enforce it. Given their status as elected representatives of the Union's peoples, the national parliaments and the European Parliament play a key role in the exercise of democratic control over activities, in particular the legislative activities, of the European Union."
"The quality of the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments is therefore of crucial interest for the democratic nature of the European Union. If they oppose each other democracy will suffer."
"If they recognize that they have a common mission, democracy will be strengthened. That, ladies and gentlemen, was the thought that I have had throughout the year since I was appointed as Rapporteur on relations between our Parliament and the national parliaments."
"Convincing you was not that difficult. On the other hand, obtaining the approval of the national parliaments was and still is harder."
"As the Finnish parliament said, our relationship is both one of competition and complementarity."
"As for the latter aspect, the European Parliament monitors the action of the Commission and the Council while the national parliaments monitor their national governments, especially when they are acting at EU level."
"That seems to be a matter of course but it is far from being the case since numerous EU legislative documents and nearly half the budget are passed without sufficient parliamentary controls, without mentioning the second and third pillars over which parliamentary - and, therefore, democratic - controls are virtually impossible, still today."
"Consequently, my resolution contains fundamental demands, in the run up to the closure of the IGC - firstly: integration into the Treaty of openness and transparency as a general principle, valid for all of the European Union's institutions."
"This simple fact, ladies and gentlemen, should lessen public mistrust and should even help to do away with it altogether."
"Secondly: strengthening the European Parliament's powers and introducing codecision into all Council decisions taken by a qualified majority."
"Thirdly: an obligation under the Treaty to indicate all pre-legislative and legislative texts in due time to the national parliaments so that they have at least four weeks to express their opinion before the Council takes its decision."
"Fourthly: strengthening cooperation between the Union's parliaments by means of a better definition of the COSAC, by means of communicating in due time the Commission's legislative programme to the national parliaments, allocating reciprocal facilities and organizing multilateral electronic communications."
"The IGC's current proposals respond partly to this demand."
"I hope that, in the run up to the Summit, these proposals will not be watered down but they will actually be strengthened."
"I am also aware of the fact, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that my report and resolution are only one cog in a relationship between our Parliament and the national parliaments, because they will still have some difficulties."
"That is why I hope that they will not be neglected but special attention will be paid to them."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to use my remaining 30 seconds to thank everyone who has helped me in drafting this report because, of course, I did not act alone."
"I am very happy to have been able to count on the support of staff working for the Institutional Committee, my own assistants and a large number of colleagues."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I congratulate the rapporteur."
"We have had excellent collaboration in committee, and the Socialist Group will be supporting her motion for a resolution when it comes to the vote."
"The role of national parliaments and of the European Parliament are, and must be, complementary."
"Attempts by Eurosceptics and assorted nationalists on the extreme right to set the national parliaments and the European Parliament against each other must be resisted."
"The role is complementary because national parliaments have a role in their national capitals in controlling, scrutinizing and monitoring the activities of the ministers who represent their country at Council meetings in Brussels."
"They all have different ways of doing it which they have developed in accordance with their own constitutional traditions."
"I have no doubt that some of these ways could be improved."
"That is up to them."
"But however good it is - be it the Scandinavian model whereby the minister appears before the relevant parliamentary committee on his or her way to the airport when going to a Council meeting and on his or her way back from the airport when returning from a Council meeting, a very intense form of scrutiny - or one of the other methods which have been developed, the fact remains that, however good that national parliamentary scrutiny is, it remains separate scrutiny by fifteen different national parliaments, each over one member of the Council."
"That is where the role of the European Parliament comes in."
"Somebody has to deal with the Council as a collective body, as an institution that is taking decisions at European level as a European institution."
"And that is the importance of the co-decision procedure - to have a parliamentary body directly elected at European level to interact with the Council."
"The two roles are therefore complementary, and care should be taken in the Treaty to distinguish these two roles."
"We can support the compromises that seem to be emerging in the IGC to take measures that would facilitate the national control that national parliaments must exercise through better time limits and better circulation of documents giving them the time to get stuck into issues."
"More important than that in the IGC is a related matter, that of extending qualified majority voting."
"If you have unanimity in an enlarged Union of 20 or so Member States, there will be no decisions for anybody to scrutinize and control."
"There will be nothing for national parliaments nor for the European Parliament to deal with because there will be paralysis."
"Unless we extend qualified majority voting in the new Treaty throughout the whole realm of Community legislation at the very least, then there will be no point in discussing the best ways to carry out national or European parliamentary scrutiny."
"That issue must be tackled by this IGC."
"Madam President, I think that the success of Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck's report, approved by a large majority in committee, lies in its appropriate focus."
"Why?"
"Because it sets out from the premise that the European Parliament and national parliaments both represent European citizens and, as Mr Corbett said, we must not fight in vain, we have to head in the same direction in exerting controls and conducting legislative activity."
"This report, which mentions the support of national parliaments - as the COSAC also recognized at its Dublin meeting - for extending European Parliament codecision to legislative acts, heads in the right direction."
"What can we do to head in that right direction?"
"I think that this report contains practical proposals that improve the political control that national parliaments exercise over Community legislation in the scope of their own competence, that of the national parliaments, and the control that governments are subjected to, which as we know has its place in the Council of Ministers."
"The rapporteur also makes practical proposals on how the controls exercised by the European Parliament could be improved and finally on cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"The rapporteur recognizes in her report, Madam President, that the proposals are not spectacular."
"They are not but they are governed by common sense, head in the right direction and are in keeping with what the national parliaments, with the representations of the European Parliament, agreed on in the COSAC - and here I wish to pay tribute to VicePresidents Fontaine and Imbeni."
"They head in the right direction I referred to earlier, in other words."
"I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her splendid work, her practical proposals in which the wishes of the national parliaments are reflected, as they were expressed at the hearing held in Brussels a few weeks ago."
"With texts like this one, which are not spectacular, we make real progress, set by step, towards European construction."
"Madam President, the proposal we are analyzing today is certainly not intended to transfer responsibilities or powers from the national parliaments to the European Parliament, far from it!"
"Its logic is to develop better links and synergy between the two assemblies, with one specific objective: improving representation of the citizens, so that as well as having a national identity, they feel more European."
"Inevitably decisions will increasingly be taken in Strasbourg and Brussels, but complementary and parallel to decisions taken in the individual Member States."
"We want to associate the two institutions, Community and national, in evaluation, analysis, objectives and especially urgent situations."
"Within this framework the regions should take on basic responsibilities for their territories, and there should be better organization of their own institution, the Committee of the Regions."
"The European Parliament is ready to work directly with the national parliaments."
"We hope this is mutual."
"For this to happen in real time, it would be very useful to have two-way electronic transmission between the European Parliament and the national parliaments - as the rapporteur proposes in her report, and we congratulate her - for each political group and each individual Member of Parliament, together with the respective committees."
"We are working together to simplify legislative procedures, we are working together on common urgent intervention, we are working together, above all, to help the citizens understand why the two major institutions that represent them exist and how they function."
"Madam President, I have just tabled an amendment taking up the main suggestion that I worded in a report dealing with the same issue and addressed to the Luxembourg Prime Minister, i.e. granting a right of appeal to national parliaments for the purpose of annulling Community acts for ultra vires or other serious reasons, according to the provisions of Article 173(2) of the Treaty."
"It must be noted that the national parliaments are very much excluded from European legislative procedures, including in areas within their remits originating in constituent powers, which sometimes causes serious problems in an atmosphere of defiance against the cause of European integration prevailing in most Member States."
