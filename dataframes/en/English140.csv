"I am counting on you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 14 December."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Maintaining the exemption from visa obligations is not only a technical issue, but clearly a political matter as well."
"However, exemptions from visa obligations are always based on mutual trust and mutual commitments."
"Today's debate conveys the message to the countries concerned that the long list of tasks that lies before them as a result of their commitment does not end after being granted visa exemption, and that they still need to provide their citizens with information about what visa-free travel entails in order to prevent abuses of this opportunity."
"The visa exemption granted to Serbia and Montenegro will provide an opportunity to acquire a European perspective primarily to the young people on whom the Europe of the future will be built."
"The exemption granted two years ago carried an important political message for these countries, and withdrawing it would have severe consequences."
"Of similar importance is the maintenance of visa exemption for the Hungarians living in Vojvodina, for those citizens who live on either side of the border, speak the same language, and cultivate close family and cultural ties."
"For countries rushing towards EU membership, the creation of the conditions of coexistence, regardless of borders, is of special importance."
"Every liberalisation of visa requirements goes towards meeting the expectations of the people living in the countries affected by the liberalisation."
"I would like to stress that the agreement facilitating the issuing of visas between the EU and Georgia cannot be viewed separately from the agreement on the readmission of illegal immigrants."
"We have been talking about this for a long time in Europe, because visa policy is particularly important for the EU."
"Visa liberalisation means that EU countries are opening up to the citizens of Balkan countries, thereby creating possibilities for participating in EU dialogue and learning about democracy."
"However, along with liberalisation, we have to take into account the fact that making it easier to cross borders may make life easier for illegal immigrants and criminal groups."
"The Member States should apply uniform procedures for issuing visas, because Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are waiting their turn."
"The European Commission must abide by the conditions for visa liberalisation and monitor the situation so that good solutions do not give rise to difficulties within EU Member States."
"Additionally, it is important for countries to cooperate and to make use of experience gained to date with regard to the visa issuing procedure."
"I believe that Serbia has made great efforts so far to meet the EU's expectations and continue on its path towards integration."
"The following measures were achieved in 2009 and 2010: visa liberalisation, launch of the ratification process for the stabilisation and association agreement and the European Commission's approval to draft the opinion on Serbia's application to join the EU."
"However, it is regrettable that the Serbian authorities have not publicised in the media and adequately explained what the establishment of the visa-free travel regime introduced in 2009 entails so that their citizens do not abuse this scheme."
"I hope that this alarming rise in the number of applications for asylum in the EU submitted by Serbian citizens will not harm Serbia's integration process."
"I firmly believe that the Serbian authorities will respond promptly."
"I also should recall that the path to accession depends on the individual efforts made by Serbia to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the stabilisation and association agreement."
"In connection with the general topic of this debate (visas), I would like to talk about two issues which are specific, but, in my opinion, of the highest importance."
"Both issues are very sensitive from the perspective of successfully implementing the European good neighbourhood policy."
"First, there is the matter of implementing the agreement on visa facilitation between the EU and Russia."
"In my opinion, it is not enough just to criticise - from the standpoint of an overall assessment of how the agreement is functioning - certain measures which Russia has unfortunately also had to apply against citizens travelling from EU countries."
"This is necessary because of the general security situation in the country, and the measures, such as, for example, the obligation to register, do not essentially complicate visa facilitation."
"The second issue is the apparent concern regarding the proper implementation of the system for relaxing the EU visa regime in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro."
"This concern has reportedly stemmed from an increase in the number of asylum applications from citizens of these countries, and measures against the relevant domestic bodies have been put forward as a solution."
"This is misleading and beside the point."
"The EU and NATO have long had a major influence on the overall political situation in the Balkans."
"These organisations should, first and foremost, pursue the sort of measures and the sort of policies in the Balkans that will not force people to leave this sorely tested region."
"We must not count our chickens before they are hatched."
"We will only believe in the agreement with Moscow to remove trade barriers once it has been ratified and implemented."
"In this context, we simply need to think of the Russian decision to withdraw from the signing of the Energy Charter."
"It will also become clear whether the Kremlin really intends to comply with EU calls for visa facilitation."
"Visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, which is an area only a fraction the size of Russia, has resulted in a wave of asylum seekers, so what can we expect to happen when the visa restrictions for the seventh largest country in the world in terms of population are lifted?"
"If a large number of Islamists from the Caucasus have Russian citizenship, will we be allowing potential terrorists into the country without visa requirements?"
"Whether we are talking about Serbia, Georgia or Macedonia, we must take a close look at the situation and, if necessary, continue to work on appropriate readmission agreements."
"We must evaluate the experiences of lifting visa regulations for the Balkan countries, bring the Schengen Information System II (SIS II) up to date and monitor the implementation of the visa requirements in Moscow."
"We must also keep an eye on the increase in the number of refugees leaving the Caucasus and the central Asian countries for Russia, together with the growth in the number of asylum seekers from those countries which want visa restrictions to be removed."
"According to data held by Russia's statistics agency, in 2008, more than 1.5 million Russian visas were issued to EU citizens, and 3.5 million EU visas were issued to Russian citizens."
"That is more than a quarter of all Schengen visas issued worldwide."
"EU-Russia visa policy is an important instrument for deepening interpersonal relations and enabling Russia to move closer to the EU."
"I would like to draw attention to the difficulties faced by the inhabitants of the Russian Federation's Kaliningrad Region."
"The majority of the inhabitants of this Russian island surrounded by EU Member States receive single entry short-stay Schengen visas."
"Most Kaliningrad inhabitants travelling through neighbouring EU Member States have to pay a visa fee every time and stand in queues at the consulates of EU Member States."
"Recently, representatives from social organisations in Kaliningrad, picketing at the building of the European Commission in Brussels, called for the introduction of special conditions of travel to EU Member States for the enclave's inhabitants, without tying this issue to EU-Russia talks on a visa-free regime."
"The past few years have seen the start of favourable processes in Western Balkans states, which seem to efface the memory that fifteen years ago, the region was still a war zone within Europe."
"Undoubtedly, the EU's exemplary assistance in the process of democratic development in the Western Balkans and the fact that it kept open the prospect of accession for the countries of this region contributed to these developments."
"The decision on visa liberalisation taken one year ago introduced the European practice of the freedom of movement to Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, a clear sign of care on the part of Europe."
"Without doubt, the matter of immigration is once again becoming a serious domestic policy issue in some of the Member States, and is exacerbated by the economic crisis."
"However, I believe that European solidarity must be exercised in spite of the crisis, if we wish to avoid a resurgence of nationalism and protectionism."
"Although the Western Balkans are not yet part of the EU, stability in South-East Europe can only be achieved through EU enlargement in the Balkans."
"The EU must strictly monitor compliance with the technical requirements related to border protection but, at the same time, it must offer assistance to ensure that the citizens of Western Balkan states see a realistic chance for their lives to improve, and that they consider EU accession an attainable goal."
"We must assist the region in its journey towards social and economic development through efficient information, even greater solidarity, and additional financial means, so that these citizens can find prosperity in their own home countries."
"Creation of an immigration liaison officers' network (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers' network - C7-0055/2009 -."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members, Mrs Guillaume, Mr Ilchev, Mrs Keller, Mrs Wikström and Mr Tavares."
"The support they have given me has improved this report."
"I would specifically like to draw the Council's and the Commission's attention to the terminology."
"From my point of view, it would be more appropriate if we used the term 'irregular immigration'."
"Up to now, clandestine immigration has been referred to as 'illegal immigration' in all the legislative instruments the EU has enacted."
"Although it is true that in some Member States, an irregular entry or stay constitutes a crime and in others, the term 'irregular' has no legal or semantic significance, in many other Member States, an irregular entry or stay does not constitute an unlawful act, which is why we should not generally criminalise these activities."
"For this reason, in the explanatory statement of the report, it is asked that the institutions revise the terminology that is used, insisting on the need to find a more precise and appropriate definition for the phenomenon of clandestine immigration."
"Moving on to the substance of this issue, the immigration liaison officers' network was created by Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004."
"This instrument states that the liaison officers will be representatives of a Member State posted abroad by the immigration service or other appropriate authority with the aim of establishing and maintaining contact with the authorities of the host country, aiming to contribute to the prevention and combat of clandestine immigration, the repatriation of irregular immigrants and the management of legal immigration."
"Since the enactment of the regulation, the Frontex Agency has been established, whose mission is to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the area of external border management; assist the Member States in the training of national border guards; carry out risk analyses; monitor the development of external border control and surveillance research; assist Member States in circumstances that require increased technical and operational assistance at external borders and provide them with the necessary support in the organising of joint return operations."
"It is evident that the important mission entrusted to Frontex could be achieved in a more efficient way if they could draw upon the knowledge and experience of the immigration liaison officers' network, especially if we take into account the fact that the European Agency does not have offices or representatives outside EU territory."
"The proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 337/2004 aims to harness the knowledge and experience of the immigration officials for Frontex and vice versa, which was not included in the original regulation."
"Furthermore, the proposed amendment suggests accessing the information obtained by the liaison officers' network through ICONet, which is a secure information and coordination network for the immigration management services of Member States, accessing the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officers' networks and, finally, facilitating a mechanism for the presentation of reports on the activity of the network and the designation of named regions of interest in the area of immigration."
"The relevant legal bases of the proposal are Article 63(3)(b) and Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"I will stop there, Madam President, and will make further observations in the second round."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would very much like to thank the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in general and, specifically, the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done on this very important dossier and I welcome the agreement reached with the Council."
"The suggested amendment will enable closer cooperation between Frontex and the immigration liaison officers' network and that will improve the information exchange via a web-based secure IT platform and ensure that the Council and Parliament are properly informed about the activities of these networks."
"Moreover, I am also pleased that, through the amendments put forward by Parliament, a human-rights based approach will be applied when reporting on the situation in matters related to irregular immigration in the selected third countries."
"Let me say that I fully agree with the rapporteur that we should use the word 'irregular' migration."
"Unfortunately, the Treaty in Article 79 refers to 'illegal' so that is why it is in there, but I myself also always use the term 'irregular' migration, so I fully agree with you."
"Thanks to the amendments to the regulatory framework that you have introduced, and in accordance with the Stockholm Programme, the liaison officers' networks will be adapted in a way that will improve their contribution to a better understanding of the root causes of migration movements with a view to addressing these phenomena properly."
"So I hope that when you vote tomorrow on the amended regulation, it will be adopted without any delay and thus enable us to exploit more efficiently this very important cooperation tool for migration management."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we always support proposals in Parliament that aim to respond to the need for the adequate management of legal as well as illegal or clandestine flows of migrants."
"This proposal is also part of this dynamic and aims to introduce amendments - already outlined with great authority by Mr Díaz de Mera - to Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers' network, in order to create the necessary synergies between this important instrument for cooperation and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), which was only created at a later stage."
"As representatives of the Member States abroad, it falls to the liaison officers - currently posted in more than 130 third countries - to maintain the necessary contacts with the authorities of the host country, so as to contribute to preventing and combating illegal immigration for returning illegal immigrants and managing legal immigration."
"As Frontex does not have permanent representatives outside Union territory, there is no longer any doubt about how important such cooperation has become."
"Frontex must, on the basis of information gathered by the liaison officers, go ahead with the risk analyses and with strengthening operational cooperation between Member States and third countries."
"The information obtained by these networks will then be transmitted using ICONet - a secure information network to coordinate the services responsible for the management of flows of migrants in Member States - and, at the same time, will enable these networks to benefit from the funds available from the European External Borders Fund."
"As Mr Díaz de Mera must already be wondering why I have not yet mentioned it, I should like to stress that he has done an excellent job, not just in terms of the quality and effort he has put in, as he always does with these reports, but also because of the efforts he has made towards reaching agreement on this important issue at first reading."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, in taking this opportunity to speak on behalf of the S&D shadow, Ms Guillaume, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, for having actively consulted all the shadows in his usual way and successfully pushed forward the negotiations with the Council."
"Whereas the Commission proposal consists of mostly technical modifications, this report has, in my view, allowed for a better understanding and consideration of the complexity and scope of the liaison officers' activities."
"Immigration Liaison Officers (ILOs) are indeed engaged in quite complex and opaque activities."
"It is therefore absolutely necessary - for reasons of transparency - to further a better exchange of information with the European Parliament, on the one hand, and organisations such as the UNHCR and the Asylum Support Office, on the other."
"It is also fundamental to include and promote the human rights orientated approach to the mission of ILOs, which the Commissioner has just mentioned."
"It is surely needless to recall that, in the context of addressing mixed migratory movements, the posting of ILOs in third countries may raise several concerns from a fundamental rights perspective, in particular, regarding the right of individuals to leave a country, including their own, and the right of asylum seekers to flee and find protection from persecution."
"Finally, on the heated debate concerning terminology, we have in the explanatory memorandum a satisfactory compromise for what seems to be an endless debate."
"I will finish by thanking Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra and saying that our group will fully support his report."
"Madam President, I would also like to join those who have expressed their appreciation of the efforts of the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera, as he created an atmosphere which allowed us to successfully discuss his proposed changes, to edit the most complex ones and to reach compromises which mean that we can now be pleased with our efforts."
"As a representative of the ALDE Group, I would first of all like to point out that the results achieved are largely due to the fact that on this occasion, the issue of human rights was integrated into the larger topic of immigration and the management of immigration processes."
"In this way, whilst observing human rights, we can guarantee an ongoing humane and fitting approach both by immigration officials and by Frontex staff."
"Secondly, a great merit of our work is that cooperation will improve, both among communications officials and between them and Frontex."
"And finally, Frontex will use our combined efforts to establish a new know-how which will be larger in scope and more varied in its functions."
"This know-how will be in the hands of the institutions and persons responsible to allow them to control immigration processes more effectively."
"And what makes more effective management of immigration processes necessary?"
"The fact that immigration processes will remain active and are likely to intensify in the near future."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I also would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, for his great work."
"The immigration liaison officers should not only be seen as 'facilitators of deportations' - which I would actually not like them to be seen as - they should closely monitor the human rights situation in the host countries and especially the protection offered to asylum seekers and returnees."
"I am very happy that our rapporteur managed to include a reference to human rights and reporting on human rights several times in the report - an aspect that was missing completely from the original proposal."
"I also welcome the greater role that is given to the European Parliament, being the only directly elected body at EU level and which has an even greater role now after the Lisbon Treaty - although not everybody seems to have realised that yet."
"Madam President, I should first of all like, as has already been said several times, to congratulate Mr Díaz de Mera on his excellent work, and on his cooperation and dialogue with us throughout this process: in particular, on the thorny issue of knowing whether the references that we have in this text, and in others, are to 'irregular immigrants' or 'illegal immigrants'."
"On this issue, the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera, had a very constructive and dynamic attitude."
"It is also true that the treaties and the position of the Council itself did not allow him to go further on this issue and establish a definition that was more wide-ranging, as well as more technically correct, for cases of irregular and undocumented immigrants."
"I believe that what is at stake here, and what has been at stake in many discussions that we have had on immigration in the European Parliament, is that we have a repressive policy on immigration that has been almost entirely completed, with nothing missing: the primary function of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), that of the Schengen Agreement, and even that of the liaison officers - which is currently being amended, as it has been before - is to control borders, which is a repressive function."
"Moreover, we all know here in Parliament, on the left and increasingly on the right, that an immigration policy which only includes repressive measures is not an immigration policy whatsoever, because an immigration policy worthy of this name also requires a legal section for legal immigration channels."
"I believe that if we were just voting on Mr Díaz de Mera's report, as such, with the ideas that he has been putting forward, I would be fully in favour."
"However, we are instead voting on the compromise with the Council, at first reading, so I believe that we have not gone as far as we could have gone with this."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, one of the totems of a sovereign state is that it controls who can and who cannot come into its own country."
"Unfortunately, several governments in the UK have given away this power to unelected, faceless bureaucrats in Brussels."
"What a disaster it has proven to be."
"We have a situation now where we have uncontrolled EU immigration into our country, which has resulted in wages being driven down and people - indigenous people - being put out of work."
"I do not believe that this EU immigration liaison officers' network has any power to stop this happening at all."
"We also have a two-tier immigration system in our country whereby if you are from Australia or New Zealand or anywhere else, you have a cap."
"However, if you are from Latvia or Poland or any of the EU countries, you can come to our country willy-nilly."
"This is fundamentally wrong."
"It is argued that this network will help control illegal immigration, but what happens if a country like Romania, for example, basically gives citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants?"
"What it does is it makes a mockery of the whole system."
"I support elected politicians in the UK having control over our own borders."
"What I do not support are unaccountable, unelected appointees."
"I believe that the strengthening of this network would not be necessary if each individual Member State had the power to control who does and who does not come onto its lands."
"I therefore implore everybody to reject this report."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Madam President, my fellow Member from the UK spoke of the difficulties British employees are facing as a result of immigration in their country."
"I come from Hungary, a country where a large number of people are unfortunately forced to move to England to find work, for example, as nurses or doctors or other qualified healthcare workers, as salaries in Hungary are extremely low."
"These people were trained in Hungary, at a very high standard, and Hungary is seeing the collapse of ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, if doctors and dentists and people like that want to come to the UK to work - and we need their skills - then by all means they should come, but what we have at the moment is a situation where our market is saturated: we cannot control who comes from the EU and who does not."
"This is fundamentally wrong."
"It is bad and it is putting people out of work."
"I shall give you an example."
"The taxi driver who drove me to the airport this morning was a bricklayer who has been laid off as a result of Polish people coming onto the site, undercutting British workers, and now he is driving a taxi."
"That cannot be right."
"(NL) Madam President, it goes without saying that every agency working in the fight against illegal immigration can count on my support."
"If immigration liaison officers can make the work of, for example, Frontex more efficient, then that is a positive thing."
"I would like to stress that we should not spend so much time staring at institutional and bureaucratic processes that we can no longer see the wood for the trees."
"The problem of illegal immigration is a political problem and one that requires political will if we are to come up with solutions to it."
"Well, we have found out today that there are still Member States, such as Belgium, which reward illegal immigration, for political and ideological reasons."
"They are rewarding illegal immigrants by regularising their status or granting them residence permits."
"That way, illegal immigration is not combated, but actively encouraged."
"We can have as many immigration liaison officers and Frontex staff as we want but, in the meantime, the problem will just keep on getting worse."
"What annoys me most about the present report is the recommendation that we should no longer speak of 'illegal immigration', but of 'irregular immigration', as it is now called."
"Well, I just cannot get my head around that: we seem to want to solve the problem by giving it another name or by pretending that the problem no longer exists."
"This is positively Orwellian."
"Let us just call a spade a spade; let us be clear and refer to illegal immigration and illegal immigrants."
"(EL) Madam President, the mere fact that almost everyone today has congratulated our rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, and all the shadow rapporteurs who worked on this endeavour, illustrates the very serious effort made and the excellent results achieved and, of course, I too congratulate them all."
"Today's debate is extremely important because it illustrates the effort we are making, at European level now, to manage legal, non-legal and illegal immigration flows, the effort we are making to coordinate and really demonstrate our solidarity between Member States and to make better use of all the instruments at our disposal."
"We have created the immigration liaison officers' network."
"As we have already heard, this network involves approximately 130 countries and allows us to obtain sound information."
"We created Frontex, we recently created the European asylum support office, we signed the readmission agreement, we are making use of all the European funds at our disposal and are strengthening them as much as we can year on year."
"The very fact that we have now arrived at a point where we make use of and combine these tools - in other words, we see what Frontex's requirements are, link up with the network of liaison officers and combine all the means and instruments at our disposal even more closely - illustrates that we are moving forward more efficiently."
"Of course, no one can say that we have reached our target level."
"When you see that, in Greece, we have 90% of illegal entries of immigrants into Europe, that alone shows that we have a great deal to do."
"However, this cooperation and the facilities that we have prove that we can move forward even more efficiently."
"They allow us to be optimistic, insofar as we can, that Europe has the facilities and that, with solidarity and close cooperation by one and all, we shall be able to achieve even better results in future."
"Rest assured, Commissioner, that we shall support all such efforts on the part of the Commission."
"Have no doubt that we shall support all such initiatives on your part."
"(DE) Madam President, as we are aware, the officers of the Frontex border guard agency carry out important work as part of the operational cooperation between the Member States and third countries to combat illegal immigration."
"In my opinion, this needs to be effectively combated in the transit countries in particular."
"A dense network of immigration liaison officers and their close cooperation is therefore a sensible measure to enable us effectively to combat mass immigration into Europe with all its negative consequences for the peoples of Europe."
"It must be ensured, however, that the information and assessments provided by liaison officers are made available to Frontex and the national authorities as quickly as possible and without any red tape."
"In general, we definitely need greater cooperation on immigration issues between all the actors."
"In my opinion, the powers of Frontex should be enhanced as quickly as possible - with the consent of the Member States - in order to be able to ensure that its work is uniform and effective, particularly at the external borders."
"(MT) Madam President, as the rapporteur for the Frontex Regulation, I am happy to welcome the latest development that has been made to the law that we have before us, as it will help us throughout the process of strengthening the Frontex agency."
"My report on the agency and on the changes that need to be made to its remit was actually presented last month and the deadline by which the amendments need to be made expires this very week."
"Therefore, I augur that in the coming months - January and February - the LIBE Committee will adopt the amendments on the Frontex report, and that we will be able to conclude it within the Committee."
"I then hope that we would be able to initiate the process towards closing this dossier as swiftly as possible."
"Nonetheless, the fact that we are going to have these immigration liaison officers that will facilitate the communication of information to Frontex is an extremely positive development."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report could have received a favourable vote, but unfortunately it has been modified by what we consider to be avoidable and unnecessary amendments, which have replaced the words 'illegal' and 'clandestine' with the word 'irregular', almost as if there were a fear of saying things as they really are."
"On a positive note, however, the report provides for the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers posted to consular authorities and to international organisations, with responsibility for preventing illegal immigration and facilitating the repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"Furthermore, the direct exchange of information on illegal migration flows between States, embassies and international organisations may prove useful in combating the activities of criminal networks."
"Too many lives have been destroyed."
"Preventing trafficking in human beings is one of the challenges that the EU must overcome."
"(DE) Madam President, the Member States send immigration liaison officers to third countries in order to combat illegal immigration in contact with the authorities in those countries."
"I therefore consider cooperation between these officers and Frontex to be urgently necessary."
"We need a meaningful exchange of information and best practice, and we also need to avoid having duplicate structures."
"I hope that such synergies will result in more efficient border controls - particularly since Frontex has no external officers of its own in third countries."
"A key element of this cooperation must be the consistent processing of readmission agreements, whether in Eastern Europe or on the continent of Africa, because chaos reigns in the EU where the repatriation of illegal immigrants is concerned."
"Some Member States proceed with great vigour, while others are very sluggish."
"Naturally, this then has negative implications for all the Member States."
"There is therefore an urgent need to act."
"Frontex needs to be bolstered, and the EU also needs to force authorities in the Member States to fulfil their responsibilities."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report and the proposal behind it clearly serve, and are intended to prepare, the promotion and facilitation of immigration, which we consider unacceptable."
"The creation of a network of immigration liaison officers is one more step towards a centralised measure controlled by the European Union that serves the spreading of immigrants and refugees."
"Furthermore, it is unacceptable that they intend to replace the term 'illegal immigration' with 'irregular immigration,' thereby attempting to further legitimise this otherwise illegal act."
"The peoples of Europe have had enough of the flood of immigrants, and we would welcome it if the elected Members sitting in this House also acknowledged this."
"Unfortunately, I can say no more about this report than that it is a caricature of itself."
"What is embodied in this report is a caricature of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, the amendment to the regulation facilitates the exchange of information 'to manage legal and illegal immigration'."
"I do not want to manage it: I want to stop it."
"Migration is based on the false assumption that we are the products of our culture and that exposure to European culture will transform non-Europeans into Europeans in the second generation, if not the first."
"Distinct peoples are not the product of distinct cultures: distinct cultures are the product of distinct peoples."
"Bring the populations of the Third World into Europe and you will be bringing the Third World into Europe - not temporarily, but for all time."
"That is what we have been doing for the last six decades."
"(HU) Madam President, now would be the time for us to finally try to find and remedy the root causes of the issue of immigration."
"For human reasons, I propose the introduction of everyone's right to reside in their native land, in their home country, and appropriate economic and other conditions should be created in the world, including in countries considered second-rate EU Member States, to ensure that people can live in the country that is their homeland."
"To continue my previous train of thought, the healthcare system in Hungary has collapsed, or is on the brink of collapse, as Hungarian doctors, nurses and employees with healthcare qualifications are forced to migrate en masse within the EU, to England, for example, as well as to other countries, essentially becoming economic refugees."
"It would be time to investigate this phenomenon and take action to combat it, for example, by requiring Member States, where necessary, to ensure an appropriate livelihood for qualified doctors and nurses."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, even if the debate did not show it, I understand, Mr Díaz de Mera, that you have very strong support for your proposal."
"I would like to congratulate you on that because it shows that you have done very important work."
"I also want to reiterate my joy that you have reinforced the human rights aspects in this through the amendments made by the committee."
"It will ensure that all relevant aspects, especially human rights, are taken into consideration when we look at a country or a region and when we report matters in relation to irregular migration in the given country or region."
"We know that there is a very clear correlation between the human rights situation and the number of migrants or asylum seekers."
"This is a major push factor."
"This is also a task for the Asylum Support Office."
"It will collect such information on countries of origin and transit of asylum seekers."
"The core function of ILOs - the liaison officers - is to establish and maintain contact with the host countries' authorities with a view to preventing and combating irregular migration."
"Providing a full assessment of the human rights situation in the host country, however, is not within their competence, although it is high on the agenda."
"I think that we have improved the text with your proposal and I very much look forward to your vote tomorrow."
"I would like to thank you and the shadow rapporteurs again for your important work."
"Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your words, and also for your commitment."
"I would once again like to express my admiration for the way that you are managing the portfolio with which you have been entrusted."
"There have been 18 speeches this afternoon, and the majority groups have supported this report."
"I would therefore like to reiterate my deep and heartfelt gratitude, because they have participated actively, enriching and amending substantive issues that should be included and are now included."
"I am essentially referring to the human rights chapter, the European Asylum Support Office and the role of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees."
"Obviously, in such a broad and diverse Chamber, we are not obliged to agree with one another, which is why the efforts that we have all made to reach a very broad consensus are particularly significant."
"Ladies and gentlemen, from a centre-right and Christian Democrat position, I am indeed saying that I am unequivocally in favour of the expression 'irregular', and that I reject the expression 'illegal', as legally, semantically and ethically inappropriate."
"Thank you very much to all my fellow Members for their support, and also for their speeches, including the dissenting ones."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 14 December."
"Single application procedure for residence and work (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Véronique Mathieu, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State - C6-0470/2007 -."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has, for ten years now, been trying to arm itself with legislative instruments in the area of economic immigration."
"Instead of an initially global approach, the Commission has preferred a sectoral approach."
"This draft directive brings to light the need for a common policy on legal immigration, particularly of the economic variety."
"Until now, we have legislated on illegal immigration, border controls, visa policy."
"It is time to move forward together on the subject of economic migration, because the European Union must face up to the challenges common to all its Member States; challenges that require common solutions at the European level."
"These challenges are demographic decline and the ageing of Europe's population."
"In fact, due to these two problems that affect Europe in its entirety, global employment forecasts are showing up perceptible workforce shortages in the years to come."
"We must therefore find solutions at the European level to meet the needs of the labour market, and economic migration is one of the solutions that we must explore."
"Let us take care, however, and not deceive ourselves."
"Defining a European approach to the management of legal immigration means organising it with obvious attention to the needs and hosting capacities of each Member State."
"As is stated in Articles 1 and 8 of this draft directive, states will retain control over the number of migrants that they wish to admit onto their national territory."
"Our governments have worked in various ways to regulate economic immigration: by means of bilateral agreements, quotas, regulatory measures."
"Not one of these measures, however, has shown itself to be truly effective in managing legal migration flows while, at the same time, combating illegal immigration."
"Now, the link between the two is obvious."
"It is by organising legal immigration in the best way possible that we shall be able to put an end to illegal immigration."
"That is the whole issue behind the adoption of this package of measures already introduced by the Commission no less than five years ago."
"What will this 'Single Permit' Directive bring to the existing legal landscape in the area of economic migration?"
"By contrast with the 'Blue Card' Directive, this directive does not concern the admission criteria for third-country workers."
"It is aimed at eliminating the variations between differing national legislation concerning the application procedures for work permits and residence permits, and the rights of foreigners working legally in the European Union."
"There is still no European instrument covering the totality of rights available to third-country nationals working and residing legally in the Union."
"This directive will therefore put an end to these differences in protection for these workers by ensuring equality of treatment with national workers in a significant number of areas: working conditions, education and professional training, social protection, access to goods and services, tax reliefs."
"In this way, this common base will offer these people protection against exploitation by guaranteeing them the benefit of a secure and protective legal status."
"It is also a way of combating unfair competition that works to the detriment of European workers."
"In fact, this difference in protection will eventually tend to encourage the recruitment of a poorly qualified and weakly protected labour force at the expense of European workers."
"Moreover, this directive will simplify admission procedures for employment purposes."
"All Member States will have a harmonised procedure that is simpler, quicker and less onerous."
"The adoption of this directive will thus result in major advantages for migrants, for employers and national administrations, and will finally enable better management of legal migration flows."
"Parliament is now a colegislator, which means that it must also demonstrate responsibility - an idealistic and bygone opinion - and we must show that we have risen to the level of the new duties that the Treaty of Lisbon has given us."
"Let us come forward as credible spokespeople ready to rise to the sizeable challenge represented by the management of migratory pressure at the frontiers of Europe."
"We know that well-managed migratory flows will be of benefit to everyone."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Mathieu and Mr Cercas, the two committees, as well as the Belgian Presidency, for the hard work that has been done on this proposal."
"As you are aware, and as the rapporteur said, the Commission already presented this report in 2007."
"Our aim was, and is still, to simplify procedures by introducing one permit for residence and work, while guaranteeing employment-related rights to legally residing third-country workers who are not covered by specific EU legislation or Commission proposals."
"With this proposal, we do not address the conditions for granting or withdrawing a permit."
"Such conditions are the competence of the Member States, as is the decision on volumes to admit - if any."
"This proposal is one of the building blocks of the European Union's labour and migration policy."
"If it is adopted by Parliament and the Council, this directive will confirm that the European Union values the important contribution third-country workers make to our economies and our societies."
"It would also demonstrate that we are ready and able to agree on legislation concerning labour and migration."
"It is a very complex proposal and it addresses both the immigration side and the social employment side."
"The majority of the amendments voted in the respective committees of this House can be supported by the Commission to the extent that they reinforce procedural guarantees for both the migrants and the employers."
"This is in relation to amendments geared towards further simplifying the application procedures and strengthening the equal treatment provisions - for example, the principle of proportionality of fees as regards procedures and the equal treatment provisions on tax benefits."
"On the other side, the amendment that makes the export of acquired pensions conditional upon the existence of a bilateral agreement is much more restrictive compared to the approach proposed by the Commission."
"I am pleased to see that both the Presidency and Parliament have made important efforts to bring their positions closer."
"The Belgian Presidency has tried to have Member States come closer to the EP position, and I know that Parliament has taken into account a number of the concerns and requests by the Council."
"The compromise we are all trying to achieve will respect certain criteria, such as the aim to protect migrant workers and to provide them with a series of work-related socio-economic rights on the basis, as much as possible, of equal treatment with EU workers as from day one of employment."
"It will also take account of the importance of creating a level playing field throughout the EU for these workers and, thirdly, the importance of showing our partner countries that we are ready to provide for the fair treatment of third country nationals legally residing and working in our Member States."
"We cannot disregard Member States' concerns relating to certain equal treatment provisions, especially when it comes to budgetary concentration."
"What I believe important is that those criteria I have just highlighted are respected, even though the end result may not be as ideal as we wanted and as ambitious as we had hoped for."
"As Mrs Mathieu said, this is a compromise."
"It is a good compromise and it marks an important step forward in the area of legal migration and will be of high importance to the workers of the European Union."
"Let me therefore express my hope that we can reach an agreement on this proposal as soon as possible."
"I again thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for the work that has been done."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Mathieu, ladies and gentlemen, immigration in Europe is undoubtedly a highly important and hugely significant political, economic and social issue."
"It is a massive opportunity, but it requires intelligent, fair management, as otherwise it would become a problem, not only for those arriving, as they would not be treated fairly, but also for the workers who are here whose jobs would be threatened."
"The alternative is that the labour market would be split and divided, and there would be 'low cost' workers threatening the social victories won over a century of building the European social model."
"Consequently, Commissioner, Mrs Mathieu, the principle of equal treatment is the cornerstone of an economic immigration policy that is both intelligent and fair."
"The Council said so in Tampere 11 years ago, the Commission said so five years ago in its Green Paper, and tomorrow, Parliament must vote on a proposal for a legislative initiative."
"This subject of equal treatment is the focus of Chapter III of the directive."
"It is not just a bureaucratic directive."
"It lays out rights and obligations, which should apply to all legal immigrants, and it should encompass all rights to equal treatment and non-discrimination."
"Unfortunately, however, Commissioner, the directive is not the one that we were promised."
"It is not I or the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who are saying that, but all of the humanitarian non-governmental organisations, all the churches in Europe and all the trade unions, without exception."
"This directive is inadequate and even dangerous, because it excludes the very groups that most need protection; it excludes temporary workers, displaced people, those transferred by their companies, and workers from less developed countries who will be coming here under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Mode 4."
"Hundreds of thousands of workers are therefore going to arrive from third countries in accordance with the country of origin principle, because they are not going to be treated equally by this directive."
"This is also because you are giving the Member States the option to opt out of equal treatment with regard to payment of pensions when they return to their countries, to family benefits and to welfare benefits for the unemployed, except for unemployment benefit itself."
"This will even apply to workers who are subject to the principle of equal treatment and who are covered by what Mrs Mathieu said."
"They are also excluded from grants and any type of assistance for higher education, including professional training."
"For all these reasons, the Commission states in the explanatory memorandum and the impact assessment that it intends to eliminate and put an end to the 'rights gap', but in practice, it does not do so."
"This is not enough, Commissioner."
"Moreover, unfortunately we have amendments tomorrow tabled by the right and centre-right groups in this House that go further, as you said, and which even adopt the Council's most extreme positions in order to destroy the consensus that we had built in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I therefore believe, Commissioner, Mrs Mathieu, ladies and gentlemen, that we need to have a much broader debate on this issue, along with the other directives, that is open to European civil society, the NGOs, the churches and the unions."
"We must not deal with this issue so quickly and, in my view, so irresponsibly as we would if we adopted the Council's text tomorrow."
"I believe that the majority of my fellow Members across party divides would agree to conducting a broad debate in order to reach a wide consensus in Parliament that respects the principles of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and that follows the recommendations of the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe."
"We are talking about people's dignity, but also about the future of Europe, and I believe that in Europe, we need all workers, without exception, whatever their origins, to have all rights to the exclusion of none if they are living legally in Europe."
"This is the way to combat xenophobia and racism and fight for a decent Europe."
"Madam President, may I, first of all, congratulate Mrs Mathieu on having been able to take the lead on a dossier which had been knocking around for years."
"If I have understood you correctly, Mrs Malmström, a proposal for a directive on the conditions governing stays by third-country nationals in the European Union for work purposes was made as early as 2001."
"That proposal was withdrawn in 2006, whereupon this proposal was tabled in 2007, with this unique procedure for citizens of third countries entering the EU in order to work here."
"As a result, residence and work permits are being combined into one."
"Madam President, the proposal now on the table - and I do not entirely agree with Mr Cercas - indicates that third-country nationals who are in possession of a single permit have social rights which are, in fact, the same for everyone."
"The debate in the Committee on Social Affairs and the Environment - and I thank my fellow member Mr Cercas, because I am happy to discuss this with him - became quite heated on two points. Primarily because of the scope, whereby - and this is something with which I agree - posted workers cannot, or may not, qualify for a single permit."
"That is described in Article 3(2)(b) of Directive 96/71/EC, also known as the Posting of Workers Directive."
"In my view, the social status of posted third-country nationals is, and was, adequately described in that directive."
"What I thought then and still think is important is that we create a level-playing field, where employees on loan will not be allowed to work for a lower wage than the usual staff."
"However, I wonder if, in failing to mention the Posting of Workers Directive, we might be causing ourselves problems in the future."
"My second point, with which I have struggled a great deal and which has now been modified as a result of my amendment, is the principle of breaching equality of treatment."
"I was and still am of the opinion that this principle, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 883, must also be our starting point when it comes to this single permit."
"I find that the compromise which the Council has reached is a good one, because it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment."
"Madam President, the directive on a single permit for residence and work really is very important."
"There were many discussions, many opinions and many assessments, but a joint decision that would be acceptable for all third-country workers legally residing and working in EU Member States has not been reached."
"This directive should be a general framework directive on rights for third-country workers and should serve as a framework for specific directives, because only then can it contribute to the European Union goal of a common migration policy."
"However, the main problem is the fact that the framework of the directive we were promised was already removed from the Commission's proposal, as certain categories of workers, such as temporary workers, intra-company transfers and refugees were deleted from its contents."
"In other words, this directive does not strengthen the principle of legal equivalence for third-country workers."
"For this directive to be a point of reference and a framework, it is necessary to include all workers within the scope of the directive, in particular, temporary workers, because otherwise, migrants legally residing and working in the European Union would not enjoy working conditions based on the principles of justice, uniformity and equality."
"It should be noted that migrant workers make a contribution to the EU economy through their work and the taxes and social security contributions they pay."
"Therefore, they must be guaranteed the same minimum rights and be treated in the same way in the labour market."
"If we vote on this directive tomorrow, we must be united, because only then can we win this struggle for all groups of workers to be included in this directive and for them to have equal rights."
"I would like to stress that it is impossible to create a two-tier labour market, either within or outside the European Union."
"We must not allow the creation of an underclass of workers that faces discrimination and does not enjoy any rights or guarantees."
"If we do, we will be trampling over all the social standards we gained previously."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to start with a little point of order: I note that for such an important debate, our partner in the negotiations, the Council, is absent."
"I find that unacceptable."
"It is not the first time and I request the Presidency of this House to write to the Council and complain about this."
"(Applause)"
"Then I would like to go on and, like the others, congratulate Mrs Mathieu for doing a very good job on a very difficult, complex and sensitive dossier."
"My group, the ALDE Group, will accept its responsibility and we, too, want to arrive at an agreement because we realise that it is very important."
"However, we do not do so with great joy because, as I think has been expressed in different ways by all the groups in this House and by the Commission, this proposal does not go nearly as far as is necessary."
"My group will stick to its position on the additional documents because, if we allow Member States to require additional documents, then that defeats the whole purpose of the single permit; either you have a single permit or you do not but, if you have a single permit, there are no additional documents."
"On the correlation tables, for the sake of arriving at an agreement, my group will not vote for the insertion of correlation tables."
"But I have to say - this is a personal remark - that I find this a shameful red line by the Member States because, if the Member States have the intention of transposing the directive and being transparent about it, they should - of their own free will - insert correlation tables."
"Finally, in 1999 in Tampere, the Member States came out with this grand statement that they wanted a common asylum and immigration policy."
"Well, how much progress have we made to date?"
"Hardly any."
"It is very clear that the Member States do not want a common immigration policy."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, we, too, have a concern about the variable labour market that we already have across 27 Member States and within those 27 Member States, but our concern is how we move away from this towards something which is more comprehensive and stronger."
"We want to be sure that we have an agreed basis of rights for the majority of third-country nationals, as originally set out by the Commission and generally improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We do not want to see these rights increasingly restrained and constrained, so we will support the widest possible and strongest range of rights in tomorrow's vote."
"We want to remind the Council that we are concerned here with individuals who should be able to develop their skills and education, benefit from the social security contributions they make and look forward to claiming their pension entitlements, given, as is recognised in the proposal, that their work supports our economies and indeed our societies."
"For our group, the commitment to circular migration is also important in Article 11(a)."
"The scope is a vexed issue because we have other existing instruments under discussion which, at times, come into tension."
"We are also fooling ourselves if we think that what is on the table here is actually going to meet the needs of each and every migrant worker within the European Union."
"We need a more nuanced approach to ensure that migration works for them, so we are not going to be voting, for example, to include beneficiaries of humanitarian protection."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as Mr Cercas put it so well, there is a difference of opinion between the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Parliament must therefore vote against what is called the 'Single Permit' Directive."
"Fundamentally, this text has but one aim, which is easy to spot, and that is to make workers in the European Union compete against workers from countries outside Europe, and even make immigrant workers compete against each other, depending on their status."
"If this directive remains as it is, there will be several kinds of status: that of a resident, that of a seasonal worker, that of an intra-corporate transferee."
"It would make the existence of several categories of workers in the European Union official."
"Accepting this would violate the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Contrary to what you said, Mrs Mathieu, such differences in status would result in permanent downward pressure on the living, working and employment conditions of all wage earners in the European Union."
"Equality cannot be summed up by merely invoking working conditions."
"As Mr Cercas said, equality must involve wages, working hours, security of employment, health, holidays, social protection, access to public services and training."
"Without this common minimum, we shall have a jungle of competition, stigmatisation, exclusion and exploitation without limit."
"Equality must involve all workers, whatever their origin."
"Let us not accept the addition of new types of competition between workers, on top of those introduced by the appalling Bolkestein Directive."
"Equality among workers must be the objective of a single positive directive, affirming this principle."
"In its absence, it is in the name of the Europe of workers, of social Europe, of a humanist Europe, that all of us together in this Parliament, whatever our opinions, reject this directive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report in question certainly contains some positive elements, and the general aim is to simplify processes and reduce the bureaucratic steps for third-country workers who hold a valid residence permit in a Member State."
"However, as a discussion point, I would like to mention the fact that, today in Europe, tens of millions of citizens - very many of whom are young - are without work as a result of structural deficiencies in the European productive system and as a result of a crisis which does not seem to have an end in sight."
"Europe's primary responsibility, even before assisting third-country nationals residing in our countries, is to implement economic, political and social measures which will help our citizens, in the first instance, to gain, or regain, work."
"If Europe can provide work for its own citizens, it will create firm social foundations so that external migration flows can be accommodated properly."
"The key point must be to ensure, above all, that Europe grows independently and stands on its own two feet."
"Our countries will then have the strength to offer work to others as well."
"(NL) Madam President, my party has always made it clear that we oppose a European asylum and immigration policy."
"In the Netherlands, we now have a fantastic cabinet which has been better able to implement the will of the people in the areas of asylum and immigration than before, but we have now simply been presented with a fait accompli."
"Nevertheless, my party, the delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), will always strive to ensure that these powers are transferred back to Member States."
"The important thing to do in the meantime, of course, is to limit the damage, but that is not what this report is trying to achieve: the new application procedure actually makes it easier, not tougher, for people to enter the European Union."
"Madam President, only an elitist political class which is completely out of touch with its citizens could manage to leave those citizens, who witness the disastrous effects of mass immigration of non-Western migrants on a daily basis, out in the cold."
"I will vote against this report because I have been elected by the Dutch and not by fortune-seekers who want to taste Western pleasures without embracing Judeo-Christian values."
"(MT) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Véronique Mathieu for all the effort she put into achieving this result."
"She carried out very important work on an extremely complex subject, as Commissioner Malmström said."
"As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), we endorse cooperation in the area of legal immigration as long as we make it clear that we are simultaneously sharpening our attack against illegal immigration."
"I believe the one cannot exist without the other."
"Nevertheless, at the same time, we also recognise that one of the tools that can be used to combat illegal immigration is to provide good and clear opportunities for regularised immigration, just as we are doing in this case."
"However, I would also like to recall, as Véronique Mathieu said, that the new powers granted to us in this area by the Treaty of Lisbon brought with them new obligations."
"Therefore, since we are required to shoulder these new responsibilities, this Parliament must do just that, by proving that it is capable of compromising with the Council of Ministers."
"This requires accepting some Council positions, such as the safeguards that it would like to keep in the issuing of these permits according to this directive."
"This, I believe, raises the issue of equal treatment."
"We have to acknowledge that in order to reach an agreement with the Council, then we must inevitably accept that the conditions will not necessarily always be the same."
"At the same time, however, and I conclude here, those who claim that we are rushing ahead or who are ready to vote against should appreciate that without such a directive, we will end up in an illegal situation that will definitely not dignify any of the workers who find themselves in it."
"Madam President, I think my colleagues from the S&D Group, Mr Cercas and Mrs Blinkevičiūtė, both referred to the central problem for our group in this package: it is not just about equal treatment or the country-of-origin principle - as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten said, that has been debated very extensively."
"There is also the question of the illogicality of where we are today."
"We have a single permit proposal which comes after the skilled workers proposal, the blue card, and comes after sanctions on employers."
"That means we have a package which has many of the correct intentions, such as having a horizontal approach."
"However, we are not having a horizontal approach because we are in a situation where Mrs Mathieu is doing a good job with what she has but, as she said in her speech, we wanted a global approach but we now have a sectoral approach, and that sectoral approach is exactly what Mrs Lambert was concerned about."
"So where are we today?"
"Our group has deep concerns in the employment sphere on the country-of-origin principle and, as my colleague Mrs Blinkevičiūtsaid, we have a real problem with the categories of workers who are included in this proposal."
"So we have a situation where posted workers, intra-corporate transferees, seasonal workers and - yes - beneficiaries of international protection are all excluded."
"We will present these amendments again tomorrow on behalf of our group."
"If you have a single permit which does not do what it says on the tin - i.e. it does not have a reasonably broad-based approach to entry for third-country nationals to the European Union - you will face problems of equal treatment, of a two-tier work force and other problems that we want to solve with common policies."
"On the other hand, we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in particular appreciate that the sectoral approach is the approach we have to work with, so there will be directives on seasonal workers and intra-corporate transferees, but you cannot blame our group, which has equal treatment on the country-of-origin principle at the heart of its activities in trying to resolve these matters."
"We are telling the truth, which is that we are doing things in the wrong way and we are doing it because of the people who are not present today to listen to our arguments: the representatives of the Council."
"The Council did not want to deal with this in a horizontal way and we are left with this kind of piecemeal approach."
"So on the single permit, we understand the good intentions and the global approach and the work of the rapporteur in trying to make this work, but we will present our amendments tomorrow in good faith in the hope that we can obtain a single permit which says what it is: a single permit covering the broad range of people who seek to work in this European Union."
"We want to make it a realistic single permit that will really work for all Member States and will stand the test of time."
"(DE) Madam President, I have now been in Parliament for a year and I have dealt with various dossiers, but none of them have been as difficult as what we have on the table here."
"At this point, I would like to offer my sincere thanks once again to Mrs Mathieu and Mr Cercas, the two rapporteurs from the relevant committees."
"This really is a very difficult matter, and the reason for this is that naturally we have very high ideals in Europe."
"We want to treat everyone who lives and works here fairly and equally."
"That, in principle, is something we can all agree on as a starting point."
"However, the question remains as to how much we can really implement this in detail."
"We have already been reminded that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we now wish to draw up a common policy on asylum and migration."
"Asylum policy is something close to our hearts, and not just because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We also need a migration policy for economic reasons, because demographic changes are taking place and we have a very urgent need not just for highly qualified workers, but also for less skilled workers."
"Basically, the great difficulty here is what to do."
"As has already been said - Mrs in 't Veld mentioned it - the Member States stated back in 1990 in Tampere that they wanted to develop a common structure."
"Nothing has yet been placed on the table."
"In other words, what we have today is a compromise - we are not completely happy with it, but in my view, it is a way for us to move forward."
"Speaking personally, I can well understand why some are saying that we need more time for discussion."
"I am not completely happy with it either."
"It is particularly important to me, for example, that everyone should have access to training and further education, because this is absolutely crucial - not just for the persons concerned, so that they can work in the labour market, but also for us with our real need for workers."
"In the case of social security, for example, where we already have so many different systems anyway that have not even been harmonised within the EU, it raises the question of how we can really create a common set of rights for third country nationals in all cases even if we want to."
"It is difficult, and that is why I see the compromise that is currently on the table as a good thing."
"We really should vote in favour; then at least we will have something."
"(FR) Madam President, it has to be said that it is extremely odd to begin a directive which is intended to guarantee a legal framework for proper access to rights for all workers with a long list of the categories of workers excluded from that directive."
"That makes it seem like a project for legal migration but also for a multi-layered European labour market, where each category of workers would be assigned, according to their worth, a sort of portfolio of rights."
"We are therefore a long way from a horizontal and universal approach to workers' rights."
"I think that those responsible in Europe have still not understood that more rights for workers means greater economic efficiency and greater social cohesion, with greater individual and collective benefits, of course, for migrants, for the host societies and for the societies of origin."
"Indeed, this has been shown in a study by the London School of Economics which says that regularising 600 000 irregular workers in Great Britain, who will not have access to this single application procedure, would bring GBP 3 billion into Great Britain's coffers."
"We are not, I think, at all equal to the challenges."
"(HU) Madam President, we all know that economic immigration is a real phenomenon in the Member States of the European Union."
"However, the presence of third-country workers must be evaluated with at least two considerations in mind."
"The issue primarily manifests as an economic necessity, as demographic and labour market trends indicate that European societies need immigrant labour."
"Thus, it is in our interest to ensure that immigration takes place legally, under regulated circumstances, and that Member States have the possibility to monitor the process, while immigrants experience legal certainty, meaning that there should be no advantages to be gained from circumventing legal procedures."
"I believe that the part of the directive that concerns common rights, that is to say, the equal rights of immigrants and employees who are nationals of the Member State concerned, is very important."
"At this point, I would also like to draw attention to the other, cultural aspect of the issue."
"The presence of immigrants with different cultural customs and traditions is a source of tension in many Member States."
"I am convinced that the provision of equal rights cannot stop at the prohibition of discrimination on the labour market."
"I believe that the issue calls for a more subtle approach."
"This is because legal immigrant workers do not only bring an additional source of labour into Europe, they do not only wish to work here, but also want to study, start families, raise children and lead full lives."
"Should Europe decide therefore that economic immigration is the solution to the imbalances caused by the demographic situation, it must not disregard the cultural dimension of the issue."
"The success of multiculturalism presupposes tolerance, mutual respect and solidarity."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the solution that we are discussing is an erroneous solution, that it is highly unfair to many vulnerable people and that, in some ways, it is also self-destructive, because it will not have escaped anyone's attention - and this point has already been made - that there is a contradiction between discussing a single permit and beginning with waivers and exceptions."
"Excluding posted workers, seasonal workers and refugees from the solution in question actually undermines the uniformity of rights, both employment rights and citizens' rights."
"And there is an even more negative development: not only are we looking at a solution which could pave the way for forms of dumping, because the costs will differ in each case, but it will also make a distinction between one citizen and another."
"This Parliament will need to discuss later on the issue of working conditions for seasonal workers."
"Commissioner, seasonal workers are not just foreign citizens; they are European citizens too, and if material conditions and citizenship rights distinguish one from the other, it is inevitable that businesses will seek second-rate solutions when employing them."
"As far as posted workers are concerned, can you imagine the kind of situation that will be created in our global market if large multinational companies are allowed to hire people to come to work in our countries, but on the terms and conditions applicable in their countries of origin?"
"A new, but extremely negative situation will be created."
"Dumping will not be the only everyday occurrence; distinctions will be made between citizens, too, and this is something that Europe has never experienced, not even in its most recent history."
"Unity is fundamental and, for this reason, the provision should be radically overhauled."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear: is this the agreement that we wanted?"
"The answer is 'no'."
"Many of us in Parliament would like to have gone further, but I believe that this is a step in the right direction, for two reasons in particular: firstly, because we are currently creating a new instrument aimed at benefiting the nationals of third countries who wish to immigrate to the territory of Member States by conferring upon them a set of rights; secondly, as Mrs Mathieu has already said, because of the political message that we are sending overseas, which counteracts the idea of a Fortress Europe that is only able to adopt repressive measures and strengthen security, while, at the same time, we are responding to the concerns expressed in the Stockholm Programme regarding the creation of flexible immigration policies in order to promote the Union's economic development."
"I therefore agree with Mrs Mathieu that an agreement urgently needs to be reached with the Council and, while I share Mrs in 't Veld's view that many Member States do not want to discuss any sort of common immigration policy, this makes it important to take the first step."
"Let us be clear: the abolition of internal borders between Member States has made it essential to harmonise national legislations on the conditions of admission and residence for third-country nationals, to guarantee them equality of treatment, and to ensure that they are guaranteed rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens."
"Furthermore, I believe that the creation of a single application procedure for a residency and work permit will be of benefit in efficiency terms, for both migrants and employers, and that it will also make it easier to monitor the legality of their residence and employment."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to date, access to employment has been regulated only for a few specific categories of third-country nationals."
"Indeed, not everyone benefits from the general principle of equality of treatment in access to employment."
"As a result, the European Union must take steps to guarantee equal treatment both for third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State and for those who qualify for refugee status or who require international protection, pursuant to Council Directive 2004/83 of 29 April 2004."
"We need to prevent a growth in demand, for example, for seasonal workers, just because they can be paid less and because they have different - lower - costs with respect to European citizens employed to do the same job."
"We must also avoid, for example, the risk of many multinational companies transferring their headquarters to countries such as Morocco or Turkey and sending their employees to work in European branches because it is cheaper."
"For reasons of social justice, we must ensure that European citizens are treated equally in terms of remuneration, working conditions and social security."
"For this reason, I believe that it is right to include seasonal workers, posted workers, refugees and self-employed workers in this directive."
"It would be extremely dangerous to make distinctions."
"(FI) Mr President, over the centuries, people have left Europe for reasons of work and to escape war and political and religious persecution, and now Europe, with its stability, attracts people from outside Europe, and that is a good thing."
"It is excellent that the rules on lawful immigration are being harmonised within the EU so that residence and work permits are combined into just one permit."
"That is a good thing."
"In my opinion, however, the Commission's approach is rather less judicious, because it has chosen one that is sector specific."
"It guarantees different rights for different groups."
"It has become such a jungle that even the experts find it hard to discover what European policy on immigration actually is."
"We have employees who have been sent here, employees with blue cards, researchers, seasonal workers, company employees who have been transferred internally, and so on."
"Why can the Commission not apply the same rules to all employees?"
"It has become evident on many an occasion that a lot of migrant groups are not treated equally, and that is very difficult to accept."
"The guiding principle here must surely be equal treatment for all."
"It is not right that only certain people receive equal treatment and that others do not."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has tabled amendments with this in mind, and I hope that they will win Parliament's approval in tomorrow's vote."
"This is very important, and while we bid the migrants welcome, we want the rules to be made more equal and more consistent."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the idea of a one-stop shop is to be welcomed, but it is a paradigm shift for some European countries - including my own, Austria, where residence permits are issued by the authorities dealing with third-party rights and work permits by the authorities responsible for the labour market, the Austrian Employment Service, with the involvement of the social partners."
"Regulation of access to the labour market directly affects the social partners and they should therefore be involved in its substance."
"The discussion that has taken place to date has involved the trade unions far too little, and NGOs and churches have been similarly excluded."
"Many of the previous speakers have said that migration policy must be viewed as a whole."
"I am therefore against the Commission's piecemeal approach that splits up the package and thereby introduces through the back door the country of origin principle, and possibly even social dumping, as has also been mentioned already."
"Allow me to make a comment on the legal nature of the supplementary document."
"A credit card format will not be able to accommodate all the official orders and data, so the supplementary document also needs to be normative in nature."
"Only then will efficient controls be possible."
"This serves to protect workers and prevents competition being distorted in a way which benefits those enterprises that wish to grow rich on the backs of illegal workers."
"(NL) Mr President, I have waved my blue card two or three times already so that I could ask a number of questions."
"Anyone listening to this debate would get the impression that I had not spent several months making my contribution to the social dimension of this dossier that we are now dealing with."
"What this is about - and I say that again to all the members here - is an amendment by me which is intended to ensure equal treatment for everyone who enters a Member State with a single permit for residence and work."
"That is guaranteed."
"How can you suggest that it is not guaranteed?"
"I have read the press reports, too, and I am getting the feeling that we are just rabble-rousing."
"Nor can you make the same claim about seasonal workers, and I believe you were going to come up with a proposal in that respect."
"As far as posting is concerned, it is not the case that you can set up a company in a third country and then relocate workers there to work in poor conditions."
"Mr President, that is simply not true!"
"(RO) Mr President, the single permit will facilitate administrative procedures, improve the control and management of economic migration and the exchange of data on labour market demand."
"However, this legislative proposal only offers a half-way solution because it deals with the rights of persons who have already been allowed entry to the European Union and the labour market of a Member State."
"It does not cover another two aspects: the criteria for granting the right to work and the exclusion of seasonal workers and intra-corporate transferees."
"I would also like us to remember that we are regulating the rights of third-country workers, but we still have not fully achieved a free labour market for all EU citizens."
"(SV) Mr President, there has been a lot of talk about equal rights in this debate."
"It is also a matter of balance or conflict, because that is the choice that we will have, and it is also a question of a long-term or a short-term approach."
"The exclusions will, in the worst case scenario, open the way for a new form of slavery."
"We know what amending the Posting of Workers Directive from a minimum directive to a maximum directive has meant in terms of shattering the order and balance on the labour market."
"These exclusions will not improve the situation."
"Instead, they will make it worse."
"This will lead to social disasters."
"Whole industries will choose to recruit seasonal workers in a way that will affect the whole labour market, suppress wages and create conflict."
"I appeal to my fellow Members from other political groups, such as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), to support the amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"That is the only way to ensure that the exclusions do not create these serious social conflicts."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 December 1990, the UN adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families."
"This Convention is one of the UN's nine main instruments on human rights."
"Unfortunately, 20 years later, none of the Member States of the European Union have signed or ratified that Convention."
"I believe that recognising the rights of third-country nationals who live and work legally in the European Union must be a priority for a Europe which faces new challenges in relation to integration, non-discrimination and protection of human rights."
"For this reason, I ask all Members to support Amendment 16 and to sign Written Declaration 96 - to which I am a signatory, together with Cornelia Ernst, Sylvie Guillaume and Franziska Keller - in order to petition Member States to ratify the UN Convention on migrant workers."
"(PT) Mr President, it is true that this proposal for a directive discusses a wide variety of situations, including, for example, immigrant workers from third countries, seasonal workers and posted workers, but the truth is that what this represents in practice is the legalisation of social dumping, the reinforcing of job insecurity and the worsening of discrimination, under the pretext of a single regulation."
"That is why we say that this proposal for a directive cannot be adopted."
"What is needed is to improve the rights of those working in the European Union, whether as posted workers, seasonal workers, full-time workers or even immigrant workers."
"We must recognise their rights, including the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families."
"It would be positive if the Commission committed to adopting and ratifying this Convention for all Member States."
"(SK) Mr President, economic migration is a fact that is more or less familiar to all the more affluent countries of the European Union."
"Along with the migrants who come to EU countries legally, however, in accordance with their laws and regulations, there are many illegal migrants, who are often exposed to discrimination or even persecution, as employers frequently take advantage of their lack of a legitimate residency status."
"The attempt made in this directive concerning better organisation and the introduction of specific common rules to resolve this problem may help to preserve the dignity of people coming to EU countries to find work, if they are willing to accept EU rules on migration."
"I am under no illusions that the directive will resolve all the problems of employment migration."
"It may improve the current employment system for migrants, however, and eliminate some of the undesirable developments we have seen in this area."
"We therefore have reason to regard this draft directive as a step in the right direction."
"That is how it should be seen."
"(GA) Mr President, there is a proverb in Irish that says: so many people, so many minds."
"If that is true about anything, it is true about this controversial, complex subject."
"Therefore, the rapporteur has done a very good job, and she deserves praise."
"As the European Union is founded on principles of peace and prosperity, it is only right that it should try and convey that idea throughout the whole European Union, and indeed the world."
"As the world's biggest donor to third countries, it is right that we should be trying to ensure that those who are legally within our borders will be treated with the same dignity and respect that we would like to be shown to our citizens if they were in third countries."
"While this is not perfect, it is a step in the right direction."
"I welcome it and therefore endorse it."
"Mr President, I do not wish to re-open a debate with my fellow Member, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, but rather just to dot the 'i's and cross the 't's."
"The debate has not been in any way personal, and no one has called her work into question."
"If they had called it into question, I would say straightaway that she has done an excellent job on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"However, if Mrs Oomen-Ruijten says that she has tabled amendments for tomorrow's sitting that improve the text and provide equality, I have to say that this is not the case."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has put her name to the amendments to the texts - which I have here - that the Council did not succeed in introducing during the dialogue we had with the Council."
"These are not amendments by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten; they are the Council's text word-for-word."
"With regard to the posting of workers, the Council has a much more unequal position than the Commission."
"We would be prepared to accept the Commission's original text, but the text from the Council states that all posted workers, including those who are covered by the 1996 directive, are also excluded from this directive."
"This amendment does not, therefore, provide greater equality but rather greater inequality."
"I would like to reiterate my personal regard for Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"She is undoubtedly an excellent MEP whose work is very good, but ultimately, she has aligned herself with the Council's view."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has indeed been a very good debate."
"Regarding the scope of the directive, it is no secret that the Commission would have liked a global approach."
"My predecessors proposed this many years ago."
"It was impossible."
"It still is, so we therefore have this sectoral approach."
"I do not like it, but it is the only way to move forward."
"The directive is necessary because we have third-country workers."
"They are in our countries and make an important contribution to our economies."
"We need to protect them."
"Having said that, contrary to some of the views that have been expressed here today, let me emphasise that the present directive establishes the principle of equal treatment for migrant workers in all employment-related areas, including employment conditions and wages."
"It does not create discrimination."
"Once adopted, the directive will be a very important tool in the fight for the protection of migrant workers and against social dumping."
"Nobody wants social dumping."
"We want to protect these people."
"Other categories of workers, such as seasonal workers and ICTs (intra-corporate transferees), are not included in the present proposal."
"I share your view that we need to protect them."
"That is why, before the summer, the Commission proposed two separate instruments covering ICTs and seasonal workers, specifically targeted to protect them."
"I am sure that, once the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs and the committees really start working on those proposals, they will do their utmost to make sure that those categories are also protected and that we can progress in those fields as well."
"I am also aware that some people or groups here would like to have included posted workers - who are now excluded."
"The directive which we are discussing today is supposed to avoid discrimination, not create new discrimination, so let us treat the issue of posted workers separately and not in this context."
"The Commission is about to launch an impact assessment study on the issue."
"It has announced a revision of the Posted Workers Directive for the end of next year."
"The question of the personal scope of the Posted Workers Directive could be addressed as part of the announced revision of the Posted Workers Directive."
"As regards the issue of correlation tables, which Ms in 't Veld raised, the Commission fully shares her view, not only as regards this directive."
"It would have been, and hopefully it will be, an important tool for addressing the issue of better regulation and greater transparency on the part of Member States when they implement the various directives."
"It will be good for you; it will be good for us, the national parliaments and citizens."
"We keep repeating this to the Council."
"If it facilitates things, the Commission is prepared to make a declaration on this. However, we do not want to jeopardise the directive if it is possible to reach a decision tomorrow, when you vote on this issue."
"However, we will keep on fighting for this and we will come back to it for many other pieces of legislation."
"Thank you for this debate."
"Thank you for the very hard work that many people have been doing, particularly Ms Mathieu and Mr Cercas."
"I hope that we can reach an agreement and have a positive vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I must agree wholeheartedly with you, as you have given very full answers to the 23 fellow Members who have spoken on our text, to Mr Cercas and to me."
"I must thank all the rapporteurs on this text from all the political groups, with whom we have had much discussion and very good cooperation throughout this year, as we have been working together on this for a year now."
"We started at the beginning of the year and we are finishing with the Belgian Presidency."
"Thank you, Mrs Malmström, as you have paid very close attention to this text, as have your services."
"I also thank the Council, because the Council has listened to us very attentively and I also thank those fellow Members who have spoken this evening."
"I would like to say that tomorrow, we are actually voting at first reading."
"This is a compromise."
"A compromise is never 100% satisfactory and if fellow Members still need to be reassured, I hope that in any event, the speech you have made will reassure them."
"With regard to Mrs Flautre, who said just now that we were beginning the text of a report with exclusions, remember that all those workers concerned in the exclusion were, in any case, covered by directives relating very specifically to them."
"It was not therefore a matter of excluding a certain number of workers from third countries."
"I hope that the text of this report, which we have drawn up with all the rapporteurs and which we shall be presenting tomorrow to our other fellow Members, will be a great step forward for workers from third countries."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 14 December 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I voted against this dangerously worded draft directive from the Commission and Council that sought to create a low pay job market for migrant workers in the EU."
"Migration must be fair."
"Everyone working in the EU should be treated equally, regardless of his or her country of origin."
"This proposal for a single work permit for nationals of non-EU countries was a missed opportunity to support decent working conditions where migrants are welcomed on the basis of equal treatment."
"Instead, the proposal would have resulted in discriminatory treatment between EU workers and non-EU employees posted to work in the EU."
"For example, companies could find it more profitable to officially relocate their headquarters to countries outside the EU and then to post their workers to their European branches to avoid having to provide the same rights and conditions for their workers that are legally applicable to EU citizens working in the EU."
"The European Parliament rejected this proposal."
"This ensures that the Commission and Member State Ministers must go back to the drawing board and bring forward a visa proposal that does not promote a race to the bottom."
"Extension of the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC to beneficiaries of international protection (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Claude Moraes, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the extension of the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC to beneficiaries of international protection - C6-0196/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I fear that as I get into the first paragraph of my speech, there will be only me, the PPE coordinator, and the Commissioner left in the Chamber."
"I admire you for your stamina, Commissioner."
"I should never take up my speaking time by doing this, but I could not help it."
"Thanks to the PPE Group for being here too at this time of night."
"Commissioner, you and the Council did a great job in rescuing this proposal, which now benefits those who should never have been excluded from the original Long-Term Residence Directive."
"There was another opportunity to include them in 2008, and again unfortunately, through the failure to reach unanimity in the Council, this could not happen."
"So it is a very happy day today that a proposal taken on by my predecessor as coordinator in my group, Martine Roure, is now the subject of an agreement."
"I am very grateful to the Council, too."
"I pointed out in the previous debate that it was not present but, if it were present here today, I would thank the Council too, because during the Belgian Presidency, we were able to make good progress."
"I am very grateful for that."
"The proposal will bring direct benefit to all beneficiaries of international protection who have been in the EU for more than five years but currently cannot become long-term residents."
"It will finally bring to an end their differential treatment compared to other third-country nationals and will give them greater certainty about their situation in the EU."
"The main issue for the negotiations boiled down to the calculation of the time period of legal residence to reach the five years."
"We supported the Commission that the full duration of the procedure should be taken into account."
"However, this was strongly opposed by the Council."
"We were particularly concerned about this, because asylum procedures can take many years in some Member States."
"The compromise we have reached in the negotiations is that at least half of the asylum procedure will be taken into account and, if a procedure takes more than 18 months, the whole procedure will then be taken into account."
"I hesitate to go on to the issue of correlation tables but I am duty bound to say something about them - I would rather not."
"I would nevertheless like to implore the institutions to reach a horizontal agreement on this issue."
"I would particularly urge the Council to recognise the importance of correlation tables for overseeing the implementation of legislation."
"We had a very difficult situation in which many of the dossiers considered of great importance by groups across this House could have been delayed because of this issue."
"I am very happy also that the scope of the proposal includes both refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection."
"It is vital to continue the trend towards aligning the standards of protection and the rights granted to both groups, as in the recasting of the Qualification Directive."
"The agreement also contains many safeguards against refoulement."
"Given that beneficiaries will now be allowed to move between Member States, it is important that the protection background of beneficiaries is never forgotten."
"Therefore, Member States will have to include a comment in the long-term residence permit and will be obliged to consult the Member State that granted protection in cases of possible expulsion."
"The proposal also takes into account the transfer of protection to another Member State under national arrangements."
"The long-term residence permit needs to be modified accordingly in order to safeguard against refoulement."
"We have also ensured that the principle of family unity is upheld in the event of expulsion to another Member State, but it is also clear that it should not be automatic in cases where it may not be in the best interest of family members to go with the expelled person."
"The agreement we have reached on this is a signal of the new cooperation which can exist between the three institutions in the area of asylum and legal migration aided by the new framework in the Lisbon Treaty."
"It shows that we can reach an agreement with Member States on a progressive piece of asylum-related legislation."
"I again want to thank my shadow rapporteurs from across the groups, Ms Nedelcheva, Ms Wikström and other colleagues who helped make this what I would call a pleasurable trialogue - if that is not a contradiction in terms!"
"I should like to thank all concerned for making this a reality."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament rapporteur, Claude Moraes."
"He has done a fantastic job together with his team of shadow rapporteurs."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council have really achieved an agreement."
"The minister was also very helpful."
"The compromise that we have reached is a well-balanced one and is in line with the 2007 proposal."
"The extension of long-term residence status to beneficiaries of international protection will ensure a higher level of protection and legal certainty for refugees in Europe and will allow for better integration in our societies."
"This is also the first building block of our asylum package - the first of six pieces of legislation - and is a first step towards our joint aim of achieving a common European asylum system by 2012. It will give a strong political signal that we can agree, that we are willing to go down this difficult but necessary road and make progress, and that we can act reasonably and constructively on this."
"I would really like to thank you for that."
"Concerning the much talked about issue of correlation tables, the Commission made a declaration to the Council."
"I would like to read it out, with your permission: 'The Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt with the EU directive and communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation, in the interest of citizens, better law making and increasing legal transparency and to assist the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions."
"'The Commission regrets the lack of support for the provision included in the 2007 COM proposal amending the Long-Term Residence Directive which aimed at rendering the establishment of correlation tables obligatory."
"'The Commission, in a spirit of compromise and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of the Long-Term Residence proposal, can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with a relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice."
"'However, the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent."
"The Commission will continue its efforts with a view to finding, together with the European Parliament and the Council, an appropriate solution to this horizontal institutional issue'."
"I think we can agree on this."
"It is important that this declaration is in the protocol and has been heard."
"As I said in the earlier debate, the Commission is repeating this argument."
"Nevertheless, on this particular report, it is very important that we have reached agreement."
"Thank you all, again, for your contribution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Moraes, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on the excellent work he has done and on the exemplary cooperation he has shown with the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council."
"With this report, we have made a great step forward towards a harmonised European asylum system."
"The agreement reached with the Council was necessary and I am very pleased that we have succeeded in making progress on this issue."
"The asylum package is very much greater and, indeed, there is still much to be done."
"Therefore, we must not drop our guard and I hope that the Council will take the same cooperative attitude in negotiations on future issues."
"That is what I wanted to say by way of introduction."
"Regarding the substance of the dossier, without repeating the rapporteur's words, I would like to go back to two points."
"First of all, I would like to stress the importance of integrating third-country nationals into our societies."
"Migrants who come to our countries are a considerable asset to our economies."
"We cannot, however, welcome everybody under any conditions."
"Several governments have realised in recent months that their integration model has failed."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Moraes, who has drawn up the report on which we are to give our views to his usual high standard and with a sincere desire to uphold humanitarian principles and the principle of respect for our fellow human beings."
"Beneficiaries of international protection in a Member State often stay there for a very long time, perhaps the rest of their lives, as their vulnerability and persecution in the country from which they have fled tends to remain for a very long time."
"Many beneficiaries of international protection therefore find themselves in the same situation as those who are classed as refugees."
"It is also reasonable for people to be classed as resident in a country after they have lived there for five years, and this was the approach taken by both the Commission and Parliament."
"The Council wanted to take a different approach, which I find regrettable."
"I would also like to emphasise that members of the family of the person who is a beneficiary of international protection must have the chance to shape their own lives."
"For example, in the case of expulsion, the family must be allowed to choose whether to follow or to remain where they are."
"I am pleased that Parliament will now adopt this report."
"It is regrettable that the Council has not approved the correlation tables, but I welcome the fact that we are pressing on with the reports that are to be included in the common European asylum system."
"It is to be hoped that the Council will now take more of a listening approach."
"We all have the same deadline to meet and that is 2012."
"We now need to relinquish our old, ingrained opinions and look to the pan-European approach and what is best for everyone when it comes to asylum and migration."
"Otherwise, the word 'solidarity' will soon become meaningless."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, once again for his fine work and for his very good, if not excellent, cooperation on this report."
"Mr President, last week, we visited Athens with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and while I was there, I talked to Mamuth."
"Mamuth is 26 years old and comes from Eritrea."
"He entered the European Union via Greece and travelled on to the Netherlands, where he would have preferred to stay, because he had some contacts there, but he was sent back to Greece."
"Mamuth said that, when he eventually got his refugee status in Greece, he would not be able to travel freely and that it would take an eternity before he was granted Greek nationality."
"It is for the sake of young men like Mamuth, who are entitled to a new life and do not deserve to be shunted back and forth across borders again, that I am pleased that this House is now going to change that situation and that rapporteur Claude Moraes has managed to take this first step in our asylum packages."
"It is also important that Mamuth, who would actually prefer to live his new life in the Netherlands, is given a decent basis for comparison, because this young man has the right to see how various matters are dealt with in Greece and the Netherlands, or wherever it is that he wants to build his life."
"Thank you, Mr Moraes, thank you for your cooperation and let us see how long the process takes for Mamuth."
"(MT) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating Claude Moraes on his report."
"I agree with the report and welcome it with satisfaction because it will grant new rights to those who apply for international protection, including refugees."
"It will furnish them with rights which, after all, are already given to third-country citizens that have been legally residing in a European Union country for five years."
"There are, however, a few difficulties in this report."
"I come from a country which has experienced these difficulties, namely that five years is far too long a time to wait in order to acquire the right that is granted by this law."
"This applies especially to those countries who are hosting a huge amount of people who are stuck there; blocked in the country they first arrive at."
"Aside from my country, there are others that have recently undergone similar experiences, Greece being one of them."
"They are hosting vast numbers of persons who are required to wait five years to benefit from these rights, as laid down by this law."
"Naturally, they ultimately benefit from long-term residence, yet they can also move to other European Union countries, which could be of great help to those like Greece, Malta, Cyprus and others."
"Therefore, I believe that this law, although good, could have been improved upon by decreasing the stipulated five-year waiting period."
"Here, I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur Claude Moraes for having recognised this and for having done what he could to insert a reference, albeit a symbolic one to him, in an explanatory note at the end."
"(RO) Mr President, I, too, must begin by congratulating my colleague, Claude Moraes, for this report."
"I also want to thank him for the exceptional efforts he makes as coordinator within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I think that it is excellent that this new directive finally fills a legal vacuum with regard to the right of residence which beneficiaries of international protection find themselves in throughout the European Union."
"These persons who have settled in one of the Member States are currently in a precarious state of legal certainty due to the fact that they are not eligible, under current circumstances, for long-term residence permits, something other third-country nationals are eligible for."
"They must be granted the right of long-term residence in a non-discriminatory manner, with the only condition being prior legal residence, as is also the case for the other third-country nationals."
"I believe that it would have been better to take into account in this calculation the whole duration of legal residence within the European Union, from the time the application for international protection was lodged."
"At the same time, consideration must be given to the fact that these people are permanently vulnerable outside the European Union, so that any move to withdraw international protection or the right to residence must be carried out with complete respect for their fundamental rights and the principle of non-refoulement."
"This directive provides the necessary additional provisions with regard to the procedures that can be applied if it comes to expulsion or ending international protection."
"I think that we must vote in support of Claude Moraes's report as it is part of the general package governing the European Union's asylum and migration system."
"(DE) Mr President, I am not looking at this report through rose-tinted spectacles."
"I am deliberately looking at it through the eyes of the citizens in our home countries who are concerned because after residing for five years in a Member State, refugees are then to be granted long-term resident status."
"This will then apply throughout the territory of the EU."
"So once a refugee has settled in a country with relatively soft asylum law, after five years he will be able to move his place of residence to any other Member State he chooses - and naturally he will initially seek out a country where the regulations have loopholes or are softer, and will subsequently settle long-term wherever the social standards are obviously high."
"The consequence will be secondary migration and abuse."
"Even the accumulation of a duration of five years in the asylum system is problematic, since often the administrative procedures are subject to wilful delays and investigations."
"Extending the directive would place an even greater burden on those Member States with a high social standard, which already have huge problems in any case, making it harder still for refugees to be integrated."
"I shall be extremely critical of this report."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I do not have much to add."
"There is a big consensus of support here for the work done by Mr Moraes on this very important directive."
"I would just once again make a pledge to Mr Moraes and the others that this is an important building block."
"I believe it will get strong support tomorrow in the vote."
"This is the first step in our common journey towards 2012 and the asylum package."
"I just hope that this spirit of constructive cooperation will remain because I need - and I am counting on - your support for the remaining directives."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to formally thank the Commissioner again for her work on this."
"One of the reasons why we hope that the first step on asylum can be completed in tomorrow's vote - and I hope it is a resounding vote - is because, although asylum remains one of the deeply sensitive issues for this House, as Mr Busuttil explained for smaller countries in particular, every piece of legislation on asylum can have a disproportionate effect, not just on small countries, but also on flashpoint countries such as Greece."
"We should all proceed carefully, as we did in this report, and there are some items in the explanatory memorandum which ensure that Members' concerns are taken very seriously, particularly when they come from serious Members."
"For example, I think we were able to incorporate Ms Nedelcheva's concerns regarding integration and those of Ms Wikström when she talked about family members and expulsion, as well as the issues of domestic violence and other issues."
"It is when we have that kind of cooperation that negotiations go very well at the higher level of the Commission and the Council thanks to the work we do in Parliament with colleagues."
"Finally, Ms Sargentini, I really wanted to find an inventive way of saying that correlation tables were extremely important."
"To say that asylum seekers are now waiting for the correlation tables to be implemented is probably the most inventive and imaginative lobbying for the correlation table resolution to happen, so I hope Council was listening."
"Thank you again to all my colleagues for their support on this report after such a long time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 14 December 2010."
"Territorial, social and economic cohesion - Good governance and EU regional policy (debate)"
"Mr President, we have intended with this report to answer the question raised in the title, which is whether establishing economic, social and territorial cohesion is an absolute prerequisite for global competitiveness in the European Union, with a particular focus on the role played by the cohesion policy in this respect."
"It is alarming that there are such great disparities between the European Union's 271 regions."
"While the most developed region has a per capita GDP which is 334% of the EU-27 average, this figure is only 26% in the poorest region, in other words, 13 times smaller."
"Another adverse factor is the rate of economic growth in the European Union, which is slower compared to that of our international competitors."
"Therefore, as is also mentioned in the EU 2020 strategy, we need to develop strategic areas and look outside the European Union to become more powerful."
"Europe is faced with a tough task as it will need to tackle, apart from the impact of the current crisis, other major challenges as well, such as adapting to globalisation, demographic changes, climate change and energy security problems."
"The cohesion policy's role in the EU 2020 strategy is unarguable."
"I think that this policy's priorities must be aligned with the objectives of the future strategy, but it is worth mentioning that it still needs to remain an independent policy."
"The strategy's objectives can be achieved more easily through increasing the synergy between the research, development and innovation programmes, on the one hand, and the cohesion programmes, on the other."
"We must support large projects with a major impact at EU level, which will generate economic growth, create jobs and ensure sustainable development for the regions."
"Particular importance must also be attached to investments in any kind of infrastructure, be it transport, ICT, social, educational, research and development or environmental, which will help achieve a suitable level of accessibility for all European citizens, offering them equal opportunities to development potential."
"The guidelines at local and regional level will be dictated by the specific features of the area, with the opportunity available to generate immediate added value."
"The application of the principle of decentralisation must be encouraged up to local authority level so as to improve the absorption of European funds."
"While promoting economic competitiveness and creating jobs, the particularly important role played by SMEs must not be overlooked."
"They must enjoy increased access to EU funding, financial engineering instruments and other credit sources."
"Maximising the cohesion policy's impact is an absolute must for boosting economic competitiveness."
"At this point, I would like to stress the need to continue simplifying the procedures for using EU funds, the guarantee of their flexible use, the continuing use of GDP as the main criterion for determining regions' eligibility under the cohesion policy and the need for a specific proposal from the Commission on the use of public-private partnerships."
"In terms of increasing the European Union's global competitiveness, I think that part of the funds allocated to the cohesion policy should be used to establish and maintain Europe's role as global leader in the sectors where it already enjoys a competitive edge and in the sectors where there is potential for it to become global leader."
"Therefore, fellow Members, achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion, along with strategic investments, is the absolute prerequisite for guaranteeing the European Union's economic competitiveness globally."
"Mr President, the current global crisis has highlighted once again how important good governance is at every level, as well as the need to have local and regional authorities constantly involved, as equal partners, in devising and implementing EU policies and strategies, especially as they enforce almost 70% of EU legislation."
"The cohesion policy plays a vital role in the application of multi-level governance."
"Given the considerable impact this has in achieving territorial cohesion in Europe, the principle of multi-level governance should become compulsory for all Member States."
"Indeed, active involvement by local and regional authorities in the decision-making process even at the prelegislative phase, along with a relevant analysis of the effectiveness of share management mechanisms, with the various responsibilities that the Commission and Member States have, will actually guarantee that better results are achieved with regard to the absorption of European funds in the future programming period."
"The practical reality has shown us that an integrated approach to regional policy is much more effective in terms of the results achieved."
"This is precisely why this approach should also become compulsory."
"We need a common definition of the concept of partnership."
"On this point, I have asked the European Commission to come up with a definition of this as a condition for establishing proper partnerships with local and regional authorities."
"Therefore, adopting the local development methodology based on local partnerships is the solution available to Member States for enhancing the role of local and regional authorities in the management and implementation of European programmes, especially those relating to urban, rural and cross-border development."
"The simplification of regulations at EU and national level, not only as a consequence of the economic crisis but also as a general principle of the future cohesion policy, is a prerequisite for better governance in applying the cohesion policy, as it is the only way we will be able to encourage prospective beneficiaries."
"In addition, I think that we need for the future programming period a common set of regulations for using European funds, which are applicable to all Member States, thereby eliminating the opportunity for the latter to introduce additional conditions which actually restrict access to funding."
"If our long-term aspiration is to have a policy which is clearer, results-orientated and much easier to apply, the Commission must improve both the assistance capacity given to local and regional authorities and the systems for monitoring the activity carried out at national level."
"I believe that training and guiding these authorities through the process of implementing the programmes will help reduce the high error rate, especially with regard to ineligible expenditure and public procurement."
"In order to avoid duplication of audits and the excessive level of control currently faced by beneficiaries, we have asked the Commission to produce a single audit manual which will facilitate the uniform application of a single audit model at all levels."
"Last but not least, we must take measures to encourage the private sector's involvement in European projects."
"A first step in this direction is to simplify the regulations for operating the financial engineering instruments aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Finally, I want to mention the good cooperation I have enjoyed with the Commission's representatives during the consultations, as well as the receptiveness and support they have shown in giving effective backing to the measures featuring in this report, which is a further guarantee that these measures will eventually be adopted by the Commission."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, in particular, Mrs Mănescu and Mr Luhan, I would specifically like to thank both of you for your two reports, which are once again constructive and very positive towards regional policy and have come at absolutely the right time in view of the ongoing debate on the future structure of regional policy, particularly looking ahead to the Cohesion Forum at the end of January/beginning of February."
"It is important that we constantly view regional policy in particular as an investment policy - as a policy of investing in regions, in people, in Europeans."
"In the area of innovation and regional policy, a total of EUR 86 billion has already been earmarked for this financial period, and this is intended to help small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, to improve the quality of their workforce, their production methods and the services that they are able to offer."
"However, what we need to do - and here you are both absolutely right - is to improve our strategy further in the future, so that in addition to the controls that will continue to be necessary in the future - in other words, alongside correct financial conduct - we focus much more on a results-orientated assessment of our work."
"I always say - and it is at the core of the cohesion report and its conclusions - that there is no contradiction between focusing on a few priorities as laid down in the EU 2020 strategy and flexibility in implementing these in the very varied regions of Europe."
"Territorial cohesion is enormously important."
"For me, it is a key issue and provides us with information as to how we can improve living standards in the regions further, which is our task, in order to ensure that people have prospects in the regions in which they were born."
"That will also contribute to further internal cohesion in Europe."
"In this context, it is important - and this should be accentuated in the coming programming period - to bring back the focus more to the role of towns and cities, in view of the fact that around 70% of Europeans live in an urban environment, but at the same time, it is essential that we do not forget the importance of town and country relations."
"Here it is a matter of using other funding to continue to improve the interfaces and to prevent unnecessary overlaps."
"It is also important - as we debated very comprehensively and, in my opinion, very well in this House some time ago - to pay attention to areas with specific geographical circumstances and, naturally, to consider the matter of demographic change in Europe, which is something that we will encounter very often and need to deal with."
"On the one hand, we are seeing very serious tendencies towards depopulation in rural areas and, on the other, a great increase in the attraction of urban areas - with the result that we have not only more and more people living in a small space, but also a corresponding depopulation."
"To a certain extent, this can be countered by investments in old and new infrastructure."
"This will make a very important contribution to ensuring growth."
"The matter of partnership - of cooperation - is very important, as was mentioned in particular in Mrs Mănescu's report."
"Yes, it is important to develop multi-level governance."
"However, I would specifically like to point out to this House the importance of the regions also involving the local level."
"When I am in the regions discussing things, I sometimes get the impression that the local representatives are not being involved by the regional representatives, and that the regional representatives are not being involved by the national representatives."
"We need to develop instruments here."
"I am with you but, vice versa, I must also state quite clearly that naturally, we must respect the constitutional framework of each Member State and give it its due."
"However, I support you on the matter of involving as many levels as possible - but also as many stakeholders as possible, including NGOs - in the development of our partnership and investment programmes."
"I will perhaps go into the matter of financial controls in more detail in my closing remarks, since I have already exceeded my speaking time."
"I would also like to warmly welcome the new president who has taken the chair."
"Mr President, the cohesion policy is one of the EU's most important and successful policies."
"The Treaty of Lisbon allows territorial authorities to be more deeply involved in the decision-making process, which is an important step towards genuine multi-level governance."
"This must play a key role not only in the forthcoming programming period, but also in every phase of devising and implementing the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The Mănescu report, which was voted for unanimously in the Committee on Regional Development, wishes to focus on the competences and role of regional and local authorities in the process of implementing the cohesion policy."
"The report stresses that the multi-level approach must be applied horizontally in all EU policies."
"Multi-level governance is a prerequisite for achieving territorial cohesion and boosting its potential."
"It should be based on a bottom-up approach, taking into account the diversity of the administrative systems currently operating in Member States."
"Greater focus must be placed on the integrated approach during the current programming period and in the future, which also applies not only to improving administrative capacity but also to the use of the financial engineering instruments."
"The role of local and regional authorities must expand by adopting a local development methodology based on regional partnerships, especially for projects relating to urban, rural and cross-border aspects."
"The role of these partnerships is to help achieve balanced development and they extend beyond national frameworks, thereby contributing to the increase in the Union's territorial cohesion."
"In addition, they will highlight not only the common development potential, but also the specific local aspects."
"Multi-level governance based on clear, transparent procedures will lead, by extension, to decentralisation, which is still necessary in some Member States."
"Expanding the role of regional and local authorities involves giving them responsibility for making projects more efficient, which will mean adopting a more results-based approach."
"I congratulate Mrs Mănescu and Mr Luhan for the excellent reports they have presented, which will provide significant added value to the future of the cohesion policy."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, let me commend my colleagues, Mr Luhan and Ms Mănescu, for their excellent work."
"We all agree that the cohesion policy has a significant role to play for the competitiveness of the European regions."
"With regard to the continuation of the policy and its achievements, we want to see adequate resources, or at least no less money made available for the cohesion policy than we have at the present time."
"Neither do we want an additional burden for the beneficiaries."
"The future design of the cohesion policy depends on the decision we will take together."
"However, the Commission has an important role to play with the proposal it makes and here we rely on you, Commissioner Hahn, because in my opinion, some of these proposals - like the suggested preconditions for the Member States for receiving European Union financial assistance - need additional qualification."
"The cohesion policies for all regions need support, and we should not permit a situation to arise in which they will suffer because of the inefficiency of some national governments."
"Here again, I agree, Commissioner, that it is important to develop these levels."
"It is therefore crucial not to replace complexity by conditionality and not to make life difficult again for the final beneficiaries."
"To ensure the cohesion policy leads to positive results, let us allow the regions to participate actively; let us allow them to feel ownership of the process, give them appropriate resources and make sure they use them in the most efficient way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"These two reports really do create a firm basis for the future of cohesion policy."
"A viable cohesion policy that applies to Europe as a whole is an absolute precondition for our global competitiveness, no doubt about it."
"As the Commissioner said, regional policy is nothing less than investment policy."
"This is something that we also need to strive for in the future."
"It is through cohesion policy that we can also respond vigorously to the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"If we want better research, development and innovations, we also have to see cohesion policy as an integral component of these goals, and we must acquire a broader perspective on them."
"Cohesion policy is not actually just a matter of solidarity. Of course, it is partly, but it is through cohesion policy that we now have very robustly financed research, development and innovation."
"That is why it is only right that we should also put at least the same amount of money into cohesion policy during the next funding period as we have hitherto."
"The Fifth Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion takes excellent account of these factors, and it is also very important that we invest more time and money in success."
"Mrs Mǎnescu's report also gets to grips with a very important key question in cohesion policy, namely, how to establish such a policy which is good and which takes every level into consideration."
"We have had some disappointing results as regards implementation figures, for example."
"As regional policy actors, we should take seriously these problems in cohesion policy and, furthermore, try to find solutions to them."
"In my opinion, Mrs Mǎnescu's report also does an excellent job of addressing these issues."
"Mr President, I should like to focus my speech on Mr Luhan's report."
"Regional cohesion policies have a key role to play in Europe for economic development that is balanced, socially harmonious and ecologically effective, that is, at the end of the day, globally competitive."
"I thank Mr Luhan for including some of our amendments aimed at establishing a sustainable low carbon economy which safeguards biodiversity."
"Nonetheless, we cannot vote for his resolution because it promotes a vision of cohesion policy as an instrument for global competitiveness that still appears to us to be too narrow, too restricted and inadequate."
"We must point out two sticking points."
"Firstly, the rapporteur relies almost exclusively on quantitative measures in terms of infrastructure as the driving force for growth, increase being his main criterion."
"We do not feel that is appropriate for the current situation."
"For example, he mentions 246 operational programmes in research and development and is proud of these, but without questioning what they are about."
"Research is a good thing but we also need to know what it is that we are researching."
"The second sticking point is that the rapporteur does not put forward sufficiently clear plans."
"We would have liked a robust choice in order to meet the challenges set out in his report, the choice of a green economy, of a green new deal which is the only choice capable of moving Europe and its regions upwards."
"Mr President, these reports are along the same anti-grassroots lines as the strategic plans of the monopoly groups in the European Union and of the bourgeois governments that serve them."
"There never has been, nor can there ever be, cohesion in the European Union, despite the efforts made to use political cohesion for the purpose of manipulating the public."
"The policy of the European Union is coloured by two basic elements: the first is the deep-rooted inequality which is an inherent characteristic of the capitalist development method and the second basic element is that Community funds are not allocated to grassroots needs; they are allocated to works and infrastructures to boost the return on capital and hot money for the monopoly groups through public-private partnerships."
"Today, as the capitalist crisis continues, even this misleadingly named principle of Community solidarity is being abandoned and replaced by the competitiveness of capital."
"The reports and plans of the political representatives of capital for future cohesion policy serve the contemporary needs of business groups, faster capitalist restructurings through the anti-grassroots EU 2020 strategy and the savage attack on the labour, insurance and social rights of the working classes."
"The European Union and the capitalist development method are not able to satisfy urgent needs, such as earthquake protection, education, health and welfare."
"That is why leaving the European Union is more necessary today than ever before, as is the fight for a planned socialist economy."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I am speaking tonight because my colleague, Mr Bufton, who would have addressed you, is unwell."
"On his behalf, I present this to you."
"As we know, along with the CAP, regional funds represent the biggest part of the EU budget."
"For decades, the British people have been forced to foot the bill for various projects around the EU, most of which are of no benefit at all to the UK taxpayer."
"Recently, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the UK unveiled the fact that EU regional funds are being used to prop up arms dealing companies in Eastern Europe, with some projects receiving funding amounting to millions of euro, although these are some of the richest companies."
"Do they really need EU subsidies?"
"Given the fraud and waste endemic in this budget line, and the way it is not even being used for the purposes its supporters allege, I call on the coalition in the UK to withdraw funding, as we need this money at home - yet another reason to leave the EU."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Hungary is certainly in a special position when it comes to the creation and support of regions constituting transboundary economic units."
"It is an historical fact that these regions were a unit within the Carpathian Basin at one time."
"The Members of Jobbik therefore support cooperation between the regions and consider it a necessity in the present situation as well, which could further mitigate the temporary barriers erected between the Hungarian people."
"However, instead of resources disbursed and controlled directly through Brussels, we can only envision funding in the form of projects launched and approved in joint collaboration, based on a partnership between the countries concerned."
"At local and regional levels, identification as well as management of problems can be more effective, taking into consideration the transboundary nature of the economically connected regions mentioned as an example."
"This should be supported even if we only take into account economic considerations."
"Similarly, the simplification of rules, the involvement of SMEs in European projects and the process of helping economically less developed regions to catch up should all be supported if these popular measures did not entail an extension of the competence and supervisory role of Brussels and the Commission to the detriment of national control."
"Prioritising the regions and granting them direct economic support could even trigger the beginning of a new era for the Hungarians of the Carpathian Basin."
"(PL) Mr President, there are few European political strategies that give rise to so much emotion and controversy."
"Cohesion policy, which, by some, is considered to be a socialist policy par excellence, is thought of as a capitalist policy by others."
"By some, it is regarded as a just policy, and by others as unjust."
"Some see it as a way of ironing out disproportions, while others see it as strengthening competitiveness."
"In fact, there are no contradictions within the policy, which is essentially intended to foster greater cohesion between areas of the European Union, not only in terms of social justice, but also in terms of equal opportunities with regard to competitiveness."
"In other words, it is cohesion for competitiveness."
"Both reports speak about this, and point to certain aspects that are important not only for the situation today, but also in the debate about the future of cohesion policy."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that both reports focus particularly on the principle of partnership."
"I call on the Commissioner to give serious consideration to whether a requirement for Member States should be placed in the proposed development contract."
"Such a requirement would state that, before signing a contract, a Member State shall agree all directions for development, priorities and principles with local and regional partners."
"This should be compulsory so that the European Commission can unambiguously assign to each Member State responsibility for implementing its part of cohesion policy."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Mănescu, for her excellent collaboration and for the fact that she was prepared throughout to discuss and take account of proposals made by fellow Members in connection with the contents of the report."
"As regards the contents of this report that we are debating, there can be no doubt that good governance is fundamental to the success of any policy, especially cohesion policy, which is based on joint administration, most of the responsibility for which has shifted to national and regional authorities."
"There is only one answer to the challenges of this complex administration system: multi-level governance."
"What I should like to stress is that, if we take account of the future direction of cohesion policy, at least as it would appear up to a degree in the fifth cohesion report, multi-level governance in both its horizontal and vertical dimension will be instrumental to the viability of any development initiative and to the success of the policy."
"I also welcome the call for simpler rules and greater technical assistance for local authorities on the part of the European Commission as factors that will guarantee greater participation by potential beneficiaries in programmes and in taking up funds in a viable manner."
"The assessments which are now carried out by the European Commission give us information as to which bodies consistently have problems in terms of their managerial capabilities in implementing political cohesion programmes."
"As the report notes, additional technical assistance for these bodies, in conjunction with reinforcement of the 'Train the trainers' initiative, will boost the managerial capabilities of even the smallest body at local level."
"Finally, I believe that more unified and harmonised rules for the Structural Funds will provide a solid basis for efforts towards simplification and sound financial management."
"(BG) Mr President, just days ago, the Commission voted for the Danube strategy action plan, so I will look at Mr Luhan's report through the prism of this event, especially since he says in his explanatory statement that his aim is to stimulate debate on the dependency and complementary nature of the measures at European and national level."
"To this I would like to add the regional level."
"The report outlines the framework in which the cohesion policy can play a role in improving the Union's competitiveness."
"It does not explicitly set out the role of macro-regions in this process, but an analysis shows that the Danube strategy is precisely such a framework on a smaller scale, as was the Baltic strategy before it."
"I find that the conditions in the report coincide with the realities in the Danube Action Plan."
"Furthermore, the tenets of increasing competitiveness contained in the report are fundamental to the strategy."
"For example, the report places great value on building links with other territories."
"It underlines that the Member States have to support a locally oriented approach to formulating and implementing the cohesion policy."
"And all of these are operating techniques enshrined in the new policy for the Danubian macro-region."
"I also admire the thesis in the report about the importance of providing continued support, in particular, to disadvantaged regions."
"This makes the Danube strategy a special case in Mr Luhan's report which conforms fully with its conclusions."
"The aim of my comparison is to show the true path of the cohesion policy."
"I believe that these principles and operating methods should form the basis of the cohesion policy during the next programme period, and include a results-oriented local policy through the macro-regions."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur on good governance; in particular, I want to express my thanks for her positive cooperation and to congratulate her on this excellent report."
"This report shows the Commission what needs to happen in the time ahead, particularly in the area of the partnership principle."
"It states how it must be ensured that local and regional levels are also involved, and how economic and social partners as well as representatives of civil society need to be involved in all phases - in the implementation and in the evaluation of the Structural Fund."
"That represents a commitment by the Member States to real partnership."
"It means that the partners will be empowered to talk to the administrations as equals, through training initiatives and financial support; it means that the partners will have a real influence on the form the programmes take."
"So far, however, we have seen little commitment on the part of the Commission. That applies just as much to the current period as to the proposals that it has made on the matter."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Olbrycht said that if this development and investment partnership contract comes about, it will only be possible if there is a partnership and if the partners are involved in developing these plans on an equal footing."
"Otherwise, there is a risk that we will move from being a Europe of regions to being a Europe of Member States, and that is not our aim."
"Our aim is regional development and the involvement of the local and regional levels, of the economic and social partners, and of civil society."
"(PT) Mr President, this debate is taking place at an opportune time in that the economic, social and territorial disparities within the European Union are being exacerbated in a way that is worrying: the inequality that exists between countries and regions and those within each country are getting worse."
"We have clearly failed to achieve territorial cohesion."
"Cohesion policy does not exist in isolation from other areas of policy: it influences and is profoundly influenced by the prevailing political guidelines and macro-economic framework."
"Attacks on workers' salaries and rights, the dismantling and degrading of public services, the attack on the state's social functions and cuts in public investment are integral parts of the economic and monetary policies that the European Union has been imposing on Member States."
"These are policies that lead to increased poverty and inequality, and that prevent us further every day from achieving cohesion."
"The truth is that cohesion policy has not counteracted the impact or imbalances caused by the integration of economies with very diverse levels of development into the Single Market or the Economic and Monetary Union."
"The insufficiency of the funds dedicated to cohesion and the incoherence of macro-economic policies that are obsessively focused on nominal convergence but make real convergence unviable are significant causes, which must be corrected by increasing the budgetary allocation to cohesion and by profoundly changing macro-economic policy."
"Supporting production and developing the productive capacities of each country and region, taking full advantage of the local potential that each has through the sustainable use of its resources, preserving the environment and creating jobs with rights, as well as strengthening social security schemes and public services, are strategically essential to effective economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mrs Mănescu's report."
"Multi-level governance has a key role to play in cohesion policy and, in this respect, the multi-level approach, which provides for cooperation and shared responsibilities across various levels of government, is being put into practice in the management of regional funds."
"The Commission is promoting initiatives in favour of regional and local authorities."
"There must be a greater incentive to support such proposals in order to ensure the real coordination and effective implementation of European programmes."
"The partnership must be guaranteed by a culture based on dialogue between the various parties involved."
"Cooperation at regional level must be transparent and must ensure fair representation of all concerned."
"For this reason, it is important to provide appropriate training for subnational representatives through initiatives such as Erasmus for regional and local officials, the financial cost of which must be borne by the Commission."
"This is likewise useful for exchanging good practices and for improving the quality and effectiveness of cohesion fund management."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I find it regrettable that an important debate on cohesion policy has once again been pushed almost into last place on the agenda."
"It does not do justice to this policy and its importance in any way."
"I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs for their reports, which have emphatically shown us the policy area in which the European Union has been really successful - namely cohesion policy - and the fact that it is essential to continue this policy and to do so in a political system with multiple levels - in other words, multi-level governance."
"Cohesion policy projects make European action directly visible to our citizens: in infrastructure projects, in social projects, in support for research, innovation, in the maintenance of competitiveness and employment in the regions."
"In the current debate on the future of the European Union, alongside the debates on currency and finances, we should be debating with the same intensity on what the European Union needs to ensure its internal cohesion, so that countries and regions do not drift apart economically, socially or politically."
"After all, when faced with global challenges and the emergence of new competitors on the world market, we need greater union and greater commonality."
"Cohesion policy can make a significant contribution to this."
"For this, however, we need cohesion policy to be focused more on those projects and project areas that advance Europe as a whole, that enable those who are strong to remain strong, and that give those that are weaker the opportunity to close the gap to the strong."
"In my view, to achieve this, it is necessary to maintain and expand the objectives of cohesion policy that have applied to date."
"However, I also feel it is necessary to make the funding more conditional and more focused on central European initiatives, whether in the transport sector, in the energy sector, in regional and urban development, or in research and innovation."
"The path described by the Commission in its Fifth Cohesion Report seems to me to be a necessary part of this - namely, to integrate the funds into a common strategic framework which results in a development and innovation partnership between the Commission, the Member States and the representatives of the regions."
"It also includes, however, involving the local and regional administrations in this process as early as possible."
"In so doing, the new forms of regional cooperation could genuinely support the process of developing real multi-level governance."
"Mr President, I hope you will allow me to make a further comment regarding what was said by Mr Colman, who has unfortunately left the Chamber."
"I would like to remind him that the European Union is a voluntary union of states."
"If countries want to leave, they have the right to do so."
"However, I do not believe that is what the citizens of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England really want."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are laying the foundations for the Europe of 2020, imagining it to be inclusive, intelligent and innovative and, in doing so, we must clearly situate the challenges we face in a global context."
"We can only enter and win the race to become competitive if we succeed in creating uniform levels within the European Union."
"The three aspects of cohesion policy - social, economic and territorial - together with the Structural Funds, are the instruments on which we must focus our attention."
"Indeed, we must not think of applying the cuts required to overcome the financial crisis to cohesion policy."
"On the contrary, we must assume the responsibility for implementing it, improving it where it has failed."
"On the basis of the data gathered and of the analysis of the results obtained, the Committee on Regional Development underlines, in Mr Luhan's report, the close relationship between competition and cohesion, and proposes corrective actions for the next programming period."
"There is no doubt that Europe can only become competitive if it successfully overcomes the territorial disparities that exist between the various regions."
"In this regard, I thank Mr Luhan for having accepted my amendment aimed at reiterating the possibility of introducing advantageous tax provisions for transitional periods of no more than five years - a possibility already contained in the resolution which was voted on by this Parliament in February 2006."
"This is a useful way of avoiding some of the difficulties encountered in applying cohesion policy, such as complex procedures, inadequate checks and the need for more effective monitoring."
"A series of amendments have been tabled on these points to optimise the impact of cohesion policy and thus increase the Union's economic competitiveness."
"As Mr Luhan's report points out, emphasis must be placed both on horizontal and vertical partnerships between local authorities and on cofinancing, elements which must be regarded as fundamental principles."
"It is also important to accelerate the simplification of procedures and access to financing, just as it is important to take an integrated approach to the distribution of funds and to maintain transitional regimes, particularly in this difficult period."
"The bottom-up decision-making process, with the involvement of the regions concerned, ensures support for development by harnessing specific regional aspects."
"Finally, the report highlights two main objectives in this regard: innovation and infrastructure."
"I believe that this report is important because it provides all of us with a clear strategy for responding exhaustively to the problem contained in the title of the report."
"I would like to tell you that, as the person in the Bureau responsible for interpreting and translation, I am going to ask the House to put the light that I have here indicating that the interpreters cannot follow you in every seat, because it is not very helpful for them to inform only me."
"I can, of course, inform you myself, but I think it will be more effective if we have this light at every desk."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Luhan and Mrs Mănescu on the remarkable work that they have carried out on their respective reports."
"They have both made a significant contribution to the discussion on new cohesion policy for 2014-2020 that is under way."
"Now, more than ever, it is essential to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion to assert the European Union's competitiveness on a global scale."
"This goal will be achieved so long as we are aware that it is only by strengthening and developing the regional dimension that we can have a Europe that is internally cohesive and externally competitive."
"In particular, I should like to stress three points that I consider crucial: firstly, decentralisation, ensuring that local and regional authorities, especially those with legislative powers, participate more and contribute to better implementing cohesion policy; secondly, the urging of Member States to invite regional and local authorities to participate on an equal footing with the national authorities and representatives in negotiations on the future of the Structural Funds; and lastly, the strengthening of the role of regional authorities in preparing, managing and implementing the programmes."
"It is only through the greater involvement of these authorities in the whole process that it will be possible to comply with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Another aspect that I consider crucial is seeking a more simple architecture for the funds after 2013, not as a result of the economic crisis but rather as a general principle for future cohesion policy, so as to facilitate the absorption of the funds."
"The great concern underlying the Treaty of Lisbon was to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"Instead of just doing this, let us also make their lives easier by preventing unnecessary administrative burdens that will dissuade them from participating."
"Only in this way will we achieve the goal of true territorial cohesion."
"Only in this way will we see a reduction in the starkly contrasting disparities that exist today within the European Union, and where there is currently a huge gap between rich and poor regions."
"Increased participation also means increased responsibility and it is this responsibility that should be taken up and shared by all, as a means of doing more and better to create a stronger, more competitive Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my congratulations and thanks to the two rapporteurs for their successful work."
"The comments made by Mr Luhan on the subject of the 'Future architecture of cohesion policy post-2013' are particularly to be welcomed."
"Although the conclusions on the Fifth Cohesion Report already indicate the Commission's initial ideas on the subject, Mr Luhan's report is an important contribution to determining Parliament's position in respect of the Commission."
"Like the rapporteur, I therefore consider it eminently sensible for cohesion policy to be in harmony with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy in the future."
"However, the individual regions must still be able to decide their own priority areas."
"Not all regions are the same; even within an individual Member State, the regions differ."
"A maximum of two or three priorities - one of which may have already been made mandatory - leaves the regions little scope for manoeuvre."
"The regions need to be given room to invest in their infrastructure and people according to their own priorities."
"With this scenario, specific issues such as demographic changes may not be able to be taken sufficiently into account."
"That would not be much of a regional policy adapted to the needs of the regions, such as the Commission is always talking about."
"For this reason, I believe that we as Parliament have to make it quite clear from the start that the regions must not be allowed to be weakened relative to the Member States."
"The partnership principle needs to be strengthened further."
"The significance of the regions of the EU varies greatly depending on the structure of the state."
"For this reason, particular significance must be attached to the principle of subsidiarity."
"This needs to be taken into account in the Commission's idea of establishing innovation and development partnerships between the Commission and Member States in the future."
"Without going into too much detail, perhaps I might be permitted to discuss briefly the importance of Objective 3."
"I expressly agree with the rapporteur when he talks of difficulties in the border territories of the EU - both internal and external borders."
"This objective needs to be brought into play more in the future."
"In my opinion, too little weight is being given to Objective 3 in the current debate on the future of cohesion policy."
"In particular, cooperation between the regions situated at the former external borders of the EU - and I am referring here to my home region of Saxony - needs to be developed far more."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the data provided by the Court of Auditors in the 2006 and 2008 annual reports on the control systems in operation for cohesion policy are certainly alarming."
"These systems were not as effective as they should have been; they had an error rate of 12% for the amounts reimbursed in 2006 and of 11% in 2008."
"If this error rate is to be reduced, the European Commission must strengthen its supervisory role in relation to local and regional policies."
"The development of a guide for public and private operators and the creation of a training and mobility scheme on how to apply multi-level governance policies in practice could represent effective measures for improving regional policy."
"Furthermore, Member States must strengthen the role of regional and local authorities, in particular, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is likewise necessary to facilitate cross-border regional cooperation; indeed, in many areas of the European Union, there is enormous potential for cooperation between regions and local communities of bordering Member States, particularly in sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry and the environment."
"I shall take advantage of the fact that I have concluded my speech within the allocated time to thank the interpreters, who are always very good to us."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, at the outset, I would like to stress that I consider the report to be particularly important, and to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Luhan, on an excellent job."
"I think that cohesion policy should be the European Union's flagship policy, and that its significance should grow in future years."
"As a horizontal policy, it should set out the directions to be taken by sectoral policies, and contribute to an increase in the competitiveness of European regions and a strengthening of the European Union's position on global markets."
"The system for implementing cohesion policy must be modern and flexible, based on a multi-level management model, as has been mentioned many times."
"It should also foster the coordination of the Structural Funds with other European instruments and with national funds."
"I managed a region with 2 200 000 inhabitants for two terms of office, and I was responsible for implementing cohesion policy instruments on the basis of both a centralised model, between 2004 and 2006, and a decentralised model - the regional operational programme - between 2007 and 2013."
"These experiences allow me to state with full responsibility that the decentralised model allows for better use of local potential for the implementation of strategic solutions and the achievement of positive changes, which is why I am convinced that goals should be agreed at a European level, but the ways of achieving them should be defined in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity at the most appropriate level, which, in the case of cohesion policy, means the regional and local level."
"At the same time, it is essential to link expenditure of funds to the achievement of measurable goals and results: economic growth and a higher level of employment and social inclusion."
"(RO) Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Luhan, for all his efforts in compiling this report, which is especially important for Romania too."
"I believe that the Europe 2020 strategy must promote a sustainable development plan."
"In this respect, what is required are both stronger representation externally and more efficient coordination internally."
"This report is important because it mentions the cohesion policy's achievements."
"Indeed, a major role is given to boosting the regions' competitiveness globally."
"Allocating funds for investment and development projects will definitely be a major benefit for our country."
"It should be pointed out that Romania may be eligible for substantial funds both now and in the period after 2013."
"In this regard, at national level, there were ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that cohesion policy is important as a contributor to growth and prosperity, as well as to promoting development that is balanced between regions."
"It is true that development that is balanced between regions is essential to the functioning of the internal market and of the Union itself, and that cohesion policy is essential to achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It is also true that cohesion policy is useful to the environment, to job creation, and to shaping and creating a modern transport network."
"Given all these things, Mr President, Commissioner, it is unacceptable that the Commission is now taking advantage of these regions' successes and now also wishes to use them as a threat against Member States that do not meet macro-economic criteria."
"This is particularly true given that, in these situations, the regions were not even involved and do not have direct responsibilities, and given that they will be the ones most affected by the constraints on the use of the Structural Funds."
"This is not right, Commissioner, and I should like to hear your reply."
"(LV) Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of this House to social cohesion."
"I find it difficult when talking to voters to explain that we take decisions here in a profound and deliberate way when their standard of living has deteriorated since joining the European Union."
"I am talking about Latvia."
"Thirty-four per cent of the population of Latvia currently survives on subsistence income and on the margins of poverty."
"The minimum pension is LVL 64, received by 12% of the population."
"What I see and hear in this Chamber, what is contained in the reports, is something that I cannot, for my part, support, because I cannot perceive that social questions are given any great attention here."
"Once again, what we have here is talk of further market liberalisation, competitiveness ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to make four comments on these reports."
"The first is that the European Union only makes sense to people if it tries to alleviate economic, social and territorial disparities."
"The second is that European cohesion policy is the crucial financial policy instrument for achieving this objective."
"My third comment is that those who criticise this should really come up with an alternative."
"If they have no alternative to offer, then they should keep quiet."
"My fourth point is that my home region - I come from eastern Germany - is an area where this policy has advanced economic development."
"We are on the right path, but we still have some way to go. We will therefore continue to need further support after 2013 if we are to keep making progress."
"Mr President, Tip O'Neill, the great Irish-American politician, once said: 'all politics is local'."
"The same could be applied to the European Union in terms of development."
"All development has been regional."
"In particular, the success of my own country under the cohesion policy since we joined the European Union is a perfect example."
"We had a little over half the average GDP when we joined in 1973, but now we have one and half times the average GDP, notwithstanding the financial difficulties of the country at the present time."
"Secondly, as we move forward, one of the key aspects for us is going to be to simplify the procedure, put an emphasis on results and added value and try and cut down on red tape and regulation."
"You could fill in forms from here to the end of Parliament but, if there is no added value, it is of no benefit."
"If we do that, we can continue to make progress and I certainly look forward to seeing the regional policy ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Mr President, the effective application of cohesion policy, which is, at present, very decentralised, requires the responsibilities of regional and local level bodies to be further strengthened, because these bodies best understand the needs of a given area and its inhabitants."
"I firmly believe that the creation of a real partnership with regional and local bodies requires a clearer definition of the so-called principle of partnership, as well as the active involvement of local and regional bodies in consultations on the regional policy of the European Union."
"I would like to emphasise that the provision of better coordination between individual levels of control, greater flexibility, and transparent and clear procedures, not only represent features of good administration of public affairs but, above all, should facilitate the drawing down of funds and increase the participation of potential partners in projects."
"Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the very lively debate and I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few more words about financial controls."
"As I am constantly emphasising at various opportunities, we really must get to grips with this and simplify matters, particularly in view of the fact that we need to make greater efforts to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises also take advantage of the opportunities that we want to provide by means of European funding and also, for example, the revolving funding that we want to offer more in the future; and we really need to look at how we can keep the red tape to a minimum."
"On the other hand, I am also constantly having to point out that a large part of the bureaucracy is added at national level."
"In other words, not all the bureaucracy that arises in European projects originates from Brussels; rather, it is the combined effect of processes at national and European level."
"We need to work on this together."
"Mrs Mănescu, I agree with you that we must make the effort to develop standards in this area - although naturally I cannot dismiss national legislation and circumstances entirely."
"In principle, however, I am absolutely with you."
"The subject of conditionality is also something that requires detailed consideration which we do not have sufficient time to go into here."
"It is undoubtedly a matter of identifying for each individual country and for each individual region, where necessary, the reasons for delays in implementing projects; generally, we know what they are already."
"In most cases, it is nothing to do with money - or at least not primarily so - but rather is due to other shortcomings."
"The thinking behind conditionality is to get rid of these in advance so as to ensure faster processing subsequently, which is in the interests of all concerned."
"I am also grateful to the speakers who referred to the development and partnership contract and to the fact that this represents an opportunity, as Mr Olbrycht said, to push for the further involvement of the regional and local authorities."
"Some rethinking will be necessary for this as regards how we can actually implement it in a somewhat institutionalised way, and - let us not forget - in a way that is acceptable to the Member States."
"Here, I am relying on and building on the support and backing of the European Parliament, since the European Parliament, the Commission and the Committee of the Regions are of one mind on this."
"There is one further player, however, and that is the Member States; we need to convince the Member States that they, too, will benefit from an added value if they involve more people in programme planning and these people thereby come to identify with it far more."
"I am also grateful for the comments - which I think came from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - concerning growth."
"I am advocating qualitative and quantitative growth."
"We need both."
"Take research, for example: this is actually something that falls into the category of qualitative growth."
"If it is one of our main objectives to increase the share of renewable energy, for example, but fundamentally we also want to be more energy efficient, then a very important topic for research might be 'How can I store electricity, keep it ready and then make it available when I need it?', so that we can make our power generation even more efficient."
"All in all, one thing has become clear: we will only be able to achieve our objectives if we in fact have a regional policy that reaches all the regions of Europe."
"As has also been said today, if we want to implement the EU 2020 strategy, we will only be able to do so if we can transport and implement this policy in all the regions, but taking into consideration the needs and requirements that exist locally."
"Once again, many thanks - particularly to the two rapporteurs - for this very valuable work."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking all my fellow Members who made a significant contribution to this report and, ultimately, to the cohesion policy and its future."
"I also want to thank the shadow rapporteurs who tabled amendments and made contributions which were just as important, and also because we reached agreement together very easily."
"I do not wish to go into too much detail on what was said."
"I also wish to thank you for the kind remarks you made to me."
"However, I would like to highlight what was said by the Commissioner in particular, comments that are very much worthy of approval."
"He said that the cohesion policy is a policy of investment in regions and people, which is a prerequisite for improving living standards in the European Union's regions."
"I fully concur with this view."
"I similarly agree that we have your backing - for which we are grateful to you - for increased investment in every kind of infrastructure, as an absolute prerequisite for eradicating the disparities in the European Union."
"With regard to the opinion expressed by Mr Besset, I simply want to say that if he had read the report closely, he would have realised that it also mentions economic growth based on a green economy."
"There is also the fact that I made a direct reference to the EU 2020 strategy where the green economy has been introduced as well."
"This is why I want to tell you that the report enjoys majority support at the moment."
"Thank you once again to all of you and we hope that the future cohesion policy will progress along the right path."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their significant contributions to this report, particularly in its final version, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the rest of my fellow Members who tabled amendments, not to mention those who spoke at such a late hour during the plenary debate."
"Given that the vote taken within the Committee on Regional Development recorded a broad consensus among the political groups on the need to implement the principles and measures proposed in this report, I cannot help but be pleased that today's debate has also been in the same vein."
"The working document was drafted following consultations with the European Commission, the Committee of the Regions and representatives of the beneficiaries, whom I would also like to thank once again for their contributions."
"As I already mentioned in my previous speech as well, I firmly believe that the European Commission will have the receptiveness and determination required to ensure that the solutions identified and proposed by us in the Committee on Regional Development will not simply remain at the proposal stage."
"We have come up with specific proposals, Commissioner."
"All you need to do is give them serious consideration."
"I mention this, especially as in the coming months, the European Union will have to define and adapt its future cohesion policy and 2020 strategy, as well as the conditions for their successful implementation."
"Our desire is a new approach to multi-level governance, which will properly serve the EU's vital objectives, as well as a Europe of citizens characterised by economic growth, social progress and sustainable development."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"In order to achieve true social and economic cohesion among the Member States, first we need to address their differences, not just in terms of economic growth and development, but in terms of their physical location."
"At this stage, I see no point in talking of common measures."
"The measures for each Member State must differ, because their needs differ."
"As regards the role of the Commission in the procedures for providing assistance and monitoring good governance in regional policy, it is my view that it must first clearly outline and state its engagements."
"From my own experience in raising issues with the Commission, I either get an answer that is evasive, or am simply told that the question is not within its competence."
"I am from a country where, for many years, passing the buck has been standard procedure, and what I wish is for the competences of the Commission to be clearly delineated, so that we can get clear answers and precise actions in particular circumstances."
"At present, there is a very marked threshold effect between regions that are eligible for funding under the convergence objective and those that are not."
"This is extremely detrimental to some regions which may not be poor but are certainly not rich."
"It would be very helpful if this threshold effect could be attenuated by creating an intermediate category of regions between the 'convergence' objective and the 'regional competitiveness and employment' objective."
"I am glad that this is one of the proposals put forward in the conclusions of the fifth report on cohesion."
"This intermediate category could be aimed at regions with per capita GDP of between 75% and 90% of the EU average."
"I would also like to see this system replacing the transition mechanism and covering regions other than those coming out of the convergence objective."
"In the context of negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework, the budget for this reshaped cohesion policy should remain the same."
"However, it is worth mentioning that just over 20 regions should be taken out of the convergence objective, which will entail savings of EUR 10 billion per year."
"This money could certainly be reallocated to a new intermediate category of regions."
"I congratulate Mr Luhan on his work on the report."
"In connection with the report, I would like to draw attention to two points."
"As regards the connection between the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy and improved competitiveness, it is important to point out that cohesion and increased competitiveness are processes that presuppose and even strengthen each other."
"We cannot focus on supporting the most highly developed regions with a view to maximising the competitiveness of the EU, as this would present the risk of underdeveloped regions falling behind even further, which, in turn, would lead to significant social tensions and the instability of the entire European Union."
"Moreover, it is important to establish that although the cohesion policy contributes significantly to the realisation of the EU 2020 strategy, it alone cannot be responsible for the achievement of the objectives of the strategy."
"We must therefore establish consistency between the realisation of the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and those of the cohesion policy, and the other policy areas must also contribute to an appropriate degree to the achievement of the objectives of the strategy."
"As my second observation, I would like to stress that I fully agree with the rapporteur in that GDP should remain the measure of determining Member State eligibility, as GDP has been the most reliable indicator of the level of development known to date."
"At Member State level, national authorities may use other indicators when distributing the resources, but at EU level, GDP must be retained as the benchmark of eligibility for aid."
"The report on the proper administration of regional policy will strengthen the powers of regional and local bodies in implementing EU policies."
"Parliament has long supported the greater involvement of public bodies other than those at the national level in planning Community policies."
"The principle of partnership as set out in the Committee of the Regions' White Paper on Multi-level Governance must be strengthened right from the early phase of negotiations within the framework of EU discussions."
"The report supports a further simplification of both legislative and non-legislative regulations."
"However, it should be emphasised here that some Member States and their public bodies in particular often contribute to an administrative burden which is not required by Community regulations."
"Further correction is essential here."
"The rules of the subsidy programmes should be simplified to make individual processes more comprehensible, and so as to avoid dissuading potential beneficiaries from participating in projects."
"A high percentage of errors (12%) is reported over expenditure paid out in the implementation and financing of programmes."
"The highest error percentage is always reported in the area of public procurement and so-called ineligible costs."
"There is insufficient supervision by the European Commission, and it is clear that the Commission cannot set up a control system at all national levels."
"It is essential for the monitoring role of the Commission to be retained and supported at the start of programmes, but more could be transferred to Member States and their regional and local bodies during the programmes."
"in writing. - (LV) In order to extend the influence of cohesion policy, certain decisive reforms are essential."
"The support provided by cohesion policy must be concentrated in three main directions."
"What is essential is first, geographical concentration; second, concentration in the scope of support; and, third, administrative concentration."
"This means that the extent of financial support must be directed to those EU Member States, those regions, where there is the greatest need."
"That is to say that an improvement in the socio-economic situation is impossible without the definite support of EU cohesion policy."
"This means that every region must assess the sectors that most urgently need to receive support, instead of nominating all possible sectors without deeper analysis."
"Every region should choose three to five of the 10 sectors offered by the Commission in which to concentrate 100% of the available support."
"This means that we must continue to ease the administrative burden."
"We must increase the degree of trust by the institutions involved, so that the number of functions carried out by those institutions may be optimised."
"I want to emphasise that the existing distribution criterion for EU cohesion policy support - GDP by purchasing power parity per capita (up to 75% of the EU average) - is an appropriate, tested and safe criterion for defining the arc of regions qualifying for support within the convergence framework, because it reflects the genuine disparities between EU Member States and regions."
"I share the rapporteur's opinion that the Union's cohesion policy is one of the most important policies helping to increase the competitiveness of the region and to ensure sustainable development."
"As the international financial crisis had a negative influence on all regions of Europe to a greater or lesser extent, the cohesion policy, which provides added value, certainly has a very important role to play in ensuring that the regions can emerge from the lull stronger."
"The sad thing is that the governments of many EU Member States do not understand the role and importance of the regions - the local authorities - well enough, as they are afraid of losing their power to the regions."
"For example, the government of my home country, the Republic of Estonia, often adopts important laws pertaining to local authorities without taking the authority's decision-making processes into account."
"In order that the various regions are not discriminated against, more attention should now be paid to the regulatory action taken by the Member States' governments to make sure that their actions are not contrary to the Member States' own laws and European values."
"It is true that there are now many regions of Europe which have obtained major political support through the European Committee of the Regions, the European Court of Justice and the Commission in cases where the Member States' governments have ignored the rights of local authorities."
"I believe that an effective European cohesion policy and the fulfilment of the objectives set out in the directive will help to ensure the viability of the regions, but viable regions will increase the viability of the European Union as a whole and, at the same time, this will help prevent the marginalisation of border regions."
"The Luhan and Mănescu reports set out quite rightly the principles on which our cohesion policy should be based."
"However, I would like to emphasise three areas in which we need to be more ambitious."
"The first is territorial cohesion."
"The concept is often quoted but rarely put into action in concrete terms."
"For example, we should pay special attention to border regions."
"The handicaps and problems that these regions experience reflect the limitations of European integration."
"These areas that mark a break should be turned into areas that help make connections."
"The next area is the unequal treatment of regions that oscillate between Objective 1 and Objective 2."
"There can be up to a tenfold difference in the aid given to some regions with the same GDP."
"It is time we established a transitional mechanism that gives equal treatment to all regions with GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average."
"Lastly, we need to work on new performance indicators."
"The development challenges that regions face are linked to their own local constraints."
"We need to refine our criteria at all levels of governance so that we can accurately gauge the needs and aims of regional development."
"Particular attention needs to be paid to the EU's cohesion policy in the interests of greater sustainable growth and increased competitiveness."
"In a Europe of the regions, GDP should continue to be the main criterion in determining regional eligibility for funding."
"However, European regional policy must cover all the regions, while being sufficiently flexible to take into account regional and territorial differences."
"If we are to exploit fully the potential for growth of the regions and achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion in the European Union, it is essential that particular attention is paid to competitiveness."
"In so doing, we must also take into consideration small-scale problems in wealthy Member States."
"In particular, research and innovation should play an important part in all the regions as a means of improving the EU's competitiveness, which is why it is necessary to continue to promote these areas in the future."
"Although the EU 2020 objectives are defined at Community level, it is vital that the local and regional authorities are involved more in their implementation; a bottom-up approach is essential if we are to implement the economic objectives of the EU 2020 strategy efficiently."
"Cohesion policy must continue to be a key EU policy after 2013, with sufficient funding and with the following conditions: simplification of procedures for assigning resources from the structural funds, creation of a framework for public-private partnership, infrastructure established as a basic precondition for increasing global competitiveness, partnership as a condition for developing real partnerships with regional and local bodies and civil society and as a means to effectiveness, legality and transparency at the stage of programming and making use of structural funds, and the application of multi-level management, both on a vertical and horizontal level."
"There are certain other conditions as well, but if we want to fulfil the tasks of the 2020 strategy, I consider it essential to comply with the conditions mentioned previously."
"Europe is currently going through a difficult period."
"The financial crisis of 2008-2009 is still being strongly felt in the economy, which is causing a widening of the gap between the wealthy regions of Western Europe and the poorer regions of Central and Southern Europe."
"This situation is making it necessary to strengthen mechanisms which are effective in fighting the crisis."
"The most important of these at Union level are cohesion policy and the regional funds."
"As a result of the cofinancing of investment at local level, they have become an effective symbol of a European cooperation which has risen above national interests."
"They also made a significant contribution to extending the area which enjoyed economic growth between 2004 and 2007, as well as to reducing the gap between the countries of the old and the new Europe."
"This is why it has become so important to increase Union funds for cohesion policy in the Financial Framework for 2013-2020, to maintain convergence as a primary objective, and to maintain the current mechanism for selecting beneficiaries based on GDP levels in different regions."
"I think the possibility of raising the level of investment cofinancing from 75% to 80% while, at the same time, reducing financing for the remote regions is also important."
"From the point of view of the countries of Western Europe, I think it is also important to continue the financing of infrastructural investments, particularly in the vertical strip which joins the north and south of Europe."
"Impact of advertising on consumer behaviour (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Juvin, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why a report on advertising?"
"Because advertising can be the best of things and also the worst of things."
"It can be the worst of things if it is misleading, if it is intrusive, if it is deceptive, if it does not play the game, if ultimately, it does not deliver what the consumer expects of it, which is information."
"It can be the best of things because advertising is also an amazing tool for economic development."
"Advertising oils the wheels of the economy, and as some people have said, advertising, if it is well done, also gives the consumer a means of making comparisons and, in some ways, it stimulates competition."
"Advertising is not, therefore, something new, so why a new text when there are texts in existence already?"
"For several reasons."
"Firstly, because advertising nowadays is not what it used to be."
"Recently, I read in an American report, but things are fairly similar in Europe, that on 29 November last year, in one day, online trade accounted for a turnover of more than USD 1 billion."
"That is a considerable increase in online trade and online advertising tools."
"One of the justifications for this report is that texts regulating advertising are sometimes completely unsuitable for the tools that have emerged in recent years."
"Advertising can be intrusive, and increasingly it is so; it invades private life."
"There is also something quite new in advertising, which is not covered by the texts."
"Advertising may be covert. Advertising may not declare itself."
"There is a famous example on Facebook, one of the social networks - a new tool that is not covered by the legislation - where groups of people report some alleged fault or other in a product."
"All that can literally destroy a brand within a few days or a few weeks."
"It is clear, therefore, that yesterday's advertising is not at all like today's advertising, which uses tools that did not exist before."
"I am thinking here of behavioural advertising, of targeted advertising, and of reading your private emails."
"Does anyone here want or accept their private emails being read?"
"Well, that is what happens today for the purposes of advertising."
"Basically, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have to think about some very simple values: respect for private life, protection of the most vulnerable people, because we know very well that children are among those most vulnerable people who receive so-called behavioural advertising, which means advertising that targets their habits."
"These children do not understand that this advertising is not just advertising that is sent to them by chance."
"It is advertising that targets their individual choices."
"An adult might understand this, but a child does not."
"Well, new technology brings new challenges: considerable economic challenges."
"We see that basically, this is really a political debate."
"The matter has been resolved, according to some professionals who, above all, do not want the advertising world to be affected."
"It is also true that we hear some professionals explaining to us that, after all, consumers are warned by long and very detailed confidentiality policies on websites."
"In reality, we know that no one reads these long, incomprehensible confidentiality policies and when they are read, they are not understood, they are actually impossible to read."
"We see that, in the end, we keep coming back to the same issue."
"Advertising must be fair, it must respect other people and it must respect private life."
"Consumers must not be spied on and must not be targeted without their knowledge."
"Consumers, citizens, must be respected."
"Mr President, and I shall finish here, we must therefore have two objectives."
"Firstly, advertising must be fair: more fair, more respectful, more effective, therefore, and more respectful of private life, but also citizens, that is, citizens who are consumers, must be more aware, not manipulated, better informed and more discriminating."
"That is the whole purpose of this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you will accept this report and will vote for it, in general terms, in this House."
"(CS) Mr President, I welcome the report on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour."
"As the report does not talk about the regulation of gambling advertisements, I would like to mention that Internet lotteries and advertisements for these in particular recognise no borders and are easily accessible to young people."
"Seven Member States prohibit on-line gambling, but it is still accessible in these countries."
"I firmly believe there is a need to try and prevent the negative consequences of becoming dependent on gambling."
"We must promote a ban throughout Europe on gambling advertisements which target children and young people, because exposing children to the influence of advertisements for virtual lotteries amounts to putting their future lives at risk in the same way as exposing them to unrestricted advertising for alcohol, cigarettes and other addictive substances."
"Moreover, casinos and gambling advertisements are sometimes not subjected to restrictions even outside the context of the Internet, so that casinos and advertisements are often found in close proximity to schools."
"I hope that today's debate will give a fresh impetus to the Commission to propose a ban on gambling advertisements in view of the undoubted public interest."
"(EL) Mr President, my congratulations to the rapporteur, Philippe Juvin, on his report on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour."
"The report evaluates current legislation, underlines problems in its application and unfair trading practices, and highlights the importance of self-regulation, protection for vulnerable consumers, such as children, teenagers and the elderly, and the need to use advertising as a powerful catalyst in combating stereotypes and prejudice."
"I prepared the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and am delighted and I thank the rapporteur for including all our proposals for safeguarding gender equality and human dignity."
"I call on everyone involved to cooperate closely in combating pejorative or misleading advertisements which downgrade the image of women and to promote healthy standards, so that advertising can exert a positive influence on social perceptions, with respect for human dignity and the roles of the sexes."
"Mr President, I would like to talk about the last indent of paragraph 25, which will be up for a separate vote and which I hope we will be able to delete from the report."
"This indent says that when search engines display ads in connection with a certain search word - i.e. somebody types in a search word and that search word is a brand name - this should require the authorisation of the brand owner."
"This may sound sensible on the surface, but it goes completely against trademark law as it stands."
"First of all, trademarks are registered in 45 different classes of goods and services and you can have the same mark in different classes in the same register."
"This would, for instance, mean that if somebody wants his ad displayed connected with the word 'golf', that would require Volkswagen to authorise it for everybody."
"The second problem is the sheer number of trademarks."
"There are millions of trademarks in Europe."
"There are 600 000 at the OHIM in Alicante alone, and many others, so if somebody wanted to advertise something connected to the word 'silver', he would probably have to get clearance from thousands of trademark owners."
"This is simply not practical."
"If this were enacted - which I hope it will not be - it would pretty much kill off the search engine business in Europe, and it would kill off legitimate advertising and legitimate competition."
"So I ask colleagues to vote ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to begin by stating that it is a good thing a discussion is beginning on the floor of the European Parliament on dishonest practices in advertising, especially in connection with the development of new advertising methods and technologies."
"New methods of digital communication have opened up a wide range of possibilities for advertising agencies."
"Along with the new possibilities for advertising, however, come new problems with hard sell, deception and the exploitation of gullible children and young people in the face of powerful assaults on their feelings."
"The regulation of advertising on the Internet must respond to the ingenuity of copywriters, and it is essential to restrict methods and techniques that violate protection of privacy or ethical frameworks, or interfere in the special nature of child development."
"We must therefore concentrate on a thorough analysis and examination of current trends, focusing on using new rules to restrict those technologies and those possibilities which violate the privacy of families and the privacy of children, and which damage the healthy development of the family, and we must apply these rules consistently."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur."
"From the perspective of the values I adhere to, we were discussing one of the most important topics of the recent period."
"The only thing that pains me is that this discussion took place at such a late hour."
"As the report underlines, the persons most vulnerable to advertisements are children and adolescents, whose free will is not yet strong enough and who are easily influenced. This does not only apply to irregular, false and aggressive advertisements, but also to advertisements in general, as we live in a new world where people are faced with the overwhelming pressure to fit in with the consumer society already at an early age."
"All types of advertisement should be expressly prohibited in children's programmes."
"Furthermore, I must specifically highlight the fact that it may not even be the traditional media, such as television or radio, that pose the greatest threat to young people, but the world of the Internet."
"Advertising is at its most aggressive there, and it is there that it can inflict the greatest damage to the targeted consumer."
"The most unscrupulous companies show a disregard even for personal data, and invade the privacy of people through the use of social networking sites."
"This must definitely be prohibited and penalised."
"In this regard, all of us must motion for action to be taken within the European Union."
"(SK) Mr President, the various types of advertising that have been spreading via the new communications media in recent years have become a social phenomenon, bringing with it the risk of exploitation of the trust of the ordinary consumer."
"In my opinion, consumer protection in this area requires minimal legal underpinning at the very least, and I agree with the rapporteur and congratulate him on his report and for seeing the matter in such a constructive way, in favour of vulnerable groups such as children and young people in particular, as some earlier speakers have already mentioned."
"As a doctor, I strongly support this."
"We must prevent cases of deliberate deception, where consumers make decisions on the basis of information which they assume is made up of objective facts or proven studies, when the information is merely of a promotional or commercial nature."
"I am alarmed by the development of advertising practices directly targeting private consumers, such as the reading of email by third parties who exploit the contents thereof for commercial purposes."
"Advertising practices used by companies must, without exception, respect the confidentiality of private correspondence and comply with legislation protecting privacy."
"(GA) Mr President, it is difficult to be certain in this regard, especially when the impact of advertising on the behaviour of citizens is being considered."
"Every day, survey after survey appears, and they all contain different results."
"Nevertheless, advertising does pay; private companies spend millions and millions on radio, TV and newspaper advertisements as well as covert advertising like sponsorship."
"At the same time, there is a dilemma in assessing it."
"On the one hand, you have people saying that one of the cures for alcoholism is to ban advertising."
"Yet we have seen the use of drugs grow exponentially in recent decades, and because they are illegal not only are they not advertised but they cannot be bought over the counter."
"Therefore, I think that there is a need for independent analysis and proper surveying at EU level, without any vested interests involved, to really establish what is good and what is bad, what is beneficial and what is not, and then we can regulate accordingly."
"Without that, I think we are going to have different surveys, day in and day out, producing the results that the people who commission them want."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and, in particular, Vice-President Reding, I want to thank the rapporteur for this valuable report analysing several key aspects concerning the influence of modern advertising and consumer behaviour."
"In order to find out how to best address the challenges arising from the development of the Internet and new technologies, the Commission has consulted widely on the existing legal framework for data protection throughout 2009 and 2010."
"The consultations have confirmed that the underlying principles of the current EU data protection legislation are still very much valid."
"However, it became equally clear that the EU needs a more comprehensive and more coherent approach in its policy for personal data protection for the EU and beyond."
"As a consequence, on 4 November, the Commission adopted a communication on a comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union."
"Online advertising delivers many benefits to European citizens, in particular, by giving them free access to services."
"Many of the targeting techniques - display, contextual and certain search-related adverts, etc. - do not involve any tracking and are not a subject of major concern."
"My colleague, Vice-President Neelie Kroes, has called on the industry to establish a self-regulatory framework for online behavioural advertising based on the EU legal framework and the four principles of effective transparency, an appropriate form of affirmation or consent, user friendliness and effective enforcement."
"The Commission will monitor the industry's efforts to assess whether more regulatory action is necessary."
"As regards advertising emails and the confidentiality of communications, the telecoms reform adopted a year ago strengthened and clarified the EU privacy rules."
"It also created a clear obligation for Member States to enact dissuasive sanctions and to ensure that the competent authorities have not only the necessary powers to enforce them but are also provided with appropriate resources."
"The Member States have until May 2011 to transpose these provisions into national law."
"The Commission acknowledges that there are certain differences in the transposition of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive between the Member States."
"The Commission considers that such differences, some of which the Commission is solving through cooperation with the Member States, are marginal, and that the desired level of harmonisation seems to have been attained."
"The use of general clauses gives some leeway to the Member States but ensures, at the same time, that the directive is future-proof."
"In this connection, the guidance on the application of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is one of the initiatives taken by the Commission to make sure that full harmonisation is effective; in other words, to ensure that the same rules are interpreted and applied in the same manner in the Member States."
"As suggested by the draft report, we will definitely continue our work on the guidance and update this document to take account of new issues and developments."
"The Commission is also developing a legal database on the legislation, jurisprudence and academic work which will foster uniform application of the directive in the Member States."
"As regards the statements in relation to advertising in the form of comments posted on social networks, forums and blogs, it is important to note that, whenever consumers acting on behalf of a trader and/or are in any way financed by a trader to make certain representations without this being made clear in the opinion or statement, this is actually covered by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive as a form of hidden advertising."
"As far as mere opinions are concerned, these, of course, do not qualify as advertising."
"In this connection, the Commission considers that marketing legislation is not the most adequate instrument, as it is a matter of freedom of expression."
"The directive nevertheless contains specific safeguards concerning vulnerable consumers."
"Age is a factor which national authorities must take into account when assessing the fairness of a practice."
"The report on the application of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which is due in 2011, will build on the Member States' experience, including in the field of advertising to children and adolescents, to the extent the data on this aspect will be available."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12:30."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I share many of Mr Juvin's views on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour."
"I believe, however, that preventing the dissemination of comments on social networks, forums and blogs - which, by their very nature, risk becoming a modern kind of 'hidden advertising' - can be achieved by identifying the new forms of offences favoured by the Internet and by extending the rules on data retention to online content providers, rather than by resorting to forms of censorship, since I consider it a priority to respect everyone's right to express his or her opinion on the Internet as well, unless it is proven that it infringes the law."
"I am amazed that people should think of censoring a comment on a forum that they believe might affect consumers' buying decisions and yet they consider it to be an invasion of privacy to extend the current Directive 2006/24/EC on the retention of data to make it possible to identify paedophiles who groom children through social forums."
"Is that a case of double standards?"
"Consumers, especially the youngest consumers, must be protected from hidden advertising."
"Nonetheless, it is proportionally important to protect freedom of expression, which is one of the pillars underpinning our democracies."
"I therefore hope that the relevant authorities can be given the tools they need to identify the perpetrators of Internet crimes through the extension of Directive 2006/24/EC to include content providers, as called for in Parliament's Declaration P7_DCL(2010)0029 of 23 June 2010."
"Regulation of trading in financial instruments - 'dark pools', etc. (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Swinburne, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on regulation of trading in financial instruments - dark pools, etc. (2010/2075 (INI))."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I have difficulty explaining to those uninitiated in financial jargon precisely what my report on 'dark pools' refers to."
"The report formally refers to the trading of financial instruments, including dark pools, which are financial transactions and shares conducted without pre-trade transparency, otherwise referred to as non-displayed trades."
"The report, more broadly, is an assessment of the implementation of the Markets in the Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) of 2007 with respect to equities and seeks to address structural issues currently apparent in the equities markets."
"Despite this being a highly technical report, I am encouraged by the high level of debate that has occurred in the committee."
"I am glad that the hard work of my colleagues has managed to establish a broad base of support across political groups, turning 194 amendments into 26 compromises, which most groups were able to sign up to."
"Given the timing of this own-initiative report and its culmination in a plenary vote this week, I also believe that the European Parliament has added significantly to the Commission's recently released consultation on the MiFID II review (MiFID II), which takes into account many of the issues raised in deliberations in the committee."
"The European Parliament, through this report, has asked for a number of investigations into the different trading venues that are currently regulated under MiFID and seeks a closer analysis to ensure that venues providing equivalent services are regulated to an equivalent level."
"I believe that the Commission, in their consultation document, may have gone a step further in widening its definition of organised trading facilities to include all venues that bring together buyers and sellers."
"This means a significant loophole may be closed."
"Yet this solution ensures that proportionality can be maintained in allowing for significant differentiation within the categories for regulated markets, MTFs, SIs, BCNs and derivative platforms."
"The new level of scrutiny being suggested for operators of dark pools should be welcomed by investors as, while they currently provide protection from the wider market, they at least have the potential for abuse."
"Allowing regulators full access to business models should ensure that they can continue as a venue for the discretionary crossing of client orders without allowing them to expand to proportions that will affect price discovery or to provide a cover for market abuse."
"As well as this, in terms of MiFID waivers, the European Parliament and the Commission agree that these need to be redefined and their implementation needs to be standardised across the EU."
"The possibility currently to arbitrage across EU Member States to find the best interpretation of the same rule should no longer be a possibility."
"During the compilation of this report and its amendment, it was clear that the biggest deficit in MiFID implementation has been the lack of a market version of a European consolidated tape."
"Investors in the US cannot understand how we in the EU operate without such a tool."
"There has been general industry acceptance, particularly among investor groups, of its necessity but, for the three years since MiFID implementation, the market participants have failed to come together to provide a European consolidated tape."
"Like the Commission, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is reticent to go beyond mandating the approved publication arrangements, but if a market solution is not found, then legislation should be supported."
"The micro-structural issues currently affecting the equity markets have been a topic of heated debate in committee."
"There has been agreement that practices like flash orders, spoofing and pinging are unfair or even abusive."
"However, the committee found it much harder to come to agreement on the role of certain market participants, in particular, the benefits or not of high-frequency trading strategies."
"In the absence of clear data, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions on their role - positive or negative - and so, before we propose legislative actions, we need to make sure that we have data so that we do not impose legislation that may be detrimental to the effective functioning of European markets."
"Fundamentally, we must ensure the integrity of our financial markets."
"They are not there for intermediaries or the interlopers to interact with one another."
"They are there to provide a market place for investors to channel capital to businesses and corporates who act in our real economy."
"This fundamental function of the markets must be kept centre stage in all of our minds as we go through the legislative process of MiFID II."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Swinburne, of course, this text is extremely complex but, basically, what is it about?"
"Once again, it is a matter of learning the lessons from the crisis."
"No, we must not do as we did before, yes, we must change the rules of the game, and we must put order back into the system."
"There are those people in the different countries of the Union who are now taking advantage of the crisis and of people's anxiety in order to put all the blame on Europe."
"Everywhere you hear people saying, 'it is because of Europe that things are not working, it is because of the euro, and here is the solution, we must get out of Europe, we must put an end to the euro...'"
"To all those people, we have to keep on repeating that yes, we do need common rules, we have to keep on saying that if the countries of Europe were not united, if they were isolated, they would now be dead."
"Yes, we need regulation, common policy, common rules, and an overhaul of our rules and better functioning of the system."
"Ladies and gentlemen, ultimately, the matter is quite straightforward: together we are strong, in isolation we are dead!"
"(HU) Mr President, I would like to thank you for allotting time so generously."
"From now on, I will pay particular attention to which sittings are conducted by you, and I will attempt to attend all of them."
"Mrs Swinburne's report is very important in that we are finally discussing the regulation of trade in financial instruments."
"The first and most significant mistake in connection with the report is that the report and the call for further regulations is a belated step."
"Secondly, if the regulatory framework has been unclear so far, we must explore retrospectively and in depth everything that has happened."
"I believe that the exclusion of major investments from the scope of stricter supervision is a meaningless and outright mistaken step."
"Not only the nature of trading, but also the derivatives issued need to be investigated, and new issues must be subject to stricter regulation."
"Inflation is actually stimulated by derivative financial market products."
"The burden of this is borne by the population, while the profits are cashed in by various international legal entities, whose background is not always clear."
"Moreover, it would not be favourable to redirect profits pocketed in this manner into the real economy, as this may lead to the entire planet gradually slipping into the pockets of the wealthiest."
"(RO) Mr President, Mrs Swinburne's report focuses on ensuring that there is a level playing field between multilateral trading facilities."
"I think that it is also just as important to apply the same level of supervision to them."
"I would like to stress the need for more suitable legislation, with the aim of reducing systemic risk and ensuring fair competition on the market."
"At the moment, there is a worrying lack of information available about trading strategies."
"The only way to really understand whether the market is operating properly is for the regulatory authorities to have sufficient information."
"ESMA should draw up common reporting standards and formats applicable to all data, both on organised trading venues and OTC."
"I think it would be useful to carry out an investigation into the effects of setting a minimum order size for all dark transactions. It could therefore be established whether an adequate flow of trade is maintained."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and of Commissioner Barnier in particular, I will answer by saying that improving transparency in financial markets and ensuring that all relevant market actors are subject to appropriate levels of regulation are key aims of this Commission and of the G20."
"I would like to congratulate Dr Swinburne and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the report on trading in financial instruments, 'dark pools', etc. The report marks an important step in the context of the ongoing review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)."
"Its recommendations are being closely integrated into the Commission's thinking as we prepare the proposal for amending the existing directive in 2011."
"The MiFID review is an important part of the Commission's agenda towards a more stable and transparent financial system working for society and the economy as a whole."
"Many pieces have already been put in place, not least, the launch of a new EU supervisory authority as of next month."
"The Commission is committed to delivering proposals in the remaining areas by summer 2011."
"We count on the support of the European Parliament in moving swiftly to adopt the necessary reforms in order to ensure they are applied as soon as possible thereafter."
"As you know, MiFID is a cornerstone of the EU regulatory framework for financial markets."
"It pre-dates the financial crisis but has, on the whole, proven to function well, even in the difficult and turbulent times of recent years."
"Of course, some shortcomings have emerged."
"Technological progress and rapid developments in financial markets have also ensured that regulatory devices which were state-of-the-art some years ago are clearly outdated today."
"On 8 December, the Commission published draft proposals for a consultation."
"We intend to be ambitious and comprehensive in tackling all challenges."
"While recognising that the original objectives of MiFID are still valid, the issues at stake are critical aspects of how our financial markets function, how open and transparent they need to be and how investors can gain access to financial instruments and investment opportunities."
"Like the draft Economic Affairs Committee report, we perceive the need for improvements in the regulation of new types of trading platforms and trading methodologies."
"This should take proper account of the nature of the business with a view to ensuring a level playing field between actors and proper protection for investors as well as against disruptive market practices."
"We also agree with the need to improve transparency rules applicable to trading in shares and to introduce new requirements for trading in other instruments."
"Another important area touched upon also in Dr Swinburne's report is to improve the functioning and regulation of commodity derivative markets in line with G20 principles."
"Furthermore, we aim to introduce targeted improvements to the existing rules regarding investor protection."
"Ensuring all products and selling practices are suitably covered under equal rules is a vital component in restoring investor confidence."
"Finally, this review will reinforce supervision and enforcement across financial markets with a key role foreseen for the new European Securities and Markets Authority."
"In taking the work forward, the Commission services are working closely with our international partners, notably with the responsible regulators in the United States who are looking at the same issues, to ensure international convergence and avoid any risk of regulatory arbitrage."
"The report by Ms Swinburne comes at an important juncture in the process of regulatory reform."
"We are encouraged by the commitment shown by MEPs and by the fact that your analyses and recommendations coincide very closely with ours."
"This report reinforces the basis for our work ahead."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00."
"The next sitting will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 14 December 2010, from 09:00 to 13:00, from 15:00 to 20:30 and from 21:00 to 24:00."

"Fundamental rights in the European Union (2009) - Effective implementation after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Gál, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2009) - effective implementation after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon brought with it the vision and idea of a strong Europe in respect of Community powers."
"To the citizens, it offers the promise of the fulfilment of this vision."
"This also applies to the protection of fundamental rights, and therefore, in contrast to previous years, this year's report deals with these new legal bases and with the strengthened and newly established powers and institutions, and provides a close examination of the situation thus created."
"The aim of the report is to offer a new and comprehensive approach in the protection of fundamental rights."
"Since December 2009, the protection of fundamental human rights has rested on multiple pillars within the European Union."
"On one hand, it is based on the Treaty of Lisbon, and on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has now become legally binding."
"The Charter has become a standard for the creation and application of EU laws by both the EU institutions and by the Member States."
"A similar pillar of the Community legal system will be our accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, a process that is currently under way, but the system of human rights guarantees enshrined in the Member States' own legal systems will remain a similar pillar."
"These legal bases will also be reinforced by the established Community institutions, both at Community and Member State level."
"At Community level, I would like to mention the Commission, the portfolio of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, the Council working group, Parliament, and of the agencies, I would like to highlight the role of the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"The aim of my report is to raise awareness in order to ensure that these existing institutions and mechanisms operate in an efficient and transparent way, whether in the monitoring of decision making or legislation, data collection, or information transfer, and that they do not accord priority to some rights while neglecting others."
"It is important that the individual institutions not only report, but also respond to and comment on each other."
"They should make use of, and build upon, each other's work in the field of the protection of human rights, and should take their decisions coherently, objectively, and on the basis of facts."
"Thus, in this report, we reviewed what Parliament expects from these institutions."
"We commented on the Commission communication issued in October, which follows a similar concept."
"One of the principal aims of the report is to emphasise that the current fundamental rights structure must begin and end with the individual, that is to say, the citizen."
"This means that we must provide citizens with sufficient information to ensure that they are aware of and understand their opportunities and are able to make use of them."
"The system of protection of fundamental rights must be comprehensible, accessible and effectively useful, as the entire structure is only worth as much as the citizens of the EU can assert from it."
"In achieving these goals, the aforementioned institutions and the Member States must assume a balancing role to ensure that the EU can increase its credibility in the eyes of the citizens."
"Finally, my report focuses on those areas which not only require rapid action but also medium to long-term strategies, such as the integration of the Roma, the fight against child poverty and the issue of language use among minority communities, to name but a few."
"I hope that with the report that will be adopted tomorrow, we will be able to send a readily comprehensible and clear message to the aforementioned institutions: to the Commission, the Council, the agencies, the Member States' bodies and courts, so we can make this system even more effective."
"In this, I request your support for tomorrow so that in the post-Treaty of Lisbon period, now that the foundations, the institutions, are already in place, we can act in this spirit."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the debate today on the fundamental rights situation in the European Union is very important, not only because it comes 10 years after the proclamation of the charter - the anniversary of the charter was at the beginning of this month - but also because it is the first discussion in Parliament dedicated to that which the rapporteur, Ms Gál, calls the 'new post-Lisbon fundamental rights architecture'."
"She is absolutely right."
"We have started with a new beginning for the meaning of human rights and fundamental rights in Europe."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their very valuable contribute to this debate."
"We now have a legally binding charter which is part of the EU's primary legislation."
"What we need to do now is to put the charter into practice."
"It was precisely for this reason that, in October, the Commission adopted a communication on the strategy for the effective implementation of the charter."
"The key objective for the Commission here is to make the rights enshrined in the charter as effective as possible for the benefit of all the people living in the EU and, as Members of this House, you represent those people."
"The charter must be our compass and we must lead by example, in particular, when we legislate."
"This applies to the Commission's internal preparation work and to adoption by the European Parliament and the Council, as well as to the application of the new rules by the Member States."
"The Commission has enforced a systematic assessment of the fundamental rights impact of new legislative proposals through a fundamental rights checklist to be used by all Commission departments."
"I am pleased to see that Ms Gál's report supports this approach."
"It highlights, in particular, how important it is for the European Parliament and for the Council to pay attention to compliance with the charter throughout the legislative process."
"Not only must the text on the table comply with the charter, but the effects of later amendments to that text must be taken into account as well."
"Each institution therefore needs to think about how to ensure that amendments to legislative proposals are properly assessed."
"I welcome the call in the report for improved cooperation among the institutions."
"We also have to see how the charter is applied when Member States implement EU law."
"I would like to reiterate in this House that I will not shy away from starting infringement proceedings whenever necessary."
"The report also highlights the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The speedy accession of the European Union to the Convention is a high priority for the Commission."
"Negotiations are well under way, and are moving forward in a swift and constructive manner."
"If everything goes well, as seems to be the case, I hope that we will be able to reach a final agreement in the first half of 2011. So things are moving quickly and they are moving well."
"I also fully share the objective of ensuring smooth cooperation with international organisations."
"We do this as a matter of course, on a daily basis."
"The Commission already takes into account the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child when it prepares new proposals which can affect children."
"Recently, we also had a discussion about the disabled, and it is clear that in that field, too, we are applying the United Nations Convention in the Member States and at European Union level."
"The rapporteur spoke about the Agency for Fundamental Rights, which has a key role to play in providing us with comparable and reliable data on the situation in the 27 Member States in areas where the EU can act."
"There, too, we want to work not only in theory but in practice."
"I have, for instance, asked the agency to contribute to the work of the Roma task force."
"The Commission is in favour of extending the mandate of the agency to ensure that it can also provide its expertise in the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation."
"To make this possible, on 2 December, the Commission adopted a proposal to amend the multiannual framework, which lists the thematic areas in which the agency can work."
"I should now like to move on to something new, which I think tallies perfectly with the rapporteur's line, and that is the momentum created by the Lisbon Treaty which we have to uphold."
"With this in mind, in spring 2011, the Commission will publish its first annual report on the application of the charter."
"The idea is for this to be published as an annual report every spring."
"I believe this would be the time for Parliament to come in and provoke a real debate on how the charter is being applied in practice."
"When we prepare our first annual report on the application of the charter in spring 2011, I will pay particular attention to the European Parliament's report, and to Parliament's other fundamental rights activities."
"This will not only allow us to hold a debate on human rights outside the European Union, as is customary in this House, but it will also allow us to hold a yearly debate on fundamental rights and how they are applied by the different governments inside the European Union, as well as to see whether the European institutions are doing their jobs as they should be."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Kinga Gál for her report and, in particular, for the focus she placed on such an important subject, that is, the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union and its implementation."
"I believe that Kinga Gál's concentration on this issue was crucial this year."
"I would like to make a point on how important it is that we keep considering human rights as fundamental human rights, because sometimes I fear that not everyone interprets the concept of fundamental rights in the same manner."
"First of all, it must be made clear that human rights do not mean that we should ignore the concept of, say, subsidiarity, or that we should trample upon the different values that Member States embrace."
"Unfortunately, there are some who are attempting to manipulate the issue of fundamental rights to do just that."
"The European Union should leave it up to the Member States to deal with ethical issues such as euthanasia and abortion."
"Secondly, we should take care to ensure that fundamental rights are indeed fundamental rights and do not include other rights which, albeit important, are not fundamental and therefore risk being unrealistic when viewed in today's context."
"A case in point would be the rights that are connected to immigration issues, which are of considerable importance, yet are not always fundamental rights."
"Finally, we must seek to adopt reasonable positions on, for example, security and the importance of data protection."
"Therefore, to conclude, I believe that we need fundamental rights, yet at the same time, we must ensure that they are both logical and realistic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, as I think she has managed to fulfil the main aim of the report, which is specifically to clarify the roles which individual institutions and mechanisms will play in the new post-Lisbon architecture of fundamental rights."
"I consider three areas contained in the report to be of key importance."
"It is important for the Union to defend not only the rights of its citizens, or the people on its territory, but also to become a global leader in this area."
"The newly-established European External Action Service can play a key role from this perspective."
"I would therefore like to call on the Commission to ensure that the structure, resources and activities of the diplomatic service are established in such a way that European diplomacy can effectively promote fundamental rights abroad as well."
"Secondly, following Lisbon, democracy and human rights have a new expression via the European Citizens' Initiative."
"The initiative boosts the role of EU citizens, who can use it to initiate the adoption of European legislation."
"Thirdly, I would like to express my satisfaction over the fact that the report calls on EU Member States and institutions to redouble their efforts on raising public awareness of fundamental rights."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for being responsive to our comments, and for the fact that the report also contains the explicit reference we requested to the fight against poverty and social exclusion in the section mentioning the activities necessary for the protection of fundamental rights."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, tomorrow afternoon, we will be able to share our thoughts on the human rights situation in the world, but this morning, we are focusing on the state of play as regards these rights in the European Union."
"Discussing the European Union first and the rest of the world afterwards is the right order in my view because, before criticising others, we should put our own house in order."
"If we really want to be taken seriously, we must not turn a blind eye to human rights violations on our own soil."
"This resolution, for which I want to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms Gál, focuses on the way forward for EU policy in the field of human rights protection and advancement after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"It deals not only with who bears responsibility for what, but also focuses on the topics that should be at the centre of our concern in the future."
"I would just like to emphasise two aspects."
"I was happy with the support given in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the idea of a kind of freezing mechanism, by which national contested policies or decisions can be frozen by the Commission until it has taken a formal decision as to whether to start the infringement procedure."
"I believe such a mechanism will bring added value in creating a more credible fundamental rights policy within the European Union."
"I hope, therefore, that the entire House will lend its support to this mechanism when we vote tomorrow."
"The other aspect relates to the right and the duty of this Parliament continually to analyse the human rights situation in the Member States and to be critical in expressing its views, including naming and shaming when necessary."
"Mr President, this is a very good report, and the first one after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, for her hard work, receptiveness and fruitful cooperation."
"I would like to come back to four messages contained in this report."
"The first concerns our requirement for the Commission to fulfil its role with respect to the new resources at its disposal and to the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The situation of the Roma people has sadly been the first practical case, and the Commission has, in the end, only gone halfway on this matter, basing itself solely on the Free Movement Directive."
"The Commission has sidestepped the non-discrimination issue on the basis of Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but it cannot be so half-hearted in future, with the ratification, by the Union, of the European Convention on Human Rights, and I am delighted to see the Union's commitment to seeing this through."
"The added value of this report also resides in the fact that it emphasises the need for early detection of potential violations through the implementation of a warning system."
"This system makes provision, among other things, for measures suspected of constituting such violations to be suspended while the accelerated procedure for determining whether they are contrary to fundamental rights is carried out."
"I would also insist on the need to set up a prevention system on the model, for example, of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism within the United Nations Council."
"Once again, I would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes, as you have already mentioned, Mrs Reding."
"In that respect, the signing of EU readmission agreements represents a real challenge."
"We are blindly endorsing these agreements when the actual terms of their implementation are being decided in joint committees from which Parliament is excluded."
"Mr President, now that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has become legally binding in Europe, we are dealing with two systems for the protection of human rights which are, to a certain extent, in competition with one another."
"One of these systems is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the case-law of the Court of Justice, and the other is based on the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights."
"I think the fundamental challenge identified in the Gál report is that of ensuring coherence between these systems, both in terms of content and in institutional terms."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights must not be interpreted in such a way that it results in the presumption of new competences for the European Union."
"Article 51 states this very clearly, but I think it is worth reminding everyone, particularly the Members of this House, that issues relating to marital law, criminal law and the legal protection of unborn life cannot be regulated at EU level, either directly or by the actions of any court or tribunal."
"This politicisation of human rights protection instruments can lead to only one thing - a fall in trust in the international judiciary."
"Mr President, I should like, in turn, to thank our rapporteur for her willingness to listen and for her work, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the quality of this report."
"For us, this report is important because it draws conclusions from one of the few positive outcomes of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, if it is effectively implemented."
"Indeed, the effective implementation of fundamental rights in the European Union is an important, if not fundamental, issue for the European Union's future."
"However, using flowery language will not be enough."
"The Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, soon, accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, will provide us with new tools in this area and will enable the European Union and its Members to reach a new stage."
"Many say that human rights are part of the European Union's essential values but few recognise them as being truly universal and indivisible."
"Indivisible, meaning that all the human rights enshrined in the Charter, but also in the European Convention, and in all the European and international conventions that stem from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, have the same value, whatever they may be."
"Civil and political rights are no more important than economic and social rights."
"The right to live in dignity is just as important as religious freedom for instance."
"Universal means that human rights are the same for everyone, regardless of their nationality, regardless of their legal status."
"However, we know that the right to education and the right to family life, here too for instance, are constantly flouted in nearly every Member State."
"The situation regarding the Roma people is unfortunately symptomatic of this."
"So yes, the Commission must resolve to start infringement proceedings and to be as strict as it is on economic matters."
"Universal also implies that human rights have the same value throughout the world, meaning that the European Union must attach the same importance to human rights as it does to economic or diplomatic issues in its foreign policy and partnership agreements."
"This is not the case in countries such as Tunisia, Libya and Colombia, and I could mention many more."
"So yes, this is a fundamental issue; the European Union's credibility and the future of its foreign policy are at stake."
"(HU) Mr President, as a Hungarian and a female politician, I am proud that it was a Hungarian female Member, Mrs Kinga Gál, who created with considerable effort this very significant work on a better assertion of human rights, and brought it before the European Union."
"For this, I would like to thank her."
"What I find lacking, however, is an emphasis on traditional civil and political liberties, and there is hardly anyone in a better position here in the EU than we, Hungarians, to emphasise that in the European Union, the problem does not only lie with discrimination against minorities or the integration of the Roma when it comes to human rights, but with the freedom of expression, assembly and speech, and nothing illustrates this better than the situation in Hungary between 2002 and 2010."
"The Human Rights Committee of the Hungarian Parliament recently adopted a very thorough and detailed report, which demonstrates through court judgments, reports of the ombudsman and other means that the Hungarian socialist governments between 2002 and 2010 maintained their power by grossly and continuously violating human rights."
"My question to the rapporteur, on the one hand, is whether this particular Hungarian report can finally be presented to the European Union in the current situation, and whether the European Union will investigate it, because that would indeed be a realistic indication that there has been some measure of change in the field of human rights."
"On the other hand, if we are able to speak of an increased possibility to assert human rights in the European Union at all, how could we better avoid incidents like the one where people were shot in the eye in Hungary in 2006, particularly if the Vice-President of the LIBE Committee is still an individual who, at that time, was a member of a government that had people shot in the eye?"
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one can only remark favourably on a report such as the one so ably put together by the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, which has the strong point of describing the situation regarding the implementation of fundamental rights both accurately and in detail."
"I should like to raise a few minor points regarding the implementation itself."
"Thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now obligatory, and the Lisbon Process, which cannot now be halted, there is no doubt that this support for wellbeing and the person derives from a set of values that is truly shared, as is shown in tangible terms by the real results achieved."
"Therefore, we must bear in mind the Treaty of Lisbon, the Stockholm Programme, and fundamental principles such as solidarity, integration and the fight against organised crime and terrorism."
"We must bear in mind that the principle of subsidiarity obviously cannot stand in the way of the implementation of fundamental rights in a Europe of the people."
"A few days from now, we shall approve a new dossier and the new regulation regarding the legislative initiative in favour of citizens against the trafficking of human beings."
"These dossiers are integrated with each other and definitely form an updated legal frame of reference."
"All the measures have a precise objective: to value human dignity."
"I should like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that the power to make checks and apply real sanctions must be properly implemented in 2013, the European Year of Citizenship."
"This could certainly be an important factor to really assess the significance of the measure."
"Mr President, pre-Lisbon, post-Lisbon, we have very little to be proud of."
"In Europe, you can still be discriminated against if you are a woman."
"We have heard it said here in the Chamber today: a woman cannot choose what to do with her body."
"You can be discriminated against on the grounds of age, disability, religion, belief, sexual orientation."
"On the supply of goods and services, there is no movement on the Council directive."
"If you are in a same-sex partnership or a civil partnership or a marriage, you can be discriminated against by a Member State on the precept of the concept of subsidiarity."
"On that basis, you can promote inequality."
"We have a two-speed Europe where some people are equal and others are not."
"We sit here and do nothing while we see rising xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and transphobia and, yes, look at what is happening to the Roma."
"Have we learnt nothing from the Second World War?"
"Have we learnt nothing from the 1930s when we turned away and did nothing because people were different from us?"
"Can we not see that religion, decent religion, is being used as an excuse to increase discrimination against LGBT people in particular?"
"Can we not see that to diminish the rights of another is ultimately to diminish our own?"
"We have nothing to be proud of."
"(NL) Mr President, it is patently clear that the Treaty of Lisbon takes a different approach to fundamental rights from that we have previously been used to."
"First of all, of course, because of the European Union's accession to the European Court of Human Rights, which has brought about a strange situation in which courts are competing with each other."
"It is still unclear exactly what turn things will take in this respect."
"I fear that, with the EU's accession to the ECHR, we may have landed in a legal minefield."
"Could the Commissioner comment on this?"
"My second point concerns the lasting impact of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on European law."
"I have a specific question for the Commissioner concerning a judgment handed down on 9 November 2010 by the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"This is about the joined cases of Volker and Hartmut Eifert, under references C 92/09 and C 93/09."
"In brief, these cases were about the right to privacy versus the right of public access to European funding streams."
"In these judgments, the Court decided that the right to privacy outweighs the general European transparency interest."
"I was very surprised by this judgment and I would very much like to know the Commissioner's point of view on this matter, in the context of the lasting impact of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter on current and future EU legislation."
"(SL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Gál, on preparing a good report."
"It is true that we have a new situation in the European Union as far as the protection of human rights is concerned."
"It seems to me that freedom is expanding and that that is a good thing."
"The report is quite contemporary, or modern; it even speaks of a third generation of human rights and the like."
"However, protecting human rights and freedoms also includes righting the wrongs of the past."
"We may have highlighted many third generation rights, as they are called, in this report, but we have forgotten some issues, such as returning property that was confiscated by totalitarian regimes to its owners or giving a dignified burial to the many people who were brutally killed in Central and Eastern Europe in 1945 and only given makeshift graves."
"For that reason, we, the present generation of political decision makers, are responsible for righting these wrongs of the past."
"Only then will we be able to speak with a clear conscience about new, third generation human rights and freedoms, as they are called, for the present and for the future, too."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, with the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has also become legally binding, and it created the possibility for infringement procedures to be launched in the case of its violation."
"In some Member States, the social tensions that have arisen in the wake of the crisis have brought about a restriction of democratic rights, instead of steps having been taken in this direction."
"They have brought about the restriction of the freedom of the media, the restriction of the right to strike, the circumvention and limitation of social dialogue, the strengthening of discrimination, and the shattering of the foundations of the rule of law and legal certainty."
"The Commission, in its role as the guardian of the treaties, has an obligation to be mindful of such signs."
"We believe that the creation of the portfolio of a Commissioner for fundamental rights is an important step, and we call on Mrs Reding to regularly monitor the Member States and call attention to cases where fundamental rights and the basic principles of democracy are violated, in order to ensure that these are not only mandatory for candidate countries before their accession, but also later on, as the failure to do so would further undermine the credibility of the EU."
"(RO) Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Kinga Gál for her report."
"We currently have a community of values and principles, reflected in a complex system of human rights protection, which includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the most progressive regional code of human rights."
"Member States must abide by the Charter's provisions when applying EU legislation."
"The Charter's provisions can be applied directly by national courts, thereby also giving them great responsibility."
"Secondly, we have the European Convention and the case-law of the Court of Justice in Strasbourg."
"They provide a guarantee for individual rights in Member States."
"The European Union's accession to the Convention will ensure that the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights is also applied to the actions taken by the EU as an institution and by a Member State which applies EU legislation."
"We certainly must monitor closely the reform of the Court in Strasbourg and its impact on shortening proceedings."
"Thirdly, at national level, Member States have the duty and opportunity to implement directly the provisions which guarantee fundamental rights, to apply them in their own countries through the decisions of their own institutions."
"Therefore, both legal and institutional mechanisms exist."
"The keyword is implementation, which must be rapid and effective for victims."
"Another keyword is coordination between the institutions which deliberate on the violation of rights and award damages."
"(PL) Mr President, incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into EU law does not extend the scope of the EU's competences and complies with the principle of subsidiarity, since the Charter is an integral part of EU policy."
"I therefore call once again upon the Polish authorities to meet their obligations and adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Poland's opt-out from the Charter has no substantive justification."
"It is a political decision which compromises my country and is detrimental to Polish citizens."
"Adoption of the Charter is particularly important in the context of the upcoming Polish Presidency."
"All Europeans must have equal rights, regardless of where they live and the extent to which their country is in thrall to the clergy."
"Unfortunately, even the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland does not always understand this."
"In my opinion, respect for the rights of women, the only majority to be discriminated against, is particularly important."
"I therefore call once again for a European directive on violence against women, including sexual and reproductive violence, as practised by certain Member States with the full sanction of domestic law."
"(HU) Mr President, the forward-looking part of the report has already been pointed out by many of my fellow Members."
"Finally, we have a report that encompasses the various issues related to human rights without giving preference to one area to the detriment of another."
"I am particularly pleased that that the report specifically highlights non-discrimination and equal opportunities."
"The report is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This is the point of my speech."
"Adherence to, and enforcement of, the Charter can only be successful if European society recognises that all human beings are equal, and that this equality can only be realised through equal treatment."
"If anyone is put at a disadvantage in any respect through no fault of their own, they must be given appropriate and proportionate assistance so that they can become persons of equal value, citizens of equal value."
"The road that leads to this goal is a difficult one, and deliberate work will be required to complete it."
"Mrs Gál's report is a significant milestone along this road."
"I am grateful for her very significant work."
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to point out one danger."
"The combination of different forms of combating discrimination may lead to discrimination."
"There was also talk of this at the OSCE meeting last week in Vienna."
"It is a paradox, but as anti-discrimination policy becomes an ideology, people begin to discriminate."
"We see how the actual concept of discrimination goes beyond its definition."
"If the European Union has any serious shortcomings in this area, it is in the need to restore the original meaning of the word 'discrimination', because it is no longer understood either by human rights activists or sometimes even by our own EU Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"I am therefore calling for democratic control of this institution."
"If this does not happen, it may even become a financially costly burden, detracting from the reputation not only of the European Commission, but, indirectly, of the entire European Union."
"(HU) Mr President, the rapporteur has done an excellent job."
"However, to quote a popular Hungarian saying, unless it is implemented, it will be worth as much as horseshoes on a dead horse."
"I do not see a political will in the European Commission to enforce these rights and to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States."
"I have much faith in Mrs Reding."
"She has more courage than all the male Commissioners combined, as she dared to oppose Mr Sarkozy, even though Mr Barroso had tried to dissuade her from doing so for a long time."
"In the upcoming period, she will be faced with a considerable challenge, as the Hungarian Government assuming the EU Presidency is committing serious infringements of fundamental rights."
"It is restricting the freedom of the media, abolishing the rights of trade unions in relation to public servants, and it fails to protect private property when it appropriates the private pension savings of three million citizens."
"This government is violating fundamental rights, and you, Mrs Reding, must have the courage to initiate an infringement procedure."
"(IT) Mr President, notwithstanding the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and the national constitutions, serious violations of human rights persist on a daily basis in the European Union and in the Member States."
"In my country - Italy - there is a regime in force in which freedom of the press is violated, political parties take part in elections by submitting fake signatures, State secrecy covers up violent attacks (including by the Mafia), our Prime Minister - though not for much longer, we hope - profits from international cooperation with regimes like those in Russia and Libya, as was also confirmed by WikiLeaks."
"The European Union cannot allow itself to turn a blind eye to all of this."
"For these reasons, I support the report, which contains many of the amendments submitted by me and approved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Amongst these, I should like to single out paragraphs 20 and 40, which call for human rights violations to be monitored and penalised, and for national legislative proposals with the potential to violate human rights to be frozen before they become law, until the EU approves them."
"I also supported the incentive to use Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union to address human rights violations and to bolster the mandate of the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"The report makes numerous positive references to minorities, rights, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, immigrants and asylum seekers, freedom of the press and social rights."
"For these reasons, I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of the report."
"(PT) Mr President, we are all aware that many kinds of discrimination still exist in the countries of the European Union, affecting different sections of the population and cultural minorities."
"However, we cannot forget that there is general discrimination against women: discrimination against women continues to make itself felt to a greater or lesser degree in many different areas in the EU Member States."
"Women workers still have difficulty in getting jobs and in being promoted in their careers, and they still fall victim to low wages and other forms of discrimination that always affect them."
"The gender pay gap in the EU stands at about 18%."
"Urgent measures are therefore needed to combat these discriminatory situations."
"(DE) Mr President, accession on the part of the EU to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms also conceals the risk that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) will be able to pass judgment on any EU legal act; the judges of the European Court of Justice have already warned against taking this step."
"I very much doubt that the ECHR will always pass neutral and appropriate judgments."
"Its President has himself admitted that he would examine cases brought by asylum seekers more closely than other cases."
"Preferential treatment for certain complainants is not fitting conduct for a neutral judge."
"The ECHR is currently attempting to suspend the Dublin Convention and prevent deportations from Austria to Greece."
"Why is this?"
"Is Greece unsafe?"
"Do we really want to be subject to a court that wants to ban the cross in classrooms?"
"The cross is the symbol of Christianity, one of the foundations of Europe and of our fundamental values."
"If the European Court of Human Rights clearly has no respect for such human rights, I cannot see that it is possible to recognise it here as an approved and appropriate decision-making body."
"(HU) Mr President, the European Union has always been ready to criticise countries outside its borders in order to promote fundamental rights."
"In the case of its own Member States, however, it has often been powerless following their accession."
"This should not be the case any longer, as today it is not only economic principles that bind us together."
"The report of Mrs Kinga Gál summarises the most urgent and most important steps in the development of internal fundamental rights protection."
"We need an effective rights protection system, and thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, we will now be able to establish one."
"Violations of the fundamental rights of citizens cannot remain without consequence."
"We must be able to hold those committing infringements to account at both Member State and European Union level."
"I can only agree with Mrs Reding in that the Commission should exercise the right to initiate infringement proceedings in all justified cases."
"The addition to the set of available procedures of a procedure with a blocking effect can serve as an effective tool in the protection of rights against Member State measures violating fundamental rights."
"Yes, we need to protect persons with disabilities, we need to eliminate discrimination and, last but not least, we need to protect European linguistic diversity."
"(LT) Mr President, the issue of human rights must be addressed at European level and the Member States themselves must also take responsibility for guaranteeing the fundamental rights of their citizens."
"At European level, for instance, it is very important to establish a European Union strategy on the rights of the child, because not all Member States are capable of guaranteeing the protection of children's rights at national level."
"It is therefore necessary to develop practical measures to combat child abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography."
"Disabled people, who still suffer from discrimination in their social, professional and cultural lives, are another priority."
"We must therefore establish a concrete system of EU legislation on the rights of disabled people and develop an EU strategy on the disabled."
"I would like to stress that combating trafficking of human beings, especially women and children, is still a huge problem and one of the worst violations of human rights."
"It is also very important to combat poverty and social exclusion, particularly as regards elderly people, who have suffered most during the recession."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the committee members who worked alongside the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, on these areas, as well as all those MEPs who took the floor today in this House, thereby showing that fundamental rights are very important."
"I can only support what has already been said by several MEPs, namely that it is high time that we focused on fundamental rights within the European Union in order to be credible and be able to talk about fundamental rights outside the European Union."
"This issue has been somewhat neglected."
"It will no longer be in future."
"I think that the Commission's annual report on the application of the Charter, which will elaborate on all the observations made by everyone regarding specific types of discrimination, will truly enable us every year to discuss what is not working and try to correct it."
"Correct it how?"
"There is this idea of a 'freezing mechanism', as the rapporteur called it, this prevention system where one would intervene with regard to a measure being taken in a Member State up to the point at which it is implemented."
"I have asked my experts to analyse this, and the institutional issues that such a mechanism raises are very complex."
"For the time being, although we will have to continue the analysis and see what is really happening, it seems to me that there is no legal basis to act in such a way and that a change in the Treaty would be needed to activate such a prevention mechanism."
"It is an attractive idea."
"We will carry on looking for a mechanism that could be used without changing the Treaty so as to deal with the most pressing issues."
"Nevertheless, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Charter is not applicable in absolute terms, because this is a common misconception."
"It is applicable only when Member States implement European rules, for instance, when a European directive that has been decided between the Council and Parliament is then integrated into European law."
"In that situation, the Charter does apply, but not in absolute terms."
"In absolute terms, that is to say, for all other cases, jurisdiction lies with the national courts."
"When the European Union becomes a member of the Council of Europe Convention, there will be an extra dimension that we will then have to implement, and it concerns the way in which we manage our rights policy."
"This is what seems to me to be of utmost importance, beyond all the specific questions that have been asked - and I will respond individually to the MEPs who asked them - I think that the main issue is the fundamental one."
"Outside the EU, in our Member States, within governments, the importance of the Charter has not yet been fully realised."
"Therefore, we have some work to do to raise awareness so that this culture of rights, this policy of values exists throughout Europe, so that, when a law is passed, when a law is applied, people everywhere ask themselves if it complies with the values we have subscribed to; that is to say that, as political leaders, we must ask ourselves almost systematically, when we act, whether what we are doing is compatible with the fundamental rights we have subscribed to."
"This seems to me to be the most important element."
"As a matter of fact, I can tell you that the Commission is due to take a decision today on whether to scrap the exequatur, in other words, that a proposal will be submitted to make court rulings valid anywhere in Europe."
"This is a decision of major importance, and for the first time, when proposing this new legislation, we focused on respect for fundamental rights."
"We did not just carry out an economic analysis, or study the impact on the market; we also studied the impact on values."
"As you can tell, we are gradually moving towards this new policy, and I think that, between us - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - we should ensure that this annual report on the application of the Charter, which I will submit on behalf of the Commission and which Parliament will criticise or approve, is a great moment of truth and an opportunity to take a close look at matters."
"This is also about truly showing to the outside world, to our voters, that the Charter is a living entity."
"The Charter is not merely a text; it is there to be put into practice."
"And if it is not put into practice, the elected representatives of the people will say so loud and clear."
"This is what we must try to establish during the two or three years before the next elections."
"I think we can achieve this goal gradually, with the first exercise of this kind in spring, then the establishment of a tradition in this House, so that no one can ever say again, when you examine human rights outside the Union on Wednesdays or Thursdays, 'You have not put your own house in order'."
"Let us do it together!"
"Mr President, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the encouraging words and the words of support."
"I would especially like to thank Mrs Reding for the openness and cooperation in which we have been working together for quite some time now, and for the clear and specific answers and messages."
"I believe that the considerations of the shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members are, after all, all included in this report, and that acceptable compromises have been reached."
"Therefore, I cannot accept the letters of amendment that have now been re-submitted to the plenary, as I think that this report is acceptable as it is."
"I would like to point out that we should by no means throw the baby out with the bath water in the general fundamental rights protection system, and therefore, we should always be mindful of the concrete facts and attempt to translate the expectations we are debating here today into something tangible."
"I am therefore pleased that in tomorrow's plenary sitting, we will see these concrete facts in the topic of combating human trafficking, where special protection will be provided to child victims in the field of victim protection."
"This will also be under debate now with the adoption of the Citizens' Initiative, as a result of which we will truly be able to speak of a citizens' Europe, as these European citizens will be able to influence the legislative procedure."
"However, I also consider it symbolic that we will debate on and adopt the report on the situation of human rights in the world tomorrow."
"The fact that the Hungarian Presidency is also setting its priorities in a similar spirit, and is placing emphasis on the strengthening of an EU that is close to its citizens, is welcome."
"However, I would like to remind my fellow Members that we should avoid employing double standards, especially here in this House."
"I say this to my fellow Members who assisted, perhaps for years - and here I address my Hungarian socialist fellow Members - in the gravest human rights infringements, and are now criticising others with unfounded accusations only to regain the voter confidence they may have lost due to these very infringements of human rights."
"I thank everyone for their cooperation and assistance."
"Mr President, I must refute the slight that was made by Ms Gál against Socialists, saying that they have been undermining human rights."
"You cannot make challenges like that without being absolutely specific and bringing forward absolutely crucial, concrete-based evidence."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, Kinga Gál, for her effort to open up the problem of the violation of human rights in the European Union."
"How can we reproach or teach someone outside the EU if, in our own Community, the law is regularly violated?"
"So far, Latvia, a Member of the EU, has not implemented a resolution of the European Parliament of 11 March 2004, where Parliament 'proposes that the Latvian authorities envisage the possibility of allowing non-citizens who are long-time inhabitants to take part in local self-government elections'."
"Three hundred and thirty-five thousand permanent inhabitants (15%) of Latvia lack their basic rights, but it does not worry anyone."
"The European Parliament can discuss cases of breaches of human rights everywhere except in its own territory."
"I have voted in favour of Kinga Gál's initiative."
"I offer my total support and the gratitude of 335 000 people."
"in writing. - I would like to use this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for shedding light on such an important issue."
"The Lisbon Treaty has redefined competences and responsibilities in many fields and, among them, made the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding."
"The European Parliament has been acting as watchdog of fundamental rights and the Lisbon Treaty has consolidated the fact."
"I very much support the notion of enhancing the role of the European Parliament with regard to a systematic approach to legislative proposals and amendments."
"While we are critical of human rights violations around the world, we must apply the same scrutiny to what is going on within the borders of the European Union."
"There is no reason to be overly pleased, as we receive signals of racism, xenophobia, sexism and other forms of discrimination in the Member States far too often."
"The work ahead of us remains vast, but I am more than sure that consistent work on upholding fundamental rights in the EU will help us prevail."
"The European Union, as a community of states that offer a high level of protection of human rights, always boldly raises its voice against serious infringements taking place in other parts of the world."
"The European Parliament usually condemns practices that show complete disregard for the universal fundamental principles of human rights, wherever they may occur, in commendable unison."
"It is less often, however, that we respond with similar determination to infringements within the borders of the EU, even though this would be the most effective way to send out a message to those countries around the world that do not respect human rights."
"A common EU action would achieve the greatest result if we voiced our dissatisfaction with the same determination and peremptoriness within our own area in respect of the assertion of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"In very few cases do we call ourselves to account in connection with these ideals, which are an integral part of the European spirit, and which have been legally binding for a year now thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"And in the event that we actually do so, we come across as powerless and impotent in the absence of appropriate sanctions."
"This, in turn, inevitably affects the force and credibility of our criticisms toward third countries and our foreign policy efforts for the promotion of human rights and democracy."
"I do not believe that Europe can give these up in the future."
"European Protection Order (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero López, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order (00002/2010 - C7-0006/2010 -."
"Mr President, today is an important day for all victims, because today we shall adopt the European Protection Order, which is a significant step forward in terms of their rights."
"Victims are unfairly forgotten about, and it is paradoxical that aggressors often have many more rights and that there is more said about aggressors' rights than victims' rights."
"Today, Parliament will honour all victims, reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims, that this European Protection Order will protect all victims equally in the European Union from this day onwards."
"We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it."
"I must say that, following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency, and many conversations with the Commission, we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy with. This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"I hope that today, Parliament will reflect the decision made by those committees and by those of us who produced this report, which was adopted by a huge majority."
"This would send a clear message to the Council about what Europeans want, which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice, to be protected, and for a victim who has a restraining order against her aggressor in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to another country."
"We have an obligation to facilitate access to justice for Europeans, and especially for victims, who are the most vulnerable."
"The protection of all victims, without exception, has been my beacon throughout the development of this report."
"I therefore wanted to include victims of terrorism, people trafficking, organised crime and honour crimes, along with a special chapter for minors, who are the most vulnerable victims, and we never think about how to protect them."
"Although this order will protect all victims, women who suffer from domestic violence will benefit most from this instrument for judicial cooperation, as their aggressors will not be able to travel through Europe with impunity, and will know that they will be pursued in the same way as in the country where they attacked their partners."
"Parliament must therefore send a clear message to the Council today about what we want."
"We will therefore vote with our eyes fixed on the victims, on those who suffer, on those who need us to protect them, on those who are afraid and need to live in freedom and hope."
"We are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid and never dare to take that one step further."
"We need to be brave, the Member States need to be brave, and I hope that the vote today will be a majority in favour and encourage those who still have doubts as to whether this instrument will open a door for victims."
"I also hope that in the near future, the Commission will put forward wide-ranging legislation in favour of victims' rights, for which it has my full support and, I am sure, Parliament's support."
"I repeat: this small but major step that is the European Protection Order will improve protection for all victims, preventing further crimes and relieving the consequences of those that have already been committed."
"Today, we have an obligation to remove the obstacles that have so far prevented real protection across Europe."
"Through our vote today, we have the opportunity to save lives, which is what we are going to do, and we should be genuinely proud of that."
"Mr President, this proposal for a directive that we are bringing to plenary today to keep away aggressors who pursue their victims until they kill them, wherever they hide, is a clear message that Parliament must send to European society and to the Council."
"We are not going to remain defenceless against the crimes that are still repeatedly committed on a daily basis in European countries, and remain hidden in the shadows of people's homes."
"These crimes also remain in the statistical shadows, as if the law of survival of the strongest took sole precedence at the heart of cohabitation, but we are trying to enforce the Charter of Fundamental Rights that we adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Did it not occur to those drafting Chapter I of the Charter that a threat to physical integrity and dignity could come not only from the public institutions and the state, but also disguised as affection?"
"For the 25% of European women currently suffering some form of violence, their torturers have private names, and defending themselves against the attacks does not allow them to be citizens."
"According to non-governmental organisations, more than 2 500 women die every year in the European Union without us having asked ourselves whether those crimes can be prevented or avoided."
"European women have therefore welcomed the initiative by the Member States and the Spanish Presidency to bring a European Protection Order before Parliament."
"We are creating a European area of security: the European arrest warrant means that none of our countries can be a haven for criminals."
"Let us create a climate of mutual trust; through the protection order, we are creating an area of justice and freedom, because the victims of these crimes can be received in any country without having to go through further proceedings, as my co-rapporteur, Mrs Jiménez-Becerril, said."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about 'private terrorism', which is the name now given to this continuous crime of attacks hidden in the privacy of the home."
"We are also talking about preventive measures from a different source."
"Not all countries have or are going to have the same legal traditions: the more progress we make, the more an instrument that can provide for our diversity is and will be necessary The Council's legal services have taken this view, as have Parliament's legal services."
"Where does the resistance lie?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it does not lie in the complexity of our legal system, which will continue to exist."
"The law is not a tool for creating conflicts, but for resolving them."
"This has been the view of the conservative governments that have supported the initiative based on sound judgment."
"If we were talking about guarantees and fundamental rights when we talked about terrorism, how could we have implemented international agreements if it was not because we were talking about security?"
"Are 2 500 women every year not a security problem for Europe?"
"It is not the first time in history that the law has faced a challenge."
"We therefore regret the Commission's position throughout the procedure, because we cannot talk about legal basis when we are talking about political will."
"Let us not invoke the law just when it suits us."
"This text is the result of an agreement."
"The improvements that we have incorporated regarding the right to information, translation and procedural guarantees have taken into account the fact that this is a recognition instrument, and Parliament has decided that it is a priority for the Member States to put the existing data on the table out in the open."
"We have not forgotten about victims' rights to psychological assistance and legal aid."
"We will continue to fight for these things, and let us hope that they will be included in the next package on victims."
"We would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for the work that it has done, along with all the shadow rapporteurs and our team."
"Through this vote today, we want to send a message to the Council that this is Parliament's will; now it is up to the Council to take on its responsibilities."
"We will not succeed in tackling prevention if some Member States believe that we do not have a problem because we do not have the data."
"Now it is the Council that is going to decide whether Europe is truly getting involved in combating violence and defending fundamental rights."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the protection of citizens, in practice mostly women, subjected to or at risk of violence is very high on the agenda of all the institutions working on this subject at the moment."
"It is important that it be on the agenda because we share the same objective: providing protection for victims in the best possible conditions across the borders of the EU."
"That is also why I have supported the aim of this protection from the outset, and that is the reason why I am preparing the ambitious package on victims' rights to be adopted in spring 2011."
"I am fully aware of the work of the co-rapporteurs, Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Ms Romero López, and of both the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who have added a lot of value to the ongoing work in order to improve the protection of victims."
"I look at some of the proposals you have made: for instance, that victims do not have to bear the costs, that they receive translation and interpretation services or that delays in the recognition procedures are reduced."
"I am ready to work on an effective and legally sound mechanism designed to help victims benefit from civil law protection measures across the European Union."
"We have been working on the procedural rights for persons who are accused."
"The corollary of this is that we work on the rights of persons who have been victims, because we very often speak about the accused in court proceedings but forget that there has been a victim, so we have to 're-put' the victim at the centre of attention."
"That is why the Commission's future victims package will build on and develop the excellent work undertaken by the Spanish Presidency, the Belgian Presidency, the Council and, of course, the European Parliament."
"All this work is very important."
"It will be put together so that when the victims package is on the table, it will be comprehensive, it will be complete, and it will make a real difference to all victims - be they women, children or men, although most are women and children - to enable us to quickly come up with concrete measures which are applicable and do not create legal uncertainty."
"Thank you for this work."
"It is going to be taken into consideration when we prepare the victims package."
"Mr President, roughly 8 000 Romanian women in Spain have benefited this year, as victims, from protection orders which are valid in Spain."
"They must also be extended to Romania and other Member States in which they travel."
"According to unofficial estimates, there are roughly 100 000 women in Europe benefiting from protection orders which are valid in the state that issued them."
"The draft directive changes the limited, territorial aspect of these protection measures."
"The instrument being introduced will ensure that a protection order issued in one Member State will be recognised in the Member States in which the victim travels so that the area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality and the victims of violence or other victims can live and travel without fear."
"Parliament's desire is for victims' protection to be extended."
"This is why, after this directive, we are asking for and anticipating from the Commission that the next step will be to extend protection to victims in this common area of justice and security."
"We are therefore awaiting the package with eagerness and interest in spring 2011."
"I would like to end by reiterating that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) gives its support to protection for victims, this draft directive and extended protection for victims."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal for a directive - for which I should like to express my great thanks to the rapporteurs, with whom I worked as a shadow - Parliament is supporting and expanding the Council's proposal, which was designed to protect people across all 27 Member States who suffer forms of persecution or serious and repeated threats from known and previously identified persons - often ex-boyfriends, husbands or partners - who threaten their physical and sexual integrity, dignity and personal freedom."
"Indeed, the number of attacks and killings - particularly against women - is on the increase."
"Their complaints are often not taken seriously enough by the police and the judiciary, and protection orders and measures against the aggressor are currently only valid in the country in which they are issued."
"Commissioner Reding, the measure under approval may not be perfect, but it plugs a legislative vacuum."
"After all, in creating the European area of freedom, security and justice, we have always acted empirically, at times pushing matters through where necessary."
"Indeed, we believe that this initiative is important because it will allow all citizens of the European Union - men and women - and all European residents to travel freely across borders, taking their human rights and their rights to protection and security with them, as stated in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament intended as the legal basis, in order to give a more coherent direction to the structure of the proposal."
"Through the establishment of the European Protection Order, the protected person is guaranteed to be looked after even in other Member States, through a fast and free-of-charge procedure."
"Each Member State must appoint a competent authority to inform victims of their rights, carry out campaigns, collect statistics and inform the person as soon as their national protection order has been issued."
"Furthermore, it gives a great boost to the creation of the European legal area and the implementation of freedom of movement, and it also applies the ordinary legislative procedure involving codecision between the Council and Parliament for the first time."
"I hope that the Council will confirm this commitment and I hope that the Commission - though showing particular attention to the coming 'Security for Victims' package of measures - does not miss this particular chance to respond right now to this extremely serious situation, which is also demonstrated by European and national statistics."
"Amongst other things, this could lead to important legal convergence among Member States."
"I would therefore suggest that we avoid any delays and make a specific commitment to this particular type of victim protection."
"Mr President, I want the European Protection Order to be particularly effective in preventing violence against women and to serve as a helpful prelude to the proposal that the Commission is preparing in order for us to have a similar instrument for all types of crime."
"I regret the fact that the drafting of this text has been so difficult and complex, despite the fact that we all share its central objective."
"I would also have liked this order to have incorporated two issues."
"Firstly, the European register of protection orders, with the corresponding privacy guarantees, in order to prevent bureaucracy for the beneficiaries and have the orders applied immediately."
"Moreover, this would reduce the cost of the processes that have to be carried out by the competent authorities, and would ultimately provide standardised, constantly updated statistics."
"Secondly, I believe that we should have made an effort to explore cooperation in this field with third countries, especially if we pay attention to the statistics regarding the origins of the victims and their possible changes of residence."
"The incipient European External Action Service has thus lost the opportunity to publicly introduce itself with a mission such as this, which Europeans understand and which solves problems that are real to all Europeans at the moment."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs for all their work, and I hope that Commissioner Reding will be sensitive with this initiative."
"Mr President, I think that we in Parliament need to be very responsible and act within the mandate that we have been given, which tells us that, at European level too, we must protect women who are victims of violence and put a stop to murderers."
"As has been said, this is about combating a type of social terrorism, which is chauvinist violence."
"We must not, therefore, get caught up in statistics or legal ins and outs."
"We are talking about justice, basic rights, life and death, defending those that must be defended against their attackers, and, most importantly, not having to regret the fact that 2 500 women every year are victims of the legal lethargy in which we are all immersed."
"We are all aware of the legal difficulties and that this is an innovative exercise in the post-Lisbon interinstitutional dynamic."
"However, those difficulties should not, under any circumstances, be an excuse for not moving forward."
"The protection of the rights of the women who have been or could be victims of violence and murders and the prevention of such acts cannot be subordinated to a few legal issues."
"We need to adopt the political will required by the urgency and importance of this case."
"It goes without saying that it is important to do things well but, above all, it is essential that we do them and, in my view, that is the fundamental vision that we can send to both the Council and the Commission through this text that I hope we are going to adopt."
"It needs to be understood that under no circumstances can we paralyse initiatives because there are technical difficulties that we have not been able to resolve before."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the two rapporteurs and both the Spanish and Belgian presidencies for the work they have done in order to continue making progress, working and overcoming the scourge of what is, I repeat, chauvinist violence."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I have been following the trialogues closely and would like to thank my colleagues, especially from the EPP and S&D Groups, for the work they have been doing."
"As a lawyer in the UK, I have had experience over the years of providing legal advice and support to people who have been victims of domestic abuse, stalking or harassment by a relative or a former partner."
"I have seen at first hand the distress that physical, psychological and sexual abuse can cause and the state of vulnerability of its victims."
"I fully support the aims and objectives of this proposal."
"However, I also have to express concerns regarding the legal base and scope."
"It seems clear to me that this proposal has a criminal base only, through the use of Article 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
"By their nature and by law, some of the offences that this proposal intends to cover are civil law matters, yet there is a noticeable absence of the use of Article 81."
"Whilst I do not object to EU legal cooperation, I strongly believe that we need to ensure that the legislation we produce at EU level is legally sound, robust and can be effectively implemented at Member State level without compromising existing Member State legal systems."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I support the protection of victims."
"However, when I first came across the European Protection Order, I thought it sounded scary, like the European Arrest Warrant, which, in my opinion, is one of the most intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people."
"The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women."
"We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism - and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that."
"Let us be clear and honest here: the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law."
"If proof were needed, we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant."
"I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK, for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life."
"We have a saying in England: 'once bitten, twice shy'."
"We have been bitten once by the European Arrest Warrant."
"I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order."
"(PL) Mr President, taking the proposed amendments into account, there is no mistaking the fact that the directive in question is one of the first initiatives aimed at achieving these important goals."
"We should ensure not only that the victims of violence are safe from further harm in their own country, but also that they benefit from such protection measures throughout the European Union."
"For this reason, I believe that we should support the rapporteur's position."
"It should be noted, too, that the initiative has a deliberately broad scope."
"Although the majority of protection orders issued relate to women who are victims of gender-based violence, the initiative can cover all victims of violence - children and adults of both sexes, provided the perpetrator has been identified."
"In this context, the Stockholm Programme states that the victims of crime, including terrorism, who are most vulnerable or who find themselves in particularly exposed situations, such as persons subjected to repeated violence in close relationships, victims of gender-based violence or persons who fall victim to other types of crimes in a Member State of which they are not nationals or residents, are in need of special support and legal protection."
"In connection with the above, the European Protection Order should apply to the victims of all crimes, including human trafficking, the victims of female genital mutilation, forced marriages, honour killings, incest and other crimes of this type. This initiative should therefore be supported, and I lend my full support to the rapporteur."
"(NL) Mr President, one hundred thousand people are currently benefiting from the European Protection Order."
"One of them is Rasja, who would like to move to Spain with her children."
"If the order pronounced against her stalker in the Netherlands does not relocate with her to Spain, she and her children, too, will become a sitting target there, unless the Spanish authorities recognise or enforce the same order."
"Fortunately, however, Spain does recognise it."
"This protection also applies to those being persecuted for exercising their right to free speech."
"They have to be able to speak in other European countries with the knowledge that those who have threatened them will not be sitting there in the audience."
"The European Protection Order makes that possible; it is a splendid initiative and one that has been supported by the Dutch Government."
"Unfortunately, with the new coalition, the status of people enjoying such protection has undergone a 180 degree reversal: women, men and children who are having to live in fear every day are callously being left high and dry."
"It is simply unacceptable that an individual's safety should stop at the border."
"For the sake of one hundred thousand people, I am now saying 'yes' to the European Protection Order."
"I expect all governments, including that of my own country, to do their utmost to increase the safety, protection and freedom of their citizens, so that all people can live in freedom and security."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should, of course, like to thank the two co-rapporteurs who, following difficult negotiations in the trialogue, are proposing a compromise agreement which, as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and for my group, I naturally invite you to adopt."
"Secondly, although I regret, as some have said today, that certain points such as, for instance, the translation of documents for victims, were not included in the body of the text of this agreement, or that the simplification elements were not sufficiently detailed - and I am counting on the 'victims package' to polish them up - I want to stress that in the end, all this sounds like common sense today, like a logical continuation of the ever-greater integration of a European area of freedom and justice and, in essence, of the establishment of a corresponding legal system."
"This bears witness to a certain amount of political boldness and of the will to go beyond political posturing for a large majority of us, in order to have a clear tool for cooperation in criminal matters."
"That tool represents to a certain extent, as Mrs Reding highlighted earlier on, a true 'rights' policy in Europe, that is to say, a real policy for the people, especially for women, whose physical integrity can be threatened, a policy that corresponds to the freedom of movement which has existed for a long time, hence, a 'rights' policy."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I say first of all that I find the Council's absence since yesterday regrettable, since the Council has generally been present in the negotiations on all the issues we have been discussing since yesterday, namely, those concerning civil liberties, justice and home affairs."
"We regret the fact that the Council is not here to listen to Parliament's voice; it is a real shame."
"I wish to congratulate the two co-rapporteurs - who have done a huge amount of work on this text - on this landmark progress for victims of all kinds: victims, firstly, of domestic violence - did you know that 45% of European women are victims of domestic violence, as are some men, for we should not forget those men who are subjected to violence by women - and then victims of terrorism, including children, particularly vulnerable ones of course."
"The text being presented to us today is an extremely important text, and I once again extend my congratulations."
"We are anxious to see the 'victims package' that you will be presenting to us next year, Commissioner, and which will complete the text that we will vote on tomorrow."
"Madam President, domestic violence, genital mutilation, honour crimes, forced marriages and trafficking are just some of the types of violence against 45% of women across Europe."
"Women and minors need improved protection."
"The European Protection Order is a good step forward to doing just that, in full compliance with the vision of the Stockholm Programme for a united Europe: an area of freedom, security and justice serving the citizen."
"Protection orders issued in one European country against an offender will thus be enforced in all the other 26 EU Member States."
"The initiative of the Spanish Presidency, embraced today by all of us, emphasises the protection of victims and prevention, and promotes uniformity in legal order procedures."
"It empowers victims to break their silence in seeking protection beyond geographical boundaries in Europe."
"I hope the Commission fully endorses the report of the two co-rapporteurs in its ambitious package on victims' rights."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that this directive on the European Protection Order to safeguard victims is another sign of a momentous shift in real guarantees, above all for women, but not exclusively so, as has already been said."
"The guidelines for this measure had already been developed, firstly by the Treaty of Lisbon, and then by the Stockholm Programme."
"In particular, I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero López, on their diligent work and on tackling the many problems encountered in the Council to smooth the way for this particularly important proposal, for an area of freedom, justice and security that will really serve citizens."
"The proposal combats domestic violence firmly and determinedly, has quite a significant range of measures and a scope that appears to be wholly consistent."
"These ready-made, timely and effective precautionary measures lead us to believe that this proposal could also be used effectively to protect victims' families."
"We await with interest the more structured package announced by Commissioner Reding regarding the protection of victims of violence, which will be ready in the coming weeks."
"I should like to conclude, Madam President, by affirming how important it is to have close cooperation between the Member States as well as great sensitivity for the application of this measure in practice, just as it is crucial not to forget the importance of psychological support for the victims."
"I am sure the Commission will duly bear this in mind in the final phase of the legislative process."
"(FI) Madam President, the European Protection Order is an important step towards the protection of victims throughout Europe."
"We are now sending a powerful signal to the Council and the Commission that the European Parliament is keen to have this protection order and that it should enter into force soon."
"We should now try to overcome the opposition that there is to it in the Council as well as all the legal reasons that the Commission is putting forward for opposing it."
"It is important that the directive should be applied over a wide area."
"It must incorporate not just orders in respect of criminal acts but also various other kinds of protection order."
"It should not involve any sort of legal hairsplitting."
"This protection order should also be flexible enough to take account of the differences in national legislation."
"It is important that Parliament focuses attention not only on the victims of genderbased violence, but on other victims of violence."
"The directive needs to spell out what a victim's rights are and what the procedures are for lodging a complaint, and these are some of the things that I myself have tried to highlight in Parliament's position."
"It is also important that the country in which the protection order is being requested informs its citizens of these procedures."
"When the protection order enters into force, the work will not have really stopped there."
"The authorities need to be educated, and we cannot be completely satisfied with an information campaign that is simply restricted to the framework of the present one."
"(PL) Madam President, the provisions included in the report under discussion today fill me with great enthusiasm."
"The guarantee that protection granted to victims in one Member State will also apply in any other European Union Member State to which they are forced to travel for fear of repeated violence represents an opportunity for them to lead a normal life."
"The European Protection Order will mean that protection measures adopted in one EU Member State can be recognised, applied and enforced by courts in another Member State."
"What is more, extending the application of the directive to the victims of any kind of violence, not just the victims of gender-based violence, represents a further milestone."
"All victims deserve respect and expect that the perpetrators of their suffering will be punished fairly."
"It seems to me that only a protection mechanism which follows the victim can be fully effective and prevent a repeat of the same offence, as well as offering real protection to the victim."
"I am delighted that Poland was one of the countries that put forward this initiative."
"(SK) Madam President, if the European Union is to become a genuine area of freedom, security and justice, we must eliminate the differences still persisting in this area between Member States."
"Victims of violence must be protected against the perpetrators not only in their own countries, but must have protective measures made available to them throughout the EU."
"Although this is a broad proposal, it directly concerns women who are victims of domestic violence."
"It is good that this also provides an opportunity to deal with the situation of other potential victims, whether victims of human trafficking, forced marriages, honour killings or incest, or the situation of witnesses or of victims of terrorism and organised crime."
"I personally very much applaud the effort to provide the best possible protection to victims also by ensuring the necessary legal certainty, among other things."
"Victims should be able to rely on clear rules and should always be informed about the measures that are available to them in their country of origin and in the countries they want to move to, or to which they have already moved."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs."
"However, the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking, in which a person has been a victim of violence by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place."
"Obviously, this is a matter of fundamental importance for hundreds of thousands of women in the European Union and therefore I fully support its content."
"Unfortunately, however, these measures do not take into account the victims of organised crime who, in the majority of cases, do not need to be defended from an identified or identifiable person, but from organisations against which a restraining order certainly cannot be applied."
"Therefore, I think that the European Parliament should regard this directive as a first step in implementing the Stockholm Programme, which talks expressly about measures to protect the victims of criminal activity, and it seems to me that Mrs Jiménez and Commissioner Reding are of the same mind."
"I appeal to the European Commission to ensure that the package of measures to protect victims, which is planned for 2011, also protects victims of organised crime and victims injured in the course of duty on a European level."
"(DE) Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction."
"The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States."
"The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter, but it was not possible to achieve this."
"A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence, stalking and, above all, exploitation of minors, which I consider to be very, very important."
"It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular."
"However, there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also, to some extent, represent a means for Member States to avoid compliance with the directive."
"Therefore, in a year's time, we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further, because all victims in all countries need the same protection."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to support the idea contained in the draft European Protection Order."
"The protection of persons under threat at the level of individual Member States appears to be insufficient in many cases."
"Thanks to the openness of the European space today, young people often enter into international marriages and international marriage commitments."
"Not all of these commitments last long, however, and the children often then become hostages to disputes between their parents."
"Hostile parents often refuse to respect the decisions of courts from other countries granting custody of the children to one of them and simply take justice into their own hands and carry off the children of former partners to their own countries, exploiting differences between the legal systems of individual Member States to overcome valid court decisions."
"The victims of this European legal anarchy are often small, innocent children."
"I hope this problem will be resolved by the European Protection Order."
"(DE) Madam President, even though some measures have been taken in recent years to protect victims, many of the people affected often feel left in the lurch."
"While lawyers and judges hear a great deal in their training about the rights of defendants, they learn very little about dealing with victims."
"This is not the only area where greater awareness is necessary."
"It is also needed in medical training so that the use of violence can be better recognised."
"For child victims, the matter of the statutory limitation of civil compensation claims in the case of sex offences is essential."
"Only those who have an unblemished criminal record are allowed to work with children."
"If, for example, forced marriages are now being prosecuted in Liechtenstein, even without the consent of the victim, and it is possible to take legal action in the case of genital mutilation performed on a minor, this clearly shows the potential danger of the much lauded multicultural enrichment."
"In my opinion, it is important to take this development in the EU into consideration, as well as its significance in the fight against human trafficking."
"(HU) Madam President, as a lawyer, I have dealt with cases of victims of violence against women and children for over ten years, whether it was domestic violence, rape or trafficking in women; and I had the opportunity to see for myself that the protection order, which is the topic of today's debate, is one of the important and indispensable means of protecting victims, but it is far from being the only one."
"Complex measures are required, such as legal advice, psychological support, support to the children concerned, and it is very important to listen to the victims, who are, I am sorry to say, the greatest experts in terms of what they need."
"I have two questions for Mrs Reding and the rapporteurs."
"First, I would like to know to what extent they are involving the victims of violence against women in this work in order to enable them to share their experience."
"Secondly, I would like to know how familiar Mrs Reding and the rapporteurs are with the convention on violence against women that is currently under preparation by the European Union's twin, the Council of Europe, and to what extent we are participating in the preparation of this work."
"(DE) Madam President, the safety of the women affected really ought to be a matter of concern to all of us."
"Regardless of where victims are, it is a question here not only of them receiving physical protection from their aggressors, but also of their human dignity being taken into account."
"This European Protection Order should apply to all victims of violence, irrespective of their age or gender."
"Madam President, I would like also to thank the rapporteur."
"Safeguarding life, physical and psychological integrity, as well as sexual integrity and freedom, are priority objectives where victim protection is concerned."
"With our political support for the European Protection Order Directive, we have given the issue the visibility it deserves and provided a Europe-wide, comprehensive package of special protection measures that are effective within the Union and grant legal protection and assistance for victims of crime, in particular, violent crimes."
"The right to protection from violence is a basic human right regardless of ethnicity, legal status or immigration status, and it is therefore a moral duty for all of us to uphold this right within and beyond national borders."
"I am convinced that this new approach to the protection of vulnerable victims is a very strong political message with a view to strengthening freedom, security and justice within the European Union."
"Madam President, I think that in this debate, we have clearly seen that we are all in agreement in supporting the objective of this report."
"The various political groups have shown their support for this directive, which offers greater protection to victims."
"My question is, therefore: what obstacles are there to adopting this instrument?"
"I repeat: what fears are there regarding something as essential and simple as protecting victims equally across Europe finally becoming a reality?"
"In the hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a majority, I would like to address the Council and the Commission to remind them that we have overcome the legal hurdles in our negotiations, and I welcome the fact that the Commission acknowledges our work, just as we acknowledge the work that it will do in the future."
"We should not therefore exclude ourselves, but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today, and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that will be presented by the Commission, with which I promise to cooperate."
"Let us therefore be brave and responsible, and let us help all those who have the right to live in a safer Europe."
"I repeat: let us help everyone, be they men, women or children."
"Let us help those who are looking to us today to give them a better life, a life that will restore to them their freedom, their security and, above all, their dignity."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we know that there are no legal measures included in the package that is being prepared for victims."
"This has just been criticised by the European women's lobby in Parliament: there is talk of good practice and coordination, but we still have a long way to go"
"I would also like to say that the origins of the violence that we are experiencing are not exotic: it is our own violence."
"I would like to say to the Council and the Member States that violence that comes from other cultures also requires a legal instrument."
"It is not possible to combat genital mutilation, honour crimes and all the harassment suffered by women from other cultures without an instrument of this nature."
"This is why it is so important that they are also included, and Parliament has worked, through all the amendments from the shadow rapporteurs, to ensure that all these victims are also included in this legal instrument."
"This is why it is so important that we work together on this issue, and why we regret the fact that Parliament and the Commission have not agreed on the same text throughout this procedure."
"Even if Parliament and the Commission had agreed on the same text, we would still have a battle to fight."
"Commissioner, it does little to help victims of violence to consider that delaying the initiative by two, three or four years would be better for them, because that is not the case."
"You said during your previous appearance that we had not realised the significance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We did realise its significance."
"The problem is that it has to be applied; the problem is that we need to take measures, and sometimes when measures need to be taken, they are legal measures, and sometimes there are obstacles in their path."
"The greatest obstacle is political will."
"This is why it is so important that we all agree on an initiative of this nature, and it is now up to the Council."
"It is now up to the Member States to decide whether this instrument is really one that is going to be effective for victims and necessary."
"We believe that it is, which is why we have defended this instrument and why we are here."
"We also defend its urgency."
"That is why we wanted Parliament to vote in favour by a huge majority, so that the countries that have not yet decided or have decided that they are against this initiative will see it as the only procedure that can be used now and in the future."
"It is an instrument that is difficult and complex in nature, but which opens the way and will protect victims and the citizenship of women."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I did not intend to speak again, but what has been said needs to be corrected."
"The measures which will be part of the victims package include an overarching communication, the Lisbonisation of the 2001 framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, a proposal on civil protection measures and, if necessary, a proposal on criminal protection measures."
"This will be put on the table of this House in May next year."
"We cannot just go ahead and put our ideas on paper."
"All our proposals must be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment."
"We need to take this very seriously, aiming for sound studies with real added value."
"That is what we are doing at the moment."
"We are finalising the impact assessment in order to determine the details of any actions on legislative and practical measures, with the aim of legal certainty and rapid and efficient protection measures."
"Having said that, I would also like to inform this Parliament that, to date, four opinions have been sent by national parliaments on the protection order: positive ones from the Italian, Greek and Portuguese parliaments and a negative opinion from the German Bundesrat arguing that the directive goes beyond the scope of Article 82, as it covers non-criminal measures and the prevention of crime."
"It has been rejected on the basis of subsidiarity."
"We are in the middle of a very complicated issue."
"By carrying out a serious analysis before putting the legal and non-legal proposals on the table, I will try to propose measures which are sound enough not to victimise victims a second time when it comes to protection measures."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"In Romania, domestic violence incidents are estimated to affect 1 200 000 people every year, yet only 1% of the victims of violence are brave enough to report it to the authorities."
"Frequent domestic tension, brawls and beatings turn family members into traumatised victims who are forced to accept this situation as being the norm."
"Violence affects a child's normal, harmonious development."
"Studies show that the pattern of violent behaviour is passed down from one generation to another in 75% of cases."
"Stockholm syndrome must be treated, but not through feeble reforms, as is happening in Romania."
"Proactive measures are required to combat this phenomenon, along with amending the relevant legislative framework and establishing dialogue and cooperation between all the state institutions with powers in this area and civil society."
"In this respect, the European Protection Order must be a strong instrument capable of providing a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States' borders."
"This will also include protection against acts of violence committed by groups of people and will apply to all victims of crime, such as victims of human trafficking, female genital mutilation, forced marriages, honour crimes, incest, gender-based violence, as well as witnesses and victims of terrorism and organised crime."
"Trafficking in human beings (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims, repealing Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA - C7-0087/2010 -."
"co-rapporteur. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my co-rapporteur, Ms Hedh, the Council and the Commission and all those who were involved in this demanding work."
"The current trafficking situation is worrying."
"The estimated volume is several hundreds of thousands of victims inside Europe, the second biggest crime-related business, with an estimated profit of USD 32 million."
"There are new trends in trafficking in human beings."
"We have more victims in forced labour."
"We have more victims coming from Member States and, in addition, we have more children among the victims."
"The estimated global share of child victims is between 40% and 50%."
"A recent report from the OSCE called on countries to change their perception of considering human trafficking as a marginal phenomenon and instead encourage them to recognise it as modern-day slavery on a massive scale."
"Combating trafficking in human beings needs a holistic approach, although we only have a limited set of tools."
"Our task is to amend the legislation."
"The Lisbon Treaty gave us a new legal basis - Article 83."
"This gives us the means to establish a common approach with a view to creating a more dissuasive environment for traffickers and, at the same time, stronger protection for victims."
"The proposal, which is a consolidated text agreed upon with the Council and the Commission, broadens the definition of trafficking, bearing in mind that the forms and trends are changing."
"The draft gives opportunities for higher penalties, defining a minimum for maximum penalties, encouraging seizing and confiscating the proceeds and assets resulting from trafficking."
"The proposal opens the issue of the victimisation of victims, entitling courts not to impose penalties on criminal activities of victims which are committed under duress."
"Assistance and support should be provided for victims before, during and for an appropriate time after criminal proceedings, while assistance and support for victims is not made conditional on the victims' willingness to cooperate in criminal investigations, prosecutions and trials."
"The proposal contains a special provision to enhance the protection of children during the investigation and assistance."
"The draft directive also has a provision on the European Anti-Trafficking Coordinator who, in the future, could contribute to a more comprehensive, more coherent and more coordinated anti-trafficking policy."
"co-rapporteur. - (SV) In 2010, people are being bought and sold as slaves in Europe."
"This is happening despite the fact that slavery was prohibited more than 250 years ago."
"They are being forced into prostitution, forced labour or begging."
"They suddenly find themselves with an owner, who they absurdly enough often believe they are indebted to."
"Human trafficking is one of the most serious crimes in the world and, unfortunately, it is growing in extent all the time."
"It is a serious violation of the human rights which we in the EU defend fiercely and fight every day to uphold."
"I would therefore like to begin by thanking Mrs Malmström for producing a legislative proposal on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings so quickly."
"I would also like to thank my fellow Member from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, Mrs Bauer, for her excellent cooperation, and all of the shadow rapporteurs who have worked on the directive."
"Finally, a big thank you to all of the other members of staff, who have done a fantastic job."
"Human trafficking is currently the fastest growing cross-border crime."
"According to the UN report 'Trafficking in persons' for 2009, human trafficking is the activity that provides the second-largest income for criminal networks after arms trafficking."
"It is absolutely clear that no country can solve the problem of human trafficking on its own."
"Trafficking in human beings is going on in all countries in Europe and the human traffickers move their victims across national borders every day."
"We therefore need to work together, and our legislation in this area needs to be as harmonised as possible."
"Therefore, the proposal for an EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, who will review and coordinate the EU's work together with the national coordinators, is also a good one."
"In order to tackle the problem of human trafficking, we need to have penalties that reflect the seriousness of the crime and that really hurt those who are making money out of trafficking in human beings."
"I think that we have made some progress with the proposals for penalties contained in the legislative proposal."
"It has also been proposed that the Member States should, in a legally certain manner, seize the human traffickers' assets gained from their crime."
"However, it is not enough to punish the perpetrators."
"Protection for victims of human trafficking must also improve."
"Without protection for victims, we will never be able to prosecute the human traffickers."
"Victims must receive the help they need and it is important, above all, to create a safe environment that will enable them to choose to cooperate with the police."
"A passage is also proposed concerning enhanced protection for children who are victims of human trafficking, and that is something that I am very pleased about."
"Since 79% of victims of human trafficking are women and because sexual exploitation is by far the most usual type of human trafficking, it is crucial to view the legislation from a gender perspective and for all measures that are proposed to be analysed from the point of view of gender."
"Ultimately, if we are ever to get to grips with this problem, we must do something about the uneven distribution of power between men and women."
"Inequality between men and women is a contributory cause of the vulnerability that leads to human trafficking."
"In order to really tackle the problem of human trafficking, all Member States must put a great deal of effort into preventive work."
"In principle, this is a matter of reducing the demand in our countries for services provided by victims of human trafficking."
"If we can reduce demand, then access to services will also reduce."
"This means that we must deal with those who make human trafficking profitable."
"We therefore proposed that it should be mandatory for all Member States to criminalise those who knowingly use the services of victims of human trafficking."
"Under current EU legislation, it is a punishable offence for employers to exploit victims of human trafficking."
"The same principle ought to apply to individuals who exploit victims."
"Unfortunately, we did not succeed in getting this proposal accepted."
"Thus, the Member States will not be forced to criminalise these people, but they will have to report on the measures they have taken to tackle demand for services provided by victims of human trafficking."
"However, we have put this issue on the agenda, and at EU level we received support for our proposal from the relevant committees in Parliament as well as from experts, the police and voluntary organisations."
"I think that, with the agreement that we are to vote on today, we have come a good way along the road."
"Let us now stand together to put a stop to the trafficking in human beings in Europe, which is a modern form of slavery."
"We must not give up, because people's right to decide when it comes to their own life and their own bodies is a human right that cannot be bought and sold for money like shoelaces or bananas."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me start by recalling that this is indeed an historic text we will adopt today - hopefully - in the vote in a few minutes."
"This is the first EU criminal law instrument after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I think we can be satisfied with the agreement that we have today."
"It is a balanced compromise between the institutions."
"I am aware, of course, that Parliament, as represented by the rapporteurs, and the Commission would have preferred some different phrasing in some paragraphs."
"Globally, however, this is a good result which is fully in line with the objectives of Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission, namely, to fight human trafficking, this horrible modern slavery, this horrible crime which is not worthy of Europe in 2010 and which is a grave violation of the fundamental rights of so many citizens."
"I have met some of these victims: children, men and many women in the sexual slavery business."
"Their stories are, of course, horrible."
"Today, when this directive is adopted, we will have a better tool to help them."
"This is, indeed, a good Christmas present."
"I would really like to thank Parliament, in particular, the two rapporteurs, Ms Bauer and Ms Hedh, the shadow rapporteurs and all the others who made it possible to reach an agreement."
"There are several examples of the European Parliament helping to improve the directive."
"I would note the specific provision concerning the status and rights of unaccompanied minors who are victims of trafficking in Article 14."
"That was introduced at your request, and we agree that this made the directive better."
"There are other examples as well."
"I would like to mention one point where I regret that the Commission proposal was not supported by the Council, although we had your support."
"However, it was not possible to reach an agreement in the Council regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction for offences committed abroad by habitual residents of the EU."
"I still believe that a provision guaranteeing that all persons living with us in Europe who commit trafficking offences in other countries could be prosecuted in the EU would have added considerable value."
"However, it was not possible."
"The issue will be back again when we deal with the directive on child exploitation and child pornography."
"Extraterritorial jurisdiction for habitual residents will be even more important when we discuss the possibilities of bringing paedophile sex tourists who live in Europe to justice."
"I believe that we should together continue, in talks with the Council, to insist that such a provision should be included in the directive."
"As I said, we have all done very good work together."
"Today, we have a very important tool to fight trafficking, protect victims, and make sure that we send the message that this is a very severe crime."
"It should be punished accordingly and it is now defined in the same way in all Member States."
"Again, thank you for your contribution."
"Madam President, Commissioner, trafficking in human beings is a harsh reality in the EU."
"Sexual exploitation is the main objective of the mafias that traffic human beings, followed by forced labour, domestic service, forced marriages, exploitation of children for begging, illegal adoption and the removal of organs, which are other scourges and aspects of the problem."
"The new powers that Article 63 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament must be used in order to strengthen EU legislation in this field."
"This includes, among many other issues, calling for the classification of crimes that are still not covered by some European criminal legislation."
"We need to strengthen our legislation to protect victims of trafficking from two perspectives: prevention and protection, and integration into society and the labour market."
"We need to establish specific measures to protect minors; to criminalise traffickers and middlemen; to establish measures to discourage demand and confiscate the proceeds of the crime; to establish the criminal responsibility of any legal persons that take part in any phase of trafficking; to step up employment inspection and penalties for the exploitation of employees and illegal hiring of irregular immigrants; to strengthen the role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders and of the immigration liaison officers in detecting the channels used by traffickers and their modus operandi; and finally, strengthening the role of the joint investigation teams of the European Police Office (Europol) in combating the mafias."
"I would like to conclude by adding that the figure of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator could make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives that I have mentioned, although his powers and capacities must be clearly defined in order to prevent actions from being duplicated or interference with the functions entrusted to Europol."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by applauding Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh for their comprehensive treatment of this extremely important issue."
"Human trafficking is a reprehensible phenomenon in today's civilised society."
"It is the third most lucrative illicit trade in the world, after arms and drugs trafficking."
"This so-called modern form of slavery is a serious crime which violates fundamental human rights."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has enhanced the activity of the European Union in various areas of criminal law, including the fight against human trafficking."
"The European Parliament plays an important role here as joint lawmaker."
"Experience shows, however, that the current legal framework is not sufficiently effective and we must do even more to protect human rights."
"We must adopt preventive measures targeting human trafficking itself."
"The greatest attention must be paid to children and women, as the most vulnerable groups."
"We must do all we can to contribute to dignified living conditions for potential victims of this crime, who tend to be people living on the margins of society."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, despite increasing efforts to combat trafficking in human beings, this complicated problem continues to flourish and expand across Europe."
"This is the reason for intensified actions and adequate measures to protect individuals from the practice of trafficking for different purposes, to prosecute traffickers and to provide effective remedies for victims at national and EU level."
"The current legal framework will effectively deal with complex transnational problems and will coordinate joint efforts at both national and EU level when addressing this profound human rights abuse and a particular form of violence against women."
"By means of this legal instrument, we make a joint commitment to ensure that women's rights across Europe are elevated to a priority level, taking into consideration that this wider phenomenon indisputably has a disproportionate impact on women and girls."
"I would like to point out another important issue which I propose should be included in this piece of legislation."
"It relates to the socio-economic aspects of this widespread problem with European countries or regions where social and economic inequalities are the most important single cause of trafficking."
"Thanks to our joint efforts, we have achieved a positive outcome in the provision on the issue related to practices such as illegal adoption."
"In conclusion, I would strongly highlight that the primary responsibility for combating trafficking rests with the Member States."
"They should take concrete actions to prevent and suppress trafficking and to protect the human rights of trafficked persons, and should play a greater role in addressing this significant problem."
"Madam President, let me start by thanking Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their hard work as co-rapporteurs."
"This directive concerns prosecution, prevention and protection in the area of human trafficking."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would have liked to have seen somewhat more thorough work, in particular, as regards protecting the victims of human trafficking."
"I refer here particularly to the right of residence in a country after the victim has been trafficked and, perhaps, rescued."
"How do we ensure that victims really can build a new life?"
"Now, that question has not been sufficiently regulated by this directive."
"Here, we are merely talking about a form of temporary residence permit, after which you do not know whether or not you will be sent back to the place from which you have been trafficked."
"We are therefore pinning our hopes on the directive being recast, so that we can sort out some solution or another."
"We are hoping that that will enable us to start giving real help to the victims."
"Another aspect that leads to heated debate in this House is the question of whether or not those who use the services of a trafficked individual should be penalised."
"However, the majority of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance remain of the opinion that penalising such people only serves to push the trafficked individual into deeper misery, because his or her activity then becomes totally illegal."
"I am also pleased to see that, in this directive, Member States will retain freedom of choice on that score, but I would like to ask any Member State dealing with such issues the following: how should we then empower the victim?"
"Madam President, I consider the improved legal measures for the fight against human trafficking, together with the European Protection Order, to be extremely important, as they represent a further step towards protecting women and children in particular from violence."
"A large part of the text is devoted to the protection of child victims and to helping these victims, who are the most vulnerable section of the population."
"I am delighted that there has been a compromise with the Council, and that this text is sufficiently emphatic while making it possible to retain the key provisions of substantive criminal law."
"In my opinion, a European level legal measure criminalising clients who use the services of trafficked persons could be highly problematic."
"I would therefore like to express my thanks for this directive, which deserves our full support."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs."
"They have done a huge amount of work and, as a result, definite progress has been made."
"It could be said that the draft directive is extremely important for the hundreds of thousands of victims of human trafficking and it should put an end to their lawless status."
"It goes as far as to say that not only protection, but also prevention and, above all, compensation, should play a part."
"It has a broad area of application relating to human trafficking."
"We believe this to be right, even though we, of course, have difficulty with the problem of begging - which I openly admit - and also in many respects with illegal migration."
"It is right that references to gender are to be found throughout this directive and - what to me is the most important point - that the welfare of children is taken into account in the case of unaccompanied minors."
"I would also like to say from a German point of view that in this respect, we have a lot of ground to make up and I am very pleased that this aspect concerning the children plays a very important part in this draft directive."
"Another point worthy of recognition is the fact that, when dealing with this problem, special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability."
"Preventive measures, such as the training of public officials and the introduction of coordinators in the Member States, constitute major steps in the right direction."
"If we vote in favour of this today, we deserve to be congratulated."
"I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States, because in any case, they now have to present reports."
"Perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, according to estimates from international organisations and police forces, trafficking in human beings is now globally the second largest source of profit for organised crime, after drug trafficking."
"It is thought that around 30 million people are victims of organ trafficking, prostitution and forced labour."
"This means that the fight against this enormous criminal phenomenon is, above all, a battle for the safety of our citizens against illegal immigration and against crime that generates crime."
"Faced with a problem of these proportions, Europe must rightly take drastic measures against those who exploit human beings in various ways."
"The fight against this phenomenon requires cooperation between Member States and between police forces but, above all, certainty regarding the punishment for traffickers."
"It must also be remembered that many people are exploited because they do not have decent living conditions in their countries of origin: they live in poverty and in desperation and are ready to do anything - even leave their own country for the promise of a better life, which, alas, is never to be found."
"As well as preventing crime and protecting the victims of trafficking, Europe must also make a greater and more deliberate effort to ensure that these people can find acceptable living conditions in their own countries."
"The basic principle of European political action must be to 'help them in their own homes', so that our efforts are directed not only at suppression, but also at prevention."
"Madam President, human trafficking is, quite rightly, a pejorative term because it describes a disgusting practice."
"Human beings, disproportionately women, are treated as though they were commodities, even livestock, to be transported, used and often abused."
"However, the term is used too narrowly."
"Very little legal economic migration is truly voluntary."
"Most people, other things remaining equal, would prefer to remain with their own people in their own countries."
"They migrate for economic enrichment or because economic forces have removed their means of maintaining their livelihoods."
"Migration is the by-product of global capitalism that sees people not as human beings, but as factors of production that are expendable."
"Economic migration is as much a form of human trafficking as illicit migration organised by criminal networks."
"The human traffickers are the governments that quite deliberately unleash supposedly blind economic forces in the service of global capitalism."
"Economies should exist to serve the people."
"People do not exist to serve economic forces."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the gender dimension of this proposal for a directive facilitates the instrument to defend the most vulnerable people."
"The fact that there are numerous references to the trafficking of human beings in the Treaty of Lisbon confirms the immediacy and the seriousness of the problem."
"Article 5(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union bans the practice, recognising it as a form of slavery and forced labour."
"The rapporteurs have extended the scope of the protection, with a particular focus on children and women, and on the vulnerable situations that make this form of slavery easier to carry out."
"The report is also correct in remarking that trafficking in human beings also hides illegal forms of adoption and forced marriages."
"I feel I must point out the difficulties that border EU Member States have in fighting illegal immigration."
"Above all, Italy, my own country, has to deal on a daily basis with instances of trafficking that spill out onto our roads and our spaces."
"We need to communicate and therefore raise awareness so as to involve civil society."
"The report, as tabled, provides for the careful protection of victims, with the aim of eradicating the phenomenon."
"I should therefore like to show my support for this proposal, as tabled, and also congratulate the two rapporteurs."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and say that I think this directive is extraordinarily important because it is the first time that the European Union has taken legally binding action in the fight against the trafficking of human beings."
"Fifty years after the United Nations convention, there are still hundreds of thousands of people in our civilised Europe - mainly women and children - who are reduced to slavery."
"For the first time, the EU is equipped with a single instrument to fight against the trafficking of human beings, whether for reasons of sexual or labour exploitation, including forced begging."
"Our group had three priorities: to hit traffickers with uniform, more severe sanctions, including confiscating assets and using them to support the victims of trafficking; to ensure a high level of protection and social rehabilitation for victims, with free legal representation and immunity from prosecution for crimes committed in connection with being trafficked; and to promote the crucial role of the non-governmental organisations, both secular and religious, that work to support the victims."
"However, I am hoping for a revision of the 2004 directive on the resident permit for victims."
"I would also underline that in the proposal, we provide for the safeguarding of children through strengthened measures and I support Commissioner Malmström's call for further measures against sex tourism and child pornography."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"I think we have put together a good document today."
"We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking."
"However, the challenge will be getting the Member States to put this directive into practice."
"It is crucial that the enforcement bodies, such as the police and the courts, are made aware of how to actually recognise and to prosecute this crime."
"This is vital, and it is also very important to raise public awareness - as Mrs Matera has already mentioned - so that people are aware of the fact that human trafficking is happening within the EU."
"It is not just happening somewhere else; theoretically, it could also be happening right outside my front door."
"Another important point that, as Liberals from Germany in particular, we had difficulty with - although this has now been resolved in a positive manner by empowering the Member States - is the criminalisation of people who make use of this sort of service, because if someone is liable to prosecution, he can refuse to make a statement in a subsequent trial."
"If someone makes use of this right to refuse to give evidence - for example, a man who had been with a prostitute who had been endangered through human trafficking - information will be lost that could be used further to finally uncover this network of human traffickers."
"It is therefore a good thing that this rests with the Member States, and I would like to thank you very much for your cooperation."
"(NL) Madam President, the basis of many of the current developments was laid down as far back as hundreds of years ago."
"I am thinking here of the Industrial Revolution, the advent of representative democracy and the abolition of slavery."
"The current fight against human trafficking is a continuation of the struggle that William Wilberforce once began."
"Unfortunately, human trafficking is one of the worst covert problems in the European Union."
"It undermines the fundamental rights of our people and the foundations of our democracy."
"For that reason, I fully support the present report."
"However, as I understand it, the proposed sentencing tariff for reoffenders will, unfortunately, remain low."
"The current proposal does not require that any particularly heavy penalties be imposed on human traffickers who have been arrested a number of times."
"That seems to me to be an unfortunate state of affairs."
"I am in favour of an approach where a trafficker who is arrested for a second or a third offence must receive a mandatory life sentence."
"(PT) Madam President, it is important for everyone to join in the fight against trafficking in human beings, with a view to eradicating it."
"This kind of modern-day slavery is known to be highly lucrative for criminal organisations, which conduct it in a multitude of ways, from sexual exploitation and forced labour to the illegal trade in human organs, or even domestic work and other kinds of undeclared work."
"These practices - which particularly involve women and, increasingly, children - therefore need to be fought effectively, by criminalising the perpetrators of such crimes and providing support for the victims to escape from their dependency on the criminal organisations."
"That is also why it is vital to combat the causes of this situation, by creating the conditions for lifting people out of poverty, promoting policies for the fair redistribution of wealth, ensuring access to essential public services, and promoting the creation of jobs with rights and pay levels that afford a decent living."
"That is also a way forward which it is essential to promote here in the European Union."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, it has been proven that the most effective way of combating trafficking in human beings is to set an example by imposing strict penalties on traffickers."
"I strongly recommend, as we tend here in Parliament to set targets and to say '20%' or '30%', that we recommend a standard European legislation which sets a minimum prison sentence for human traffickers of 10-15 years, which cannot be reduced or replaced by a fine."
"You will see how effective that will be."
"Standard EU legislation and a minimum term of imprisonment of 10-15 years."
"I think it will be the most effective measure we have ever taken."
"We cannot adopt measures here on climate change and environmental pollution without setting quantifiable targets for combating this crime."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must congratulate Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh on the excellent work they have done in this report."
"Trafficking in human beings is a disgrace to our society and requires a strong, concerted reaction from everyone."
"The organised crime behind sexual exploitation, forced labour, the trade in the removal of human organs and other ignoble practices must be fought effectively, but primarily it must be prevented."
"What is at stake is the defence of human rights and the protection of the most vulnerable individuals, women and children in particular."
"Experience has shown that the legal framework in force is not effective enough and that the European Union has to work harder."
"Closer cross-border cooperation is essential, including the effective sharing of information and good practice."
"This proposal rightly emphasises a victim-centred approach."
"Policies in this field should cover aspects linked to social affairs and social inclusion, such as the social rehabilitation of victims."
"Madam President, this is no ordinary day for Parliament."
"We should be proud of the historic step that has been taken today, both on human trafficking and, indeed, on the European Protection Order."
"For the first time, criminal law and all the tools we have at our disposal after Lisbon have been brought into action on one of the most complex and horrific problems that we have to face collectively."
"We are proud, in the S&D Group, of the work done by Anna Hedh and her co-rapporteur, Ms Bauer, and we are proud of the 'firsts' that are marked by this report."
"For the first time, the EU will define, in a binding legislative act, a high level of sanctions against trafficking."
"For the first time, there are strong guarantees concerning the protection of victims, special attention for child victims, the non-prosecution of victims who break the law due to their enslavement and the recognition of the role and support of NGOs in the process."
"Finally, the complexity of this cause in relation to children and women - because we were moving into criminal law - should not have been a reason to stop a very good report."
"We are very proud in our group that this has happened across the House."
"It is a very proud day for the whole Parliament."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we are taking a huge step towards combating human trafficking in an efficient manner."
"The rapporteurs have achieved a good result in relation to minimum thresholds for sentences, jurisdiction, non-prosecution and statutory limitation - not all of this is perhaps quite what we would have liked to have seen, but it is nevertheless a very practicable solution."
"Anything else would also, to some extent, have disrupted national criminal law in the legal systems of the Member States."
"We need to be more restrained in this regard."
"I am also convinced that we would have done ourselves a disservice by making customers of prostitutes liable to prosecution, because this is not something we would have prosecuted otherwise."
"However, I would like to come back to the general question of criminal law and criminal procedure in the Member States."
"This is a very sensitive area of national legislation, which has developed over hundreds of years."
"We should therefore tread very carefully where this is concerned."
"I am also mentioning this in view of the imminent European Investigation Order."
"However, we have today established a good basis for cross-border cooperation in criminal matters."
"I am pleased that we have now taken this step."
"(DA) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we know that several hundred thousand people are sold as slaves each year to Western Europe, we have a duty to take action."
"I am therefore very pleased that an agreement has successfully been reached between the Council and Parliament on this new directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings."
"The new legislation is significantly stronger than the current legislation and it is a major victory in the fight to ensure better help and protection for victims. At the same time, the hunt for the unscrupulous people behind this will become even more targeted and efficient."
"I am pleased that the directive emphasises the fact that the victims shall be protected from any form of prosecution or punishment."
"When someone has been forced to carry out criminal acts, it is the people behind this who must be punished, not the victims."
"The European Parliament also believes it is important that the help being offered to victims is always provided in a language and in a format that they can understand."
"Moreover, we must not forget that voluntary and non-profit-making organisations play a crucial role when it comes to both preventing and combating human trafficking."
"Today could be an important day for decency, as the European Parliament will hopefully vote in favour of this new legislation, which will provide a much needed helping hand to the victims and result in an intensive hunt for the people behind these crimes."
"(SK) Madam President, the punishment of legal persons for crimes connected with human trafficking helps to intensify the fight against this modern form of slavery."
"Of course, the punishment of a legal entity must not exclude the punishment of specific natural persons who have taken part in this activity in any way."
"Apart from the imposition of financial penalties, effective measures against legal entities include, in my opinion, exclusion from the right to public grants or assistance, suspension of commercial activities and, above all, court decisions on the closing down of said entity."
"Member States must ensure the adoption of legal measures so that national bodies can decide not to pursue or impose punishments on the victims of human trafficking, and so that they can continue with investigations even when victims withdraw their statements."
"Last but not least, I would like to point out that the victims of these appalling crimes often continue to be victimised, and find themselves in very precarious circumstances, which is the reason for special protection and support."
"Special attention must also be paid to underage victims, for whom it is necessary to find even more comprehensive and lasting solutions."
"(CS) Madam President, all of the reports discussed this morning have one thing in common - the protection of fundamental human rights in the European Union and a common European process in this area."
"It is almost beyond belief that in the EU in the 21st century, several hundred thousand people a year fall victim to human trafficking, most of them women and children."
"It is a sad fact that in the current era, this problem is highly topical, and the statistics unfortunately do not indicate that it is in decline."
"Quite the reverse."
"The perpetrators of this serious crime earn astronomical profits from human trafficking, estimated at up to USD 32 billion annually."
"The protection of human rights and human dignity must be a clear priority in our work, and a common approach by the Member States is essential."
"I therefore fully support the proposal for a directive, which will introduce further instruments for combating this type of crime, and more effective protection for the victims, compared to existing legal measures, and which will attempt to achieve a more coordinated approach at EU level."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, in the final version of the report, involvement in criminal organisations for offences relating to the trafficking of human beings is an aggravating factor that doubles the minimum penalties from five to ten years in prison."
"In addition, Article 6a makes explicit reference to the seizure and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from this kind of offence."
"This approach - which I believe is absolutely right and I hope may also be carried over to other legislation - looks the facts in the face and recognises that the trafficking of people for various forms of exploitation, such as, for example, prostitution, criminal activities and organ trafficking, is carried out by international criminal organisations."
"I am also pleased with the provisions of Article 7, which directs Member States not to prosecute people for their involvement in criminal activities that they have been compelled to commit as victims of trafficking."
"Often, in fact, those who suffer the violence of trafficking not only suffer injuries, but also the insult of being incriminated for doing what they were compelled to do, prostitution being a typical example."
"Therefore, I support the report and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs."
"(FR) Madam President, one cannot but endorse the draft directive by the two rapporteurs, which should be extended to all Member States for a stronger and firm jurisdiction in order to prosecute and severely punish the perpetrators of the crime that is human trafficking, and also to protect, help and rehabilitate victims, who are overwhelmingly women and children."
"However, to be more effective and credible in this fight, Europe, as the heir to the history of the European States, should recognise the slave trade and slavery as crimes against humanity, as some Member States have done, and I want to mention France in particular."
"(IT) Madam President, the plague of trafficking in human beings is a phenomenon that has taken on particularly worrying dimensions."
"Whereas originally, it essentially involved women and children being recruited for prostitution, now the victims are people of all ages and both sexes, who are placed into a cycle of exploitation that is not necessarily sexual but also economic."
"Organised crime networks take advantage of social vulnerability, family difficulties, domestic violence and disabilities to favour immigration, exploiting the people involved through the use of force, abuse and threats."
"We are in favour of the proposed directive."
"We need to increase the penalties for traffickers of human beings, confiscating their assets."
"In addition, there should be a concerted effort by all Member States to strengthen policies preventing trafficking in human beings and training people to identify victims or potential victims."
"Madam President, this report was certainly a major step along the road to fighting trafficking in human beings in general and trafficking in women in particular."
"The next major step should be to explore the crystal clear relationship and connection between trafficking in women and prostitution."
"On the one hand, we rightly talk about trafficking in women as a brutal, terrible crime that we should fight."
"On the other hand, we talk about prostitution as 'sex work', as a service."
"We talk about pimps and brothel-keepers as entrepreneurs, and we normalise prostitution."
"What I want to say is that the client who goes to a brothel, or the client who asks for the services of a prostitute, has basically no way of knowing whether she is a 'normal' prostitute - if that even exists since it is another matter whether there is ever consent to prostitution - or a trafficked woman."
"There is therefore no way of really attacking trafficking without attacking the sex industry."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you for this important debate."
"I would like to inform you that today, the Commission will appoint an Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, who will take office in the next month."
"That person will improve coordination and coherence between the EU institutions and agencies and the Member States, will help ensure that best practices are shared in the different Member States, develop existing and forthcoming policies and be a contact for third countries."
"This is very important."
"By bringing together prevention, law enforcement and victim prevention, this person can ensure that appropriate methods to combat trafficking are used and mobilised appropriately."
"I will ask the Anti-Trafficking Coordinator to liaise closely with the European Parliament and to keep you informed on these developments."
"The criminalisation issue merits a debate in itself, but it is stated in Article 19 of the directive that the Commission will, in some years, submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council 'assessing the impact of existing national law criminalising the users of services which are the objects of exploitation of trafficking in human beings on the prevention of trafficking in human beings, accompanied, if necessary, by adequate proposals'."
"We will surely come back to this issue and I do not rule out our having further proposals on this."
"Having said all this, I think we can be proud of this directive today."
"It is a very important tool for fighting trafficking and protecting the victims."
"It has given us an important tool, it has shown the world our commitment to fighting modern slavery and it will strengthen our efforts."
"I would like to pass on my sincere thanks to the two co-rapporteurs, Ms Bauer and Ms Hedh."
"Today's debate has shown how important your work has been, because you have the support of all the groups."
"I would like to congratulate you on that."
"Madam President, I would especially like to thank Mrs Malmström for calling the report an historic text."
"This statement is probably accurate, as it is the first time that we are adopting a criminal law based on the Treaty of Lisbon, but I should also hope that this is a great step forward in ensuring that not a single perpetrator, not a single perpetrator of human trafficking, can remain unpunished."
"What was especially reassuring to see in the debate that took place here was the presence of a political will."
"I myself have frightfully often seen, and have sometimes myself shared the view, that there is a lack of political will to make any serious progress in this area."
"What I have heard today was the opposite of that, and I would like to thank my fellow Members for exhibiting this political will to take a tremendous step forward in relation to human trafficking."
"We have received two motions for amendment from the EFD, and I would like to ask my fellow Members not to support them, as they intend to reduce the penalty to a minimum."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Tzavela for requesting the very opposite, that we make the penalty even stricter."
"I am convinced that this is an important step, but today's step must be followed by an array of subsequent steps."
"We have much work to do in combating demand."
"We can certainly not solve all the problems related to supply, but there is much we could do about demand, and I have a feeling that in this area, the time is not yet ripe, that here, the political will is perhaps insufficient for taking a step forward."
"I am convinced that the scope of the law will sooner or later need to be extended to third-country perpetrators residing in the EU with a residence permit, as I am also convinced that we will need to review the directive on temporary residence permits to ensure legislative consistency in this area."
"Thank you very much for your support."
"Madam President, I would like to offer my thanks for all of the excellent contributions and the support that we have received in the Chamber for this legislation to prevent human trafficking."
"I now hope that, in the future, we may even improve on this legislation and tighten our common EU rules against human trafficking."
"However, we must not forget to go on working continually on what are the real reasons for, and root of, all trafficking in human beings, namely poverty, social exclusion and demand."
"We must apply our energies to these problems, above all, so that we can tackle the problem of human trafficking."
"As I said earlier, we must not give up."
"People's right to decide when it comes to their own life and their own bodies is a human right that cannot be bought and sold for money like any old commodity."
"The fight against human trafficking in Europe and the rest of the world will continue."
"Thank you for all your support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, in a few minutes."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Trafficking in human beings - in the various forms that this can take, including sexual exploitation, illegal trading in human organs, forced labour or illegal adoptions - represents a serious violation of the human rights set out in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The extent of this problem is striking, and experience has shown that the European Union's current legal framework on the issue is not effective enough."
"Cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council therefore plays a strategic role in developing a European policy to address this problem effectively."
"The Treaty of Lisbon strengthened the powers of the European Union regarding judicial and police cooperation between Member States in criminal matters."
"However, I believe that the penalties for traffickers in human beings still need to be increased and that the assistance given to victims of violence needs to be developed yet further."
"I agree that, in order to discourage demand, it would be a good idea for the European Union and the Member States to make a greater commitment to awareness-raising campaigns in the countries of origin, transit and destination of trafficking."
"Lastly, I support the appointment of a European Anti-Trafficking Coordinator to manage the European Union's work and policies in this specific sector."
"I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs for the work they have done, because this historic directive is a very important step in combating the scale of trafficking in human beings, by laying down clear levels of penalties and sanctions."
"Although numerous EU and national laws have already been adopted and multiannual political commitments have been made in this area, it is calculated that several hundred thousand people are trafficked each year within the EU and beyond its borders."
"This demonstrates that combating trafficking in human beings, in particular, women and children, remains a huge problem and one of the worst violations of human rights."
"I would like to emphasise that considering the fact that children are more vulnerable and that they face a greater risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings, particular attention should be paid to this group of victims."
"Given that trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery and an extremely profitable business for organised crime, more attention must be paid to preventive efforts, the protection of victims and social issues."
"Furthermore, a hostile environment must be created for human traffickers."
"The level of penalties and sanctions for people who profit from trafficking in human beings should reflect the gravity of the offence committed and act as an effective deterrent to such activities."
"In addition to penalties, the Member States should include such sanctions as the seizure of assets and take the necessary measures to seize and confiscate instrumentalities and proceeds from the offences, because then these offences would not be economically viable."
"in writing. - Today's vote on human trafficking comes at a crucial juncture in the ongoing fight against this form of modern-day slavery."
"As Irish director Ciarán O'Connor outlined last year in his film 'Trafficked', which documented the ongoing impact of trafficking in Ireland, it is a crime which is becoming more advanced and more ruthless as authorities fight harder to drive it away."
"Measures such as this are crucial in order to give authorities the tools and common purpose they need to tackle this Europe-wide problem."
"At a national level, legislatures need to come down hard on those convicted, and resources must be given to police forces so that it is not for lack of finance or manpower that trafficking is allowed to continue."
"However, this is a crime without borders, and as such, it is European legislation as much as national laws that will truly put an end to slavery in Europe."
"The European Union's action on trafficking in human beings cannot be limited to denouncing it, but recognises the need for precise, ex-post actions to ensure that those responsible for such a barbaric practice do not go unpunished."
"These actions include the harmonisation of penalties, as well as the coordination of the interventions provided for by the EU with those already implemented by other international organisations, such as the United Nations."
"The ex-post actions must be combined with preventive actions, which are just as important."
"Above all, there must be close cooperation between judicial and financial police authorities to ensure that the economic systems that revolve around these criminal activities are blocked at source and all ramifications cut off."
"Furthermore, it is increasingly important to have accurate and reliable databases that distinguish between the various specificities and provide a starting point for a variety of interventions that contribute to hitting each individual case right at its core."
"Through this proposal for a directive, the European Union is aiming to attack the entire supply chain of an inhumane trade that tramples on its principles and founding values."
"in writing. - The phenomenon of organised crime is something that the European Union needs to tackle head on."
"We need to be seen as proactive rather than reactive to situations of human trafficking."
"It is important that we research new emerging ways of human trafficking, in order to intercept and pre-empt emerging human trafficking routes."
"As a member of the S&D Group, I would like to emphasise that one of our key objectives is to fight cross-border crime."
"I therefore voted in favour of this legislative initiative."
"As legislators of the European Union, we must ensure respect for the right to human dignity, the right to integrity, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the prohibition of slavery and forced labour."
"We cannot allow the trafficking and subsequent auctioning of children to continue."
"Traffickers are also using Internet recruitment."
"This is very alarming as many children have access to the Internet."
"in writing. - Trafficking in human beings is a crime against human dignity that ruins the lives of many children and women throughout the world."
"The current proposal is a breakthrough because it puts victims first and tackles the problem in a complex, cross-border manner."
"These new measures will facilitate the reconnaissance and prosecution of trafficking cases and will encourage victims to cooperate with the authorities."
"This will be binding legislation, subject to state enforcement."
"This type of regulation is the only one that can make a difference for all vulnerable people who might fall prey to trafficking."
"I also call on Member States to follow the proposal in this text and punish those who knowingly accept the services of a victim of trafficking."
"Fighting demand is key to fighting the roots of trafficking."
"This report is an excellent proposal, morally and professionally, and I congratulate my distinguished colleagues, Bauer and Hedh, for this."
"I am particularly happy that the Council and FEMM and LIBE Committees managed to create a text that is backed by all relevant institutions in the EU."
"I hope that it will soon be formally adopted and transposed into national law."
"The victims are eager to see it."
"The directive relating to human trafficking is an important step forward, because human trafficking is a reality, even in Europe."
"What is most important is to prevent human trafficking by addressing the problems of poverty and inequality and by making people more aware of the issue."
"It is vitally important to recognise the existence of human trafficking and to help its victims."
"Victims can be women or men, children or adults."
"An employee on a construction site could be a victim of human trafficking."
"The situation surrounding a Roma beggar may match the human trafficking criteria if it is organised and based on compulsion."
"Unfortunately, often human trafficking is linked to sexualised practices: women and girls end up as prostitutes or they are forced into it."
"It is important that the victims of human trafficking are given the chance of protection and legal advice."
"in writing. - As a result of the harmful tendencies affecting Roma communities - such as low levels of education, deep poverty, marginalisation and discrimination - Roma women and children are extremely vulnerable to trafficking."
"This modern-day slavery is deeply rooted in poverty and exclusion and, therefore, the elimination of the unacceptable living conditions that many Roma face must be a major strategic objective."
"Furthermore, the EU and the authorities of the Member States must take much more vigorous action to combat this phenomenon, particularly regarding the eradication of organised crime and the protection of groups at risk, namely women and minors of minority origin."
"This initiative aims to adopt a broader concept of what should be considered trafficking and I believe that exploitation for begging, including the use of a trafficked-dependent person for begging, regardless of his or her relationship with the perpetrators, must fall within this scope."
"Penalties should be more severe when the offence is committed against persons vulnerable on grounds of age, gender, pregnancy, health conditions, or disability, and must pay due account of cases where the victim has been subjected to torture, the forced administration of drugs or medication, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical and sexual violence."
"Every year in Europe, hundreds of thousands of people are sold as if they were objects and, fortunately, today we feel an ever-increasing need to protect the victims of trafficking in human beings from the use of false documents, from prostitution and from immigration."
"When we speak about trafficking in human beings, we must think about not only sexual exploitation, forced labour and illegal adoptions, but also the problem of trafficking in organs, which is becoming an increasingly widespread crime."
"The European legal structure is not effective enough and the European Union and Member States must do more."
"We need an established structure for coordination between the institutions and the agencies of the EU, as well as those of the Member States and international partners."
"In today's debate, I should like to touch on the problem of child trafficking."
"We should make every effort to develop and improve the legal and institutional systems and childcare systems in all Member States."
"The scope of activities covered by the term human trafficking should be revised and extended."
"This is the only way we will be able to prevent problems such as: 1) commercial adoption, or, in other words, private adoption involving the relinquishment of rights to the child before the family courts, most frequently for payment; 2) pregnant women leaving the country and returning with no child; 3) the disappearance of children whose parents have died in countries affected by armed conflicts."
"Given that a good many crimes are now committed via the Internet, it is worth appointing special interdisciplinary teams specialised in fighting this type of crime."
"They would deal not only with the surveillance of criminal milieu, but also the collection of evidence by means of monitoring the financial situations of individuals involved in trafficking children."
"We should train public officials and make them more aware of the situation of children in families from which children may be trafficked."
"This applies particularly to services working with families receiving state assistance due to difficult material circumstances."
"The only way we will have any chance of eliminating or at least limiting human trafficking and, in particular, child trafficking, is by means of multilateral and harmonised measures, taken at the level of the 27 Member States."

"You are therefore very welcome to the European Parliament."

"Mr President, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks are inherent to possible terrorist attacks, industrial accidents or natural disasters."
"Incidents of this kind, whether accidental or criminal in origin, know no borders and are potentially devastating for human lives, infrastructure, the environment and public health."
"They do not occur just in remote areas: we need only recall the recent disaster caused by the leak of toxic sludge from a factory in Hungary and the series of letter-bombs posted from Yemen to various addresses in the United States and Europe."
"It is crucial for the European Union to make every effort to develop the necessary cooperation between the Member States' civilian and military capabilities and resources in order to prevent, detect and respond effectively to CBRN attacks or disasters."
"Such cooperation requires a special European crisis-response mechanism, working in collaboration with a European civil protection force."
"In fact, this House has long been calling for such a force to be established."
"The EU Action Plan therefore needs strengthening."
"The existing plan, which the Council approved in 2009, is weak and, in practice, is not being implemented by all Member States."
"It just needs one link to crack for the whole chain of intervention to fail."
"It is vital to give the Commission a stronger monitoring, guiding and coordinating role, and the plan urgently needs to be implemented in all Member States."
"This report proposes greater civilian-military cooperation in terms of pooling efforts for CBRN disaster prevention, detection, preparation and response."
"The EU has to bring all the Member States together to put in place integrated national systems for implementing the plan."

"Well that is something."
"Following the vote on the amended proposal:"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as you are aware, I am just listening and I am looking."
"I got the message that I have to sit here and take the message - and it is a clear one - to the college."
"I promise you that I will take the message and, of course, it will be an objective one, as there was quite a lot of action."
"But my colleague will return to this after a discussion in the college."
"Consequently, the proposal shall be sent back to the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, in accordance with Rule 175(56), we need to know whether the Commission is withdrawing this legislative proposal."
"Therefore, the proposal is not automatically sent back to the responsible committee."
"The Commission needs to decide now whether it is withdrawing its proposal and tabling a new proposal before Parliament."
"Mr Cercas, I deduced from the Commissioner's words that it will go back to the Commission."
"That is what I deduced."
"We will, however, ask the Commissioner to clarify the Commission's position."
"Commissioner, please clarify the Commission's position."
"Mr President, I must admit my surprise."
"(Noise)"
"We have already been negotiating this text for a year."
"For a start, I would like to tell you that we had reached an agreement with the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I then discovered at the last moment that voting advice had been given that totally contradicted the agreements we had reached."
"I discovered that the agreements that we had with the ALDE Group have not been adhered to."
"We went to plenary with agreements that had not been honoured."
"Secondly, Mr Cercas is proposing that we amend - I would like to be able to speak, otherwise there is no point - the Socialist Group, and Mr Cercas in particular, are proposing that the Commission amend its proposal."
"But, Mr Cercas, we have now been discussing this for a year."
"You are proposing a number of things."
"For a year now, we have failed to reach an agreement. So, what is the point of starting all over again?"
"We could debate for 10 years, Mr Cercas, and you would still disagree."
"We have tried everything possible and you have never agreed with anyone."
"I do not see, therefore, how submitting more proposals will mean that we move forward."
"That is a real shame."
"You opposed migrants entering the European Union."
"The Socialist Group is denying these migrants the same treatment as that enjoyed by European workers."

"The Commission has to tell us whether or not it is maintaining its proposal."

"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, you will not blame me, following this discussion which was not completely clear, for taking the outcome of this discussion home to Brussels."
"I will certainly put it on the table of the college."
"The Commission will inform you later of the outcome of its discussions."

"It is very important, not only for women, but also for men, children, victims of terrorism, victims of organised crime, victims of trafficking of women and for victims in general."
"Mr President, there are two of us who are rapporteurs."
"I just want to remind the liberal ministers of the European Union that currently, it is also very important that this report is endorsed in order to support the fundamental rights of women."

"Voting time"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take a few seconds to express my disapproval of the Council's decision to reject the report by Mrs Estrela on maternity leave."
"Today, I am acting as the spokesperson for millions of European mothers and fathers who, like me, are very disappointed by the Council's decision."
"It is an admission of a lack of values, which I do not identify with and which I condemn with every fibre of my being."
"I wonder what kind of Europe we are heading towards."
"Rejecting this proposal is a decision that hurts not just the families of today but, above all, the families of tomorrow."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"We will now proceed to the explanations of vote."
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, not for the first time in this Chamber, I feel that I have fallen through some kink in the space-time continuum, some warp or tunnel that has led me back to the 1970s."
"Here we are in a world of state control of industry, of price and income policies, of limited working hours and of subventions to unprofitable corporations."
"I can do no better than to read out the voting list of what we have been voting on today: subsidies to SI/Mura in Slovenia, to Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG in Germany, to the automotive industry in Wielkopolskie in Poland, to the retail trade in Aragón in Spain, to the textile sector in the Comunidad Valenciana in Spain, to the manufacture of natural stone products in the Comunidad Valenciana in Spain, to Lear in Spain, and to H. Cegielski-Poznań in Poland."
"In the 1970s, we used to talk about picking winners."
"What we are actually doing here is picking losers."
"We are making the EU step in with money where the free market has decreed a failure."
"Why are we doing so?"
"Because the EU is now a mechanism for the redistribution of wealth to favoured client groups."
"Mr President, you know as well as I do that this is nonsense."
"You were a brilliantly successful Conservative leader in Catalonia."
"You understand the importance of free peoples and free markets, and so do our voters."
"The money is running out."
"We are reaching the moment when, as in George Orwell's magnificent metaphor, the people will shake off the system like a horse shaking off flies."
"(LT) Mr President, today, the European Parliament demonstrated a strong position by taking a step towards deeper cooperation between the European Union and the South Caucasus."
"The South Caucasus and Georgia are regions that are strategically important for the EU."
"My country, Lithuania, has always had a special relationship with Georgia."
"We supported it at the most difficult moments and not simply at state level as a government."
"There was always huge public support for this country."
"I believe that the whole of the European Union wants Georgia to join the family of European nations."
"This country has made huge efforts to be part of Europe and therefore, we must assess them accordingly."
"Visa facilitation will help to ensure people's mobility, their cooperation and, at the same time, both economic and cultural links."
"I would very much like to welcome Georgia and its people with this decision, adopted today in the European Parliament."
"The EU is sending them a message that we expect them to become members of the European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, we cannot allow the huge sum of money we spend on cohesion policy to be wasted or squandered."
"It is therefore vital to improve the way in which the money is managed, and also to ensure that it is spent more effectively."
"Local authorities, which are most aware of the needs of their region, play a key role in this regard."
"Attention should also be paid to cross-border areas, in order to facilitate their integration."
"In order for there to be proper vertical and horizontal cooperation, procedures must be streamlined, and more money spent on the training of specialists from implementing bodies in the individual Member States."
"We also need to support modernisation and expansion of the IT system, which will ensure easy and equal access to information for all beneficiaries."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the rapporteur that we should proceed towards multi-level governance for greater involvement of sub-national authorities in drawing up development policies, above all, in the convergence objective areas, which are interested in increasing their ability to come into line with the areas of the Member States and to compete on the global market."
"In order for the regional development policies to be more effective, we need to involve those who know their own regions and can help drive their development."
"That is the link between multi-level governance and territorial cohesion highlighted by the rapporteur."
"Regarding the simplification of regulations, the lighter the burden of bureaucracy, the greater the acceleration and quality of European investments for regional development."
"Greater assistance for the Managing Authorities from the Commission would contribute to reducing the mistakes made in the past at the first level of controls."
"(HU) Mr President, the controllability and efficiency of regional policy contributes to the security of the economic and social status of EU citizens."
"I voted on the course of good governance laid out by Parliament because I agree that the key to the progress of our countries lies in closer regional cooperation."
"It is therefore desirable to call upon the Member States to make better use of the available forms of cooperation across regional borders."
"Priority multi-level governance is precisely what may help local regional authorities and the private and public sectors to find each other."
"The idea formulated with regard to implementation, according to which the local and regional authorities must also be involved in policy making, also deserves support."
"The large number of participants involved in the policy at Community, national, regional and local level represents both opportunities and uncertainties."
"The framework set up by the EU must ensure an appropriate balance between the two."
"(FI) Mr President, firstly, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Mǎnescu, for her excellent work."
"It is very important to point out that there is a need for good governance in regional policy."
"In my opinion, good governance mainly involves the principles of fairness and impartiality."
"We need to look at the European Union as an entity and not just cherry-pick and provide support for certain areas only."
"The whole of Europe must be developed impartially, and we also have to ensure that that can and will be done, using the tools of regional policy."
"I am also very concerned that when we look at the criteria for regional policy and funding, it should not just be GDP that we consider."
"That is not a sustainable criterion in itself, as we will be examining remote regions in the EU, and for that reason, it is important to include the notions of sparsely populated areas and long distances."
"When we talk about good governance, we are talking, above all, about impartial, fair governance in the European Union's regional policy."
"(FI) Mr President, the immigration issue is a very topical one throughout the European Union."
"For that reason, it is very important that we create a network of liaison officers."
"We also need to try and act in a way where we are becoming more objective in these matters in Europe."
"Recently, however, there have been worrying examples of our failures in some aspects of immigration policy."
"People who have arrived in Europe and settled here have not been prepared to accept fundamental European values."
"Accordingly, as Europeans, we need to ensure, in particular, that those core values, on which the whole of the European Union is built, are preserved, and that they are adhered to."
"They include democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion."
"It is these that we especially need to uphold."
"For that reason, alongside the creation of a liaison officer network, it is also important to establish codes of ethics and values for it, as a point of reference when immigration policy is being laid down."
"It is important that migrants can integrate and accept fundamental European values when they are resident in the European Union."
"(CS) Mr President, I would like to talk about the vote on the European Protection Order, because I personally consider this instrument to be enormously important."
"I can well imagine the position of the women to whom the order mainly applies, and who find themselves in situations where they are literally being persecuted, wanting to move and needing protection."
"For this reason, I am concerned that the text we have voted on is not established on a reliable legal basis."
"I firmly believe, however, that the text can be modified, and I believe that this obviously good idea will be fully implemented."
"At this point in time, however, I have abstained from the vote for these reasons."
"Mr President, I just want to say that my voting machine did not work for the vote on the European Protection Order, but I would have voted in favour because this is a very important issue and it was important for Parliament to adopt the European Protection Order today."
"This legislation is essential for Europe."
"The mutual recognition of judgment and judicial decisions is fundamental in an area of freedom, security and justice."
"In order to prevent a crime, or a new crime, being committed against a protected person, the executing state is now given a legal base for recognising a decision previously adopted in another Member State."
"This legislation is needed for the prevention of violence against women and the other victims of violence."
"It is an essential and important step in enabling victims to reside or stay wherever they want in the EU and thereby be included in the freedom of movement."
"Mr President, human trafficking is a very serious issue."
"Since 2008, 35 people have been rescued from exploitation in my own constituency of Northern Ireland; 25 of these were rescued in 2009."
"However, no one has yet been convicted of an offence of human trafficking."
"It is a form of modern-day slavery, a serious crime and a violation of a person's fundamental human rights."
"Indeed, many of the women taken or rescued in Northern Ireland are from the Far East and are there through organised crime gangs who are making huge profits and exploiting these people both for labour and sexual exploitation."
"While there are many valuable aspects to this report, and I believe that this is an area where there can be considerable cooperation between national police forces - indeed the police force of Northern Ireland has been leading the way in this - I abstained in the eventual vote because I firmly believe that the setting of minimum tariffs is a matter for the Member State alone."
"(FI) Mr President, currently, human trafficking is one of the biggest and most crucial issues and one of the most serious threats facing the European Union."
"We need to recognise the problem and admit that there is one, even if often, it is as if we were hiding behind the notion that we have already resolved it."
"Unfortunately, that is not the case."
"We need to ensure that the fundamental rights of each person can become a reality."
"The term 'human trafficking' is something of a misnomer, because there is nothing human about it."
"It is an appalling business, where people are stripped of the onetime chance of life and of human dignity."
"Women and children are in the special risk group."
"Prostitution and the trade in organs are the most glaring examples of this."
"I would like to call on the European Union actually to start to act - not just talk, but act - to bring human trafficking in the European Union to a complete end, using this report as a point of reference."
"We need to take action to fight against it properly, using the sanctions that would ensure that each person would have a chance to preserve their human dignity and enjoy a good life."
"(SK) Mr President, I supported the directive, because human trafficking is a denial of freedom in the broadest sense of the word."
"I am pleased that the new directive places a duty on states to improve their legislation with the aim of combating this crime effectively, but I would also like to point out that a Community-wide condemnation of exploitation must come before the pursuit of traffickers."
"Every trade involves a buyer and these are often people from the rich democratic countries, and they may be our neighbours."
"The report pays attention to victims, but we must do more, we must open our eyes and notice what is happening around us, so that people who see no way out of their poverty never become victims."
"We must concentrate on educating children and young people, we must inform parents and teachers, and we must talk about this in the media, since the most effective form of prevention is a lack of demand."
"(IT) Mr President, I asked for the floor to give an explanation of vote on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings."
"Obviously, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Bauer because the fight against trafficking in human beings is, and must remain, one of our priorities."
"This problem has grown to such an extent that it can be called a new form of slavery."
"The most vulnerable parts of society - women and children - are taken abroad and exploited through the most abominable forms of prostitution, slavery and pornography."
"Each year, this phenomenon has 1 million victims around the world and 500 000 in Europe alone."
"Those who take advantage of this phenomenon are committing a criminal act, financing the trafficking of human beings and using people as goods to be bought and sold."
"As the report emphasises, we need to take action in the countries where the victims of trafficking come from and where they are moved to."
"We will only be able to find a solution through a common effort, by carrying out collective awareness raising and supporting and assisting the victims and, above all, by fighting the root causes of this phenomenon so as to help those countries involved to develop suitable legislation to combat all forms of slavery."
"(DE) Mr President, I am pleased that, in Parliament today, we have talked not only about the agreement between the European Union and Georgia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas but also about the agreement between the European Union and Georgia on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation."
"In this regard, it is important that we do not merely deal with the pleasant things in life, but also with the serious issues, and I hope that, as Parliament, in perhaps a year's time, we will receive an interim report on how this agreement between the European Union and Georgia has been implemented and, above all, how well it has worked."
"I would also like the European Parliament to be much more involved in the initial discussions next time."
"Mr President, I wanted to explain why my group and I abstained on the vote on the EU rapid response capability."
"The multiplication of major disasters outside the EU in recent years has led to increased calls to improve the effectiveness of the EU disaster response capacity."
"While I can agree with many of the excellent points raised in this report, I cannot support the call for the establishment of a new EU civil protection force."
"While I support calls for the EU to coordinate its response to humanitarian catastrophes with the wider development community, I can only support such developments when they take place within already existing mechanisms, such as the Community's civil protection mechanism."
"While it is extremely important that the EU responds effectively to humanitarian catastrophes, it is equally important that we are not the only ones responding."
"In addition to focusing our attention on improving the EU's response, we must also focus on strengthening the capacity of developing countries and regions and sub-regional capacity in the affected area, so that we do this together as an international community."
"Otherwise, we will be doing all the hard work and they will be doing nothing."
"(PL) Mr President, many EU citizens are still not aware of the significance of cohesion policy for the development not only of individual regions, but also of entire countries."
"Its main task is to create a level playing field for regions within the European Union."
"As a result, populations from less privileged regions with difficult farming conditions and poor access to communications benefit from the same level of access to social, education, transport and energy services as the citizens of areas enjoying better social and economic positions."
"The idea of cohesion is therefore one whose significance cannot be overestimated."
"We must therefore support all measures aimed at making better use of money granted under the Structural Funds and at making more effective use of its integrating role, all the more so because the effects of cohesion policy measures are most keenly felt at local level and, therefore, to a significant extent in rural areas too."
"These are the reasons why I voted in favour of this report."
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to talk about the Luhan report, which is the final topic in today's debate."
"Competitiveness and cohesion are elements which complement and support one another."
"The competitiveness of the EU as a whole, however, can be secured only if economic growth is genuinely sustainable."
"Many investments co-financed from the Structural Funds have proved their worth, among which I would like to emphasise infrastructure improvement, because it has resulted in foreign investment being attracted into many regions, contributing to economic development."
"Cohesion policy, however, has also proved its worth in a time of financial crisis as an effective instrument for responding flexibly to new socio-economic challenges."
"I also agree with the rapporteur's view that the economic competitiveness of EU regions is closely connected with the average level of employment, the education and qualifications of the workforce, social security and access to public services, because support for social cohesion is of key importance for overall regional competitiveness, even on a global scale."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted for the report on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (flooding in Madeira, Portugal, and a storm in France)."
"Portugal applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after unusual and abnormal rainfall on the island of Madeira in February 2010 triggered landslides and flooding, causing severe damage to public and private infrastructure, businesses and agriculture."
"The Portuguese authorities officially estimated the damage caused by the floods in Madeira at EUR 1.08 billion."
"The Solidarity Fund is contributing about EUR 31 million."
"I was in Madeira myself and witnessed the need for this fund to be more flexible and generous in its support, particularly for the more remote and island regions, which are often battered by bad weather."
"On the basis of the report by my esteemed German colleague, Mr Böge, I voted for the proposal for a decision by the European Parliament and of the Council on mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 67 million to help Madeira (Portugal), which was hit by landslides and floods, as well as France, affected by floods following storm Xynthia in February 2010."
"I note that the amount represents 2.7% of an estimated EUR 2.5 billion of total direct damage."
"Of course, this is a substantial amount of funding, but given that it is a relatively small proportion of the total damage (2.7%), I cannot help but wonder whether the European Union should not use this fund to finance a European civil protection force which could immediately come to the aid of disaster victims, in order to cope with extremely acute situations that are beyond the capabilities of national forces."
"This force would not be very expensive because, initially, it would involve coordinating existing national civil protection forces."
"In addition it could be used for missions abroad (such as Haiti)."
"I welcome the adoption of the report awarding Portugal EUR 31 255 790 from the European Union Solidarity Fund, following the flooding that occurred in Madeira last February."
"The torrential rain that fell on the island of Madeira caused chaos and extreme material damage, with landslides, collapsed bridges, closed highways, and houses and cars swept away by the floods."
"Forty-two people died and 13 disappeared in the disaster that struck Madeira."
"Today, the European Parliament here in Strasbourg has witnessed a genuine demonstration of European solidarity, which is one of the most important values of the European project and one that deserves to be emphasised."
"I voted for this report because I agree that, in respect of the general budget of the European Union for the 2010 financial year, the European Union Solidarity Fund should be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 66 891 540 in commitment and payment appropriations in order to address the application made by Portugal to respond to a disaster caused by landslides and flooding on the island of Madeira and also the application by France with regard to a disaster caused by storm Xynthia."
"I, of course, welcome the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund to aid the victims of the tragedy that struck Madeira following abnormal rainfall."
"I congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Teixeira, on his able and continual efforts to raise awareness in the European institutions and to establish a basis for the necessary support."
"I reiterate my strong belief that the procedures need to be simplified so that the Solidarity Fund can be mobilised more swiftly in future."
"Emergency aid that arrives too late tarnishes the Union's efficient image and undermines the feeling of European solidarity."
"Portugal applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after unusual and abnormal rainfall on the island of Madeira in February 2010 triggered landslides and flooding, causing severe damage to local public and private infrastructure, businesses and agriculture."
"The Portuguese authorities, in conjunction with the regional government of Madeira, estimated the total direct damage at EUR 1.08 billion, equivalent to 0.68% of Portugal's gross national income."
"The flooding caused considerable damage to many homes, farms, roads and water mains."
"The financial aid released through the fund will enable the Portuguese authorities, particularly the regional government of Madeira, to recover part of the expenses they incurred in responding to the emergency."
"I voted overall in favour of this report out of a sense of responsibility and a commitment to avoid unnecessary delays in mobilising financial aid for the regions of Portugal and France that have been struck by natural disasters."
"Ten months after storm Xynthia hit the French coast, killing 53, injuring 80 and causing substantial material damage, Parliament has adopted a budgetary amendment in order to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 35.6 million."
"The reconstruction process aside, however, how many other tragedies will there have to be before we finally have a Community approach to preventing natural disasters?"
"Natural and man-made disasters are becoming more and more frequent, which is why we must ensure that national measures are more effective and better coordinated, and that European measures are more flexible."
"I also want to point out that since 2006, we have had a report by Mr Barnier on establishing a rapid reaction force for responding to natural disasters: what is stopping us from adopting it?"
"What is stopping us from using it?"
"I voted in favour of this report today which means that the EU Solidarity Fund can be mobilised following the damage in the wake of major floods in Portugal and storm Xynthia in 2010."
"This demonstrates the strong ties between the Union's Member States and underlines the importance of coming to the aid of regions struck by natural disasters."
"I am delighted that over EUR 35 million have been released from the Solidarity Fund to repair the considerable damage caused by Xynthia in some coastal areas, primarily Charente-Maritime, Vendée and the Côtes-d'Armor."
"The Commission is proposing to mobilise the Solidarity Fund to provide a total sum of EUR 66 891 540 in favour of Portugal and France: EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal and EUR 35 635 750 for France."
"Portugal requested assistance following a storm in Madeira in February 2010, which caused severe damage to public and private infrastructure, businesses and farms."
"France, for its part, requested assistance from the Solidarity Fund following storm Xynthia, also in February 2010, which struck a significant part of the country, killing 53 people, injuring 80, and also causing severe damage to dams and dykes, public and private infrastructure, road and rail networks, farms and businesses."
"While I am wholly in favour of this mobilisation, not least because of its importance to the Autonomous Region of Madeira, I have to express my disappointment that the aid is only being made available in December, 10 months after the disasters that struck the French coast and the island of Madeira."
"We urgently need to find faster ways of getting the Solidarity Fund procedure to work and we must focus our efforts on achieving that."
"We, of course, voted in favour of this report, which proposes mobilising the Solidarity Fund to address the enormous damage that occurred on the island of Madeira following the storm that struck the region in February 2010."
"Nonetheless, we would like to reiterate some remarks here."
"According to the Solidarity Fund Regulation, 'in the event of major disasters, the Community should show its solidarity with the population of the regions concerned by providing financial assistance to contribute to a rapid return to normal living conditions in the disaster-stricken regions'."
"The regulation also states that this instrument should enable the Community 'to act swiftly and efficiently to help, as quickly as possible, in mobilising emergency services to meet people's immediate needs and contribute to the short-term restoration of damaged key infrastructure'."
"However, the rules and procedures involved in mobilising the fund have already shown that this principle of helping the affected populations quickly is not being observed in practice."
"In this case, this House is only voting to mobilise the fund 10 months after the disaster."
"That is why we have argued - and we do so again now - that the rules for mobilising this fund need to be adjusted to allow for more flexible and timely mobilisation and to reduce the time that elapses between the disaster and the point at which the funds are made available."
"In my view, the EU Solidarity Fund, like the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, is one of the budgetary tools that give the strongest practical expression to the 'solidarity' value that we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strive to promote when drafting Community policies."
"On 27 and 28 February 2010, storm Xynthia killed 53 and injured around 80 in Vendée and Charente-Maritime."
"It was a genuinely traumatic experience for the region and the nation, and its psychological and economic impact is still being felt 10 months later."
"As from the March 2010 plenary session, Parliament took action, adopting by a very large majority a resolution calling for the fund to be used to provide assistance to the victims."
"Today's vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens."
"This is the Europe we wish to build, a Europe close to its citizens, alert to the issues affecting them, and capable of addressing those issues collectively."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund."
"I believe, in fact, that the fund is a valuable tool for enabling the European Union to show solidarity with the populations of regions affected by natural disasters, by providing financial support to help ensure a swift return to normal living conditions."
"Today's vote concerned two requests for assistance."
"The first was made by Portugal, following the abnormal rainfall on the island of Madeira, which triggered landslides and severe flooding, causing damage to public and private infrastructure, to businesses and to agriculture."
"The second request for mobilisation was made by France following storm Xynthia, which caused the deaths of 53 people and flooded wide areas, including residential areas, and caused severe damage to dams and dykes, public and private infrastructure, road and rail networks, agriculture and businesses."
"Lastly, I would add that the Fund was mobilised to the tune of EUR 31 255 790 for the flooding in Madeira and EUR 35 635 750 for storm Xynthia, totalling EUR 66 891 540."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which grants 31 million euro to Portugal and 35 million euro to France from the EU Solidarity Fund."
"This is an important gesture of support following flooding and landslides in Portugal in February, and destruction caused by the storm 'Xynthia' on the Atlantic coastline in France."
"I voted in favour of mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund for the areas hit by floods in Portugal and the French regions hit by storm Xynthia in February 2010."
"The Atlantic coastal regions were the worst affected, with the storm flooding vast areas, including residential areas, causing serious human and material damage."
"Today's vote responds to the request by the French authorities for these regions to receive, among other things, European financial assistance for an 'extraordinary disaster, mainly a natural one, affecting the major part of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and the economic stability of the region'."
"Of the estimated EUR 1 425.43 million of direct damage caused by the disaster, EUR 35 635.750 will be paid out to France."
"The mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund is a practical expression of a Europe that is close to its citizens, which is what they expect."
"The European institutions still need to work towards delivering swifter operations and procedures, which are justified by the urgency and scale of natural phenomena."
"The aid that the European Union is allocating to Portugal and France following the storms in February 2010 is good news."
"It is, however, regrettable that the EU does not act as swiftly to help citizens devastated by the consequences of climate change as it does when it has to bail out the banks."
"The European Union is an area of solidarity, and the EU Solidarity Fund is a part of that."
"Support from the fund is crucial for aiding areas affected by natural disasters, such as the flooding in Madeira (Portugal) and storm Xynthia in France."
"After verifying that both applications meet the eligibility criteria of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal (Madeira flooding) and EUR 35 635 750 for France (storm Xynthia), resulting in a total amount of EUR 66 891 540 to be deducted from the ceiling of EUR 1 billion in commitment and payment appropriations."
"I would, however, like to highlight the delay in mobilising this type of support."
"The procedure needs to be made less bureaucratic and more streamlined in order to respond to future disaster situations in a timely manner."
"Although I voted in favour of this proposal to grant aid, I consider that this is an analgesic and palliative measure for the consequences of the capitalist model, and that it does not represent any progress in the fight against the root causes of the crisis."
"I agree with the mobilisation of resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for citizens made redundant due to structural changes in commercial models or as a direct consequence of the current economic and financial crisis."
"I believe that the sum of more than EUR 250 million that is being requested as additional assistance and aid for the more than 600 employees made redundant from the retail sector in the Netherlands can help to achieve the ultimate goal of facilitating the reintegration of these workers into the labour market."
"I also voted in favour because I am convinced that this assistance complements the redundancy aid provided for in all national legislation and collective agreements."
"Therefore, this mobilisation of funds from the EGF cannot, under any circumstances, replace the legal responsibilities of governments and business vis-à-vis employees who have been made redundant, or enable the evasion of such responsibilities."
"In such circumstances, support is essential, so that all EU Member States may feel they belong to a united family."
"It would be many times cheaper if European Union funds were to be granted to projects that were capable of alleviating the consequences of natural disasters. For instance, construction of dams and protective structures, and investment in public information and warning measures."
"I consider that it would also be useful to develop building regulations for higher-risk regions."
"If the European Union merely provides funds and does not work towards prevention of natural disasters, this may have graver consequences in the future."
"Portugal applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after unusual rainfall caused landslides and severe flooding on the island of Madeira in February 2010, which resulted in damage to public and private infrastructure and to businesses and agriculture."
"The Portuguese authorities estimate the total cost of the direct damage to be EUR 1 080 million."
"France applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after the major part of France was hit by storm Xynthia in February 2010, with the Atlantic coast region, particularly Charente-Maritime and Vendée, being worst affected."
"The storm claimed 53 lives and nearly 80 people were injured."
"For the designated zone, the French authorities estimate the total cost of the direct damage caused by the disaster to be EUR 1 425.43 million."
"After verifying that both applications comply with the eligibility criteria of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal (flooding in Madeira) and EUR 35 635 750 for France (storm Xynthia), resulting in a total amount of EUR 66 891 540."
"As all conditions for the assistance are met, I voted in favour of the report in order to show solidarity with the victims and the states affected."
"I supported the vote of the European Parliament, which today, Tuesday 14 December 2010, approved the release of EUR 35.6 million for France, whose Atlantic coastline was partly devastated by storm Xynthia in February."
"This money will be used to finance the rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by the disaster."
"As MEP for the worst affected regions, I welcome the allocation of these funds to repair the damage caused by the storm: it comes as a real relief to all the French départements affected."
"This mobilisation proves that solidarity is not a hollow word where the European Union is concerned."
"To conclude, I wish to point out that storm Xynthia in February 2010 affected a large part of France, with the départements of Charente-Maritime and Vendée being the worst hit, leaving 53 people dead and 80 injured."
"The material damage was estimated at EUR 1 425.43 million."
"A total of EUR 35.6 million has been released from the EU Solidarity Fund to repair this damage."
"According to the Böge report, EUR 66.9 million have been made available to combat the effects of severe natural disasters in France and Portugal."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree that, in respect of the general budget of the European Union for the 2010 financial year, the European Union Solidarity Fund should be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 66 891 540 in commitment and payment appropriations in order to address the applications made by:"
"Portugal to mobilise the fund in response to a disaster caused by landslides and flooding on Madeira Island; and"
"France to mobilise the fund with regard to a disaster caused by storm Xynthia."
"I warmly welcome the adoption of this report providing for the allocation of EUR 31 255 790 to Portugal to address the terrible damage caused by the disaster that struck the island of Madeira in February 2010."
"In this respect, I should point out the major commitment shown by the Portuguese delegation from the Partido Social Democrata, particularly the work done by Mr Teixeira, which proved decisive in obtaining this result."
"in writing. - The Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Portugal and France under point 26 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA)."
"The IIA allows the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion."
"In 2010, so far, only one proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund has been submitted by the Commission, a proposal of 24 September 2010 to mobilise EUR 13.02 million following severe flooding in Ireland in November 2009."
"This proposal and the corresponding draft amending budget (DAB No 8/2010) are still in the process of being adopted by the two arms of the budgetary authority."
"In parallel to the proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in favour of Portugal and France, the Commission has presented a draft amending budget (DAB No 9/2010 of 13 October 2010) in order to enter the corresponding commitment and payment appropriations in the 2010 budget as provided in point 26 of the IIA."
"The Solidarity Fund was set up with the aim of demonstrating the European Union's solidarity with the people of regions affected by natural disasters."
"In February this year, the region of Madeira, where I come from, was struck by a disaster caused by landslides and flooding."
"Following this tragedy, Portugal submitted an application to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in order to address the damage, particularly by repairing infrastructure and rebuilding the affected areas."
"The French authorities also submitted an application to mobilise the fund following storm Xynthia."
"The total damage caused by both disasters has been assessed at EUR 66 891 540, and this amount will soon be mobilised once the amending budget has been changed as required to make it available."
"The effects of February's disaster made themselves felt straight away, and extensive and severe damage was caused to public and private infrastructure, businesses and crops."
"However, even though the effects of the tragedy that devastated the region were so severe, European help was not immediately forthcoming."
"Ten months have now passed."
"Since I endorse the need to make the whole procedure less tardy, I am voting for the fund to be mobilised for the affected regions and appeal for it to be done as quickly as possible."
"The adoption today in plenary of a budgetary amendment to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 35.6 million following a proposal by the Commission is good news."
"This is in response to the request made by the French Government following storm Xynthia, which hit the French coast on 27 and 28 February 2010, leaving 53 people dead and 80 injured in Vendée and Charente-Maritime."
"The procedure is undoubtedly long and in need of improvement, but I am pleased to see European solidarity being shown in this way, in the face of the tragedy the victims have experienced."
"I had written to Commissioner Hahn to support the French Government's request for aid, and he has honoured the commitment he made to me during his visit to La Rochelle in early March."
"This fund is more than much-needed financial assistance; it symbolises the common values shared by our continent."
"In view of the opinion by the Committee on Regional Development and the proposal to reduce payment appropriations from the line 'Energy projects to aid economic recovery - European offshore wind grid system' so as to aid the countries (Portugal and France) affected by major natural disasters through the Solidarity Fund, and also bearing in mind the fact that this decision sets out the basic criteria for the operation of the Solidarity Fund, I agree with this report."
"We all remember storm Xynthia, which devastated the Vendée coast nearly a year ago."
"Since then, where water had destroyed everything, reconstruction has had to take place."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund is the ideal instrument for supporting local efforts."
"By voting for this text, I have helped to release EUR 35 635 750, earmarked not for compensation of damage suffered by private individuals, but for infrastructure rehabilitation."
"Created following the 2002 floods in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and France, the Solidarity Fund is meant to assist European regions affected by unforeseeable disasters."
"This text also allocates an equivalent amount to the areas affected by recent flooding in Portugal."
"I, of course, welcome the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund to aid the victims of the tragedy that struck Madeira following abnormal rainfall."
"I congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Teixeira, on his able and continual efforts to raise awareness in the European institutions and to establish a basis for the necessary support."
"I reiterate my strong belief that the procedures need to be simplified so that the Solidarity Fund can be mobilised more swiftly in future."
"Emergency aid that arrives too late tarnishes the Union's efficient image and undermines the feeling of European solidarity."
"The sole purpose of Draft amending budget No 9/2010 is to formally enter the budgetary adjustment arising from the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund into the 2010 budget."
"I have already voted in favour of a parallel draft report recommending that mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund be approved for Portugal (Madeira flooding) and France (storm Xynthia), and so it is out of the same sense of responsibility that I am voting in favour of this report on the amending budget to mobilise EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal and EUR 35 635 750 for France, making a total of EUR 66 891 540 to be deducted from the fund's ceiling."
"Despite the importance of investment projects for energy infrastructure, and most especially wind energy, I am voting in favour of reducing the payment appropriations from budget line 06 04 14 03 so that the funds can be reallocated to the EUR 66 891 540 in payment appropriations (line 13 06 01) required to cover needs relating to the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund."
"As we vote on this draft amending budget, which will allow for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in favour of the people of Madeira and the regions of France affected by the storm Xynthia - which, of course, we supported - it is important to highlight a few points here, in addition to the delay in mobilising the fund, which we mentioned previously."
"The Commission believes that the eligibility criteria for mobilisation have been met, particularly, in Madeira's case, as regards the threshold for damage."
"It should be noted, however, that the Union support now made available will only cover 2.89% of the total damage caused by the disaster."
"Madeira is an outermost region and, hence, has to bear the resulting constraints."
"It is also pursuing convergence objectives (despite the damaging changes in this field since the last enlargement)."
"These particular characteristics ought, therefore, to be taken into account by increasing support for the region, either from this fund or through other measures."
"Consequently, when the rules of the fund were being discussed, we proposed considering the idea of increasing financial assistance to cohesion countries and convergence regions by introducing an indispensable cohesion dimension into this question of providing support for damage caused by natural disasters."
"That would also reduce the disparities between the various regions and Member States in the European Union."
"At a time when we are facing ever more frequent natural disasters in Europe, the European Union must be able to provide appropriate aid to its Member States when one of them is hit by a disaster of this kind. Consequently, following storm Xynthia in March, which hit the coastal areas of Charente-Maritime and Vendée, and the floods that affected the island of Madeira in Portugal in February, it was only natural that I should approve the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund in order to compensate for the damage caused by these disasters."
"To my mind, this vote illustrates the solidarity that exists between the nations of Europe, and which should exist in many other areas too, for that matter."
"When faced with a natural disaster - and we are facing ever more disasters of this type - it is imperative that the European Union provide aid to Member States and regions which are grappling with the lasting effects of such tragedies."
"The EU Solidarity Fund was established to precisely this end."
"The fund makes it possible to grant financial assistance to victims in areas affected by 'major natural disasters', such as the Portuguese island of Madeira which was destroyed by floods, or the French regions devastated by storm Xynthia."
"With the memory of this year's floods in Poland and other parts of Europe still fresh in my mind, I concur with the proposal to grant support to the countries that have suffered, in solidarity with the thousands of citizens of regions affected by such devastating cataclysms."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which approves the transfer of 66 million euro from the European offshore wind grid system to the EU Solidarity Fund in order to help the victims of flooding in Portugal and storms in France."
"This draft amending budget makes sense, considering the purpose of the funds mobilised through the Solidarity Fund to address the effects of the landslides and severe flooding that took place on the island of Madeira, Portugal, and the effects of storm Xynthia in France."
"After verifying that both applications meet the eligibility criteria of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal (flooding in Madeira) and EUR 35 635 750 for France (storm Xynthia), resulting in a total amount of EUR 66 891 540 to be deducted from the ceiling of EUR 1 billion in commitment and payment appropriations."
"I would, however, like to highlight the delay in mobilising this type of support."
"The procedure needs to be made less bureaucratic and more streamlined in order to respond to future disaster situations in a timely manner."
"An increase in the budget in times of financial and economic crisis should, in principle, be rejected."
"In this case, however, it is a matter of an adjustment on account of storm damage in France and Portugal caused by storm Xynthia."
"Mutual aid and assistance in the event of natural disasters is a true sign of active European solidarity and is therefore to be welcomed and supported."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report."
"According to the report, it must be ensured that the funds made available for Portugal and France are used to help in the rebuilding of infrastructure in both countries, and they are to be used as a 'tool of refinancing'."
"I therefore voted in favour of it."
"The people affected must be helped and their living conditions and the economic stability of the region must be improved."
"I fully support the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in response to the natural disasters in France and Portugal."
"I regard the Solidarity Fund as one of the most important ways to build European identity and a sense of community between EU citizens."
"In 2010, Poland was one of the countries to benefit from the Solidarity Fund, and this met with a positive response from the media."
"I would like to highlight the need to raise public awareness of the Solidarity Fund and the effects of its use."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree that, in respect of the general budget of the European Union for the 2010 financial year, the European Union Solidarity Fund should be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 66 891 540 in commitment and payment appropriations in order to address the applications made by:"
"Portugal to mobilise the fund in response to a disaster caused by landslides and flooding on Madeira Island; and"
"France to mobilise the fund with regard to a disaster caused by storm Xynthia."
"I welcome this draft amending budget making it possible to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide a total of EUR 66 891 540 in commitment and payment appropriations, EUR 31 255 790 of which is to address the request for assistance submitted by Portugal following the considerable damage caused by the storm that struck the Autonomous Region of Madeira in February 2010."
"in writing. - According to Article 37(1) of the Financial Regulation, the Commission may present draft amending budgets if there are 'unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances'."
"On this aspect, and regarding the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Portugal and France on the basis of point 26 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA)."
"The IIA allows the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion."
"The conditions for eligibility to the fund are detailed here as well as in Council Regulation No 2012/2002 establishing the EUSF."
"It is important to note that the objective of the fund is not to compensate private damage but to repair infrastructure and is a tool for refinancing."
"In 2010, so far, only one proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund has been submitted by the Commission, a proposal of 24 September 2010 to mobilise EUR 13.02 million following severe flooding in Ireland in November 2009."
"The aim of this European Parliament document is to approve the Council's position on Draft amending budget No 9/2010 with a view to implementing the changes needed for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund."
"The disasters that occurred in Madeira and France were considered by the Commission to be a 'major natural disaster' and an 'extraordinary regional disaster', respectively, and both applications by the national authorities for mobilisation of the fund were accepted."
"According to the Financial Regulation, the Commission may present draft amending budgets 'if there are unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances'."
"In this case, the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund to provide EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal and EUR 35 635 750 for France, making a total of EUR 66 891 540."
"Today, in the name of European solidarity, we are approving the redeployment of this amount in payment appropriations from budget line 06 04 14 03: Energy projects to aid economic recovery - European offshore wind grid system, for the repair of infrastructure and reconstruction of the areas affected by the disasters."
"I welcome the measure that has been adopted, although I regret the slowness of the whole procedure for mobilising the fund, given the extent of the tragedy that devastated the region that I come from, the Autonomous Region of Madeira."
"On the basis of the report by my excellent Italian colleague, Barbara Matera, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of EUR 2.2 million in aid to Slovenia, which is facing redundancies in the textile industry."
"The plant in question is Mura, European Fashion Design, which has laid off 2 554 workers."
"I find it strange that 583, or 22.8%, of the 2 554 workers made redundant in total have a long-standing health problem or disability."
"I am not sure they fulfil EGF criteria."
"It should be noted that 1 114 of the 2 554 dismissed workers 'have not concluded primary school education'."
"It is legitimate to question the educational level of those recruited and their suitability with respect to current industrial standards."
"I question the independence of the civil servants at the Slovenian Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs who have to assume the role of certification authority for supervising this expenditure."
"Like the proposals she tabled in the last plenary session, Mrs Matera's resolutions advocating the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in six specific cases are entirely justified."
"This fund will provide assistance to employees suffering from the harmful effects of globalisation in Slovenia, Germany, Poland and Spain."
"I have always felt that using this fund was effective, because it produces concrete results and meets specific and perfectly identifiable needs."
"As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I simply had to vote in favour of adopting these resolutions."
"Given that Slovenia has requested assistance for 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company operating in the wearing apparel sector, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that the Commission's proposal, in its explanatory statement, should include clear and detailed information on the application, analysing the eligibility criteria and explaining the reasons that led to its approval, in accordance with the requests made by Parliament."
"Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation should be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In light of structural changes in international trade, it is important that the European economy is able to quickly implement assistance policies for workers affected by such changes whilst also giving them the skills required to return swiftly to the labour market."
"Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities normally incumbent upon companies, nor is it intended for the financing and restructuring of companies."
"Given that Slovenia has requested assistance in respect of 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company that operates in the wearing apparel sector in the NUTS III region of Pomurje, and that 7% of all people employed in the region of Pomurje were working for Mura and incomes in this region were already below the Slovenian average, I am voting overall in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Slovenia."
"The number of times in recent months that this House has approved the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which was set up to provide additional support for workers suffering from the consequences of major changes in the structure of world trade, is, in my view, highly indicative of the crisis that Europe is going through."
"The EGF is not the answer to this crisis, but it is a considerable, significant help."
"In this specific case, the aid is intended to address the consequences of 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company in Slovenia that operates in the wearing apparel sector."
"This sector has been particularly badly affected by changes in the structure of world trade and is the victim of cheap textile imports."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European citizens and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, and, at the same time, developing a new, skilled workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"It is in this context that this intervention plan for Slovenia is being put forward, in relation to 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company operating in the wearing apparel sector."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects to implement measures to speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"Applications to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are being submitted month after month."
"Thus, there are now eight more applications from four Member States: Slovenia, Germany, Poland and Spain."
"Several hundred more companies are shutting down in various industries, from car manufacturing to the textile sector via the retail trade."
"In all, over 6 500 workers (6 592 to be precise) have been made redundant."
"That makes almost 10 000, if we also add in the ones discussed here a month ago."
"As we approve this mobilisation, I cannot avoid reiterating that what is needed is a clear break with the neoliberal policies that are causing the obvious economic and social disaster to be seen in the countries of the European Union."
"Palliative measures are indeed necessary, but it is the causes of the disaster that have to be addressed."
"It has become increasingly urgent to implement the proposal that we made during the debate on the 2011 budget, to create a European programme for employment and sustainable development, to which 1% of EU gross domestic product would be allocated, supplemented with funds from the Member States."
"The aim of this would be real convergence, promotion of each country's potential, the sustainable use of its resources, investment in production and the creation of jobs with rights."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Slovenia because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 2 554 redundancies in Mura, European Fashion Design, an enterprise which operates in the wearing apparel sector, amounting to a total of EUR 2 247 940 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I welcome the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Fund to help the 2 554 workers made redundant in the Mura, European Fashion Design, enterprise in Slovenia."
"I hope the EUR 2.2 million will help the workers and the region recover quickly from the structural changes they are facing."
"I am abstaining out of consideration for the Slovenian workers of the Mura Group, who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation."
"In the situation into which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could be inclined to vote against, given the pitiful amount of this handout."
"However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain."
"This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable."
"It endorses a rationale that has led the investment funds that own this Group and the banks that invest in them to make profits at their expense."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of the company relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of the lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of company relocations, and it is fundamental in facilitating their access to new employment."
"The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Slovenia, which has applied for assistance for 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company operating in the wearing apparel sector."
"I voted in favour, as I have done on previous occasions relating to mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"We must support people who have lost their jobs and give them the opportunity of applying their potential in different areas."
"It is a real shame that, despite the fact that I made a personal approach to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Latvia, pointing out to him the opportunity of drawing on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, Latvia has nevertheless not made use of this opportunity, even though 15% of Latvia's population is unemployed."
"It appears that a signal needs to be sent to the leadership of the European Commission about the inaction of the powers that be in the Republic of Latvia."
"More than 100 000 people from Latvia have already left their native country."
"It seems that the fate of these people is of no concern to the government of the Republic of Latvia."
"The Slovenian clothing company Mura, European Fashion Design, had to make 2 554 workers redundant between 21 October 2009 and 20 February 2010 as a result of the economic and financial crisis."
"Slovenia is therefore applying for EUR 2 247 940 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to be able to take measures for the rapid reintegration into the labour market of the workers affected."
"I have voted in favour of the report, because mobilisation of the funding is fully justified."
"According to the report by Mrs Matera, we need to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers in Slovenia who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"I think this is a positive thing to do and have therefore voted in favour of it."
"Given that Slovenia has requested assistance for 2 554 cases of redundancy at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company operating in the wearing apparel sector, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that:"
"the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;"
"the operation and added value of the EGF should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to establish an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund resources, following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created as a separate, specific instrument with its own aims and deadlines, and that suitable budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified."
"The request presented by Slovenia for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for 2 554 redundancies at Mura, European Fashion Design, a company operating in the wearing apparel sector, in the period from 21 October 2009 to 20 February 2010, fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily expanded to cover its intervention in situations like this in which there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State' as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will help these workers successfully rejoin the labour market."
"Given that Germany has requested assistance for 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that it should be ensured that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors."
"Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation should be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In light of structural changes in international trade, it is important that the European economy is able to quickly implement assistance policies for workers affected by such changes whilst also giving them the skills required to return swiftly to the labour market."
"Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities normally incumbent upon companies, nor is it intended for the financing and restructuring of companies."
"Given that Germany has requested assistance for 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector, I am voting overall in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Germany."
"Today, we are approving a package of EUR 8 308 555 in aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in favour of Germany, in order to address the consequences of 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector."
"As I have always pointed out, although such assistance is extremely important in dealing with the current symptoms, it is not a final solution to the problems affecting European industries, which lie not only in the economic crisis that we are experiencing, but also in the need for Europe to adapt to a changing world, one in which it is essential to be competitive."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European citizens and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, and, at the same time, developing a new, skilled workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"It is in this context that this intervention plan for Germany is being put forward, in relation to 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects to implement measures to speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"Today's decision will result in the workers from the enterprise Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG in Baden-Württemberg who are threatened with redundancy receiving around EUR 8 million in assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"These funds are to be used to assist these workers in finding new jobs as quickly as possible."
"It is important to me that these people receive these funds quickly and without significant bureaucratic frictional losses."
"The assistance is needed now and not in six months' or a year's time."
"The European Union and the Member States must also endeavour to do more than simply counter the negative consequences of globalisation."
"Globalisation is a process the progress of which we can, and indeed must, control."
"My abstention from this vote is not only due to the sceptical attitude of the German Free Democratic Party to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, but is also based on a possible conflict of interests as a shareholder in Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Germany because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 1 181 redundancies at four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG in Baden-Württemberg, an enterprise which operates in the manufacturing of printing machinery sector, amounting to a sum of EUR 8 308 555 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - The European Globalisation Fund was created in order to provide assistance for workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"The 1 181 redundancies at four production sites of the enterprise Druckmaschinen AG in Baden Württemberg (manufacturing of printing machinery sector) fall exactly into this category and I therefore supported the mobilisation of EUR 8 308 555 to assist them."
"I am abstaining out of consideration for the German workers of the Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Group, who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation."
"In the situation into which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could be inclined to vote against, given the pitiful amount of this handout."
"However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain."
"This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable."
"It endorses the rationale that has led this Group, a world leader in the manufacture of printing machines, to relocate with the aim of increasing its profits."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of the company relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of the lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of company relocations, and it is fundamental in facilitating their access to new employment."
"The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Germany, which has requested assistance for 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector."
"The effects of the economic crisis are still being felt throughout Europe."
"In Germany, too, some enterprises are still struggling to survive and are making numerous people redundant."
"Between 26 January 2010 and 26 May 2010, the printing machinery manufacturer Druckmaschinen AG, based in Heidelberg, had to make 1 181 workers redundant as a result of the crisis."
"The Federal Republic of Germany has therefore applied for EUR 8 308 555 in assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as all of the stipulated criteria for mobilisation of the funds are met."
"I support the mobilisation of the fund in connection with this application because this measure can provide additional support to workers who are suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"I therefore voted in favour of it."
"Given that Germany has requested assistance for 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that:"
"the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;"
"the operation and added value of the EGF should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to establish an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund resources, following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created as a separate, specific instrument with its own aims and deadlines, and that suitable budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified."
"The request presented by Germany for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden-Württemberg, a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector, in the period between 26 January and 26 May 2010, fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily expanded to cover its intervention in situations like this in which there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State' as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will help these workers successfully rejoin the labour market."
"Apart from the application from the enterprise Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, I have, without reservations, voted in favour of all of the applications for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund that have been voted on today, as I support the general idea of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and, in particular, the direct support given to the people who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation."
"However, with regard to the aforementioned enterprise, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, I abstained from the vote."
"In this case, I have definite reservations."
"It is well-known that Heidelberger Druckmaschinen is a jewel of the German mechanical engineering sector."
"The company made excellent profits for many years."
"Then, admittedly, came two or three financially difficult years."
"Heidelberger Druckmaschinen reacted with the reflex typical of large companies: it reduced staff numbers in the area where wages were high, in other words, in Germany, and, at the same time, invested and increased the number of staff in China, where wages were low."
"If, during such a process, an application is made for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, this represents a negative example of how a socially meaningful and very responsible EU measure is exploited by international companies to wheedle out of their social responsibility."
"On the basis of the report by my Italian colleague, Barbara Matera, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of EUR 0.6 million in aid to Poland, which is facing redundancies in the automotive sector."
"Five hundred and ninety workers have been made redundant from two companies within the automotive industry."
"I support the fact that this aid is being managed and controlled by the bodies responsible for the European Social Fund (ESF) in Poland, thereby limiting monitoring costs to a mere EUR 2 000."
"Like Mrs Matera, I congratulate the Commission on the fact that, in the context of mobilising the EGF, it has proposed an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused ESF funds."
"Nonetheless, I regret the fact that, in order to mobilise the EGF in favour of this case, payment appropriations have been taken from a budget heading designed to support SMEs and innovation."
"We must deplore the Commission's shortcomings in implementing competitiveness and innovation programmes, especially during an economic crisis that is likely to significantly increase the need for assistance."
"Given that Poland has submitted a request for assistance for 590 redundancies at two companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers) in the NUTS II region of Wielkopolskie, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree with the Commission's proposal, in relation to the mobilisation of the EGF, to establish an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund resources, following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created as a separate, specific instrument with its own aims and deadlines, and that suitable budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified."
"Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation should be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In view of the structural changes in world trade, it is vital that the European economy is able to promptly deploy the instruments designed to support workers affected in this way, and to provide them with new skills so that they can be quickly reintegrated into the labour market."
"Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities normally incumbent upon companies, nor is it intended for the financing and restructuring of companies."
"Given that Poland has submitted a request for assistance for 590 redundancies at two companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers) in the region of Wielkopolskie, I am voting in favour of this report or, in other words, in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Poland."
"The financial and economic crisis that we are going through, combined with the constant shifts in the labour market caused by changes to the structure of world trade, has resulted in countless victims of unemployment, which, in many cases, is long term."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was created to respond to situations like these."
"In this particular case, we are talking about the mobilisation of in excess of EUR 600 000 in favour of Poland to support 613 redundancies at two companies in the motor vehicle manufacturing sector between 1 March 2009 and 30 November 2009."
"As the Commission has assessed this application and considers it to be suitable and to meet the set requirements, and as it recommends that the request be approved, I voted in favour."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European citizens and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, and, at the same time, developing a new, skilled workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"It is in this context that this intervention plan for Poland is being put forward, in relation to 590 redundancies at two companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers) in the NUTS II region of Wielkopolskie."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects to implement measures to speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Poland because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"The request for assistance concerned 1 104 redundancies (of which 590 have been targeted for assistance) made redundant by two companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers), amounting to a sum of EUR 633 077 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - The Commission has proposed granting EUR 633 077 from the European Globalisation Fund to help 1 104 workers made redundant in Poland in two enterprises involved in the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers."
"I voted for this proposal."
"I am abstaining out of consideration for the workers of the Polish car industry, who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation."
"In the situation into which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could be inclined to vote against, given the pitiful amount of this handout."
"However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain."
"This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable."
"It endorses the rationale that leads companies such as SEWS and Leoni Atokabel to shamelessly relocate in order to increase their profits."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of the company relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of the lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of company relocations, and it is fundamental in facilitating their access to new employment."
"The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Poland, which has applied for assistance for 590 redundancies at two companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers) in the NUTS II region of Wielkopolskie."
"In order to be able to prevent a significant increase in the level of unemployment as a result of the financial and economic crisis, the EU Member States need funds to be able to implement effective political measures quickly."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund makes available an annual amount of EUR 500 billion for this purpose."
"If more than 500 workers from one or more enterprises are made redundant during a specific period, an application may be made for mobilisation of funds."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as assistance amounting to EUR 633 077 for 1 104 redundant Polish workers from enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 is fully justified."
"I voted in favour of the report because it concerns targeted measures to help workers suffering as a result of the economic crisis and its consequences."
"Given that Poland has submitted a request for assistance for 590 redundancies at two companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 (manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers) in the NUTS II region of Wielkopolskie, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that:"
"the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;"
"the operation and added value of the EGF should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to establish an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund resources, following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created as a separate, specific instrument with its own aims and deadlines, and that suitable budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified."

"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will help these workers successfully rejoin the labour market."
"I voted in favour of the aid to Aragón."
"This autonomous community has a population density of less than the EU average (112 inhabitants per square kilometre); its traditional economy is growing cereals and rearing sheep; its retail trade has suffered 1 154 redundancies from 593 businesses in a nine-month period; 56% of people in its service sector were unemployed in February 2010, 73% of whom were women; 73.9% of workers made redundant were sales assistants in shops and markets; 14.4% were doing unskilled jobs."
"It is regrettable that measures began to be adopted too late, 11 months after the first redundancies."
"It would be interesting to analyse the results of the temporary and extraordinary assistance measures for those made redundant which will be adopted for their reintegration into the labour market."
"It must, however, remain clear that these actions must not substitute those that the businesses are obliged to adopt under national legislation or collective agreements."
"Given that Spain has submitted a request for assistance for 1 154 redundancies at 593 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 47 (retail trade, except for motor vehicles and motorcycles) in the NUTS II region of Aragón, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that the functioning and added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006, within the framework of the 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework mid-term review process."

"Given that Spain has submitted a request for assistance for 1 154 redundancies at 593 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 47 (retail trade, except for motor vehicles and motorcycles) in the region of Aragón, I am voting overall in favour of this report or, in other words, in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Spain."
"The financial and economic crisis that we are going through, combined with the constant shifts in the labour market caused by changes to the structure of world trade, has resulted in countless victims of unemployment, which, in many cases, is long term."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was created to respond to situations like these."
"In this particular case, we are talking about the mobilisation of in excess of EUR 1.5 million in favour of Spain to support 1 154 redundancies at 593 companies in the retail trade between 1 June 2009 and 28 February 2010."
"As the Commission has assessed this application and considers it to be suitable and to meet the set requirements, and as it recommends that the request be approved, I voted in favour."

"Lastly, I must emphasise the importance of the EGF, which has proved to be a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - The extent of the global downturn is revealed in this application from Spain to mobilise EUR 1 560 000 from the European Globalisation Fund to help 1 154 people made redundant in 593 different retail enterprises over a nine month period."
"I supported this request."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of the company relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of the lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers' rights."

"There have been 1 154 redundancies affecting 593 Spanish enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 47 in the NUTS II region of Aragón."
"The financial and economic crisis has resulted in a drastic downturn in sales in the retail sector."
"This situation has serious consequences, particularly for the region of Aragón, which has a lower population density than the EU average."
"Further emigration from this region, which, prior to the crisis, was experiencing a slight upturn, is to be feared."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as immediate action must be taken to respond to increased levels of unemployment, particularly in small regions with struggling economies."
"in writing. - (DE) Since this is a matter of additional support for workers made redundant as a result of the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis so as to provide them with additional funds for their reintegration into the labour market, I have voted in favour."
"Given that Spain has submitted a request for assistance for 1 154 redundancies at 593 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 47 (retail trade, except for motor vehicles and motorcycles) in the NUTS II region of Aragón, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."

"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will help these workers successfully rejoin the labour market."
"I voted in favour of European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid for Valencia because, as a result of the structural changes in world trade and the financial crisis, there were 544 unexpected redundancies from 143 businesses between 13 April 2009 and 12 January 2010 in the Valencian textile industry, which have had a serious impact at local level."
"Out of those dismissed, 61.7% are men, 22% are over the age of 55, 79.9% only have a basic education and four are disabled."
"I believe that the training that they will be given during the 14 months of paid part-time work experience will improve their professional qualifications so that they can enter the labour market."
"As in the previous case, it is regrettable that the measures were applied too late, one year and two months after the first redundancies."
"Given that Spain has submitted a request for assistance for 350 redundancies at 143 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 13 (manufacture of textiles) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that the Commission's proposal, in its explanatory statement, should include clear and detailed information on the application, analysing the eligibility criteria and explaining the reasons that led to its approval, in accordance with the requests made by Parliament."
"Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation should be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."

"In this particular case, we are talking about the mobilisation of in excess of EUR 2 million in favour of Spain to support 544 redundancies at 143 companies in the textile sector between 13 April 2009 and 12 January 2010."
"As the Commission has assessed this application and considers it to be suitable and to meet the set requirements, and as it recommends that the request be approved, I voted in favour."

"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - The textile industry is currently facing a challenging time all over Europe."
"The Commission proposes mobilising EUR 1 422 850 in response to 528 redundancies in 33 enterprises in the sector in Spain."
"I voted in favour."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of the company relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of the lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers' rights."

"Between 13 April 2009 and 12 January 2010, 544 Spanish workers were made redundant from 143 enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 13 (manufacturing of textiles)."
"In order to be able to provide 350 of them with assistance, Spain has applied for the mobilisation of EUR 2 059 466 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as all the criteria for the mobilisation of the fund have been met in full."
"Since the proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises specialising mainly in the manufacture of furniture, shoes, textiles, ceramics and toys in Comunidad Valenciana is very high and the service sector represents 60% of total employment in this region, this sector has been particularly badly affected by the high number of redundancies in the last two years."
"This has a high impact at local level."
"It is therefore particularly important for us to strengthen and continue to support the textile industry."
"I therefore voted in favour of this application."
"Given that Spain has submitted a request for assistance for 350 redundancies at 143 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 13 (manufacture of textiles) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."

"I welcome the Commission's proposal to establish an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund resources, following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created as a separate, specific instrument with its own aims and deadlines, and that suitable budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified."
"The request submitted by Spain for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) concerns 544 redundancies (350 of which are eligible to receive support) at 143 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 13 (manufacture of textiles) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana."
"According to the Commission's assessment, this application fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily expanded to cover its intervention in situations like this in which there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level' as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will help these workers successfully rejoin the labour market."
"I voted in favour of this initiative so that 330 people out of the 528 who were made redundant over a period of nine months from 66 companies in Valencia in the natural-stone processing sector can receive additional aid in order to make it possible for them to re-enter the labour market."
"Of those dismissed, 62% are over the age of 45, three are disabled, 51% do not have any training and 34.4% only have a basic education."
"This community has already received other aid due to job losses in the manufacturing sector."
"Therefore, other measures urgently need to be adopted."
"The mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund can only form part of those measures."
"To conclude, I must once again regret the fact that the Spanish State applied measures too late: one year and three months after the redundancies, when these types of measures have to be applied immediately and urgently."
"Given that Spain has submitted a request for assistance for 300 redundancies at 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that the functioning and added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006, as part of the 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework mid-term review."
"Assistance to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation must be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In the light of structural changes to international trade, it is important for the European economy to quickly implement instruments to aid workers affected by such changes, whilst also giving them the skills required for their swift reintegration into the labour market."
"On this basis, financial assistance should be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for companies' normal responsibilities, nor is it intended to finance companies or lead to their restructuring."
"Given that Spain has requested assistance for 300 individuals who have lost their jobs at 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products) in the region of Comunidad Valenciana, overall, I am voting in favour of this report or, put another way, in favour of mobilising the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support Spain."
"We are today approving the mobilisation of an aid package totalling EUR 1 422 850 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in favour of Spain, a country that has been badly affected by the global economic crisis and, in particular, has seen unemployment rise above the European average."
"In this specific case, the aid concerns 528 redundancies at 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products)."
"I hope the Spanish economy will be able to respond adequately to the crisis, as the mobilisation of this aid is only part of that response."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, supplying new qualified resources to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"It is in such a context that this intervention plan for Spain has been designed, a plan implemented regarding 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana."
"I hope, therefore, that the European institutions will consolidate efforts to implement measures designed to accelerate and improve the level of utilisation of a resource of such importance as the EGF which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Spain because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 528 redundancies (of which 300 have been targeted for assistance from the fund) in 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of non-metallic mineral products), amounting to a sum of EUR 1 422 850 financed by the EGF."
"in writing. - This application refers to the mobilisation of a global amount of EUR 1 422 850 from the EGF for Spain."
"It concerns 528 redundancies in 66 enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23, namely 'Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products', during the nine-month reference period from 31 March to 30 December 2009."
"The Commission's assessment was based on: the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis; the unforeseen nature of the redundancies concerned; demonstration of the number of redundancies and compliance with the criteria of Article 2(a); the explanation of the unforeseen nature of those redundancies; the identification of dismissing enterprises and workers targeted for assistance, the territory concerned and its authorities and stakeholders; the impact of the redundancies as regards local, regional or national employment; the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded, including its compatibility with actions funded by the Structural Funds; dates on which the personalised services to affected workers were started or planned to start; procedures for consulting the social partners, management and control systems."
"In accordance with the Commission's assessment, the application fulfils the eligibility criteria set up by the EGF Regulation and I therefore support it."
"I am abstaining out of consideration for the Spanish workers of companies such as Levantina who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation."
"In the situation into which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could be inclined to vote against, given the pitiful amount of this handout."
"However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain."
"This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable."
"It endorses the rationale that has enabled the Charterhouse and Impala Funds to increase their capital at the expense of the Levantina workers in Comunidad Valenciana."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of this."
"This aid is essential in helping the unemployed and victims of the relocations occurring in an era of globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries which respect workers' rights."
"The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of companies relocating and is crucial in facilitating access to new jobs."
"The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is proper to provide aid to Spain which has presented a request for assistance relating to the 300 individuals who have lost their jobs in 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana."
"EUR 500 million is the annual ceiling for the funds that can be mobilised through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"As there were a total of 528 redundancies in 66 enterprises in Spain between 31 March 2009 and 30 December 2009, the mobilisation of funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund amounting to EUR 1 422 850 is not in the least surprising."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as the full utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is extremely welcome."
"I support this application, which seeks to cushion the effects of the numerous redundancies in this sector and to assist the reintegration into the labour market of workers who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"Given that Spain has requested assistance in respect of 300 redundancies at 66 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree that:"
"the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;"
"the operation and added value of the EGF should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006."
"I welcome the European Commission's proposal to establish a source of funds other than unused European Social Fund resources, in response to the repeated statements by the European Parliament that it is necessary to identify appropriate budgetary mechanisms for the transfer of funds, given that the EGF was set up to be a specific and separate instrument with its own aims and funding periods."
"The request submitted by Spain to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 300 of the 528 redundancies at 66 companies operating in NACE 2 Division 23 (manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products) in the NUTS II region of Comunidad Valenciana fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened: intervention was envisaged in situations like this where, as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful reintegration of these workers into the labour market."
"The crisis has led to a 28% decline in vehicle registrations."
"In Terres de l'Ebre (Catalonia), employment in the service sector is at 60%."
"The closure of Lear Automotive led to a 4% increase in unemployment in the area, which, in 2009, stood at 22.7%."
"This aid aims to provide a package of personalised services similar to other aid granted in the same region and to the same sector, in another case that covered 1 429 of the 2 330 people made redundant."
"This case will apply to 508 of the 515 redundancies recorded over a period of four months in 2010 due to the closure of Lear Automotive."
"I voted in favour of this initiative so that its application will enable those affected to re-enter the labour market and it will help to reduce unemployment."
"Given that Spain has applied for assistance for 508 redundancies at Lear Automotive (EEDS) Spain, S.L. Sociedad Unipersonal, a company that operates in the automotive sector, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal as amended by Parliament."
"I also agree that the Commission's proposal, in its explanatory statement, should include clear and detailed information on the application, analysing the eligibility criteria and explaining the reasons that led to its approval, in accordance with the requests made by Parliament."
"Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation should be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In view of the structural changes in world trade, it is vital that the European economy is able to promptly deploy the instruments designed to support workers affected in this way, and to provide them with new skills so that they can be quickly reintegrated into the labour market."
"Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities normally incumbent upon companies, nor is it intended for the financing and restructuring of companies."
"Given that Spain has applied for assistance for 508 redundancies at Lear Automotive (EEDS), a company operating in the automotive sector in the region of Catalonia, I am voting overall in favour of this report or, in other words, in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Spain."
"We are here again today to adopt the mobilisation of a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) assistance package totalling EUR 382 000 to support the Spanish automotive industry."
"In this particular case, the assistance relates to the 515 jobs which have been lost at Lear Automotive (EEDS) Spain, S.L. Sociedad Unipersonal, a company which operates in the automotive sector in Catalonia."
"Before the crisis, the automotive sector was Spain's most important source of exports."
"However, the reduction in demand for such products in the European Union as a result of the crisis promises to threaten yet more job losses, not only in Spain but throughout the Union, and, as a consequence, it is important that utilisation of the EGF can effectively assist a sector which is so important to the European economy."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, supplying new qualified resources to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"It is in such a context that this intervention plan for Spain has been designed, a plan which will assist the 508 individuals who have lost their jobs at Lear Automotive (EEDS) Spain, S.L. Sociedad Unipersonal, a company which operates in the automotive sector."
"I hope, therefore, that the European institutions will consolidate efforts to implement measures designed to accelerate and improve the level of utilisation of a resource of such importance as the EGF which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Spain because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"The report adopted today concerned a request for assistance for 515 redundancies (of which 508 have been targeted for assistance from the fund) in Lear Automotive (EEDS) Spain, an enterprise which operates in the automotive sector in Catalonia, amounting to a total of EUR 382 200 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - The economic downturn in the automotive sector has led to 515 redundancies in the enterprise Lear Automotive (Spain)."
"I support the proposal to mobilise EUR 382 200 from the European Globalisation Fund to assist them."
"I am abstaining out of consideration for the Spanish workers of Lear Automotive, who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation."
"In the situation into which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could be inclined to vote against, given the pitiful amount of this handout."
"However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain."
"This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable."
"It endorses the rationale that has led this US multinational and its main shareholders, Pezna Investment Management and the Californian teachers' pension fund, to relocate without any consideration for those who made them wealthy."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This aid is essential in helping the unemployed and victims of the relocations occurring in an era of globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of companies relocating and is crucial in facilitating access to new jobs."
"The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, so we should now grant this aid to Spain for assistance with respect to 508 redundancies at Lear Automotive (EEDS) Spain, S.L. Sociedad Unipersonal, a company which operates in the automotive sector in Catalonia."
"In order to be able to apply for funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and for the application subsequently to be approved, there are clearly defined criteria that need to be met."
"It is intended to benefit workers who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis by establishing measures that will guarantee their rapid reintegration into the labour market."
"The fund provides an annual amount of EUR 500 million for such cases."
"However, an enterprise must have made at least 500 redundancies - like the Spanish enterprise Lear Automotive, which meets all the criteria - for Spain to be able to apply for funds."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as this is precisely what the funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are for."
"Given that Spain has requested assistance in respect of 508 redundancies at Lear Automotive (EEDS) Spain, S.L. Sociedad Unipersonal, a company which operates in the automotive sector, I voted in favour of the resolution, because I agree with the Commission's proposal and the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree that:"
"the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;"
"the operation and added value of the EGF should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006."
"I welcome the European Commission's proposal to establish a source of funds other than unused European Social Fund resources, in response to the repeated statements by the European Parliament that it is necessary to identify appropriate budgetary mechanisms for the transfer of funds, given that the EGF was set up to be a specific and separate instrument with its own aims and funding periods."
"The request submitted by Spain to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 508 redundancies at Lear Automotive (EEDS) Spain, S.L. Sociedad Unipersonal, a company which operates in the automotive sector, fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened: intervention was envisaged in situations like this where, as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful reintegration of these workers into the labour market."
"Given that Poland has requested assistance in respect of 189 redundancies at H. Cegielski-Poznań and at four of its suppliers, all operating in the marine diesel engine sector, I voted in favour of the resolution, as I agree with the Commission's proposal combined with the respective amendments introduced by Parliament."
"I also agree that we should ensure that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors."
"Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation must be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In the light of structural changes to international trade, it is important for the European economy to quickly implement instruments to aid workers affected by such changes, whilst also giving them the skills required for their swift reintegration into the labour market."
"Given this, financial assistance should be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for companies' normal responsibilities, nor is it intended to finance companies or lead to their restructuring."
"Given that Poland has requested assistance for 189 cases of redundancy at H. Cegielski-Poznań, a producer of diesel motors used in ships and electricity stations and four of its suppliers, overall, I am voting in favour of this report or, put another way, in favour of mobilising the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support Poland."
"We are here today to adopt a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) assistance package of EUR 114 250 for Poland to allow it to address the consequences of the 658 job losses at four productive facilities at H. Cegielski-Poznań, a company involved in the production of maritime diesel motors, and four of its suppliers in the cities and district of Poznań."
"As I have always warned, whilst such assistance is very important in dealing with the present symptoms, it is not a final solution to the problems affecting European industries which relate not only to the economic crisis we are facing but also to the need for Europe to adapt to a changing world, one in which competitiveness is fundamental."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, supplying new qualified resources to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"It is in this context that this intervention plan for Poland has been designed, a plan which relates to the 189 individuals who have lost their jobs at H. Cegielski-Poznań, a firm which produces maritime diesel motors, and four of its suppliers."
"I hope, therefore, that the European institutions will consolidate efforts to implement measures designed to accelerate and improve the level of utilisation of a resource of such importance as the EGF which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"The global economic crisis has given rise to major structural changes in many businesses, resulting in a huge number of people losing their jobs."
"The proposal under examination relates to assistance for a large group of workers laid off in the Polish region of Wielkopolskie."
"A second proposal for financial assistance upon which we are voting today relates to several hundred more lay-offs in the same region."
"There is therefore a huge amount of upheaval on the local market in this region of Poland."
"I am delighted that the European Commission has confirmed that the application meets the conditions required for the granting of financial support."
"As a result, the laid-off workers will be able either to get back their old jobs or find new ones, and the owners of the businesses will make use of the support to mitigate the negative effects of the global crisis and to maintain their place in the market."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Poland."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 658 redundancies (of which 189 have been targeted for assistance) at H. Cegielski-Poznań and four of its suppliers, enterprises which operate in the sector concerned with the manufacture of marine diesel engines in the cities of Poznań and Poviat, amounting to a total of EUR 114 250 financed by the EGF."
"Lastly, I would note that the adoption of today's reports once again shows the importance of the EGF, which is a valuable resource to assist workers in difficulties due to the economic crisis and is also an effective tool for combating unemployment."
"in writing. - I voted for this application for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist 658 redundancies in the enterprise H. Cegielski-Poznań and four of its suppliers, which operate in the manufacture of marine diesel engines in Poznań and the surrounding district."
"The Commission proposed mobilising EUR 114 250 and I support the proposal."
"I am abstaining out of consideration for the workers of the Polish car industry, who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation."
"In the situation into which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could be inclined to vote against, given the pitiful amount of this handout."
"However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain."
"This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable."
"It endorses the rationale which leads to the privatisation of State-owned companies such as Ciegielski-Poznań."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This aid is essential in helping the unemployed and victims of the relocations occurring in an era of globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of companies relocating and is crucial in facilitating access to new jobs."

"In order for States in which workers have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis to be able to provide these workers with practical assistance, the EU has set up the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"The mobilisation of funds is intended to facilitate the reintegration into the labour market of those affected."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as Poland needs to support 658 workers who have been made redundant from the enterprise H. Cegielski-Poznán."
"Given that Poland has requested assistance in respect of 189 redundancies at H. Cegielski-Poznań and at four of its suppliers, all operating in the marine diesel engine sector, I voted in favour of the resolution, as I agree with the Commission's proposal combined with the respective amendments introduced by Parliament."
"I also agree that:"
"the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;"

"The request submitted by Poland to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 189 of the 658 redundancies at H. Cegielski-Poznán, a company which produces marine diesel engines, and four of its suppliers, in the period from 1 September 2009 to 1 January 2010, fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened: intervention was envisaged in situations like this where, as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant within its suppliers or downstream producers'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful reintegration of these workers into the labour market."
"in writing. - With the adoption of this text, the EP has requested the institutions involved to make the necessary efforts to accelerate the mobilisation of the EGF."
"It also recalls the institutions' commitment to ensuring a smooth and rapid procedure for the adoption of decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, providing one-off, time-limited individual support geared to helping workers who have suffered redundancies as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis."
"It emphasises the role that the EGF can play in the reintegration of workers made redundant into the labour market."
"Finally, it stresses that, in accordance with Article 6 of the EGF Regulation, it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and reiterates that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor measures restructuring companies or sectors."
"It is regrettable that this proposal, dating back to 2003, and which aims to provide refugees with long-term resident status after five years of continuous legal residence, has not been implemented in the intervening period."
"With the amendments proposed by the European Parliament in April 2008, which provide for, amongst other measures, the calculation of the five years of residence preceding the application for residence status, and with the lack of unanimity in the Council, this new proposal will directly aid beneficiaries of international protection who have been residing within EU territory for more than five years but still do not have resident status."
"I voted for this report which supports the application of the proposal to both Geneva Convention refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection."
"In its report, the European Parliament supports the European Commission's proposal and takes into account the commitment to protect the interests of beneficiaries of international protection."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that currently, the situation for citizens of third countries who are beneficiaries of international protection is confusing and unclear because the conditions for granting this status are not harmonised."
"According to the Commission's proposal, the conditions and procedure for granting status will become simpler and clearer in the European Union."
"Furthermore, this new directive will enable beneficiaries of international protection who become long-term residents to take up residence in a Member State other than the one in which they were recognised."
"This initiative has been tabled to follow up on the 2007 proposal for a directive on the extension of long-term resident status to refugees and persons under subsidiary protection, which never achieved the unanimity in the Council that was necessary before the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force."
"It aims to give beneficiaries of international protection who have been legally residing in a Member State for a period of five years legal certainty about their right of residence in a Member State, as well as a set of rights comparable to those of EU nationals."
"The compromise reached is of the greatest importance, not only because it allows refugees within the EU to have a high level of protection and legal certainty, but also because the discriminatory treatment of all nationals of countries outside the EU has finally been abolished."
"It is also an important political signal, because the adoption of this first initiative of a series of six pieces of legislation is not only a first step, but also a reflection of the constructive approach guiding the three institutions in the establishment of a Common European Asylum System by 2012."
"I voted in favour of adopting this directive."
"The proposal for a directive amends another directive from 2003 so as to allow beneficiaries of international protection as well (refugees in particular) to be granted the right to be eligible for a long-term residence permit within the EU if the relevant person has already lived legally in the EU for at least five years."
"Once they have this permit, they will enjoy similar rights to the rest of citizens and will be able, for example, to move around and settle in any EU state (apart from the UK, Denmark and Ireland)."
"It is further stipulated that these beneficiaries of international protection may continue to be expelled from the EU, but only under very strict rules, bearing in mind the principle of refoulement and the rights granted primarily under the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This proposal aims to extend the scope of Council Directive 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents and beneficiaries of international protection who have been legally residing in a Member State for a period of more than five years."
"By treating beneficiaries of international protection equally in all Member States, such a measure puts an end to the inequalities which have hitherto existed between Member States and will allow the individuals in question to reside in a Member State other than the one in which they gained legal recognition, something which did not happen previously."
"These measures are important precisely because we are building a common area of freedom and security within Europe, creating an area in which those who are duly recognised as having the protection of international law must benefit from the same rights in the various Member States."
"After a first failed attempt, it was about time that beneficiaries of international protection finally enjoyed equal treatment with other third-country nationals who are long-term residents."
"Indeed, there is no reason why they should be treated so differently or why there should be such uncertainty over their status within the Union."
"I therefore supported Claude Moraes's report, which, among other things, has made it possible to further strengthen the guarantees against 'refoulement' and, despite the reservations expressed, to arrive at the favourable figure of five years' residence."
"Another significant fact to be welcomed is that this is the only text of the 'asylum package' to have ultimately been adopted under the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and this in spite of the commitments made at the beginning of its mandate."
"Therefore, we need to continue to work hard to ensure that the Common European Asylum System, founded, inter alia, on common procedures and reception conditions, finally becomes a reality within the Union."
"Today, the issues at stake are clear to see: only by improving and harmonising national asylum systems, which differ so much at present, will we be able to have a common system."
"I voted for the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/109/EC to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international protection."
"I did so because I believe that it is important to guarantee refugees the same rights as citizens from third countries who hold a long-term residence permit."
"Through today's vote, the European Parliament has plugged a gap in European Union law regulating the legal status of long-term legal residents, which did not apply to refugees and beneficiaries of international protection."
"Thanks to the new rules, these people will be able to enjoy greater certainty with regard to their legal status in the European Union and will not be subject to inequality of treatment compared to citizens of third countries."
"in writing. - I voted for this proposal which intends to give long-term resident status to beneficiaries of international protection who have been residing legally on the territory of the EU for more than 5 years."
"This gives them an opportunity to integrate, which means being able to communicate in one of the official languages of their Member State of residence, and to increase their awareness of their rights and obligations, as well as of the core values of the Member State of residence."
"To this end, language training should be provided by the Member State to long-term residents."
"Member States should also be encouraged to develop training programmes about the fundamental laws and core values of the Member State of residence and principles of democracy, human rights and equality, as well as individual rights and obligations in that Member State."
"I voted for this report because I am convinced that it would have positive effects for all beneficiaries of international protection who have been residing legally on the territory of the European Union for more than five years, but who currently have no entitlement to long-term resident status."
"We are convinced of the need to ensure greater certainty regarding their legal situation in the EU, avoiding all possible differential treatment vis-à-vis other third-country nationals."
"We share the serious concern of some Member States that they may host a disproportionate number of beneficiaries of international protection due to their particular geographical or demographic situation."
"Therefore, it seems that further measures to deal with any unwanted consequences are more necessary than ever, including, for instance, the adoption of measures to make it easier for such people to move to and establish residence in a Member State other than the one that afforded them international protection."
"We therefore support all possible proposed safeguards against refoulement (only the Member State which granted international protection should be authorised to carry out expulsions), striving to uphold family unity where desirable."
"The intention is that the adoption of this report will extend the scope of Council Directive 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents and beneficiaries of international protection who have been legally residing in a Member State for a period of more than five years."
"From now on, this will allow equal treatment of beneficiaries of international protection in all Member States and will allow the individuals in question to reside within a Member State other than the one in which they gained legal recognition, something which did not happen previously."
"The importance of these measures is directly related to the aim of creating a common area of freedom and security within Europe, creating an area in which those who are duly recognised as having the protection of international law must benefit from the same rights in the various Member States."
"International law and moral principles give the European Union the opportunity of accelerating the granting of legal status to individuals whose life in their country of birth, outside the European Union, is impossible."
"Every individual has the right to be treated humanely."
"However, refugee status must be defined taking into account all the circumstances and prohibiting any kind of speculative dealings, be it of a financial nature or pertaining to migration policy."
"Unfortunately, facts that have not been thoroughly verified are often accepted as true in both the European Union and the European Parliament."
"Sometimes, the false statements made by defenders of rights and various assorted individuals are accepted as true."
"It is important not to tolerate populism."
"Otherwise, whole peoples may be able to settle in Europe under refugee status."
"Whether, under what circumstances and after what period of legal residence refugees are granted a long-term residence permit is a matter for the Member States to decide and must not be dictated by the EU."
"The fact that this proposal was adopted two years late and in a revised form is not without its problems, because a correct interpretation of the much cited Geneva Convention would result in only a fraction of the asylum applications being accepted."
"The fact that after five years of legal residence, beneficiaries of international protection are to have rights comparable to those of EU nationals has raised problems and questions, particularly in those EU states with strong social systems, which will give rise to inestimable costs."
"Extension of the area of application to include refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection can only serve to burden the public purse even more."
"We must, in particular, always take into account the enticement to refugees, in other words, the fact that the measures intended to provide protection and financial security are exactly those that represent an incentive for many economic migrants to immigrate illegally into Europe on the pretext of seeking asylum from inhumane and life-threatening conditions."
"Equally questionable is the idea of taking into account the duration of the asylum procedure when calculating entitlement to a residence permit."
"For these reasons, I voted against the report."
"After residing in a Member State for five years, refugees are to be granted a long-term residence permit, which is then to apply throughout the whole of the EU."
"Since the asylum systems in the different Member States have different levels of stringency, a well-advised refugee would settle initially in the Member State that has the most lenient asylum law with the most loopholes."
"After five years, he can then leave his place of residence and move to any other Member State of the European Union of his choosing."
"The result is secondary migration from countries with low standards to Member States with generous social systems."
"People will first choose the Member States according to the stringency of the asylum law and then according to the level of social services."
"That would, of course, put a particular burden on countries like Austria, Germany or the Netherlands."
"The approach taken by this report is certainly not a sensible way to deal with asylum challenges in the EU and pursue appropriate integration policy."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"I voted in favour of the present report as I agree with the extension of the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC to provide long-term resident status to individuals who benefit from protection under international law and who have already legally resided in the territory of a Member State for a period of five years."
"In particular, I would emphasise the inclusive nature of the policy which would result from the present proposal."
"Long-term resident status provides the opportunity to integrate these individuals, particularly through the language training which must be provided by Member States to long-term residents."
"For the same reasons, I support the rapporteur's proposal to encourage Member States to develop educational programmes on the fundamental values and legal principles of the Member State of residence, as well as on the general principles of democracy, human rights and the rights and duties of individuals."
"I should like to thank Mr Moraes for his excellent work and I share with him the idea of adopting a constructive approach that includes most of the amendments proposed by the Commission, as well as numerous technical amendments agreed in the Council during negotiations on this instrument."
"The draft report reflects the desire to take some of the Member States' concerns into consideration, with the aim of reaching an agreement at first reading, as well as a commitment to protect the interests of beneficiaries of international protection before and after they obtain long-term residency status."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the extension of long-term resident status to beneficiaries of international protection who have been legally residing in a Member State for a period of five years is quite clearly justifiable, since it guarantees equality of treatment to all nationals of third countries, and promotes the economic and social cohesion of the European Union."
"in writing. - In 2001, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents."
"In this proposal, it was originally foreseen that refugees could qualify for long-term resident status after five years of legal and continuous residence in a Member State."
"In the course of the negotiations, it was nevertheless decided by the Member States to exclude refugees from the scope of the directive."
"Subsequently, in the Joint Statement from the Council and the Commission, made at the JHA Council of 8 May 2003, it was agreed that the Commission would table a proposal for a directive on the extension of long-term resident status to refugees and persons under subsidiary protection."
"This proposal was tabled by the Commission in June 2007 using the same legal base as the act it was supposed to amend, i.e. Articles 63(3)(a) and 63(4) of the EC Treaty."
"The main objective of the proposal was to give beneficiaries of international protection who have been legally residing in a Member State for a period of 5 years legal certainty about their right of residence in a Member State, as well as a set of rights comparable to those of EU nationals."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution which approves the conclusion of an agreement with Georgia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas."
"This agreement shows a clear desire for rapprochement between Georgia and the EU which has been expressed in recent years through a series of significant political acts, ranging from improved bilateral cooperation between the EU and Georgia to Georgia's accession to the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I supported the resolution as I strongly believe that the agreement on the facilitation of the issuance of visas will facilitate people-to-people contacts, which are a very important condition for the development of economic, social, humanitarian, cultural, scientific and other ties."
"I believe that the elimination of the visa requirement for the citizens of Georgia will mark an important step on their path to European integration."
"A visa facilitation regime is of great significance in people's lives as it strengthens contacts between peoples and brings about the realisation of the idea of free movement, which is one of the fundamental rights in Europe."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this European Parliament recommendation on the facilitation of the issuance of visas for Georgia, because the enlargement of the European Union was an opportunity for the Union to create a new framework for cooperation with its neighbours to the east and the south."
"In particular, the agreement on the facilitation of the issuance of visas will facilitate people-to-people contacts that form a major precondition for developing economic, humanitarian, cultural, scientific and other ties. Furthermore, a visa facilitation regime is of great significance in people's lives as it strengthens contacts between peoples and brings about the realisation of the idea of free movement, which is one of the fundamental rights in Europe."
"The elimination of the visa requirement for citizens of Georgia will also mark an important stage on their path to European integration."
"I agree with the European Parliament's position that agreements concluded between the Union and Georgia, such as that on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and on the facilitation of the issuance of visas, are, first of all, a very important stage, a step forward in relations between the European Union and Georgia."
"Furthermore, these agreements are also relevant from a regional point of view and will support EU efforts to enhance cooperation with other countries in the region."
"The European Union has speeded up the process of opening up to the states of the South Caucasus ever since its expansion towards Eastern Europe, at a time when this region has become extremely important from a strategic, stability and security perspective."
"Europe now has a duty to the countries in this region."
"Its commitment is clear, especially given the proximity of these countries to the EU's eastern border."
"Apart from the economic and commercial potential offered by these states, the agreement between the EU and Georgia on the facilitation of issuance of visas to citizens from this state is also a measure for encouraging democracy in this country."
"It is important for the EU to export the principles of good governance, fair justice and total respect for human rights."
"This action will also be boosted by the two agreements signed recently with Georgia."
"One concerns the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and the other the facilitated issuance of visas."
"Waiving the compulsory requirement for Georgian citizens to have visas will mark an important step on the road to bringing them closer to Europe."
"A visa facilitation scheme is of paramount importance to people's lives as it increases contacts between people and makes a reality of the idea of free movement, one of the European Union's fundamental rights."
"The actions of the European Union must be based upon the principles of good governance and respect for democracy and human rights."
"In relations with the South Caucasus region, the EU must be a partner to it, assisting with economic and commercial development, with security, with stability, with the promotion of prosperity, and with conflict resolution."
"The agreement to facilitate the visa process for Georgia will contribute to the EU's enlarged neighbourhood policy by promoting cooperation and the exchange of individuals between the two parties."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution."
"Without any doubt, this agreement constitutes significant progress in relations between the EU and Georgia."
"Following on from the strengthening of bilateral cooperation with the EU, and from Georgia's participation in the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights, this agreement represents another step towards improving the operation of justice and increased respect for basic freedoms by Georgia."
"It is to be hoped that this agreement will provide Georgia with the incentive to carry out the necessary reforms in the areas of freedom, security and justice."
"At the same time, the agreement should make it easier for citizens of the two contracting parties to move and maintain personal contacts, something which is essential to ensuring the development of economic, humanitarian, cultural and other relations. I also hope that the necessary information campaigns will be implemented in Georgia, in order to inform the Georgian public both of the entry into force of this facilitated visa regime and of the new opportunities from which they can now benefit."
"Two important agreements for relations between the European Union and Georgia have just been adopted: one on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and one on visa facilitation."
"These agreements represent a first step in the process of strengthening relations between the European Union and Georgia."
"Thus, the EU wishes to encourage Georgia to implement the reforms required in the areas of freedom, security and justice."
"These agreements are also beneficial at a regional level."
"They will contribute to the efforts made by the Union to strengthen cooperation with other countries in the South Caucasus region, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"The growing relationship between Georgia and the European Union, evident in a range of recent actions, is to be welcomed."
"The agreement on the facilitation of the issuance of visas is another important step towards Georgia's integration into Europe."
"The freedom of movement of individuals is one of the most important rights which the EU provides to its citizens and, for this reason, I view cooperation between the EU and Georgia favourably."
"Combating illegal immigration and providing incentives for reform in the spheres of security, freedom and justice could bear ample fruit if there is a spirit of commitment from both sides."
"in writing. - (LV) I have always emphasised that it is the European Union's duty to lend a helping hand to those peoples who feel that they belong and wish to belong to the West and to accept our values."
"In the Rose Revolution, the people of Georgia rejected stagnation, dishonest governance, the past and post-Communism, and chose development, the future and Western values."
"By its actions, that country has confirmed that it wishes to be a partner of a modern international society, one that does not shirk taking responsibility."
"Georgia has achieved much in a short time."
"It has substantially improved its governing structures, attracted significant investment and significantly reduced corruption."
"I consider the facilitated issuance of visas to be an essential step in opening up new opportunities for study to Georgian citizens, and in allowing Georgian entrepreneurs to make new contacts with entrepreneurs in European Union Member States."
"In this way, we shall all be winners, but Georgia's citizens most of all."
"Just as we Europeans take pride in our achievements, our history and cultural values, so Georgians take pride in their country, its natural beauty and ancient culture."
"I hope that a facilitated visa regime between the EU and Georgia will also encourage Europeans to become acquainted with Georgia."
"in writing. - I supported this report on the EU-Georgia agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas."
"The process of deepening the relations between the EU and the countries of the South Caucasus, including Georgia, will undoubtedly contribute to improving the exercise of justice and the respect for freedoms."
"The two agreements recently concluded with Georgia, one on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and the other on the facilitation of the issuance of visas, will contribute fully to achieving these objectives"
"Georgia has made noteworthy efforts to develop closer relations with the European Union, as is evident in a range of recent actions."
"The present agreement on the facilitation of the issuance of visas is thereby another important step towards Georgia's integration into Europe."
"The freedom of movement of individuals is one of the most important rights which the EU provides to its citizens and, for this reason, this cooperation between the EU and Georgia is very important."
"It is, however, essential for the struggle against illegal immigration to continue and for there to continue to be incentives for reform in the spheres of security, freedom and justice in Georgia."
"The South Caucasus is of strategic importance to the European Union."
"The process of strengthening relations between the European Union and the countries of the South Caucasus, including Georgia, will help to improve the exercise of justice and the level of respect for freedoms."
"This agreement represents an important stage in the relations between the European Union and Georgia and an encouraging step forward, given Georgia's European aspirations."
"Furthermore, the agreement is also beneficial at a regional level and will contribute to the efforts made by the Union to strengthen cooperation with other countries in the region."
"For Georgia, this also represents a step forward and an encouragement to cooperate further with its neighbours and with the European Union."
"Moreover, this type of agreement will encourage Georgia to implement the reforms required in the areas of freedom, security and justice, such as the fight against illegal immigration, the strengthening of democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"I abstained in the vote, because I am well informed about the situation in Georgia and about the Georgian President's determination to increase his prestige with the signing of this agreement."
"I consider Mr Saakashvili to be a war criminal."
"His regime is responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians."
"I saw it with my own eyes in August 2008 in the city of Tskhinvali."
"Any kind of flirtation with a criminal will inspire him to commit further crimes."
"An agreement with Georgia would bring a wave of bogus asylum seekers."
"Thus, we first need to dispel our security concerns."
"As the experience with the Balkans shows, visa-free travel is not just used for travel to the EU, but also sets a real stream of asylum shopping in motion."
"It is to be feared that the same thing would also happen in the case of visa facilitation for Georgian citizens."
"In general, the facilitation of the issuance of visas to citizens of non-EU states should not be granted too hastily."
"Before doing so, it must be examined as carefully as possible whether appropriate readmission agreements for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants could prevent the abuse of the system."
"The problems with the Schengen Information System II must also be resolved beforehand."
"Finally, it must not primarily be asylum seekers, or even criminals, that benefit from visa-free travel."
"The preconditions mentioned have not been met and I therefore reject an extension of the visa-free area in the strongest possible terms."
"According to the report, visa liberalisation for Georgia would provide an incentive for necessary reforms in the areas of freedom, security and justice."
"Quite apart from the opportunities for abuse of the system that visa liberalisation would open up, this logic needs to be turned on its head: no visa negotiations until all of the necessary reforms have been implemented."
"At the end of the day, this is about the security of EU citizens, who must be protected against visa tourists and organised crime."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The process of strengthening relations between the European Union and the countries of the Southern Caucasus, including Georgia, is vital if we are to create a solid, coherent and effective foreign policy."
"The conclusion of an agreement to simplify the visa process has clearly contributed to the realisation of this objective."
"The draft decision regarding the conclusion of the agreement includes standard elements of the facilitation of the issuance of EU visas and establishes timescales for decisions to be made, along with the relevant costs and exemptions, the necessary documentation, and a joint declaration concerning cooperation and travel documents."
"I support the proposal to include an EU declaration regarding facilitation of the process for family members, as this responds to specific requests made by Georgia and aims to improve the mobility of a significant number of individuals who have family ties with those Georgian citizens residing legally in the territories of the Member States."
"Regarding the implementation of the two agreements recently concluded with Georgia, I fully support Mrs Griesbeck's assertion that the people need to be informed of the new situation and benefit from the new possibilities that derive from it."
"In addition, the changes in the visa policy should also appear as soon as possible on the European institutions' websites."
"I voted in favour of the signing of this agreement as I believe that, combined with the agreement on the re-admission of illegal residents, it constitutes very significant progress in relations between the EU and Georgia, signalling an important stage in its integration into Europe and, at the same time, providing an incentive for the country to promote the necessary reforms in the areas of freedom, security and justice."
"in writing. - The enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States in 2004 and then to 27 in 2007 was an opportunity for the Union to create a new framework for cooperation with its neighbours to the east and the south."
"The European Union thus engaged in an enlarged neighbourhood policy extending as far as the countries of the South Caucasus region and aimed at deepening its relations with the countries located at the EU's external borders, promoting their security, stability and development and preventing new divisions on the European continent."
"Europe thus signalled its growing interest in the States of the South Caucasus and it must today pursue its engagement with the countries of this region as an area to be protected near its new frontiers."
"The process of deepening relations between the EU and the countries of the South Caucasus, including Georgia, will undoubtedly also help to improve the exercise of justice and respect for freedom."
"The two agreements recently concluded with Georgia - one on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and the other on facilitation of the issuance of visas - will contribute fully to achieving these objectives."
"I voted in favour of the report on a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on setting up an EU rapid response capability to address the various major natural or man-made disasters which have occurred outside the EU in recent years."
"This is because I believe that it is important to improve the efficiency of EU disaster response capabilities and that a preventive action plan has become increasingly necessary as a global, integrated EU response."
"The disaster which occurred in Haiti demonstrated the need for the EU to implement fundamental reforms in terms of its rapid and efficient response to emergencies and catastrophes."
"In order to have a quick and effective response, I believe that it will also be necessary for there to be more political will amongst the different parties involved."
"It is also necessary to implement a restructuring of competences in order to provide greater coherence and coordination in responses to disasters by the EU."
"I believe that it is essential to put into practice certain concrete proposals included in the 2006 Barnier report concerning the creation of a European civil protection force."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution as it is obvious that the multiplication of major disasters outside the European Union in recent years has led to increased calls to improve the effectiveness of the existing EU disaster response capacity."
"One of the major steps towards a more integrated response has been the inclusion of civil protection and humanitarian aid under the portfolio of one single Commissioner to create opportunities for enhanced coherence and coordination of the EU disaster response."
"It is, however, regrettable that two years after the publication of the 2008 Commission Communication, many actions from the Action Plan still remain to be implemented, while the EU response to recent crises has revealed the limitations of the existing system."
"If efforts have recently been made to reinforce coherence and coordination between the civil protection and humanitarian aid dimensions of the EU response, steps towards the creation of a European civil protection force have remained minimal."
"Therefore, a strong political will is needed for a more efficient and rapid response to emergencies."
"I support the need for the EU to provide a coordinated, coherent and high-profile response in the event of disasters."
"This is why I consider it important to develop EU civil capabilities which will be permanently available and take action independently of the military structures."
"I think that the EU civil protection force should enhance the instruments currently available, whether in terms of disaster response training or disaster management by developing initiatives taken during preparatory actions."
"Given the numerous serious disasters in the world and their increasing frequency, caused mainly by climate change, I voted for the excellent report by my Italian colleague, Mrs Zanicchi, containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on setting up a rapid response capability."
"The moment has come to improve the EU's disaster response in terms of efficiency, coordination and visibility."
"It is becoming more and more urgent to create a European rapid response capability, or 'European civil protection force', as Mr Barnier has suggested."
"Clearly, the coordination of national civil protection forces seems to be a useful means of assisting a Member State which could not cope on its own with a large-scale disaster (fire, flood, natural disaster, and so on)."
"This European civil protection force would also be very useful for intervening in external situations such as in Haiti."
"At a time when we are going to celebrate, in 2011, the European Year of Volunteering, an action such as this would trigger European interest and could help to consolidate European citizenship."
"I voted for this report."
"Disasters causing significant human, economic and environmental damage are on the increase worldwide and such crises are happening with greater frequency and scope in more parts of the world."
"Although progress has been made in recent years towards a more coherent EU disaster response, efforts must continue to ensure effective, coherent and coordinated EU actions in this area."
"It is necessary to develop an Action Plan with a number of concrete actions to build up a more integrated coordination between the various instruments for disaster response, and to assess possible responses by the EU and the Member States."
"The recently established European External Action Service should be included in these activities in order to coordinate aid more effectively outside the EU."
"Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure there are sufficient financial resources to fund the aid measures required."
"I voted for this report because the multiplication of major natural or man-made disasters outside the European Union in recent years has led to increased calls to reform EU disaster response capacity and improve the effectiveness of the existing EU disaster response capacity."
"For example, the lack of visibility of the EU response has also been highlighted as one of the main shortcomings of disaster response."
"Clear agreements and procedures should therefore be established to ensure a dual visibility (for both the Member States and the European Union) for civil protection assets deployed by Member States through the EU civil protection mechanism."
"Another problem with EU response concerns coordination and, therefore, the European Parliament trusts that in future, the European External Action Service will create a single crisis response, which will require a rationalisation of the existing crisis platforms."
"Furthermore, clear mechanisms for coordination between the Commission and the Council should be ensured, also in relation to the coordination and the use of EU military assets in a disaster response."
"A rapid response agency for dealing with emergencies would make the European Union's interventions in the event of natural or accidental disasters much more coherent and effective."
"The European Union clearly intervened rapidly and responded to real needs in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti."
"However, it is also just as obvious that we need to learn from real situations and improve the service we give every time."
"The earthquake in Haiti was immediately followed by a period of confusion over who should take the lead for the coordination of the EU's overall action."
"In the future, it is expected that the EEAS will create a single crisis response, which will require streamlining of the existing crisis platforms."
"Clear responsibilities need to be defined for each Member State in the event of a disaster, with the necessary logistical preparations so that capabilities can be mobilised as quickly as possible to the highest possible standards."
"The intervention in Haiti highlighted that actions of this kind become effective when each state specialises in a particular service, as was the case with France, which provided a water purification unit, and Italy, an advanced medical unit."
"I expect the recommendation on the creation of an EU rapid reaction instrument to result in greater pressure to improve the effectiveness of existing EU capabilities to respond to catastrophes, whether natural or man-made."
"I consider the existing civil defence mechanism of the Community to be an important, but insufficient, step towards a genuinely operational civil defence mechanism that is as effective as possible."
"The limits of the current civil defence mechanism were apparent, for example, in the reaction to this year's crisis in Haiti, which was relatively flexible and extensive, but, on the other hand, suffered from a lack of efficiency, coordination and visibility."
"It was also unclear who was supposed to lead coordination of the overall EU operation."
"In view of the extent of the crisis, High Representative Ashton finally secured the coordination of EU assistance in close cooperation with Commissioner Georgieva, who is responsible for humanitarian assistance, civil defence and international cooperation."
"I see scope for extending the operational ability of the EU to cope with catastrophes, particularly through the creation of a permanently available civilian capability which will operate independently of military structures, and in the creation of budgets and research and industrial potential (for example, satellite imaging in the GMES programme)."
"In light of the increasing frequency and impact of natural disasters which have had serious consequences in human, economic, social and environmental terms, the European Parliament recommendation to the Council on setting up an EU rapid response capability is particularly important."
"I voted in favour of the proposal, as I believe that it covers the fundamental issues which should be considered."
"Amongst these issues, it reiterates that cooperation between Member States could provide operational and financial benefits, and it recognises that there must be an integrated approach to disaster management, which also includes prevention of, preparation for, and management of disasters, as well as post-disaster reconstruction."
"Furthermore, I believe that it is important for the coordination and efficiency of the European response to be improved, not least through a European civil protection force."
"I abstained on the report on setting up an EU rapid response capability to humanitarian disasters because, although it contains positive ideas and elements, it also attaches military means and a military presence to this capability."
"It is a very good thing that the reports states that 'the use of civil protection resources, where deployed in any humanitarian crisis, should be needs driven and complementary to, and coherent with, humanitarian aid..., with a view to ensuring compliance with the humanitarian principles of neutrality, humanity, impartiality and dependence'."
"However, there are also points in the report which go in a completely different direction, which is why I abstained."
"For example, the facility to also respond to 'military crises' or 'to use military assets and capabilities in disaster response', even if it is 'exceptional'."
"The recent natural disasters afflicting the world highlight the pressing need for rapid and effective response mechanisms to reduce their disastrous social, economic and cultural impact on affected regions."
"Following previous European Parliament resolutions, particularly those on the Haitian earthquake and on preventing natural or man-made disasters, this House is once again wrestling with this topic."
"In general, I support the report by my colleague, Mrs Zanicchi, and I emphasise that future EU capacity relating to disasters must be based on mechanisms available at European and international level, avoiding any duplication, making the best use of resources and enabling the European civil protection force to be based on the already existing Community Mechanism for Civil Protection."
"I welcome the fact that, following the tragedy in Haiti, there has been greater political will and more efforts to strengthen coherence and coordination between the civil protection and humanitarian assistance sectors."
"I also welcome the work done by the parties involved on achieving this objective."
"However, it is regrettable that the previous proposals of the European Parliament still have not been fully implemented, notably, those relating to the Barnier report."
"Whether in Haiti following January's earthquake, or in Pakistan following this summer's floods, whenever there is a disaster, Europe does a lot but in a disorganised manner."
"Each Member State sends its own staff, its own rescue dogs, its own aeroplanes, and so on. Taken together, however, the hastily organised individual responses will never beat a planned and organised European response."
"The European Union, with the 27 Member States acting collectively, is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid and development aid."
"We have at our disposal a vast array of civil and military resources to meet emergency and reconstruction needs."
"However, as long as there are still national knee-jerk responses, we will unfortunately be unable to derive any real benefit from this virtual collective force."
"What we need is a true 'rapid response capability'."
"Equally, increased efficiency and speed when dealing with an emergency requires a strong political will on the part of the various parties concerned."
"Rapid response to catastrophes and natural disasters is essential, since it is in the first few hours following such an event that the greatest number of people can be saved."
"Furthermore, in recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in disasters, whether natural or man-made, and these require a high level of technical expertise and coordination of the different means of responding to disasters."
"The creation of a Community Mechanism for Civil Protection may be a first step but I agree with the rapporteur that there is more to be done in this area."
"EU coordination and cooperation on rapid and effective response to disasters can be very successful, as it was in the case of the Haitian earthquake in January 2010."
"It is essential that the response should be of this kind."
"Natural disasters can and must be prevented."
"Factors such as intensive soil use, poorly planned urban growth, rural flight and desertification, among others, are the causes of an increased risk of disasters."
"The promotion of sensible land use, and of economic and social development in harmony with nature, is a vital factor in disaster prevention."
"It is, above all, in this respect that the EU should intensify its efforts, implementing the recommendations made in a recent Parliamentary report and strengthening this aspect of its cooperation policy."
"With regard to responses to those disasters which cannot be prevented, there is also clearly a place for strengthening cooperation, mutual assistance and intervention between the various Member States and third countries."
"The best forms and means of achieving this must be the result of a debate involving the various national civil protection and other authorities, whilst respecting the sovereignty of each Member State."
"This should be the path set out by the report, not the 'immediate establishment of an EU Civil Protection Force' or the use of military means in response to humanitarian aid situations, which the report admits could act without being under the aegis and coordination of the UN."
"This vote represents an important step towards the creation of a European civil protection force that could intervene quickly and effectively wherever there is a serious emergency."
"As we will all remember, although the European response in providing aid to the people of Haiti was swift and on a large scale, it highlighted a number of critical problems in the management, coordination and visibility of the operation, which are down to the mechanics of the current system, which is based on voluntary and ad hoc contributions subject to different national decision-making processes."
"The recent European Commission communication on the role of civil protection and humanitarian support aims precisely to lay the foundations for an effective and coherent synergy of the actions already taken at national, regional and local levels."
"The Treaty of Lisbon provides the opportunity to develop a more thorough, coordinated and functional disaster response capacity."
"The time has therefore come to speed up the process that will equip the EU with a modern and efficient civil protection capability."
"I voted for the report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on setting up a European Union rapid response capability because I believe that the European Union must make significant efforts to ensure coordinated and effective responses to the various major disasters that we have recently witnessed."
"The need for such a commitment was emphasised in the latest Commission communication on 'Reinforcing the Union's disaster response capacity', which included an Action Plan designed to establish integrated coordination between the various instruments for disaster response."
"In addition, I agree with Mrs Zanicchi that it is high time we recognised the political importance of reinforcing the EU disaster response capability and that all means should be mobilised to achieve this objective."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which:"
"recalls the pivotal role of the High Representative/Vice-President in coordinating EU operations in third countries and regions;"
"underlines that the structure and working methods of the European External Action Service (EEAS) should aim at ensuring the coherence and consistency of EU action in crisis situations;"
"calls therefore on the Council to grant the HR/VP a permanent mandate allowing her to activate a crisis cell, gathering representatives from all the appropriate services of the Commission and the Council and from all EU planning capabilities (MIC, CMPD, EUMS, CPCC) to coordinate the EU response in the event of disaster, in order to be able to start work quickly without having to systematically go to the Council;"
"suggests that this cell could be supported by a team, deployable within the first hours of the crisis, could be composed of civilian (CRT, MIC), military and civ-mil (EUMS, CPCC) experts and could also benefit from SITCEN and SATCEN intelligence;"
"emphasises the need for optimal coordination between an EU disaster response and other EU instruments - particularly common security and defence policy (CSDP) civil or military missions and instruments (i.e. Battlegroups)."
"The creation of a means of responding rapidly to catastrophes and natural disasters is essential, since it is in the first few hours following such an event that the largest number of people can be saved."
"Furthermore, in recent years, we have unfortunately witnessed a significant increase in disasters, whether natural or man-made, and these demand meaningful and swift intervention capability."
"The creation of a Community Mechanism for Civil Protection is very important for these reasons, but much remains to be done in this area."
"The number of major disasters in EU countries and third countries alike is increasing all the time, not least because of climate change and increased urbanisation."
"Developing countries are the worst affected by disasters, with a particularly high death toll as a result."
"The economic cost of such disasters is also much greater in these countries."
"The creation of a rapid response force will enable the EU and the Member States to better coordinate their efforts and give better visibility to EU activity."
"That is why I supported this recommendation."
"Like its author, I call for the many excellent practical proposals made in the Barnier report to be taken into account."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Zanicchi, has updated the question of the possibility of rapid response only after considerable delay, but its topicality has not been diminished thereby."
"I am convinced that it is the European Union's duty to increase significantly financing for the preparation, provisioning and expansion of rapid response forces."
"Natural cataclysms will occur ever more frequently as a result of climate change."
"We cannot get by here without a professional rescue team, whose professional preparedness will permit rapid localisation and effective control over fires and technogenic disasters."
"I voted in favour."
"A strong rapid reaction unit would be a good thing and would be able to help citizens of Europe and other states during their most difficult times."
"Sadly, the rapporteur does not seem to be concerned with strengthening humanitarian aid or the EU's civil protection programme, but rather with making the 'EU' stamp as visible as possible."
"It must not be the goal of this rapid reaction unit to promote the EU throughout the world."
"As a result of the leadership of the United Nations and the involvement of the military in providing emergency aid, we also risk giving up our independence, which I do not wish to support."
"It is for that reason that I voted against this report."
"It has proved necessary to improve the effectiveness of the existing EU disaster response capacity in many situations which we have tackled during recent years."
"I would just like to mention the disastrous floods or the forest fires which have affected a number of European states."
"Another example is the recent large-scale environmental accident which occurred in Hungary."
"Faced with such incidents, no state has the capacity to respond at a sufficiently high level on its own."
"There is also a duty of solidarity between EU Member States."
"The report spells out the criteria which need to be met by a rapid reaction force, as well as the conditions which would be required for it to carry out its activities."
"It seems the report has less to do with increasing the efficiency of development aid or the protection of citizens than it has with promoting and drawing attention to the 'EU' brand."
"It is for that reason that I voted against this report."
"The need for an effective European Union response capability to deal with the increasing number of major disasters over recent years is what drove me to vote for this report."
"There have been numerous calls in the last few years for the EU to improve the effectiveness of its response and, as we stand, much more needs to be done to ensure more coherent and visible progress."
"In my opinion, we need to mobilise all available resources to achieve this objective because, since 2008 and the last communication from the Commission on this matter, we have moved towards a comprehensive and integrated EU response."
"We all expect that the implementation of this report will result in a concrete action plan to gradually build up more integrated coordination between the various instruments for disaster response."
"I agree with the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on setting up an EU rapid response capability for natural disasters."
"In fact, an analysis of the lessons learned in Haiti clearly shows the need for renewed reform of EU disaster response capability, as I had, as a matter of fact, already stated in my opinion 'on a Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters'."
"Rapid and effective response in emergency situations is absolutely essential if we are to ensure that the EU demonstrates solidarity, whether with Member States or with third countries, and this requires strong political will from the various decision-making bodies."
"It is generally acknowledged that major efforts are currently under way to strengthen coherence and coordination between the civil protection forces and the various areas of humanitarian aid."
"However, meaningful steps must be taken towards the creation of a European Civil Protection Force, as is also stated in my opinion 'on a Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters'."
"I agree with the rapporteur: it is time to make greater progress in this matter, particularly in terms of implementing the concrete proposals of the 2006 Barnier report."
"I share the rapporteur Mrs Zanicchi's belief that it is high time to recognise the political importance of strengthening the European Union's disaster response capability and that all means should be mobilised to achieve this objective."
"I also agree with Mrs Zanicchi's view that the encouraging results of the 2008 Preparatory Action should be further assessed and that the idea of a voluntary pool of Member States' assets on stand-by for immediate deployment in EU operations should be further developed."
"In this regard, the rapporteur wished to remind the Council and the Commission of the recommendation in the report by Mr Barnier, according to which only preventive organisation and a pooling of existing resources can bring about the emergence of a European civil protection force."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree that it is essential that we endeavour to implement policies to strengthen the EU's capacity to respond to disasters, promoting the efficiency, coordination and visibility of these activities."
"in writing. - The multiplication of major disasters (natural/man-made) outside the European Union in recent years has led to increased calls to improve the effectiveness of the existing EU disaster-response capacity."
"If the EU disaster-response capacity has constantly evolved since the establishment of the Community civil protection mechanism in 2001, the rapporteur believes that much more needs to be done to ensure a coordinated, coherent and visible EU response."
"This need for a more coherent response was also highlighted in the latest communication from the Commission on 'reinforcing the Union's disaster response capacity', which dates back to March 2008."
"This communication was supposed to be a first step on the road to a comprehensive and integrated EU response."
"It included an action plan with a number of practical actions to gradually build up more integrated coordination between the various instruments for disaster response."
"Today, we have Parliament's response to that problem."
"Now that, because of climate change, the number of natural disasters across the world resulting in serious humanitarian, economic and environmental damage has increased, it is imperative that the European Union is able to act quickly."
"The creation of a European civil protection force provides a clear structure for this kind of rapid response."
"After the earthquake in Haiti, we have learned the lesson that we need to increase the efficiency, coordination and visibility of the Union."
"I am therefore in favour of civil protection and humanitarian aid being brought together under the portfolio of a single Commissioner."
"I also believe that, where possible, humanitarian relief operations should always be carried out under the coordinating umbrella of the UN."
"In this report, the Commission has been invited to set up programmes in the affected areas, working together with national governments, local authorities and NGOs, in order to enable local communities to prevent and manage disasters."
"Military and civil defence resources should only be used in disasters as a last resort."
"The incidence of natural and man-made disasters has been increasing, not only in number but also in impact and scale and, as a result, in terms of human, socio-economic and environmental impact."
"This obliges the EU to rethink its response strategy in terms of prevention, management and assistance, so that it becomes more concerted and efficient in operational terms."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which uses the recent disaster in Haiti as a case study and calls for the creation of a European Union Civil Protection Force capable of creating synergies between the Member States and European institutions in order to prevent disasters and assist third countries, especially any developing country that has been struck by a disaster."
"The humanitarian nature of this initiative is representative of the increasingly concrete nature of the external dimensions of EU solidarity."
"However, I believe that it is extremely important for this same initiative to be regarded as leading to the coordination and management of those disasters which occur inside the European Union."
"I recall the disaster which devastated the island of Madeira last February and, on that basis, I consider it essential to create this Civil Protection Force whilst, at the same time, making best possible use of existing mechanisms."
"Work is continuing in the field of financial regulation."
"I voted for this own-initiative report by the European Parliament, which seeks to subject all financial products to supervision by the market authorities."
"Lack of transparency is detrimental to market efficiency and has helped exacerbate the financial crisis."
"The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive facilitated the transfer of market activities to better regulated and more transparent negotiating spaces."
"Echoing the conclusions of the September 2009 G20 summit in Pittsburgh, this report aims to ensure that 'all standardised OTC derivative contracts [are] traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms'."
"Since the implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the European financial markets have undergone unprecedented changes, both as a result of the directive and for other reasons linked to the crisis."
"As a consequence, it has not been possible to achieve the desired regulatory aims."
"The implementation of the MiFID has caused the fragmentation of the markets, which has encouraged the explosive growth of high-frequency trading strategies."
"The market has adjusted to the use of dark pools for trading large orders in private broker crossings, and to exemptions established in the MiFID for such actions when they are conducted through organised trading venues, called 'dark transactions', where transactions were formerly undertaken in regulated markets."
"It is essential to apply legislation, designed to ensure the effective regulation and transparency of these technological developments, in order to prevent the creation of any systemic risk to the overall functioning of the markets."
"The European Parliament continues to adopt reports relating to certain elements of financial regulation, but without ever getting to the bottom of the matter."
"Of course, it is better for there to be some regulation of financial transactions by private brokers and/or financial institutions."
"However, this is not the fundamental issue."
"The report does not go beyond arguments for greater regulation of trading platforms, referring to the need for 'increasing transparency and safety within the markets in financial instruments', and to the need for 'equitable treatment' of multilateral trading facilities and regulated markets."
"The fundamental question at issue here is the continued existence of the same old speculative system, yet the report only addresses the form of this speculation, and not the most important aspect: the content."
"For our part, we continue to argue for an end to the derivatives market and to tax havens, as well as for effective control of financial powers by political powers, rather than vice versa."
"Until this happens, any other policy will be merely cosmetic."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"It seems that a significant consequence of the competition brought about by implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) has been market fragmentation which has, in itself, encouraged the explosive growth of HFT strategies."
"Regulation must reflect the fact that these technological advances are in need of suitable provisions in the legislation, so that they do not fall through regulatory gaps and inadvertently cause systemic risk to the overall functioning of the markets."
"With the recent implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the European financial markets have undergone unprecedented changes, both as a result of the directive and for other reasons linked to the crisis."
"As a consequence, it has not been possible to achieve the regulatory aims intended by the adoption of the MiFID."
"The market has adjusted to the use of dark pools for trading large orders in private broker crossings, and to exemptions established in the MiFID for such actions when they are conducted through organised trading venues, called 'dark transactions', where transactions were formerly undertaken in regulated markets."
"For these reasons, it is essential to start applying legislation designed to ensure the effective regulation and transparency of these technological developments, in order to prevent the systemic risks to the overall functioning of the markets from being created again in the future."
"Data acquisition costs in Europe are much too high."
"They are sometimes ten times higher than they are in the United States."
"The report contains some good proposals for reducing these and other unnecessary costs."
"However, I fear that the author is on the wrong track with her plans to achieve this goal of cost reduction by introducing numerous additional provisions."
"There is a danger that doing so will merely replace one bureaucratic obstacle with another one."
"It is for that reason that I abstained from voting."
"My decision to vote for report is in line with the current situation on European capital markets, which are going through a period of unprecedented flux thanks to new technological advancements."
"Thanks to the introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which promotes competition between trading venues for execution services, the efficiency of the price formation process has increased, widening choice for investors."
"Market fragmentation has, however, led to poor post-trade transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) trades and this situation means a more effective regulatory framework for consolidated post-trade information is required."
"In my opinion, regulators need to ensure that they can, at any time, recreate every detail of the trade in order to understand the market dynamics and the participants' involvement."
"The impact of new technology and the advent of new market participants has led to faster trading speeds and to an increase in direct market access by clients of trading platform members."
"Although the introduction of MiFID brought innovation, it seems that it also contributed to the fragmentation of the market."
"I voted for the report because I believe that these technological advances need to be adequately regulated in order that they do not cause systemic risk to the overall functioning of the markets."
"I support the call for the Commission to strengthen market infrastructures across all trading venues and clearing systems to enable them to cope with future risk through enhanced transparency, improved resilience and regulatory oversight of all aggregated trades."
"I thus voted in favour of Parliament's resolution, as it supports the idea that:"
"multilateral trading facilities should be subject to the same level of oversight and, therefore, regulated in a comparable manner;"
"investment firms which provide a portfolio management service and act in a portfolio management capacity should benefit from the best possible terms from investment companies;"
"the Commission should evaluate the effects of setting a minimum order size for all dark transactions;"
"firms that pursue high-frequency trading strategies should be analysed to ensure that they have robust systems and controls with ongoing regulatory reviews of the algorithms they use."
"I fully support the rapporteur, Mrs Swinburne, and her idea to promote competition between trading venues for execution services."
"This has led to increased investor choice, lowered transaction costs and has helped increase the efficiency of the price formation process."
"There are now 136 multilateral trading facilities (MTF), as well as the primary exchanges, which collectively make up the organised trading venues."
"These organised venues account for some 60% of the trading volume, with the remainder being carried out by broker-dealers, collectively termed 'over the counter' (OTC)."
"Bilateral trades, where the client gives the broker an order and he finds a match, have migrated from mainly verbal orders to predominantly electronic orders."
"Although, by definition, there is no pre-trade transparency for OTC trades, they are still required to be reported under the rules of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)."
"I agree that the Commission should evaluate the impact of setting a minimum order size for all dark transactions, and whether it could be rigorously enforced so as to maintain adequate flow of trade through the lit venues in the interests of price discovery."
"in writing. - It seems that a significant consequence of the competition brought about by the implementation of MiFID has been market fragmentation which has, in itself, encouraged the explosive growth of HFT strategies."
"Regulation needs to recognise that these technological advances are in need of suitable provisions in the legislation so that they do not fall through regulatory gaps and inadvertently cause systemic risk to the overall functioning of the markets."
"That is, in summary, the proposal in the text adopted today by the EP."
"in writing. - This own-initiative report sets the framework for the discussion of MiFID, to which the OTC Directive, the rise of ESMA and, of course, EMIR are related."
"Even the name of this report allows people to understand the nature of necessary, but often complicated, regulatory changes."
"Unregulated markets have been allowed unfiltered access by means of sponsorship to formal trading venues."
"This must change."
"Similarly, I can agree with the rapporteur that pre-trade, post-trade transparency needs improvement, and particularly that post-trade data for non-equity products are provided in a form which is readily consolidated."
"Understanding the market dynamics and equipping regulators with instruments plus information/data is vital."
"Banks, stock exchanges and funds develop new financial products and trading practices so quickly that the directive on markets in financial instruments is already out of date."
"The scope of the transparency rules must also be extended to include the internal trading systems of banks and the exceptions must be more narrowly worded so that financial institutes and financial products cannot escape effective supervision."
"The disclosure of pre- and post-trade data, previously only stipulated for shares, is now to be extended to bonds, centrally cleared derivatives, structured products, funds and certificates, which will increase the efficiency and transparency of the price formation process."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that it is essential for the EU to be prepared for the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks which have given a new dimension to terrorist attacks, to industrial accidents and to natural disasters, since such risks know no borders and could result in innumerable victims."
"The response of the EU to this danger should not be limited to ex post facto intervention programmes but starts much earlier when dealing with the proper storage of, limiting of access to, and controls of such materials."
"I consider it essential that intervention following an incident should be matched by significant cooperation between the different authorities of a Member State (civil protection, military, police, etc.), as well as between the national authorities of the various Member States and European institutions."
"In other words, I consider a coordinated and comprehensive approach to be essential."
"In June 2009, the Commission tabled a three-year EU CBRN Action Plan for 2010-2012, with the following elements: prevention, detection, and preparedness and response."
"In this regard, I believe that recognising the importance of each of these stages is crucial to ensure the proper implementation of risk assessment studies, response and counter measures."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this important resolution because it is high time to pay attention to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) risks which present a new dimension of possible terrorist attacks, accidents, natural disasters and/or pandemics due to their transnational character and mass-scale victimisation."
"It is necessary to start dealing with such materials, and their proper storage, limited access, controls, etc., from the very beginning and not just create ex post facto intervention programmes."
"At the same time, aftermath intervention demands large-scale cooperation between different national authorities inside a Member State."
"Therefore, the CBRN Action Plan should ensure the efficient interaction of national and EU initiatives in addressing CBRN risks and preparing the necessary response."
"Considering that CBRN accidents or attacks pose serious threats to the security of the people living in the European Union and can disrupt critical infrastructure and the normal functioning of societies in any or several EU Member States and are oblivious to borders, I support the European Parliament resolution which calls on the Council and the Commission to rapidly review and strengthen the Action Plan according to the recommendations in this report and to ensure its swift implementation."
"Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks present a new challenge to society, as well as a new basis for possible terrorist attacks, accidents, natural disasters or pandemics."
"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Mrs Gomes's report as this report will enable us to establish the foundation for a suitable disaster response mechanism."
"We must also take into consideration, while reassessing the EU CBRN Action Plan, the suggestions put forward by Parliament, aimed at improving the basic areas which improve security in the event of such risks."
"I agree that it is vital to share best practices with countries which have developed a specialist mechanism in the field of CBRN risk assessment, prevention, detection, communication and response."
"I think that it is important for us to stress the need to maintain well-managed stockpiles to ensure that disaster response resources, whether medical or any kind of other relevant equipment, are fully functional, current and up to date."
"This is why I voted in favour of this report."
"Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear disasters, whether accidental or resulting from a terrorist attack, pose serious threats to the security and health of EU citizens and are the cause of environmental pollution and contamination."
"Although the number of incidents in the EU involving CBRN material has so far been relatively small and have been due to industrial accidents or to the increase in, and worldwide spread of, dangerous pathogens, there remains a risk of CBRN disasters, whether accidental or intentional."
"I voted for this report because I agree with the rapporteur's position that the CBRN Action Plan proposed by the European Commission, the goal of which is to ensure the efficient interaction of national and EU initiatives in addressing CBRN risks and preparing the necessary response, underestimates the risks which are not confined by the EU's borders."
"I believe that international CBRN risks should also be properly assessed by and included in the CBRN Action Plan, and therefore preventive actions must ensure an international dimension, emphasising the implementation of international agreements in the areas of nuclear and chemical weapons."
"It is essential that we adopt an effective Action Plan so that we can confront the existing and continuing risk of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) disasters within EU territory."
"Whether accidental or intentional, these represent a serious threat and have the potential to cause devastating and far-reaching effects on the security, welfare and health of the European public, as well as on the environment, our cultural heritage and basic infrastructure."
"Fortunately, the number of incidents related to CBRN materials, including acts of terrorism, has been relatively low."
"This Action Plan shows the need for a comprehensive and transnational response, since the effects of a CBRN disaster know no borders and such a plan should be based on the following elements: prevention, detection, and preparedness and response."
"It should also ensure effective interaction between national and EU initiatives in order to tackle CBRN risks and prepare capabilities to respond to and limit the consequences."
"Like the rapporteur, Mrs Gomes, I have no doubt that we need to adopt an EU Action Plan but I regret the fact that the Commission has not been more ambitious, because the proposed Action Plan shows a lack of strength and coherence on certain matters."
"in writing. - Although I agreed with the majority of the Gomes report, I have voted against it as it focuses too much on the EU coordinating civil-military cooperation."
"Military competences should remain with the Member States and not with the EU and the Commission."
"I have no problem with Member States cooperating on an equal level in the case of a CBRN event - and in the case of an environmental disaster resulting from such an incident, it is crucial - but I do have a huge problem with this report potentially opening the door for militarisation of the EU."
"I voted for this report as I think that it proposes effective measures for preventing, combating and managing chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) incidents."
"It is of paramount importance that this report promotes the notion of a rapid response mechanism in the event of a CBRN disaster in one of the Member States."
"In addition, this mechanism will be based on a response inspired by solidarity from all EU Member States."
"Another point which is just as important is that the report adopted by Parliament proposes the creation of mixed European rapid intervention teams which will be made up of military personnel, police officers and medical staff who will provide an effective response in the event of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear disasters."
"As a result of the compromises obtained by the shadow rapporteur from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), my colleague, Mrs Hankiss, the text upon which we are voting today is much more detailed and balanced, giving many specialist matters relating to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear safety significant priority, not only in terms of preventing accidents and responding appropriately to natural disasters, but also with reference to the clear and present danger presented by terrorism of this nature."
"We are increasingly faced with diffuse and unconventional threats and, with this in mind, Europe must have an adequate strategy for prevention, detection and protection, so that the safety and health of Europeans can be guaranteed. The Commission should continue along these lines and so I am voting in favour."
"Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks have given a new dimension to terrorist attacks, industrial accidents, natural disasters and pandemics, given that such threats know no borders and could result in innumerable victims."
"In June 2009, the Commission tabled the EU CBRN Action Plan, which was amended by the Council in November."
"The plan will be implemented over the next three years - 2010-2012 - and is based on three principal elements: prevention, detection, and preparedness and response."
"However, the amendments introduced by the Council have made the Action Plan less robust, and have rendered both the planned measures and the monitoring and inspection of their application less binding."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, which aims to entrust the Commission with a strengthened regulatory role, as I believe that is the only way it will be possible to fill in the existing gaps in the powers conferred in this area by the different Member States."
"If there were genuine concern regarding chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats, there would be no insistence by certain EU countries on maintaining extremely powerful nuclear arsenals that could be used in military attacks."
"Nor would US nuclear weapons still be stationed in various European countries, an action which blatantly contradicts one of the three pillars of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which is supposedly supported."
"The report makes no reference to certain decisions such as that recently taken by the UK to sell nuclear technology to India, a country which is not a signatory to the NPT, nor to the decision by France and Germany to cooperate in the maintenance of their nuclear weapons, justifying this by a hypocritical 'cost rationalisation'."
"Nothing is said either about the assistance given by the main EU powers and by NATO to the project to install anti-missile systems in Europe, or on the decision by NATO to maintain its role as a 'nuclear alliance'."
"At a time when the crisis of capitalism has intensified, this report makes it clear that concrete actions are what matter, and not declarations of intent: such actions demonstrate that military might continues to be a resource used by capitalist economic globalisation."
"in writing. - Explanation of Vote on the Gomes report 'Strengthening chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security in the European Union - an EU CBRN Action Plan'."
"Although I agreed with the majority of the Gomes report, I have voted against it as it focuses too much on the EU coordinating civil-military cooperation."
"Military competences should remain with the Member States and not with the EU and the Commission."
"I have no problem with Member States cooperating on an equal level in the case of a CBRN event - and in the case of an environmental disaster resulting from such an incident, it is crucial - but I do have a huge problem with this report potentially opening the door for militarisation of the EU."
"in writing. - Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks present a new dimension of possible terrorist attacks, accidents, natural disasters and/or pandemics due to their transnational character and mass-scale victimisation."
"An appropriate response against such a danger does not include only ex post facto intervention programmes but starts much earlier when dealing with such materials, their proper storage, limited access, controls, etc. At the same time, an aftermath intervention demands large-scale cooperation between different national authorities inside a Member State (civil protection, military, law enforcement, etc.) as well as between national authorities of different Member States and EU instances."
"Therefore, an all-hazard coordinated approach is needed."
"I voted for this report which sets out such a coordinated approach."
"There is no doubt that we need to protect ourselves from any malicious use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear products, material and organisms."
"However, it is their everyday use that we should be most wary of. The fact is, this text never once mentions the need to find an alternative to nuclear energy."
"At present, the latter poses a serious threat to our fellow citizens."
"As for terrorism, which is at the heart of this report, why call on NATO, the organisation that poses the biggest threat to world peace, to deal with it?"
"These are all inconsistencies that prevent me from voting for this text."
"I think that the EU should be prepared to face any attack or accident which jeopardises Europeans' security and health."
"For this reason, the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear Action Plan is necessary, both to prevent and to respond to any type of threat or accident occurring in EU territory."
"The current threats are varied, meaning that this issue is complex in nature, but we now have an appropriate and adequate mechanism to confront the most diverse of situations."
"This is why I voted as I did."
"Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks present a new dimension of possible terrorist attacks, accidents, natural disasters and/or pandemics due to their transnational character and mass-scale victimisation."
"An appropriate response against such a danger must start when dealing with these substances, their storage, limited access and controls. Aftermath interventions demand large-scale cooperation between different national authorities inside a Member State as well as between national authorities of different Member States and European bodies."
"The priority is to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and disarmament through the universal and full implementation of all relevant treaties and international agreements."
"It is also important to address the risk of proliferation by terrorists."
"The urgent establishment of a European crisis response mechanism is also necessary."
"It should coordinate civilian and military means so as to ensure that the European Union has a rapid response capability to deal with a CBRN disaster."
"Finally, European quality and security standards should also be adopted."
"I voted in favour because, unfortunately, at the given moment, if there is going to be no improvement in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security, the European Union will not be fully aware of the possible consequences."
"This report is a little note of explanation, not an action plan."
"In order to draw up a comprehensive document on the subject of nuclear security, specialists with wide experience of nuclear energy and in the uses of nuclear technology need to be involved."
"Such work can require several years, but it must be carried out."
"The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, cannot draw up such a document on its own."
"I voted in favour, but I consider that this report is a mere epilogue for a book on EU nuclear security."
"I hope that work on that book itself will begin in the immediate future."
"The security of the civilian population in the event of possible incidents of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear nature is a very important matter and ambitions in this regard should essentially be supported."
"Unfortunately, where this report is concerned, I have the feeling that the desire is to fight a terror spectre that, fortunately, does not exist in Europe in this highly organised form."
"Thus, the intention is to create more panic in order then to be able to implement a particular policy."
"Moreover, the report appears to deal predominantly with the subject of solidarity."
"I believe there is a point at which we should say 'enough' where terror prevention measures are concerned and the same goes for EU solidarity."
"I therefore abstained from voting on this report."
"I voted in favour of increasing chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security in the European Union and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to be the shadow rapporteur on this issue."
"Although prevention and protection from disasters caused by the substances mentioned is an issue for the Member States themselves, we need a common approach."
"This European Commission communication is a step towards a common action plan aiming to protect the public in the EU from various disasters."
"We are living in rather unstable times, and threats arise not only because of irresponsible human activity and accidents but also intentional acts."
"This issue is particularly relevant in my country, Lithuania, which is surrounded by chemical and nuclear hazards."
"Firstly, at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, there remain chemical weapons from the Second World War, and secondly, there are plans to construct two nuclear power plants near the Lithuanian border."
"We must assess the situation, the security standards currently in force and their suitability as regards current needs."
"Only by assessing the existing situation can we determine whether we need new security standards."
"This assessment and standard-setting framework must be sufficiently flexible so that it can be adapted to changing technologies, which, as well as making our lives easier, can also become a deadly weapon when in the hands of terrorists."
"On the other hand, providing security should not become a reason or a pretext to centralise civil protection."
"Although the establishment and supervision of common security standards would help to provide security, we should not, in every case, create new institutions or unduly complicated procedures."
"I voted in favour of the report on strengthening chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security in the European Union - an EU CBRN Action Plan, for the same reasons as those being put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"I would emphasise the need for an EU-level approach to prevent and detect attacks and/or accidents because the threat of CBRN attacks is 'global', and the focus given to the need to strengthen CBRN security if we are to prevent terrorist attacks."
"I would also point out the importance of the compromise reached between the two largest political groups in terms of reducing the extent to which the entire chemical industry was to be obliged to replace high-risk materials regardless of the risks involved."
"I can only support the rapporteur, Mrs Gomes, and I agree fully with the goal of the adopted chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) Action Plan."
"It should ensure the efficient interaction of national and European Union initiatives in addressing CBRN risks and preparing the necessary response."
"I agree, however, that the adopted EU CBRN Action Plan is weak and lacks coherence on several points."
"It is of crucial importance to stress that a CBRN Action Plan offers a valuable opportunity to implement the solidarity clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Unfortunately, the Action Plan adopted by the Council does not even make reference to the solidarity clause."
"Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks present a new dimension of possible terrorist attacks, accidents, natural disasters and/or pandemics due to their transnational character and mass-scale victimisation."
"An appropriate response against such a danger does not include only ex post facto intervention programmes but needs to start much earlier when dealing with such materials, their proper storage, limited access, controls, etc. At the same time, an aftermath intervention demands large-scale cooperation between different national authorities inside a Member State (civil protection, military, police etc.), as well as between national authorities in different Member States and EU instances."
"Therefore, an all-hazard coordinated approach is needed."
"I voted for this report because it calls on the Council and the Commission to rapidly review and strengthen the Action Plan according to the recommendations in this report and to ensure its swift implementation, given that CBRN accidents or attacks pose serious threats to the security of the people living in the European Union and can disrupt critical infrastructures and the normal functioning of societies in one or more EU Member States without any respect for borders."
"Attacks using chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) materials constitute a grave threat to the European public."
"This means that there must be recognition of the need to implement an effective Action Plan in order to ensure appropriate linkages between the approaches and initiatives of the different Member States and the EU regarding the prevention of, detection of, preparation for and response to CBRN incidents."
"in writing. - Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks present a new dimension of possible terrorist attacks, accidents, natural disasters and/or pandemics due to their transnational character and mass-scale victimisation."
"An appropriate response against such a danger does not include only ex post facto intervention programmes but starts much earlier when dealing with such materials, their proper storage, limited access, controls, etc. At the same time, an aftermath intervention demands large-scale cooperation between different national authorities inside a Member State (civil protection, military, law enforcement, etc.) as well as between national authorities of different Member States and EU bodies."
"Therefore, an all-hazard coordinated approach is needed."
"That is what we intend to do with the adoption of this report."
"I voted in favour of the present report and I consider it to be of great importance during a period of economic and financial crisis, since it is necessary to ensure that all European Union regions develop harmoniously."
"I agree with the general intention to create a tripartite agreement between the EU, Member States and the regions, since modernisation, interconnected infrastructure and assistance for investment plans and development projects respecting the specific characteristics of each region are fundamental."
"I also believe that continued investment in infrastructure in many European regions, particularly in the south and east, is essential."
"Given the different levels of decentralisation of the European regions, a balance must be found when designing a horizontal approach between the different levels of government and between all areas of activity."
"Efforts towards the administrative modernisation and reform of the regions, combined with high quality technical assistance from the Commission, are essential prerequisites to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of EU investments."
"The simplification of procedures and the allocation of resources from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in a manner which is accessible to all interested parties is essential."
"This will guarantee, on the one hand, the participation of all actors in society and, on the other, better application of EU programmes, instruments and policies."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this important resolution as the implementation of the cohesion policy is predominantly decentralised and based on sub-national authorities assuming responsibility."
"I agree that the multi-level approach should be applied not only vertically but also horizontally, among actors of the same level, in all shared-competence Union policies including the cohesion policy, which plays a forerunner role in the application of multi-level governance, as an instrument to improve the quality of decision-making processes through the active involvement of sub-national authorities from the pre-legislative phase of the debates."
"Also, it is important to stress that funding application procedures are too complicated, and an excessive number of checks are likely to discourage potential beneficiaries of cohesion policy from the efficient absorption of funds and maximisation of their impact."
"Therefore, there must be sufficient administrative capacity both at EU and at regional and local level in order to increase the added value of the cohesion policy and ensure the sustainability of actions."
"I decided to vote for this report because we need to send out a strong signal of Europe's desire to work with local, and particularly regional, administrations."
"At a time of various degrees of decentralisation in the Member States, we need to show that the European Parliament is also fully engaged with making regional politics an instrument for better governance in Europe."
"To my mind, regional policy is one of the EU's most important policies."
"The funds it distributes throughout Europe contribute to cohesion between the different regions and help them to become competitive."
"However, certain things can be improved, particularly in the area of multi-level governance; in other words, the coordinated action of the Union, of Member States and of regional and local entities."
"Regional policy suffers from the complexity of its procedures, which often deter local players from having recourse to it."
"Nevertheless, despite these procedures, the number of irregularities is still too high."
"I voted for this European Parliament initiative, which emphasises the crucial role that local authorities play in implementing regional policy while, at the same time, calling for multi-level governance to be improved."
"It also recommends better follow-up on the part of the Commission, with regard to both supporting regional players and making sure the funds are put to good use."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Romanian fellow Member, Mrs Mănescu, on good governance with regard to the EU regional policy: procedures of assistance and control by the European Commission."
"I welcome the demand for simplification, because this is a precondition for a better understanding and use of European funds by local officials."
"Like the overwhelming majority of my fellow Members, I am in favour of a strong cohesion policy where financial resources are maintained after 2013, while rejecting any attempts at renationalisation."
"I would add, on a personal level, that the best way to prevent cohesion policy from being renationalised is to 'Europeanise' it."
"I find it regrettable that all too often, cohesion policy resources are used for projects with a regional or sometimes national dimension, but rarely with a European one."
"European Union cohesion policy is the principle means of ensuring sustainable regional development."
"Implementation of cohesion policy is predominantly decentralised and based on sub-national authorities assuming responsibility."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has allowed territorial authorities to be more deeply involved in the decision-making process, to facilitate better and more effective implementation of cohesion policy measures, adapted to the needs of individual regions and their populations."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"I feel that it is necessary to maximise the potential for territorial cooperation, which, in some regions, has hitherto gone untapped, and to promote more active application of the principle of partnership, ensuring effective cooperation between the private and the public sectors."
"Mrs Mănescu's report seeks to bring the European Union closer to its citizens: it advocates better control by the Commission of local authorities' involvement in the development of cohesion policy."
"This document is part of a process to simplify very complex administrative procedures aimed at developing our regions and stepping up collaboration between local authorities in the various Member States."
"The fact that it has been adopted by a large majority confirms the importance given to improving the use of European funds."
"I voted in favour of this report because in cohesion policy, decision-making processes are improved through the application of multi-level governance and the involvement of sub-national authorities."
"Supervision by the Commission, as currently foreseen, is considered insufficient and cannot compensate for ineffective control systems at national level persisting throughout the whole multiannual period."
"Therefore, in order to improve the control system and increase assistance to sub-national authorities, it is necessary for the Commission to strengthen its supervisory role and procedures."
"Higher investments, both in financial assistance and training, should be ensured for national and regional administrations to increase the capacities and knowledge of rules by authorities in charge of programme management."
"It should also be noted that the current funding application procedures that are too complicated are likely to discourage potential beneficiaries of cohesion policy."
"Therefore, in the future, we need to develop a more user-friendly policy with better coordinated Structural Fund rules."
"in writing. - Conservative MEPs abstained on the final vote on the Mănescu report for the following reasons."
"Firstly, the report promises to maintain a strongly-funded cohesion policy, whereas we believe that the cohesion and social funds should not be ring-fenced, and that the EU should rather concentrate spending on the new challenges it faces instead of old priorities such as cohesion policy."
"It is also our contention that the content of this report fails to provide meaningful progress in terms of more stringent and greater control over the funding allocated under these programmes; if anything, the proposals in this report only serve to further obfuscate delivery mechanisms and muddy the waters."
"We would also have liked to see the report cogently address the issues raised by the European Court of Auditors related to such funding, which it singularly fails to do."
"Consequently, Conservative MEPs have abstained on the final vote."
"The decentralisation of Member States' powers is based on sharing responsibilities between the different levels of government."
"For this reason, the capacity of regional and local authorities to implement EU policy has been strengthened."
"I agree with the adoption of this resolution, since it focuses on the specific nature of local and regional challenges, calling attention to the need to consider integrated approaches which emphasise the regions' specific characteristics, such as their geographical and natural disadvantages, depopulation and the specific characteristics of the outermost regions, but which also recognises the different administrative processes existing in the various Member States."
"These approaches must also allow the coordination of the interests of the various actors involved in order to facilitate governance at several levels."
"The resolution also points to the fact that application procedures are too complicated and have an excessive number of checks which discourages potential beneficiaries of cohesion policy, as well as to the requirement to consult the general public in order to legitimise the decision-making process."
"I also agree that a stronger role for the regional and local level must correspond to a strengthened supervisory role for the Commission, and to increased coordination between cohesion and structural policies."
"I voted for this report which proposes to reinforce multi-level governance with a view to achieving greater involvement by sub-national authorities at the policy development stage."
"I think that citizens' interests will be much better represented if regional and local authorities are involved in the decision-making process right from the outset."
"Furthermore, the European Commission's role in monitoring the way in which the Structural Funds are managed is unarguable."
"However, this audit role of the European Commission needs to be enhanced."
"The Cohesion Fund accounts for more than one third of the total EU budget."
"Its ultimate aim is to reduce disparities between levels of economic development in the various regions, targeting resources specifically towards growth and employment."
"However, the Financial Times newspaper recently published an investigation over how Cohesion Fund resources are, in fact, spent and the scenario described is very worrying: the fund is used for purposes which are categorically not those intended."
"For this same reason, I consider it crucial to strengthen the Commission's control procedures relating to the application and usage of the Cohesion Fund, reinforcing the mechanisms of good governance."
"We agree with the need to guarantee respect for criteria relating to effectiveness, efficiency, rigour and transparency 'in all the phases of Structural Fund programming and implementation'."
"We recognise that the 'ongoing simplification of the Financial Regulation and of the Structural Funds rules' could be essential in terms of lifting certain existing barriers to accessing them, particularly by less developed regions."
"Regarding the principle of cofinancing, whilst we recognise the importance of the assumption of responsibilities by national authorities when applying cohesion policy, we consider that, in view of the current profound crisis, something which has particularly affected certain Member States and their regions, the rules relating to cofinancing should be made more flexible."
"This will allow a better absorption of the funds set aside for cohesion policy."
"In particular, the maximum rate of cofinancing should be lowered to 10% for all Structural Funds."
"We still disagree with and oppose some aspects of the report."
"One example is the 'good governance' advocated for public services which, according to the rapporteur, can only be achieved through a partnership of 'public and private parties'."
"Another example is the patchwork of uncritical references to the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy: a strategy driven by liberalisation, privatisation and increased labour market flexibility which is an approach entirely at odds with the objectives of cohesion policy."
"I approved of this report because the 2006 report of the European Court of Auditors showed that the control systems in place for the cohesion policy were not effective enough, and the error rate in the expenditure reimbursed was too great (12%)."
"The 2008 report confirmed this data with 11% of funds unduly reimbursed."
"Overly complex rules governing the Structural Funds are partly responsible for these errors."
"The shared management system characterising the cohesion policy implies a high degree of complexity in the interpretation and application of the rules given the numerous actors involved."
"Therefore, rules should be simplified to ensure more user-friendly procedures and not discourage potential beneficiaries from participating in projects."
"in writing. - Over the last decades, decentralisation of powers in several Member States has considerably reinforced regional and local authorities' competences in the delivery of Community policies."
"The incorporation by the Reform Treaty of sub-national subsidiarity into the Community law for the policies of shared competence allows today territorial authorities to be more deeply involved in the decision-making process, both for the design and the implementation of policies, as fully dignified partners, to participate in achieving the Community objectives."
"This important step towards better multi-level governance answers repeated requests by the Parliament to reinforce the involvement of the sub-national authorities in the conception of policies, always respecting the different national constitutional assets."
"An efficient implementation depends strongly on how policies are conceived; involving local and regional authorities also in this phase - as those knowing best the needs of their territory and of its population - is an assurance of more effective results at a later stage."
"It is crucial to place the emphasis on the pre-legislative phase of the decision-making process and on the added value offered by policies and best practices implemented at local and regional level to the development of territorial strategies in the EU."
"This text acts as a foil to the creation of European macro-regions."
"In order to further impose these competitive clusters to serve the interests of the sacrosanct common market, this House is proposing that they be overseen by the European Commission to the detriment of elected governments."
"EU regional policy should be centred on reducing inequalities in the income and living conditions of those living in the European regions."
"We are a far cry from that."
"Given that some regions possess clear geographical and natural disadvantages such as depopulation, among other things, I believe that this measure is fundamental if we are to make cohesion policy more effective."
"It is fundamental for there to be greater rigour in applying the Cohesion Fund so that asymmetries between the Member States and regions of the EU can be reduced."
"In this way, we will create a process which is more transparent, less bureaucratic and more equitable in terms of funding distribution."
"As a result, there will be fewer gaps between levels of competitiveness."
"This is why I voted as I did."
"At last!"
"At last, someone has given some thought to what is referred to as regional policy."
"Taking the example of Latvia alone, I can honestly say that not even I have been able to extract information from the officials at the Latvian Ministry of Economics on plans for the application of EU Structural Funds."
"This information is kept in great secrecy from the people of Latvia."
"In return for what sort of 'appreciation', however, is it possible to find out about the European Commission's plans in relation to Latvia and, possibly, receive funding?"
"I voted in favour in the hope that the process will become accessible to everyone, and that no one will make a secret of the European Commission's plans."
"The report aims to strengthen the role of the Commission in supporting regional and local authorities."
"This is an attempt to extend the overall power of the Commission and that is something to which I must most definitely express my opposition."
"I therefore voted against this motion."
"Over recent years, the European Union has seen local authorities become increasingly significant in the Member States."
"Decentralisation of the management of the territory to smaller, local bodies has meant that, due to the principle of subsidiarity, these have assumed greater power and influence, mainly concerning specific competences delegated to them by the Member States."
"Regional authorities have therefore found themselves in direct contact with the European institutions."
"I voted for Mrs Mănescu's report, precisely because in this situation, there is a need for greater control and support for regional policies from the European Commission."
"The report also targets the adoption of a White Paper on territorial cohesion, which would be a real step forward for the EU towards a new multi-level governance that ingrates perfectly with European, national and regional competences."
"The principle of sub-national subsidiarity, introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, puts into practice the aim of involving the regions in the European decision-making process."
"The increase in dialogue with the European Commission involves the principles of good governance in relation to regional policy and the adoption of other procedures of assistance and control."
"I voted in favour of the present report, which deals with the competences and role of regional and local authorities in the process of implementing cohesion policy."
"Regional authorities can now participate more directly and more actively in the decision-making process. This includes drawing up and implementing policy, and being treated as true partners in realising EU objectives."
"I welcome this important step for governance, which responds to the repeated calls by the European Parliament for an increase in sub-national entities' participation in drawing up and implementing European policy."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Mănescu, on her excellent work and I agree with her that the potential of territorial cooperation can be better exploited through multi-level governance, thanks to the relationships developed between private and public actors across national borders."
"I also agree on promoting the exchange of information between the European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) that have already been created, as well as those in the process of being set up within the framework of existing programmes."
"Over recent decades, the decentralisation of powers in several Member States has reinforced regional and local authorities' competences considerably in the development of Community policies."
"Emphasising the prelegislative phase of the decision-making process and the added value offered by the policies and best practices implemented at local and regional level to the development of territorial strategies in the EU helps ensure their effectiveness and sustainability."
"The following aspects need to be considered to see how the multi-level governance approach can be improved in the area of cohesion policy: the vertical and horizontal dimensions of governance, setting up real partnerships with local and regional authorities, territorial cohesion and cooperation, simplification of rules at EU and national level (Member States should simplify their national provisions and develop a stronger culture of evaluation at all levels in order to ensure effective controls and avoid errors - in 2008, 11% of funds were mistakenly reimbursed)."
"The Commission's role needs to be strengthened in supporting regional and local authorities, with serious reflection about the ways in which to improve governance and, consequently, the effectiveness of the delivery system of the Structural Funds for the period after 2013."
"I believe that it is necessary to improve governance in the area of regional policy with a view to making the management of the Structural Funds and of cohesion policy not only more effective, but also more balanced."
"I agree with the rapporteur in seeking from the Commission a policy which will, in future, put more emphasis on results, based, above all, on the quality of intervention and the development of strategic projects."
"I also believe that European networks for exchanging best practices should strengthen their initiatives, as this will contribute to our assurance with regard to the application of these procedures in practice."
"in writing. - Over the last few decades, the decentralisation of powers in several Member States has considerably reinforced regional and local authorities' competences in the delivery of Community policies."
"The incorporation by the reform treaty of sub-national subsidiarity into Community law for policies of shared competence today allows territorial authorities to be more deeply involved in the decision-making process, both for the design and the implementation of policies, as fully dignified partners, to participate in achieving the Community objectives."
"This important step towards better multi-level governance answers repeated requests by Parliament to reinforce the involvement of the sub-national authorities in the conception of policies always respecting the different national constitutional assets."
"The decentralisation of government brings increased responsibility to regional and local authorities."
"Indeed, it is authorities at local level which best understand the needs of their regions and the people who live there, thanks to which they can adapt general objectives to their own potential and possibilities."
"We will achieve success if the Member States identify with the work they undertake and responsibility for it is devolved to authorities at the appropriate level."
"We should support a grass-roots approach, which should be flexible and integrated."
"It is important for cohesion policy to be user friendly."
"There is a need to reduce administrative costs and simplify procedures, the complicated nature of which, in many cases, not only results in mistakes, but often discourages beneficiaries from using support which is available to them."
"We talk about reducing the risk of error, but we should not forget the plans and objectives upon which we have decided."
"I am thinking, here, of innovative measures."
"We have given an important place to innovative methods, so we have to reckon with the risk and possibility of mistakes being made."
"We should, therefore, ask ourselves if we want to undertake work of an experimental nature in the spirit of the priorities of the 2020 strategy, or if we would rather reduce the number of mistakes, which would mean discouraging our citizens from undertaking innovative but sometimes uncertain work."
"Good governance in European regional policy is essential if such policy is to be successful."
"Governance must be given a greater presence at several levels, with the aim of strengthening the participation of all institutions in the legislative process."
"With this in mind, it is fundamental that there should be an increase in the involvement of regional and local authorities in both the pre-legislative and implementation phases of such policies."
"I would emphasise the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon recognises sub-national subsidiarity, not only in the sphere of regional policy, but also horizontally, which is to say, in all European policies."
"I believe that with more and better participation at the various levels of decision making, the aim of territorial cohesion, based on a vision of integration, will be realised."
"However, a bottom-up perspective should be adopted, because it is local and regional institutions which can best understand the characteristics and problems of the regions."
"The Territorial Pact of Local and Regional Authorities on Europe 2020 can add to the strengthening of this contribution to the goals of intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"The principles of partnership and cofinancing will contribute to an increase in the responsibility of these institutions and the European Commission should see its supervisory role strengthened, particularly by improving the control and audit system."
"in writing. - I voted for this report as it makes important calls on the Commission to strengthen its monitoring role in order to reduce the error rate highlighted in the recent report by the Court of Auditors."
"The Commission should also consult local and regional authorities at all stages of legislation relating to the regions to make them more accountable in producing a more results-oriented policy."
"This should also help to reduce the level of error, improve control systems and increase assistance to sub-national authorities and beneficiaries."
"I feel this report goes a long way to promoting better cooperation between regions in different Member States, which will only have a positive effect in achieving the aims of cohesion policy across the EU and ensuring that all European Union regions develop harmoniously."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which aims to harness the know-how and experience of immigration liaison officers for the benefit of Frontex and vice-versa."
"This was not a matter addressed in the original regulation adopted in 2004."
"There is a clear need for the amendments and for new issues to be included in order to improve the functioning of Frontex, such as exploitation of the information obtained through the liaison officer networks and exchange of this via ICONet (secure Information and Coordination Network for Member States' migration management services), accessing the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officer networks and facilitate their operation and, lastly, expediting the system for the presentation of half-yearly reports."
"I am convinced that those amendments are very timely and necessary as the EU has to face and manage the increased flow of legal - and also illegal - immigration."
"Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 of 19 February 2004 established an immigration liaison officers network."
"These officers are representatives of Member States posted in a third country and are responsible for facilitating the EU's efforts to combat illegal immigration, in particular, by gathering information for the European Frontex agency."
"However, coordination in the context of this policy, which is still in its infancy, can be improved."
"Meetings between these liaison officers and Commission and Frontex representatives should be taking place."
"Furthermore, better cooperation with other bodies, such as the European Asylum Support Office and the Office for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, should be encouraged."
"That is why it was deemed necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 377/2004."
"I gave my support to this text which, as well as reiterating the fundamental rights conditions to be fulfilled by this policy, provides the means by which to effectively control the management of the EU's external borders."
"I agree with the amendment of the regulation aiming to enhance cooperation between Frontex and immigration liaison officers."
"More active cooperation would help Frontex carry out its principle functions in combating illegal immigration, i.e. preventing illegal immigration and returning illegal immigrants."
"As the agency's activities concern migration within EU territory, immigration liaison officers posted to third countries can make a decisive contribution to Frontex achieving its objectives outside the Union."
"The agency would thus have an opportunity for a more effective exchange of information with the competent authorities of third countries or with international organisations on EU border control issues, through the training of border guards, operational information exchanges and joint operations."
"It would be possible to exchange information via ICONet (secure Information and Coordination Network for Member States' migration management services)."
"I voted in favour of this European Parliament report because, with the increase in migration flows, it is important to create liaison officer networks."
"Given that the current economic, financial and social crisis has encouraged even more people to migrate, the European Union must do all it can to ensure that immigration flows are properly managed."
"The creation of networks would not only help to regulate legal, irregular and illegal immigration, but would also facilitate operational cooperation between the Member States and expedite the system for the presentation of the half-yearly reports."
"Furthermore, closer cooperation between officers would guarantee a better exchange of technical knowledge and liaison with colleagues working in third countries."
"I would like to underline that the European Union institutions should constantly strive to ensure a safe and swift immigration process and guarantee that EU citizens are protected from the possible dangers posed by irregular and illegal immigration."
"This can only be achieved by using all possible effective instruments of international and internal cooperation."
"I believe that Parliament's position on amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network contributes to the appropriate management of legal as well as illegal or clandestine flows of migrants."
"In fact, it is necessary to strengthen the synergies and operational cooperation between the Member States and third countries, in particular, through the liaison officers."
"I also believe that it is fundamental to analyse the activities of the immigration liaison officer networks in regions and/or countries of special interest to the European Union, particularly where the circumstances of these regions and/or countries have a bearing on illegal immigration or human rights issues."
"For its part, the Commission should develop recommendations on developing immigration liaison officer networks."
"I voted against the report on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network because it is designed to further reinforce Frontex, which does all it can to promote the idea of Fortress Europe."
"In other words, the idea is to replace the progress needed in immigration and asylum policies with repressive policies, which not only conflict with basic principles and rights, but which are also ineffective and have a disastrous impact on host communities and communities of origin and on the lives of refugees and immigrants."
"I voted for this report as I think that it makes significant improvements in the management of immigration flows in the European Union."
"Enhancing the remit of immigration liaison offers located in third countries will help Frontex as a whole operate more efficiently, given that it will be based on information and assistance from these officers."
"Another point which is also just as important is that these liaison officers will be obliged to respect fundamental rights during their mission."
"Indeed, regular reports will be submitted to the European Parliament for scrutiny regarding the monitoring of respect for these rights."
"Following the formal creation of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), it has become necessary to make the best possible use of Union border resources."
"In this regard, it has become imperative to institute closer cooperation between the immigration liaison officer networks and Frontex."
"Using the skills of both immigration liaison officers and Frontex, based on an exchange of information obtained from the liaison officer networks through the Information and Coordination Network for Member States' migration management services, will enable better risk analysis by Frontex, as well as more cooperation in relation to legal and illegal immigration."
"As shadow rapporteur on this dossier, I supported Mr Diaz de Mera's report, which has enabled us to go beyond the technical changes proposed by the Commission by gaining a better understanding of the complexity and lack of transparency of the work carried out by immigration liaison officers (ILO)."
"In the context of 'mixed' migratory flows, it is indeed crucial to include in their activities an approach that is more mindful and respectful of human rights."
"The assignments carried out by ILOs also need to reflect greater transparency and greater democratic supervision; this is now the case, with the exchange of information between the European Parliament, on the one hand, and organisations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), on the other, being strengthened."
"Given the Council's opposition, the compromise finally found to solve the terminological controversy ('illegal' immigration versus 'irregular' immigration) seems satisfactory, but it can only be a first step."
"The European institutions will have to make good their commitment."
"The exchange of best practices between different countries' police forces is sometimes necessary and its objectives commendable."
"We should remember, however, that international police cooperation existed way back in the 19th century, long before European integration."
"This report proposes, in the context of Frontex (European Agency at the External Borders of the Member States), an improvement in the exchange of information on illegal migratory flows, illegal immigration and the deportation of persons residing without authorisation, including the introduction of immigration liaison officers networks."
"One could welcome this new initiative, which the majority of Europeans want, were it really aimed at dramatically reducing immigration."
"However, the reality is altogether different, and this agency's work, like the measures taken by the national governments, has resulted in failure."
"France and Europe are being swamped with immigrants."
"Around 900 000 people enter Europe illegally each year, according to an 'official' European Union figure."
"Given that illegal immigrants, and even foreign criminals, are not sent back to their country of origin, one is entitled to wonder how yet more provisions could reverse migratory flows without real political courage backed up by action."
"in writing. - The proposal amending Council Regulation (EC) No 337/2004 aims to harness the know-how and experience of immigration liaison officers for the benefit of Frontex and vice-versa, which was not a matter addressed in the original regulation."
"The amending proposal has the following objectives: harnessing of the know-how of liaison officers and of Frontex for their mutual benefit; exploitation of the information obtained through the liaison officer networks and exchange of this via ICONet (secure Information and Coordination Network for Member States' migration management services); accessing of the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officer networks and facilitate their operation and, lastly, to expedite the system for the presentation of the half-yearly reports."
"I welcome this measure."
"Following the formal creation of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), it has become necessary to make the best possible use of Union border resources."
"In this regard, it is necessary to institute closer cooperation between the various immigration liaison officer networks and Frontex."
"Exchanging information and skills between immigration liaison officers and Frontex using the Information and Coordination Network for Member States' migration management services will enable better risk analysis by Frontex, as well as better control over legal and illegal immigration."
"I am in favour of this regulation, which seeks to amend the regulation of 19 February 2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network."
"These amendments are necessary as a result of the way in which European law in this area has developed and is practised."
"The new regulation makes provision for, among other things: • a legal basis between Frontex and the liaison officers; • better use of ICONet and; • increased rationalisation of the reporting systems pertaining to the network's activities."
"With this new regulation, we hope that this immigration liaison officers network will become more effective."
"The border protection agency Frontex plays an important role when it comes to combating illegal immigration."
"This can only be effectively combated in the transit countries."
"A dense network of immigration liaison officers and their close cooperation is therefore a sensible measure to enable us effectively to combat mass immigration into Europe with all its negative consequences for the peoples of Europe."
"However, this will only be the case if the information and assessments provided by liaison officers are made available to Frontex and the national authorities as quickly as possible and without any red tape."
"As regards cooperation in particular, there is still potential for improvement and this needs to be exploited with regard to the issue of immigration."
"For example, the powers of Frontex should, with the consent of the Member States, be enhanced as quickly as possible in order to ensure that its work is uniform and effective, particularly at the external borders."
"It would be important to have a comprehensive strategy for how the external borders of the EU can be better protected and the causes of emigration from the countries of origin better combated."
"This is a task for the Commission."
"Although the report does not deal adequately with these considerations, it represents an improvement on the current situation and, for that reason, I voted in favour of it."
"The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network introduces amendments which aim to use the knowledge and experience of immigration liaison officers for the benefit of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) and vice versa."
"In fact, Frontex could not yet be fully operational without the creation of such a network of liaison officers."
"I agree with the objectives of the proposed amendment, in particular: actions to make the most of the knowledge and experience of liaison officers and of Frontex; making use of information obtained through networks of liaison agents via the Information and Coordination Network for Member States' migration management services; permission to use the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of networks of liaison officers and simplify their operations; and, finally, improvements to the system of submitting biannual activity reports."
"I agree with Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra in relation to the decisive contribution that immigration liaison officers posted to third countries could, by virtue of their remits, make to Frontex achieving its objectives, especially considering that the agency has no representation outside the European Union."
"I also support the amending proposal, which will have the following objectives: to harness the know-how of liaison officers and of Frontex for their mutual benefit; to exploit the information obtained through the liaison officer networks and exchange this via ICONet (secure Information and Coordination Network for Member States' migration management services); to access the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officer networks and facilitate their operation; and, lastly, to expedite the system for the presentation of the half-yearly reports."
"I believe that amending the regulation is essential to providing a genuine platform for the exchange of information between immigration liaison officers and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union."
"The exchanging of information will definitely add value to the work of both parties."
"in writing. - When the regulation now being amended was adopted on 19 February 2004, Frontex was yet to be officially established."
"It was eight months later, on 26 October 2004, that the Council adopted the Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders."
"By virtue of the remits set out in its rules of procedure, Frontex is responsible for carrying out risk analysis based on the information gathered by the competent authorities in the Member States, for facilitating operational cooperation between the Member States and third countries, and for cooperating with the competent authorities of third countries and with international organisations through, for example, exchanges of experience on border control issues, the training of border guards, operational information exchanges and joint operations."
"The amendments proposed here are appropriate and necessary."
"The troubled times that the European Union is experiencing demand appropriate management of immigration flows."
"This should be seen as having two facets: management of legal immigration and management of illegal and clandestine immigration."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution as economic immigration is a growing challenge for the EU."
"Therefore, the EU must develop balanced legal immigration channels which meet the needs of our labour markets while taking account of the demographic and economic challenges which the EU will face in the near future."
"I am convinced that the adoption of this directive will simplify procedures for the admission of third-country nationals for employment purposes, will reduce administrative costs and will also make it easier to check on people admitted to the territory of a Member State and authorised to work there."
"With reference to the simplified procedure, I have to stress that the implementation of legal requirements and transparency of decision making by national authorities must be ensured."
"I agree with the rapporteur that these decisions on the admission of third-country nationals for employment purposes have a strong impact on the life of the persons concerned, and must therefore be taken in a way which is completely transparent."
"The directive on a single residence and work permit in all the Member States of the EU and the European Parliament report on it view immigrants as cheap labour, at the mercy of the cruel exploitation of capital."
"An immigrant will only have the right to stay in the territory of a Member State of the EU if he works to swell the coffers of the plutocracy."
"Otherwise, he will be considered illegal and will be treated as an unwanted object, imprisoned for up to 18 months and thrown out."
"Nothing sets immigrants apart from local workers in the Member States of the EU."
"They are united by the common fate of the worker, the exploited, the producers of the wealth seized by capital."
"The fight for the fair demands of immigrants, for their legalisation, for the abolition of black-market and uninsured work, for higher salaries and wages, for an equal day's pay for an equal day's work, for full protection of social and civil rights and for the repeal of the Dublin agreement is a joint fight."
"Immigrants' problems will only be resolved by integrating them into the working class movement and stepping up its fight against the anti-grassroots and chauvinist policy of the EU and its bourgeois governments, which are responsible for the poverty and misery of local and immigrant workers in the EU and throughout the world."
"I am convinced that we will only be able to fight illegal immigration and undeclared work effectively through balanced legal immigration channels that are mindful of the needs of the labour market."
"The advantages deriving from the adoption of this directive are obvious: the issuance of a single document authorising residence and access to the labour market constitutes a considerable simplification of the admission system, will reduce its costs and cut procedure times."
"The adoption of this directive is needed in order to introduce additional measures regarding seasonal workers and workers posted within their undertaking and, hence, I hope that this takes place as soon as possible, with due regard to the competence of Member States to decide maximum entrance quotas for workers from third countries."
"On Wednesday, we voted on the draft directive by my colleague, Véronique Mathieu, on the creation of a single residency and work permit for migrant workers."
"I voted for this text. Unfortunately, it was not adopted."
"This text allowed for the alignment of the system applicable to foreign workers and thus tackled social dumping."
"By regulating illegal immigration more effectively, it enabled the Union to clamp down on undeclared work and on illegal sectors."
"The socialists opposed this directive on the pretext that its scope excluded some categories."
"However, the liberals' position was totally unexpected and led to the text being rejected."
"Having seen one of their positions on a rejected amendment, they voted against the whole text without having warned us beforehand about the importance they attached to that point."
"That is how a year of precious work has been wasted."
"People must realise that the European Parliament is not subordinate to the Council."
"From now on, even with regard to immigration, Member States must take MEPs seriously."
"The ordinary legislative procedure is a reality."
"The draft directive on the single permit for third-country nationals was rejected in plenary: that is a strong signal on the part of Parliament because the issue was a crucial one."
"For years, we have been talking about creating a single permit for third-country nationals who wish to live and work in a Member State."
"It was a laudable initiative to start with, but the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), as they stand, deny the very essence of a single permit."
"They also go against equal treatment for all and create different categories of workers, which is quite simply unacceptable."
"Equal treatment cannot be compromised."
"Thus, in response to these PPE amendments, we voted by a majority against the final proposal: with 350 votes to 306, it has been rejected and will have to be sent back to the European Commission."
"We need to do better: yes to a responsible common immigration policy but no to a restrictive and discriminatory one!"
"When it voted today on the directive on a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State, the European Parliament blocked the European Commission's proposal and returned it to the competent parliamentary committees for the contents of the proposal for a directive to be further improved."
"This vote is a victory for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and all workers in the European Union."
"I would like to stress that because the framework of the directive we were promised was already deleted from the Commission's proposal, as certain categories of workers, such as seasonal workers, intra-company transfers and refugees were deleted from its contents, the European Parliament could not approve such a directive."
"This directive should be a general framework directive on rights for third-country workers and should serve as a framework for specific directives, because only then will the European Union goal of a common migration policy be achieved."
"By voting in this way, we demonstrated that the European Union cannot be home to a double labour market with double standards, because this would undermine all the social standards we have gained previously."
"in writing. - I have voted in favour of Amendments 30, 34, 65, 103, 109 and 114 because although I fully support the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, I believe that regulation of access to labour markets, social security schemes and public housing are matters to be regulated by the Member States which should not be regulated at Community level."
"By ratifying the abovementioned UN Convention, Member States have pledged to implement it in their domestic systems without ceding any powers in that regard to the Union."
"The report on the single permit to reside and work in the European Union has given us the chance to reflect upon and discuss the important role that immigrants can have in our societies."
"Legal entry, effective integration and respect for the law are essential preconditions for this important role and allow for greater participation by immigrants in the shared development of their adopted communities."
"In this regard, the single permit voted upon can provide a way to manage entries and safeguard the rights and duties of all the people who make up a community."
"I supported the proposal for a directive, including the parts that are without prejudice to the more favourable provisions contained in EU legislation and international instruments."
"I regret that this House has not adopted the proposal being discussed, which I believe could make a useful contribution to the creation of a European area of freedom and integration between people that wish to work together for the growth of the EU."
"For years, we have been talking about creating a single permit for third-country nationals who wish to live and work in a Member State."
"This is a commendable initiative, the initial objective of which is to simplify the administrative requirements for third-country nationals by enabling them to obtain a work permit and a residence permit via a 'one-stop shop' procedure."
"The initial legislative proposal stipulated that workers from third countries should enjoy the same treatment as nationals with respect to employment rights (such as access to social security, education and training)."
"However, according to the text as amended by the rapporteur, Member States would have been authorised to restrict some of these rights."
"This is contrary to equal treatment and is not acceptable."
"We therefore voted by a majority against the final proposal, which was rejected."
"Formulating a humane and reasonable immigration policy will be a fundamental challenge for society over the next few years, but it can only be done at European level so as to avoid electoral agendas and national knee-jerk reactions."
"The issue in question in this proposal is the introduction of a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in the EU."
"This presupposes the existence of rules common to all Member States, which aims to put an end to the current differences in approach of the various EU countries and which would make the process of giving legal status to workers quicker, more uniform and more transparent throughout the Union."
"On the one hand, the legal migration of labour and, above all, qualified labour, helps to fight clandestine working, and can improve the competitiveness of the economy and overcome existing scarcities."
"On the other hand, however, we cannot forget that, during a period of economic crisis and vulnerability, when unemployment is growing, labour migration policy must be flexible, as argued by the Commission, but also sustainable and reasonable."
"I am genuinely disappointed about the rejection of the report by Mrs Mathieu on the single application procedure for a residence and work permit."
"It was balanced report that was much improved at the voting stage by the amendments of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which were accepted with the decisive contribution of liberals and conservatives."
"I am saddened by the failure of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to respect the agreement and the mistaken assessment by the European Conservatives and Reformists, which open the doors to a new proposal from the Commission, which is likely to be inferior to the current one."
"The opportunity for legal immigrants to obtain the necessary residence and work documents by means of a single procedure for the entire territory of the European Union would have been a decisive step forward, and a right and proper corollary to the necessary reinforcement of the fight against illegal immigration through greater cooperation with the coastal Member States and the strengthening of Frontex."
"Instead, as has been the case on a number of other occasions, it is some stubborn ideological remnants of the Left that prevail, who, in pursuing the indiscriminate opening of borders, end up denying the need to protect honest foreigners who come to Europe for work."
"We consider it very significant that this proposal for a directive on a single application procedure for a single residency and work permit has been rejected by a majority of the European Parliament, as Parliament's text, already negotiated with the Council, only served the interests of large firms and economic groups."
"These groups were pressing for social dumping so that they could have a foreign workforce that they could exploit with low wages and few rights."
"Although put forth under the pretext of a single regulation, such groups in practice wanted to legalise social dumping, strengthen job insecurity, increase inequality and open the way for different outcomes and laws to put the principles of equality and justice for all workers into jeopardy."
"In some ways, they wished to resurrect the country of origin principle from the infamous Bolkestein Directive, which was rejected after concerted resistance by workers."
"Now, the resistance and arguments of workers and unions in various Member States has had repercussions for the European Parliament, demonstrating that the struggle has been worthwhile."
"Portuguese workers also contributed to this positive result, through the general strike of 24 November."
"However, it is necessary to maintain our vigilance."
"At a time when almost 25 million Europeans are registered as unemployed, a directive aimed at facilitating the immigration of job seekers has once again been tabled."
"You have to admit that there is something obscene about that."
"What is more, this text sought to guarantee certain economic and social rights to these immigrant workers, allegedly to avoid any social dumping or unfair competition with indigenous workers or workers who are already in Europe."
"This is an implicit admission that immigration pushes down European wages and does not make up for any labour shortages, but, on the contrary, results in direct competition for our workers."
"Some amendments, in wanting to promote equal rights - and equal costs - between residents and immigrants, were, in fact, tantamount to allowing every kind of immigrant, whether working or not, access to our social benefits."
"This represents a choice between social dumping and automatic handouts which is no longer bearable, neither politically nor financially."
"It is time to decide, at Member State level, to reverse migratory flows, which have become unbearable economic, social and even cultural burdens, and to practise national and Community preference in all areas."
"The EU Member States face a constant struggle with the problem of illegal immigration and work carried out in what is known as the shadow economy by citizens of third countries."
"Appropriate steps must be taken to counteract these problems effectively."
"Simplifying and standardising procedures for issuing entry and residence permits for citizens of third countries in order for them to start working in a Member State will help limit illegal immigration."
"At the same time, it will make it possible for the workforce requirements of European markets to be met."
"The proposed regulations leave a certain margin of discretion to accepting countries, especially with regard to conditions for refusal of entry."
"This ensures an appropriate level of legal security and that there will be no interference in Member States' competences."
"The directive under discussion will make it possible for all Member States to adopt a common position on economic immigration."
"This will ensure transparent regulations, security and legal protection for workers who suffer discrimination, a continued fight against illegal immigration and, finally, measures to combat unfair competition."
"For this reason, I agree with the rapporteur's position."
"in writing. - In 2001, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities."
"Despite a favourable opinion from the European Parliament, this ambitious proposal, which sought to establish the entry and residence conditions for third-country nationals wishing to undertake an economic activity within the Union, did not survive beyond its first reading within the Council, and the Commission officially withdrew it in 2006."
"I welcome the fact that the new legal basis provided by the Lisbon Treaty gives this proposal a good chance of being adopted."
"I voted in favour of this report, together with my group, because I believe that it responds well to the considerable demographic challenges that the European Union will face in the coming years by establishing a single application procedure for third-country nationals who wish to be admitted to the territory of a Member State in order to work there, and by offering them a secure legal status."
"Unfortunately, Parliament's rejection will delay the analysis of this important directive, which would have simplified the often complex administrative procedures for receiving economic migrants."
"It would thus have enabled the labour markets of our Member States to respond to current and future manpower needs and would have provided a way of combating exploitation and discrimination, to which these workers too often fall victim."
"The directive seeks to reduce the differences that exist between national legislations: with this one-stop shop system, the administrative procedure would be simpler, less expensive and quicker."
"Our proposal would not have defined the conditions for admission for third-country nationals: the Member States would always have been responsible for determining the conditions for admission and setting the number of migrants to allow into their territory for employment purposes."
"This report and the draft directive that it amends are shameful."
"They introduce selective immigration governed by market requirements."
"They deprive of their rights all immigrants who are of no use, or no more use, to these markets."
"Even when they do grant limited rights to those who work, they offer the option to restrict them still further in the future."
"Immigrants are not second-class human beings!"
"This directive is quite simply inhumane."
"I shall vote against it and I also condemn it."
"This document, which has been rejected by the majority of Members, was a piece of legislation which would have enabled flows of migrants to be better managed."
"It aimed to eliminate the differences between Member States in their labour and residency procedures, and give third-country nationals working legally in the EU access to certain rights."
"It was thus a step forward, for two reasons."
"Firstly, because we are creating a new instrument which aims to benefit third-country nationals wishing to immigrate to the territory of Member States by conferring upon them a set of rights."
"Secondly, because of the political message which it sends overseas, disproving the idea that Europe is closed and only able to pass repressive measures, and strengthening security at a time when we are responding to the concerns expressed in the Stockholm Programme regarding the creation of flexible immigration policies in order to support the EU's economic development."
"This is why I voted as I did."
"The circumstances under which third-country nationals are permitted to reside and work in an EU Member State are a matter for the state in question, not the EU."
"The fact that, in certain areas, periodic immigration of well-educated skilled workers may perhaps be useful must not result in an open door policy because, first and foremost, it should be workers from our own population, in other words, EU citizens, who are recruited."
"If we have a shortage of workers in many areas, we should investigate the causes of this and respond by adapting the training accordingly, but also by providing opportunities for reskilling."
"The fact that labour migration can be a problem for workers because it suppresses wage levels and can also lead to dumping prices has been shown time and again in the past."
"It was for this reason, for example, that the transitional periods for the free movement of workers were introduced at the insistence of the countries with well-developed social security safety nets."
"In the debate, it must not be forgotten that the rules and regulations for the supply of labour can be exploited by clever enterprises."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"I voted for this report as the European Union has needed for many years now clear rules and procedures about the rights granted to legally resident third-country workers."
"We need such a set of rules for at least two reasons."
"Firstly, although we should provide a preferential scheme for EU workers, legally resident workers participate in Member States' economic life and are entitled to protection and guarantees."
"They should be considered as an asset to the EU economy and not as a threat to EU workers."
"Secondly, such clear rules would help achieve better control over migration."
"On the other hand, if we avoid such rules, we encourage illegal migration and employment and all the repercussions they entail."
"I regret to say that I reject the report and call on the Commission to come back with a new proposal."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Mathieu because I hope that after years of work, the guidelines will be established to draw up a directive that provides a single package of European rules on permits and rights for workers from third countries."
"We have been working on a European directive since 2001 without seeing any results."
"Now let us hope that the Council approves it in codecision with Parliament and that a conclusion is reached, given the importance of the issue."
"This is a crucial point for the development of Europe, as increasing demand for manpower is taking us ever closer to what is called 'economic immigration' and, therefore, a common regulation on the issue is urgently needed."
"Long-term economic development of the Union must be supported, so we need to simplify administrative practices regarding permits for third-country nationals who wish to be admitted to the territory of a Member State in order to work there, offering them a secure legal status."
"The directive will enable us to meet current and future manpower needs and will provide a way of combating exploitation and discrimination, to which these workers too often fall victim."
"I voted in favour of the present report, which was not adopted in the final vote."
"I did so because I believe the monitoring of migration in the European Union is a fundamental part of a responsible hosting policy in the Member States."
"The best way to combat illegal immigration and clandestine working is to develop a balanced policy towards legal migration, hosting immigrants on the basis of the needs of the labour market in the host state."
"At a time without economic growth, it is important not to create false expectations of inclusion, or encourage policies which promote a scarcity of labour."
"The proposal of filling out a single application to the authorities of the host country, requesting a work and residence visa, would cater for this concern."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Mathieu, and with the proposal for a directive, which is part of the European Union's efforts to develop a global migration policy and is a framework proposal for citizens of third countries."
"Its aim is twofold: a) to create a single application procedure for a permit to reside and work in a Member State; and b) to establish a uniform set of minimum rights for third-country workers legally resident in the EU, on the basis of equality of treatment with EU nationals."
"Legal immigration into EU Member States is important for economic development."
"The immigration of workers can increase competition and vitality and, in light of the demographic challenges that the EU is facing with an ageing population, it is important to adopt a flexible immigration policy."
"We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal, which seeks to introduce a single application procedure for third-country nationals applying for work and residence permits."
"This should simplify the complex administrative formalities involved in the reception of migrants."
"It should also make it possible for the labour markets in our Member States to react to current and future labour requirements and provide a tool for combating the exploitation of, and discrimination against, these workers."
"However, we are opposed to the amendments tabled concerning additional documents, which would make the proposal contradictory and pointless."
"Having a single application procedure and one document becomes meaningless if all of the Member States can issue and demand additional documents."
"The amendment stating that the Member States may issue a document to supplement the residence permit, which may be updated or withdrawn when the person's labour market situation changes, was voted through."
"As we were dissatisfied with the text and would have preferred the proposal to go to a second reading before it was adopted, we voted for the inclusion of correlation tables, against the wishes of the Council."
"These were not voted through, either, and when we found ourselves in a situation where a positive vote for the report would mean adoption at first reading with a content that we believed undermined the whole proposal for a single document instead of several within the EU, we chose to vote against the proposal."
"One of the best ways of combating illegal immigration and undeclared work is to develop balanced legal immigration channels which meet the needs of the labour markets in our countries."
"Economic immigration is a reality on which we must impose order, but it is also a necessity in view of the demographic and economic challenges which the European Union will face in the near future."
"Immigration policy must be devised as an instrument for regulating our labour needs, thereby helping to implement the Europe 2020 strategy."
"EU law does not limit the power of Member States to organise their own social security schemes."
"In the absence of harmonisation at Union level, it is for the legislation of each Member State to lay down the conditions under which social security benefits are granted, as well as the amount of these benefits and the period for which they are granted."
"However, when exercising this power, Member States should comply with EU law."
"Furthermore, working conditions must be respected, including for pay and dismissal, health and safety at the workplace, working time, leave and disciplinary procedures, taking into account any general collective agreements in force."
"The European Union must prepare itself for future demographic challenges."
"The issues relating to labour migration are relevant to the competitiveness and vitality of economies."
"They demand both balanced treatment and deep consideration."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has rejected this proposal for a single permit."
"Today's vote paves the way for new negotiations and says 'no' to allocating rights according to workers' market value."
"This directive, far from guaranteeing a common set of rights for all migrant workers, founded on equal treatment and non-discrimination, proposed a fragmented concept of legal migration, where the market value of a migrant worker would determine the extent of his or her rights."
"On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, this hierarchical arrangement is totally unacceptable: the Union must at last incorporate the conclusions of the many studies which show that the benefits - both individual and collective, economic and societal - for host countries and countries of origin alike go hand in hand with the full and effective exercise of migrants' rights."
"The Greens will continue to pay extremely close attention to this matter in order to help equip the Union with an ambitious migration policy that is based on the principle of universality and indivisibility of fundamental rights."
"This will be the issue at stake in the new talks prompted by the rejection of this dreadful agreement."
"The objective of the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order is crime prevention."
"It is based on the fact that, although the Member States provide protection for the victims of crime when within national borders, it has become necessary to develop a European-level mechanism for early warning and prevention."
"This takes into consideration the recommendations made by the Stockholm Programme and the procedures resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which allow reports to be provided for on a cross-cutting basis, as well as the first Council proposal for a European victim protection directive of 5 January 2010."
"I agree with a wide-ranging approach in order to include the victims of several types of crime, and with the amendments that provide for arrangements for revoking the protection order, for ensuring continuity of legal protection, for laying down a deadline for execution of an order and for clarifying the position as regards victims moving from one Member State to another."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution because it supports the Council's proposal for a directive which provides clear measures concerning the prevention of crime and victim protection in particular."
"It is important that victims of violence should not only be prevented in their country from being harmed by offenders, but should also have these kinds of preventive measures within the whole of the European Union."
"The adoption and implementation of this directive would show that the EU is determined to put into practice the Stockholm Action Plan, the European Union initiative to maintain and develop an area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is important to stress that a European Protection Order should be applicable to all victims of crime, including victims of human trafficking, forced marriages, honour killings, gender violence, witnesses, victims of terrorism and organised crime, regardless of the age or sex of the victim, where there is an identified aggressor."
"Furthermore, protection of victims does not mean just physical protection, but also includes the dignity of victims."
"Therefore, I strongly agree that it is imperative to include protection for victims that aims to restore their dignity and the respect due to them as human beings."
"The vote in Parliament on the proposed directive on the European Protection Order for victims sends out an important signal for the protection of people who have suffered from violence."
"Unfortunately, even though there was no qualified majority in the Council after the Netherlands took the side of the countries that are blocking the initiative, this has no effect on the importance of today's vote."
"The European legislative vacuum regarding the protection of victims of violence needs to be filled by a concrete response that is not only limited to the territory of the State in which the victim is present, but which applies across borders."
"Through the cooperation of 12 Member States, including Italy, the aim is to activate an early-warning and victim protection mechanism within the territory of the European Union."
"I am convinced of the importance of reaching an agreement on this instrument - including in political terms - because it will guarantee protection to victims of all kinds of crime and will provide for restraining and prohibiting actions against people who constitute a threat."
"An equally significant aspect is the possibility for the victim to move to another Member State, receiving the information and assistance they need to start a new life, while continuing to benefit from protection measures."
"I am in favour of the general idea of the protection order."
"Victims of violence must be safeguarded from repeat attacks by their aggressors, and must receive the benefit of preventive measures throughout the European Union."
"The draft directive is another step towards achieving the objectives of the Stockholm Action Plan and of the European Union initiative to maintain and develop an area of freedom, security and justice."
"I am aware of the complexity of this initiative."
"Judicial systems vary in the different Member States, as do criminal and civil proceedings."
"Despite this, I believe that the rapporteurs have succeeded in strengthening the continuity of legal protection and guaranteeing maximum protection for victims, while ensuring legal certainty."
"Victims of violence can benefit from protection measures against their aggressors in their respective Member States."
"However, this protection stops at the borders of their Member States, and until now, there was no way of extending this protection beyond those borders."
"I voted for this new directive, which allows the judicial authorities of a Member State that has implemented protection measures under its national law to issue a 'European Protection Order', which protects victims on the territory of the other Member States."
"Obviously, the directive is intended primarily for female victims of violence, but it may be applied to anyone regardless of gender or age, potential victims and their relatives."
"I voted in favour of the draft directive on the European Protection Order, which aims to protect victims of crime throughout the European Union."
"This initiative aims to introduce a mechanism for judicial and police cooperation between the Member States so that victims of crime who benefit from a protection measure in one Member State will not need to repeat the entire judicial process to obtain protection measures, and so that they may also be protected should they decide to reside or remain in another EU country."
"The European Protection Order will be issued at the request of the protected person and should be given not only to women who are the victims of domestic violence, the main group to receive protection, but also to all other victims, such as victims of human trafficking, female genital mutilation, forced marriages, honour killings, incest, gender violence, witnesses, and victims of terrorism and organised crime."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a directive on the European Protection Order because its fundamental goals are crime prevention and victim protection."
"Currently, even when Member States have made provision for protection orders for victims, the resulting enforcement measures stop at the border of the issuing State."
"The European Union must do all that it can to prevent crime and persecution at European level."
"Only then will we be able to guarantee a safe environment for victims without restricting victims' right to mobility."
"Although the Member States' criminal, civil and administrative proceedings are different, all countries must work together to prevent repeat offences."
"I feel that it is very important to include the aspect of moral support in this proposal."
"For most victims, crime has various psychological and moral repercussions that continue long after the crime has been committed."
"The EU must concern itself not only with prevention and protection, but also with moral support for victims so that they can begin a new life in any EU Member State."
"I have voted in favour of the report on the European Protection Order because it aims to improve the legal position of victims of violent crime."
"Legal protection is needed, in particular, by people who are victims of repeated violence by close relatives, people who become victims of violence on the basis of gender, or people who become victims of other kinds of crime in a Member State where they have neither citizenship nor a place of abode."
"I agreed with the amendment proposals, which limit the reasons for refusing to recognise or for rejecting a European Protection Order, setting a 20-day limit for implementing an order or clarifying the situation when a victim moves from one Member State to another."
"I am pleased that the problem of the legal basis, which the Council and the Commission, in particular, raised against each other, has been clarified."
"The specific conflict of views between the civil and criminal aspects of the European Protection Order has, in my view, been eliminated through adoption of the amendment proposal, which adds the recognition of court rulings to cooperation in criminal cases."
"This will accommodate the Commission's objection that the European Protection Order legislation will contravene its exclusive right of initiative in the area of civil law."
"I support this resolution as I believe that it is fundamental that victims of violence should benefit from measures to prevent crime and from protection throughout the European Union."
"In other words, this protection should not be restricted to a single Member State but should allow the individual to reside or remain in other EU countries."
"This measure should be applied to victims of human trafficking, female genital mutilation, forced marriages, honour killings, incest, gender violence, witnesses and victims of terrorism and organised crime."
"To achieve this, it will be necessary to overcome the fact that the legal systems of the Member States are different."
"This draft directive aims to fill a gap in existing legislation regarding the victims of crime, which does not address the issue of preventing crime and the need for a rapid and effective, Europe-wide early warning and prevention mechanism to protect victims."
"The creation of a European Protection Order should, for these reasons, become an important way of protecting victims, regardless of the type of violence to which they have been subjected."
"It must work across the borders of Member States, so that victims will not have to start the entire judicial process required to obtain protection measures afresh if they move to another Member State."
"Although, on the one hand, we have just adopted legislation regarding the civil and procedural rights of suspects in the EU, on the other hand, we cannot forget the civil and procedural rights of victims who are, without any doubt, vulnerable and lacking in protection to a greater extent."
"The adoption of this directive is an important step towards assisting victims, but I hope that the Commission can go further and present a comprehensive and more complete legislative package regarding victims as soon as possible."
"I voted in favour of the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order."
"Unlike, perhaps, some of the more resistant Member States (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands since the last change of government, and so on), I am against limiting the scope to criminal procedures in the strictest sense;"
"I am in favour of including a broader range of procedures."
"I hope that the strong signal sent by the European Parliament in plenary will ensure not only that the current deadlock caused by the blocking minority within the Council is broken, but also that the forthcoming Hungarian Presidency carries on looking into this matter."
"Conferring legal protection upon the victims of crime is fundamental to the construction of an area of liberty, security and justice."
"It is for this reason that I agree, despite some reservations, with the objectives of the present proposal which aims to improve the existing legal situation in the following respects: (i) improving the arrangements for revoking a European Protection Order; (ii) continuity of legal protection; (iii) limiting the reasons for refusal to recognise, or rejection of, a European Protection Order; (iv) deadlines for execution of an order; and (v) clarifying the position as regards victims moving."
"This directive concerns the application of protection measures intended to assist victims of criminal acts whenever these endanger an individual's life, or physical, psychological or sexual wellbeing."
"Protection measures exist in all EU Member States, but cease to take effect when someone crosses the country's borders."
"The European Protection Order aims to ensure that the protection offered to an individual in one Member State will be maintained and continued in any other Member State to which the person relocates or has been relocated."
"This is the position which the European Parliament adopted today, with 610 votes in favour, 13 against and 56 abstentions."
"It is based on the compromise negotiated between Members of this House and representatives of the Belgian Presidency of the EU."
"However, the text has yet to be confirmed by a qualified majority of Member States in the Council."
"Although most of the protection measures are aimed at women who have been the victims of domestic violence, the new rules should apply to all victims: as the adopted report states, 'this directive applies to protection measures which aim at protecting all victims and not only the victims of gender violence, taking into account the specificities of each type of crime concerned'."
"The European Protection Order is the practical expression of the priority given by the Spanish Presidency to combating violence against women."
"Victims covered by measures stipulating the distance to be observed by their aggressors will be protected beyond national borders, thus allowing them to start a new life wherever they see fit."
"The European Protection Order issued will have the same legal force throughout the Union."
"The scope of the text has been extended to include the protection 'of life, physical or psychological integrity, dignity, personal liberty or sexual integrity'."
"This broad definition includes the notions of forced marriage, paedophilia, human trafficking, genital mutilation, and so on. This measure meets the primary objective of the area of freedom, security and justice, which is to build a protective Europe."
"I therefore voted for this text."
"in writing. - I welcome the European Protection Order."
"It is an excellent initiative which will ensure that measures for victims' protection will extend from one Member State to another."
"At present, protection orders stop at our border, leaving the victim defenceless."
"The EPO marks a huge step forward in victim rights."
"It is a strong instrument which will provide a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States' borders."
"Over 100 000 women in the EU are covered by protective measures."
"However, I am very concerned by the blocking minority at Council level of which Ireland is part."
"I hope that the huge acceptance of this report at Parliament level will encourage the blocking minority to re-think their stance."
"I do not accept their argument that the legal basis of the report is inaccurate."
"Both the Council and the Parliament's legal service found that the legal basis was adequate and, as unanimously supported by JURI, the protection order does not establish obligations to modify national systems for adopting protection measures, as the Member State to which a victim travels is asked to provide protection in accordance with its national law."
"in writing. - The ECR Group fully supports the aims and objectives of the proposed European Protection Order and we are keen to see that victims of violence, terrorism, domestic abuse, stalking and/or harassment are protected if and when they move throughout the EU."
"The ECR Group is sympathetic to the distress that physical, psychological and or sexual abuse can cause and the state of vulnerability in which it leaves its victims."
"We were not able to vote in favour of the report today due to our concerns over the legal base and scope of the directive."
"This proposal has a criminal law basis; however, some of the offences that this proposal intends to cover are civil law matters, yet there is an absence of the use of Article 81 of the TFEU."
"The ECR Group is concerned about how effectively this proposal would be implemented and what message this anomaly sends out to the EU public about how we make law here."
"The ECR Group strongly believes that the legislation we produce at EU level must be legally sound and robust and should not compromise Member States' legal systems."
"For these reasons, the ECR Group abstained on this report."
"in writing. - The proposal for a directive on the European Protection Order, submitted by 12 Member States, is an initiative aimed at preventing crime."
"Even when Member States have provided for protection orders for victims, the resulting enforcement measures stop at the border of the issuing State."
"Victims, however, may move from one Member State to another for many reasons, not least to escape crime."
"Because they move in this way, they are defenceless when judicial and law enforcement cooperation fails to protect them by implementing a rapid, effective Europe-wide early warning and prevention mechanism."
"Setting up a cooperation arrangement along these lines is the aim that has given rise to this initiative."
"The action taken by Member States shows that crime can be prevented at European level when the aggressor or aggressors are identified."
"Thanks to the contribution of the Council, and especially of the two rapporteurs and of the amendments we tabled in committee, the draft directive on the European Protection Order offers excellent protection for victims without any national legislative restrictions."
"It should be seen as a symbol of regulatory progress in Europe, which is working step by step to ensure that rights and safeguards are the same in every Member State."
"As it has been presented, the European Protection Order makes protection for victims wishing to move freely within the European Union a more decisive and faster process."
"The difference between our legal systems, including their procedures, is clearly still a constraint."
"However, the scope as defined allows our countries to adapt quickly to the new order, thereby strengthening our Union and giving more protection to European citizens, particularly the most vulnerable."
"I therefore strongly support this proposal, which would give hope to the many people whose freedom and dignity is infringed on a daily basis, and who do not have all the means to react."
"In the future, they might even be able to start a new life in another country."
"It is a matter of the most elementary justice that the victim of a crime who has benefited from a protection order in a Member State should also be protected should they decide to reside or remain in another EU country."
"It was with this intention that we adopted these new rules today."
"All victims, and not only victims of domestic violence, should be able to benefit from the European Protection Order."
"Protection measures exist in all EU Member States, but they cease to take effect when an individual crosses a country's borders."
"The European Protection Order aims to ensure that the protection offered to an individual in one Member State will be maintained and continued in any other Member State to which the person relocates or has been relocated, regardless of the crime they have suffered."
"Any victim of a reprehensible act who receives protection in a Member State of the European Union should be able to enjoy the same protection when he or she travels to another Member State."
"Despite the fact that most measures concern female victims of sexist violence, it should be specified that any other victim of violence, including children, can enjoy the benefits of this initiative."
"Moreover, we can welcome the fact that a protection order can also be requested for the family of a protected person."
"Protection should not, however, be limited to the victim's physical protection."
"His or her dignity as a human being must also be considered."
"I am well aware of the complexity of the initiative and of the challenges it may face, not least because of the potential differences between the Member States' judicial systems and criminal, civil and administrative procedures."
"Nevertheless, the Member States must be encouraged to continue along these lines."
"I am in favour, and I consider that this report is the best report of those subject to a vote on 14 December."
"The basic criteria have been defined, all issues have been thoroughly worked through, and the rationale is clear."
"Now, people who have become the victims of crime will be ensured the protection of the courts in every European Union country if they move from one EU Member State to another."
"This will give the investigating authorities and the Public Prosecutor the opportunity to carry out their investigations effectively and the victims of crime will not keep important information from the investigation out of fear."
"I am grateful to the rapporteur for his report."
"Even though some measures have been taken in recent years to protect victims, the people affected are often left in the lurch."
"Lawyers and judges learn a great deal in their training about the rights of defendants, but they hear nothing about the right way to deal with witnesses and victims who appear as witnesses."
"If the scheduling is tailored to the defendant only and absolutely no consideration is given to a victim who is bringing a civil action against someone, that is like a slap in the face."
"Greater awareness is important here, but it is also needed in medical training, too, so that the use of domestic violence can be better recognised."
"The question of the statutory limitation of civil compensation claims is essential in the case of child abuse."
"The protection of victims also includes only allowing people with an unblemished criminal record to work with our children."
"If forced marriages are now being prosecuted in Liechtenstein, including without the consent of the victim, and it is possible to take legal action in the case of genital mutilation performed on a minor, this clearly shows the potential danger of the much lauded multicultural enrichment."
"Since victim protection is still in its infancy and the people affected often do not know who they can turn to in their own country and what their rights are, it is important that victim protection is harmonised within the EU."
"I have voted in favour of the report."
"I voted in favour of the report on the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order because the EU needs a system that increases protection of the lives, safety and physical, psychological and sexual integrity of citizens who are the victims of aggression."
"The draft directive aims to strengthen the protection of victims of this type of crime within the EU, because protection measures are currently limited to domestic legislation within Member States."
"This resolution aims to fill a gap in legislation to ensure that victims of aggression are protected outside their own countries too, thereby guaranteeing that every Member State offers victims adequate protection."
"Member States will not be required to harmonise their national laws, but they may adapt them so that they are mutually recognised."
"I voted today in favour of the proposal for a directive adopting a standard mechanism to facilitate and strengthen protection granted to victims of crimes who move between Member States in exercise of their right of freedom of movement."
"The directive will now protect victims from crimes which may endanger their life, their physical, mental and sexual integrity or their personal liberty, the ultimate goal being to avoid such crimes in the future."
"Following negotiations with the Council, the directive has been improved, especially on the following points:"
"legal protection has been extended, as the victim will no longer be required to restart the whole legal process of gaining protection when moving to another Member State;"
"the conditions under which European Protection Orders are issued have been improved and simplified;"
"the reasons for refusal to recognise or rejection of a European Protection Order have been limited;"
"a clear deadline has been set for execution of an order;"
"protection extends not only to the physical integrity, but also to the dignity of the victim."
"This report goes against the already adopted Stockholm Action Plan, a European Union initiative to maintain and develop an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Despite the problems regarding the legal basis of these amendments, I decided to vote in favour of the report, as I believe that protection measures for the victims or potential victims of crime are a positive thing."
"The possibility of enlarging the scope of a legal protection order from one Member State ('the issuing state') to another Member State to which the protected person wishes to move ('the executing state') is a significant advance towards the creation in practice of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, and this is an ideal which I share."
"Domestic violence is a violation of fundamental human rights and can affect anyone, irrespective of religion, colour or social status."
"Romania saw a 35% rise in domestic violence in 2009 compared with 2008."
"Indeed, in 2010, it is reported that the number of cases of domestic violence is increasing."
"Domestic violence incidents are estimated to affect 1 200 000 people every year, yet only 1% of the victims of violence are brave enough to report it to the authorities."
"The European Protection Order must be a strong instrument capable of providing a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States' borders."
"This will also include protection against acts of violence committed by groups of people and will apply to all victims of crime, such as victims of human trafficking, female genital mutilation, forced marriages, honour crimes, incest, gender-based violence, as well as witnesses and victims of terrorism and organised crime."
"Member States must continue to ensure legal protection, limit the reasons for refusing to recognise or for rejecting a European Protection Order, set a 20-day deadline for the execution of an order and clarify the position with regard to victims who move from one Member State to another."
"I believe that the Council directive is very positive as it aims to create a true area of freedom, security and justice."
"However, I share the concerns expressed by the rapporteurs, particularly regarding the technical omissions as well as the differences that they highlight between the Member States' legal systems."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero López on their excellent work."
"Victims of crime who have the right to protection in one Member State will be guaranteed the same level of protection throughout the Union, thanks to the new European Protection Order (EPO) approved today, which extends the scope of legislation to include all victims of crime, not just victims of gender violence as originally proposed."
"Protection measures exist within all EU Member States, but they become ineffective when victims cross borders."
"The European Protection Order should ensure that any protection granted to a person in one Member State will apply in all the other Member States to which he or she travels or has travelled."
"The European Protection Order may be issued at the request of persons under protection if they decide to move to another Member State, or if they simply wish to spend time there."
"The Member State that issued the protection measure will be responsible for issuing an EPO and sending it to the Member State to which the person intends to travel."
"The text still needs to be confirmed by a qualified majority of Member States in the Council, and they will have three years to transpose it into national law."
"in writing. - The proposal for a directive on the European Protection Order, submitted by 12 Member States, is an initiative aimed at preventing crime."
"Even when Member States have provided for protection orders for victims, the resulting enforcement measures stop at the border of the issuing state."
"Victims, however, may move from one Member State to another for many reasons, not least to escape crime."
"Because they move in this way, they are defenceless when judicial and law enforcement cooperation fails to protect them by implementing a rapid, effective, Europe-wide early warning and prevention mechanism."
"Setting up a cooperation arrangement along these lines is the aim behind this initiative."
"The action taken by Member States shows that crime can be prevented at European level when the aggressor or aggressors are identified."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order."
"The directive is indispensable in order that victims of violence can feel comparatively safe throughout the European Union, regardless of where they are living."
"After the directive has been adopted, it will be important to conduct regular training courses for judicial bodies and other competent bodies, to enable them to provide appropriate help to victims."
"It will also be vital to conduct an information campaign aimed at making citizens aware of the possibility of issuing a European Protection Order."
"As a result, the victims of violence will receive significantly more protection, and there will be a drop in such crimes."
"The directive on the European Protection Order represents a key step towards a European directive on violence against women."
"A joint, comprehensive EU strategy needs to be drafted and implemented as quickly as possible, with the aim of fighting violence against women in all EU Member States."
"We urgently need European legislative standards to combat violence against women."
"This is the only way we can support women and oppose society's acceptance of domestic violence and the impunity of those who commit this crime."
"I hope that the upcoming Polish Presidency will make a significant contribution to the drawing up and adoption of a draft directive on this matter."
"I have already written a letter bringing this matter to the attention of the Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, but I have not yet received a response."
"I welcome the adoption by a resounding majority of the report on the European Protection Order."
"The measure adopted today will enable people who have been granted protection in a Member State to enjoy the same protection in any other Member State to which they may travel."
"The directive applies not only to victims of domestic violence, but also to victims of forced marriages, human trafficking and female genital mutilation."
"This represents a major step forward for the rights of victims and their mobility within the European Union."
"I now call on the Council to follow the European Parliament's position by giving its overwhelming support to the European Protection Order."
"in writing. - UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern day version of slavery and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity."
"However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection."
"This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU."
"It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp human trafficking out."
"The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking."
"As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked."
"If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations."
"The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution."
"There is nothing more inhuman than exploiting the lives of other living beings for profit, infringing every fundamental right."
"Trafficking in human beings is one of the basest activities in history; it is a widespread and highly complex phenomenon."
"I am pleased that Parliament has approved at first reading the proposal for a directive on trafficking in human beings."
"This is a significant step forward in combating the phenomenon, which is the main activity of a large number of international criminal organisations."
"The most important point is the recognition that organised crime is the main problem to tackle."
"The EU is finally making a real, explicit distinction between crime and organised crime, because the latter is a truly separate issue."
"There are many other positive elements such as a broader definition of exploitation, greater protection for victims and the rule stipulating that victims of trafficking shall not be charged for crimes they have been forced to commit as a result of violence or the threat of violence against them."
"As Amnesty International points out, often women who are victims of trafficking are arrested for prostitution, or are not guaranteed full access to justice."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution as trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery, a serious crime and a severe violation of fundamental human rights."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has strengthened EU action in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, including in combating trafficking in human beings, and the European Parliament, in becoming colegislator, has a full role to play."
"I strongly support the EP proposal that penalties for traffickers need to be increased to the level of the 2009 proposal, the confiscation of assets should be applied, and assistance to victims and, in particular, to child victims, should be further developed."
"I am convinced that the EP should clearly express the requirement for Member States to do more in order to discourage demand for the services of victims of human trafficking, through awareness-raising campaigns, education, training and so on, all of which should fully incorporate a gender perspective."
"It is important to stress that criminal sanctions against employers who use trafficked labour have a strong preventive effect, so these must be developed further."
"The continued existence of economic and cultural inequalities on a global level has resulted in the development of new forms of slavery, no longer necessarily linked to the realm of sexual exploitation, but also to that of economic exploitation."
"These situations may not match the historical view we have of slavery, but they are equally offensive."
"They deprive their victims of the values of freedom and equality on which modern society is based."
"Victims are priced, sold or bartered, and stripped of their dignity."
"Trafficking in human beings is an extremely profitable business for organised crime, and it now has a cross-border dimension."
"One year after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there have been many initiatives in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters."
"We now need to strengthen the work of the EU by providing incentives for anti-trafficking actions, collecting data in order to compile reliable statistics, and establishing closer cross-border cooperation, including the exchange of information and best practice, as well as closer collaboration with Eurojust and Europol."
"We also need to take a victim-focused approach."
"Victims need protection, including legal protection."
"They need assistance and social rehabilitation programmes."
"Above all, however, it is important to increase the penalties for traffickers and employers who take advantage of the vulnerability of their victims, who are sometimes minors."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Commission proposal for a directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and the European Parliament report on it, because they impose uniform and harmonised criminal legislation and penalties on the Member States."
"The EU has set its mind on exploiting the workers' vulnerability and gradually getting them to believe that single, uniform rules of criminal law are needed in all sectors and in all the Member States."
"The imposition of harmonised criminal law in the Member States of the EU, with the unashamed stated objective of strengthening the Euro-unifying and state mechanisms of repression in order to consolidate the power of the monopolies, is yet another heavy blow to grassroots freedoms."
"At the same time, it is an unacceptable and dangerous restriction on grassroots sovereignty and the sovereign rights of the Member States."
"The EU's interest in combating trafficking in human beings is feigned, because it comes from a capitalist, transnational union which freely admits that it is founded on the capitalist system."
"Converting the workforce to a capitalist commodity turns people into a commodity to serve the only value recognised by the rotten system of exploitation: capitalist profit."
"I welcome the adoption of this proposal and of new penalties."
"Trafficking in human beings is a serious crime and a severe violation of fundamental human rights."
"I hope that this new directive will succeed in filling the gaps in the previous judicial framework and that the Anti-Trafficking Coordinator role is established within a clear legislative framework."
"Although the Treaty of Lisbon strengthened the European Parliament's role in judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, the Member States are the ones that can play a key role in combating this crime."
"If we want to achieve a strong preventive effect, the Member States must make it a criminal offence for anyone to knowingly use the services of victims of trafficking."
"Trafficking in human beings is an abomination that the European Union unfortunately cannot ignore."
"Whatever the motives, be it sexual exploitation or work, it is considered unacceptable by the Union's authorities."
"That is why Europe has already, for some time, had a broad range of legislation to combat this phenomenon."
"This new directive, for which I voted, replaces the former framework decision, in accordance with the new powers in this regard."
"By bringing together the acquis communautaire in this area and concentrating it within a single text, this directive is destined to play a major role in the fight against human trafficking."
"It defines the principles on which the Member States' legislation must be based, lays down the applicable penalties, establishes the responsibility of legal persons, protects victims against any prosecutions that their status may have brought about, introduces measures for assisting and protecting victims and contains some specific provisions for women and children."
"Hundreds of thousands of people are trafficked in the EU each year for the purposes of, among other things, sexual exploitation, forced labour, the illegal trade in organs and begging."
"This modern form of slavery is a terrible crime and a gross violation of fundamental human rights."
"I welcome what the report says about putting more stringent measures in place to prevent trafficking, imposing stricter penalties on traffickers and providing better protection for victims."
"This modern form of slavery must be combated; provision must be made for support, protection and enhanced assistance to victims; and prevention and monitoring must be strengthened."
"International criminal organisations must be combated, and cooperation at EU and international levels must be established to do this properly."
"I welcome what the report says about imposing stricter penalties on traffickers and about the seizure of assets."
"Children are most at risk from human trafficking, and there must be help and protection available for all victims of trafficking, especially children."
"I support this report."
"Trafficking in human beings is a serious crime and a severe violation of fundamental human rights."
"This crime is widespread across the world and may take many forms, relating to sexual exploitation, forced labour, the illegal trade in human organs, illegal adoptions, etc. We therefore urgently need to take active measures to support a strategy on fighting trafficking in human beings, in which significant attention would be paid to combating and preventing trafficking in human beings."
"Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure effective systems of assistance and support for victims, providing for the right to compensation, necessary medical treatment and free legal and psychological assistance, with special attention being paid to children."
"The strategy on fighting trafficking in human beings should also include social dimensions and the dimensions of immigration, asylum and reintegration policies."
"Moreover, in order to reduce the scale of offences, it is necessary to provide for effective and appropriate penalties for those who violate the provisions of the directive."
"I supported the report because human trafficking is a serious problem which we need to tackle, and the measures set out in the Treaty of Lisbon are not forceful enough to overcome criminality in this area."
"Human trafficking is a kind of slavery, and Europe must protect its women, its children, its citizens, against this threat using all available means."
"It is a grave offence and a huge infringement of fundamental human rights which forces people into dependence through threats, violence and humiliation, and should be subject to a minimum sentence of 10 years."
"In addition, in my opinion, we need to adopt a victim-based approach which incorporates the identification of all potential categories of victims and special measures aimed at protecting them, focusing, in particular, on children and other risk groups, as Edit Bauer mentioned in her report."
"Today, the European Parliament adopted an historic and particularly important directive strengthening the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"This directive is a very important step towards combating the scale of this terrible crime, laying down more severe penalties and sanctions, and further enhancing prevention and victim protection."
"I voted for this report because there must be a stricter response to human traffickers and the terrible crimes they commit, and harsher penalties and sanctions must be adopted so that their levels reflect the gravity of the offence committed and that they would act as an effective deterrent to such acts."
"The new directive contains a very important provision whereby, in addition to penalties, the Member States should include such sanctions as the seizure of property and take the necessary measures to seize and confiscate instrumentalities and proceeds from offences, as only then will these offences no longer be economically viable."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that with the increase in the scale of these offences in Europe, the EU's approach must be more oriented towards human rights, with most attention being paid to preventive actions, victim protection, return and reintegration policy and social issues."
"Creating an Anti-Trafficking Coordinator position at European Union level would enhance the coherence of the actions taken in the battle against this modern-day slavery."
"Cooperation between states on this issue, especially at EU level, is good."
"However, on many occasions, they lose sight of the action involved in reintegrating into society those who have fallen victim to human trafficking."
"Education and prevention campaigns must obviously be focused in the less developed states in the European Union where broad sections of the population are vulnerable due to material shortages."
"In order to have a better and more precise picture of this phenomenon, harmonised data must be collected which should include information on the number of people trafficked, including data on gender, age, the nationality of the victims, as well as the form of trafficking, the types of services for which the victims were used, the number of traffickers arrested, prosecuted and convicted and the mechanisms for referring these cases to the national asylum authorities."
"The extent of human trafficking is huge at the moment, but we do not know the real scale of this phenomenon due to a lack of precise, centralised EU data."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh on tackling the difficult task of preparing a report on such a topical issue."
"Trafficking in human beings is one of the greatest evils of our times, on a par with slavery; it reduces its victims to a state of exploitation and dependency by ruthless criminal organisations."
"Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon of vast proportions; we do not know exactly how vast due to a lack of information."
"We therefore need to carry out specific studies to discover its true extent."
"At the same time, Europe needs to promote policies allowing for greater cooperation in the criminal and judicial fields."
"These can be implemented under Article 79 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which identifies the legal basis within the framework of the common immigration policy."
"To conclude, I agree with the rapporteur's request, namely: to increase penalties for traffickers in human beings and confiscate their assets; to make it a criminal offence for anyone to knowingly use the services of trafficking victims; and to provide greater assistance for victims."
"in writing. - UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity."
"However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection."
"This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU."
"It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking."
"The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking."
"As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked."
"If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations."
"The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution."
"I voted in favour of this directive because increasing efforts to combat human trafficking is a fundamental element of it."
"The EU's response to this now covers prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation, the exploitation of workers through forced labour and begging, organ trafficking, illegal adoption, forced marriage, drug trafficking and even the exploitation of an individual to commit petty theft or robberies."
"In my view, the document strengthens crime prevention, particularly by creating legal offences, or by using penalties, the confiscation of goods, or the permanent closure of establishments used for criminal purposes, in the case of human trafficking."
"I believe that there will also be better help and assistance to victims through provision of the required accommodation, legal advice, and material, psychological and medical assistance."
"Human trafficking is the modern form of slavery and the second most lucrative activity for organised crime throughout the world."
"This directive is the first legal instrument adopted on this subject, making use of the new possibilities opened up by the Treaty of Lisbon, and it has defined a common approach in the fight against human trafficking and in the protection of its victims, filling a significant gap in the previous legal framework."
"It has been possible to reach a balanced compromise, creating an instrument capable of dealing more effectively with this type of criminal activity, and creating more rigorous policies and making penalties more severe, including prison terms of five to 10 years and the seizure of the proceeds of crime."
"At the same time, it strengthens the areas of prevention and victim protection, paying particular attention to children and other vulnerable groups."
"I also support the proposal to create a coordinator of the fight against trafficking in the EU, although any duplication of roles with the other already existing bodies, such as the European Police Office, should be avoided."
"Trafficking in human beings affects many hundreds of people every day in Europe, most of them women and young girls."
"There was an urgent need, therefore, to plug the legal gap that exists in some European countries, such as Spain, where, incidentally, the largest brothel has just opened a few kilometres from the French border."
"Hence, the European Union has finally equipped itself with an instrument for creating an environment that deters traffickers, and for making sure that trafficking victims are given assistance and protection."
"From now on, common rules will define the offences and penalties applicable to traffickers."
"This marks a further step towards the protection of human dignity and an end to human beings being treated as commodities."
"The trafficking of human beings today is, for its victims, an inhumane modern-day form of slavery."
"For its perpetrators - criminal organisations involved in prostitution and sexual exploitation, illegal adoption, forced labour, illegal immigration and illegal organ trafficking - it is an extremely lucrative activity."
"Since various European countries are the 'destination' for such networks, I welcome this initiative to create a common framework for preventing and combating human trafficking at European level, an approach which stems from Parliament's proposal for a resolution, on which we voted on 10 February 2010."
"Human trafficking is a serious violation of human rights and is very profitable for organised crime."
"The importance of this form of modern slavery is huge, even whilst we do not know its true extent."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has strengthened European Union policy in the area of cooperation between judicial authorities and the police on criminal matters, including the fight against human trafficking."
"Having become colegislator in this area, the European Parliament will have an important role to play from now on."
"I welcome the passing of the measures adopted in this report with regard to the need to gather data on the number of trafficked persons and the sex, age and nationality of the victims, the means by which trafficking takes place, the type of services which the victims ultimately end up providing, the number of traffickers arrested, tried and convicted and the national referral procedures for national asylum authorities."
"We know that it is not enough to adopt legal instruments to combat human trafficking and protect its victims."
"The fight to eradicate human trafficking must be seen as a priority in the struggle for the respect of human rights."
"Political will is required for this to happen."
"However, above all, it is also essential to act on prevention, something which requires other economic and social policies, and implies the end of capitalist exploitation and neoliberal policies."
"Conditions must be created which release the individuals involved from poverty, by promoting policies for the fair redistribution of wealth, by guaranteeing access to essential public services, and by promoting the creation of jobs with rights and pay levels that afford a decent living."
"For these reasons, the adoption of this document is only one step in the long, hard fight which must continue if we are to end human trafficking."
"Last week, we adopted a report on the proposal for a directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims, and I am very pleased with the result of this vote."
"Firstly, the definition of 'trafficking in human beings' will now be much broader and will include trafficking into the sex industry, labour exploitation, especially in the agricultural sector and domestic service, and forced begging."
"Secondly, our text establishes sanctions and minimum penalties for traffickers."
"Thirdly, our text provides for a whole range of assistance and support measures for victims, and we must not forget that there are reportedly several hundreds of thousands of victims in the European Union each year."
"Time has proven that the existing framework was not effective enough."
"The text we adopted last week demonstrates that the will is there to step up our action to protect citizens and to prosecute traffickers throughout Europe."
"Trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery."
"For criminal gangs, it is also an extremely profitable business which can take on may different forms, such as sexual exploitation, forced labour, trafficking in human organs, begging, illegal adoption and domestic servitude."
"This text is the first binding European legislation on the subject."
"It strengthens both protection for victims and sanctions against perpetrators."
"The gender perspective that underpins the text is to be welcomed, as it is often women who are the victims of human trafficking."
"Another important point is that victims will not be prosecuted for crimes committed as a result of trafficking, such as breaking immigration laws."
"I supported this text."
"in writing. - The ECR Group strongly believes that in the 21st century, it is simply abominable that slavery still exists on our Continent, and believes that people-trafficking will only be combated if all nations work together at the highest levels to prevent it."
"Current EU legislation is out-dated and far from effective; the ECR Group supports its revision."
"The ECR Group today voted in support of this directive, which focuses on cross-border cooperation to prevent and combat this heinous crime of trafficking human beings."
"The ECR Group did request split votes on Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 15(4) and voted against these specific articles, as it does not believe that the EU should set maximum criminal penalties; nor does it believe in specifying a criminal offence, as is done in Article 15(4)."
"The ECR Group supported the resolution overall and the text amended by the LIBE and FEMM committees."
"Trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery and a severe violation of fundamental human rights."
"Trafficking in human beings is also one of the most profitable activities of criminal organisations."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon gave the EU greater powers in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, and the report adopted today, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims, represents the European legislator's commitment in this area."
"The text identifies minimum rules for defining criminal offences and imposing sanctions on traffickers, and introduces common rules to improve prevention and the protection of victims, who shall have to receive assistance, including legal representation."
"Trafficking in human beings, a phenomenon closely linked to organised crime, in the same way as drug trafficking and money laundering, must be combated with strong and effective measures."
"Experience gained over the last few years has shown that judicial and police cooperation and a high level of harmonisation of individual national laws are both essential for combating these types of crime."
"in writing. - Trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery, a serious crime and a severe violation of fundamental human rights which reduces people to a state of dependency via threats, violence and humiliation."
"Trafficking in human beings is also an extremely profitable business for organised crime, with high profit possibilities and limited risk-taking."
"It may take many forms such as sexual exploitation, forced labour, illegal trade in human organs, begging (including the use of a dependent person for begging), illegal adoptions and domestic work."
"The scale of this phenomenon is impressive, but certainly not known in full."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has strengthened EU action in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, including in combating trafficking in human beings."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has become colegislator in this area and has a full role to play."
"I supported this report."
"The recent findings of the International Labour Organisation revealed that, throughout the world, there are at least 2.45 million people subjected to forced labour as a result of human trafficking."
"This phenomenon has been on the increase in recent years and now also occurs in European countries."
"This is why I believe that this is a scourge which must be fought robustly in the EU, without neglecting the proper help and protection for victims."
"This is why I voted as I did."
"It is clear that trafficking in human beings is a serious crime and a serious infringement of fundamental rights."
"It is clear that everyone will vote for a stricter law against trafficking in human beings."
"It is clear that A. Mirsky will be in favour of a stricter law, together with other Members."
"This is a win-win subject."
"Everyone is in favour and, as a result, this will be a 'plus' for the report's authors."
"Perhaps a more important topic could be found?"
"In this way, another 100 reports could be written, about vice, about terrorism, about killing, about fanaticism, about fraud, about robbery, about rape, about insults."
"About, about, about ..."
"Is this the job of a Member of the European Parliament?"
"I am voting in favour."
"Is there anyone who will be against?"
"Officially, slavery no longer exists."
"Unofficially, however, it is very much in existence in the form of human trafficking."
"This form of crime in particular has, for many people, become a lucrative business with billions being made in profits."
"When it comes to combating human trafficking, we are lagging far behind organised crime."
"Only a combination of different measures can ultimately achieve the goal."
"On the one hand, the security apparatus, which, in recent years, has been starved of funds, must be topped up again."
"Within the EU, only the spin-offs of human trafficking can really be combated, but we need to remove what underpins this."
"Subsidiary areas, such as begging, would be relatively easy to combat by imposing a general ban on begging throughout the EU."
"On the other hand, cooperation with the countries of origin, for example, for forced labour and forced prostitution, is essential."
"Therefore, information and awareness campaigns via the education systems in the countries of origin, transit and destination are an important tool for combating human trafficking."
"Some of the fundamental considerations in the report are right, but in other areas, I cannot give my consent without reservations."
"I therefore abstained from the vote."
"Romanian children are being brought to central Europe and forced to steal and beg, and elderly and disabled people are also being forced to beg."
"Meanwhile, the heads of the begging mafia are living in luxury villas."
"Human trafficking is a lucrative and fast-growing business."
"According to Europol, there are hundreds of thousands of victims in the EU alone."
"Therefore, the stepping up by the EU of the fight against human trafficking is to be welcomed."
"A particularly positive aspect is the fact that organised begging is also being addressed for the first time."
"Left-wing romantics often shut their eyes and would have the public believe that these people are begging voluntarily and that there is no such thing as begging tourism or the begging mafia."
"However, some of the proposed measures go too far."
"Instead of placing the countries of origin under obligation with regard to the destruction of mafia structures and providing victims with local help and the opportunity for training and, therefore, a future in their own country, the EU is moving in the direction of residence permits and exemption from punishment for victims of human trafficking."
"This is sending the wrong signal: these people are already being lured to Europe with false promises."
"Residence permits in the context of victim protection and exemption from punishment if someone is caught stealing will be all the more of an incentive for someone to place themselves in the hands of the mafia."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"My decision to vote in favour of report is justified by the essence of the human being as such."
"The protection of individual freedom is a fundamental right to be fought for, insofar as violations of human rights that reduce people to a state of dependency via threats, humiliation and violence are a heinous and very serious crime."
"Unfortunately, in recent years, trafficking in human beings has become an extremely profitable business for organised crime, with excellent profit possibilities and limited risk-taking, which is why this phenomenon is growing at an uncontrollable rate."
"As a result, the European Union is taking steps to prevent and combat the phenomenon by applying rules on the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of organised crime."
"I consent to the fight against this phenomenon because I hope to see the development of an action aimed at combating trafficking in human beings, the development of a victim-focused approach, with special attention given to women and children, and, lastly, the targeted organisation of information and awareness campaigns run through the education and school system in the countries of origin, transit and destination for trafficking."
"A policy to prevent and combat human trafficking is a fundamental issue at the heart of the EU."
"I share the objective of creating tougher rules in this area, an environment which is hostile to human traffickers, greater protection for victims and more rigorous prevention measures."
"I thus agree with the European Parliament proposal to create an Anti-Trafficking Coordinator."
"I also wish to emphasise the positive nature of the proposed penalties, particularly a prison term of up to 10 years and the possibility of 'seizing the assets' of the criminal, as well as of the Council proposal which urges Member States to use the seized assets for the purpose of assisting and protecting the victims, including compensating them."
"Human trafficking is a clandestine activity carried out on a global scale, as well as being a serious violation of human rights and a social phenomenon with repercussions for the whole of society."
"Human trafficking involves strategic risks affecting stability and socio-economic development leading to: destabilisation of the labour market; the growth and diversification of organised crime; economic destabilisation resulting from the scale of money laundering; demographic destabilisation; a rise in public sector corruption; and destabilisation of internal economic investment."
"In Romania, approximately 780 victims were registered in 2009."
"At least 416 of these were victims of forced labour and at least 320 were victims of forced prostitution."
"The victims identified last year also included 176 children trafficked for forced labour and prostitution."
"Member States must provide funds for assisting and protecting victims, including for the provision of compensation to victims and the cross-border enforcement of EU anti-trafficking law."
"In the case of child victims, primary consideration must be given to the interests of the child and harsher penalties must be imposed on traffickers."
"The amendments made will help create a hostile environment for traffickers, protect victims and prevent this activity more effectively because fundamental rights must be respected."
"I voted in favour of the resolution as I believe that it is essential for there to be a coordinated and consolidated European Union strategy against human trafficking."
"Having become colegislator in this area, the European Parliament will have an important role to play from now on."
"I believe that, in line with the resolution adopted on 10 February 2010, the approach taken in combating human trafficking must prioritise a global view of the phenomenon and focus on the defence of human rights."
"I congratulate Mrs Bauer and Mrs Hedh on their excellent work: the text adopted today will make the sanctions against traffickers tougher; it will provide greater protection for victims and will strengthen prevention."
"Prostitution, exploitation of children, forced labour: it is calculated that, each year in Europe, hundreds of thousands of people are sold as though they were objects."
"The EU considers that the main victims of trafficking are women and children, exploited for the purposes of prostitution (43%) or of forced labour (32%)."
"There are many other reasons, besides prostitution and forced labour, for the exploitation of human beings: forced begging, illegal adoptions, organ trafficking, and so on are all cases covered by the text of the directive."
"Under the new rules, victims will have to be given assistance and, in particular: appropriate accommodation and material assistance, necessary medical treatment, including psychological assistance, counselling and information, and translation services where appropriate."
"Legal representation must be provided free of charge, at least when the victim does not have sufficient financial resources."
"Victims of human trafficking should also have access to witness protection programmes, if deemed necessary by the national authorities."
"in writing. - This legislation represents an important step forward in combating this inhumane and degrading crime, and we welcome its adoption today."
"However, the aim of the directive was to address prevention, prosecution and protection, and the Greens regret that the provisions on victim protection are not as strong as we believe is possible and necessary."
"The position of victims and their legal status or their rights to legal assistance could, and should, have been much stronger."
"Hopefully, the Commission will now come forward with a proposal to revise the directive on residence permits for victims of trafficking so that we get a truly holistic approach to tackling this hideous crime, as envisaged from the beginning."
"I am also glad that there is no direct reference requiring Member States to take legal measures to penalise those who use services (for example, dining in a restaurant in which victims of trafficking are working)."
"Besides the intricacy and legal uncertainty of differentiating the 'what, who and when' in all of this, such measures actually risk bringing victims of trafficking further outside the reach of the authorities."
"We have just adopted by an overwhelming majority the report on the proposal for a directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims."
"This is an historic vote for several reasons."
"In the first instance, it is the first time in the European Union's history that binding European legislation has been adopted to combat human trafficking."
"In the second instance, the European Parliament and the Council reached an agreement at first reading, which means that the provisions of this directive will be implemented as quickly as possible."
"Lastly, this directive introduces heavier penalties for traffickers (five years minimum) and strengthens protection and assistance for victims."
"The new rules will apply to trafficking into the sex industry and to labour exploitation in sectors such as construction, agriculture and domestic service."
"I am therefore delighted with the result of this historic vote."
"The illegal trafficking in human beings really should be viewed as present day slavery."
"It is the third fastest growing criminal industry, with a volume of around EUR 23 billion a year."
"The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the actions of the EU in the area of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters - including human trafficking."
"We therefore need to increase the penalty for human traffickers and enhance our support for victims accordingly, particularly for children."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution which approves the conclusion of the agreement with Georgia on readmission of persons residing without authorisation, which will push out the frontiers of the area of liberty and security, extending it beyond the European Union and encompassing this neighbouring country."
"I am convinced that this agreement is a step forward in the relations between the European Union and Georgia, it shows the European aspirations of Georgia, and will thus represent a strong signal on the part of the European Union."
"It will promote friendly relations, stability, security and the wellbeing of citizens, which is so much needed in the region."
"Moreover, it will encourage Georgia to implement the reforms needed in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I strongly support the EU-Georgia agreement on readmission of persons residing without authorisation as a sufficiently sound framework is in place in Georgia to ensure that the rights of those persons treated under the agreement will be respected."
"EU enlargement in 2004 and 2009 encouraged the EU to create a new framework for a collaborative partnership system with its neighbours to the east and the south located at the EU's external borders, promoting their security, stability and development and preventing new divisions on the European continent."
"I voted in favour of this agreement."
"The European Union must pursue its engagement with the countries of the South Caucasus and protect this area."
"This region has strategic importance for the European Union, which can assist this region in its economic and commercial development."
"Above all, the EU's action must be marked by encouragement, based on principles of good governance and absolute respect for human rights and democracy."
"I feel that this agreement with Georgia on readmission is relevant from a regional point of view and will also support EU efforts to enhance cooperation with other countries in the region."
"The two issues of facilitating the issuance of visas for Georgian citizens and approving an agreement on readmission of persons residing without authorisation were voted on during the plenary sitting of the European Parliament on Tuesday, 14 December."
"My colleague, Nathalie Griesbeck, was rapporteur on both of these agreements that concern the movement of persons between the EU and Georgia."
"This agreement with Georgia is aimed at shortening the visa application process, simplifying the paperwork required, and even exempting some categories of individuals, such as students, journalists and retired persons, from the requirement to obtain a visa."
"We voted at the same time on the agreement on readmission, in which the EU and Georgia have mutually undertaken to readmit their own respective nationals residing without authorisation."
"Both these agreements are a sign of the will of the EU and Georgia to cooperate in the areas of freedom, security and justice."
"The actions of the European Union must be based upon the principles of good governance and respect for democracy and human rights."
"In relations with the region of South Caucasus, the EU must be a partner to it, assisting with economic and commercial development, with security, with stability, with the promotion of prosperity, and with conflict resolution."
"On this basis, I voted in favour of the agreement with Georgia on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation, as I believe that it is a contribution towards the achievement of the above objectives."
"The Prague Summit Joint Declaration of 7 May 2009 establishing the Eastern Partnership has underlined the importance of promoting the mobility of citizens in a secure environment, through visa facilitation and readmission agreements."
"This readmission agreement is therefore a necessary complement to the adoption of the visa facilitation agreement reached with Georgia, which would necessarily have to be accompanied by an improvement in the security conditions necessary to combat cross-border crime and illegal immigration."
"I hope that, based on this agreement and in the spirit of joint commitment, the EU and Georgia can effectively fight illegal immigration and contribute to the development of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and civil society in that country."
"Bearing in mind the results of dialogue over human rights between the EU and Georgia, which took place this year, the fact that Georgia has ratified a number of relevant international conventions on the protection of fundamental rights, its Membership of the Council of Europe and its participation in the Eastern Partnership, which is based on commitments to the principles of international law and to fundamental values, I voted in favour of signing this agreement."
"Georgia's increasingly close relationship with the European Union, evident in a range of recent activities, is to be welcomed."
"The agreement on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation is an important stimulus to the strengthening of relations between Georgia, its neighbouring countries and the European Union, as well as to the fight against illegal immigration."
"The incentives for reforms in the spheres of security, freedom and justice could bear ample fruit if there is a spirit of commitment on both sides."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which is the sister of the report on the issuance of visas between the EU and Georgia."
"The package should ease travel and improve the EU's relations in this part of the world."
"Georgia has made significant efforts to develop closer relations with the European Union, as is evident in a range of recent activities."
"This agreement on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation is essential as a stimulus to relations between Georgia, its neighbouring countries and the European Union, as well as to the fight against illegal immigration."
"It is, however, essential that there continue to be incentives for reform in the spheres of security, freedom and justice in Georgia."
"I am in favour, because I strongly hope that when Mr Saakashvili goes into hiding from the Georgian Public Prosecutor on the territory of the European Union without a residence permit, he will, in accordance with the agreement, be expeditiously extradited to the Georgian authorities without complications."
"This agreement is truly very necessary."
"I am in favour."
"The facilitation of the issuance of visas to citizens of non-EU states should not be granted too hastily."
"Before doing so, it must be examined as carefully as possible whether appropriate readmission agreements for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants could prevent the abuse of the system. The problems with the Schengen Information System II must also finally be resolved."
"Finally, it must not primarily be asylum seekers, or even criminals, that benefit from visa-free travel."
"A great deal will de facto depend on whether, and to what extent, the agreement is actually implemented."
"It will, in any case, increase Georgia's cooperation with the European Union."
"In my opinion, the readmission agreement is not restrictive enough and therefore, I abstained from the vote."
"Over the last few years a series of highly significant political acts, such as Georgia's accession to the Council of Europe and to the European Convention on Human Rights, have brought it closer than ever before to the European Union."
"I voted in favour of the draft Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and Georgia on the facilitation of the issuance of visas because I believe it is extremely important for Europe to implement a neighbourhood policy with its neighbouring countries, especially with regard to 'hot spots' such as the Caucasus, where the interests of the EU itself are reflected in an important trade partnership."
"Furthermore, reducing the bureaucracy and controls with regard to a neighbouring country can only improve relations with that country, creating the conditions for greater control of the area and, hence, for more security, development and stability."
"The two agreements concluded - on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation and on the facilitation of the issuance of visas - will be absolutely instrumental in achieving these objectives."
"The process of strengthening relations between the European Union and the countries of the Southern Caucasus, including Georgia, is vital if we are to create a solid, coherent and effective foreign policy."
"I support the agreement between the European Union and Georgia on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation."
"I would highlight the following positive measures: the readmission obligations defined within the agreement have been drawn up on a fully reciprocal basis, and cover its own nationals, third-country nationals and stateless persons."
"The obligation to readmit its own nationals includes former nationals who have given up their nationality, who have lost their nationality or who have had their nationality taken away, without having acquired the nationality of another state."
"The obligation to readmit nationals also covers family members - spouses and minors or unmarried children - who do not have the right of residency in the requesting state, irrespective of their nationality."
"There is also what is called the fast-track process, agreed in relation to people intercepted in the 'border region', that is to say, within an area that extends up to 5 kilometres from ports, including customs zones, and international airports in Member States or in Georgia."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur Mrs Griesbeck's assertion that information campaigns are essential in Georgia in order to inform people of the new situation and to allow them to take advantage of the new possibilities."
"In addition, the changes in the visa policy should also appear as soon as possible on the European institutions' websites."
"I also agree with the rapporteur's recommendation that the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the European Commission, which is responsible for monitoring the application of these agreements, should, after they have been enacted, identify any obstacles or asymmetrical barriers to their proper application and to the reciprocity of procedures, both at consular service level and at the borders to be crossed."
"I voted in favour of signing this agreement as I believe that, combined with the agreement on facilitating the issuing of visas, it constitutes very significant progress in relations between the EU and Georgia, signalling an important stage in its integration into Europe and, at the same time, providing an incentive for the country to promote the necessary reforms in the areas of freedom, security and justice."
"in writing. - We voted against this agreement because: it aims to return people to a country where, according to the UNHCR Global Appeal 2010-2011, around 212 000 people were internally displaced for more than 16 years, living in need of shelter and means to become self-sufficient, where sexual and gender-based violence is rife in all parts of society and police ill-treatment is tolerated; it also applies to those former residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia who do not have any de facto links to Georgia; it does not include strict safeguards concerning the violation of fundamental rights and guaranteeing high standards of reception, which are poor in Georgia; it contains numerous loopholes and ambiguities which might be clarified in the Joint Readmission Committee in which Parliament regrettably has no say, which would be entirely legitimate regarding its new competences; it does not guarantee adequately the protection of personal data - data can be forwarded to 'other bodies' without requiring the consent of the person involved."
"I voted in favour of the principles espoused in this report, which reinforce the idea that the European Union can only be competitive globally if it mobilises the convergence of its regions and Member States."
"I agree that, despite all progress, regional disparities need to be reduced in order to strengthen the internal market and the Europe 2020 strategy, which will only be able to have tangible results if the starting point in all regions is taken into consideration."
"Although, on the one hand, I agree that many regions still need investment in infrastructure and accessibility, on the other, I would stress the importance of investment in research and innovation, with the participation of all levels of government and private operators being fundamental to this, so as to improve the absorption and application of funding."
"In order for this idea to be implemented, a clear notion of partnership on the part of the Commission is required, and EU support for the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises needs to be reviewed and consolidated."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution as it provides a very much needed framework highlighting the integrating role of cohesion policy and the contribution it makes to increasing the EU's global competitiveness."
"Cohesion policy is the EU's key policy for enabling the regions to face growing challenges, such as climate change, population ageing, social migration, energy, or the economic and financial crisis, in the best possible way and, hence, to help increase the EU's global economic competitiveness."
"I support the rapporteur that this could be achieved by ensuring common living standards for all EU citizens and supporting development by harnessing local and regional specificities, thereby generating added value and economic productivity."
"It is important to stress that once the objective has been met of ensuring a similar quality of life by enabling access to infrastructure and quality services, the regions can concentrate on measures aimed at developing local economic potential, with an important stage being the development of local research, development and innovation policies and the appropriate regional infrastructure."
"The adoption of the territorial, social and economic cohesion package has a key role to play in the task of setting the European Union's priorities and objectives, thereby guaranteeing personal and economic development and also promoting solidarity between Member States."
"I support the importance of promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion through infrastructure development to help ensure the success of the EU 2020 strategy in circumstances where this new strategy will be addressing bottlenecks in economic development."
"Furthermore, competitiveness can only be achieved through the promotion of research, innovation and technological development and the provision of correspondingly high quality vocational training for European citizens."
"I voted for this report as I consider that the cohesion policy has proved to be an effective instrument providing a flexible solution to the socio-economic challenges presented by the economic and financial crisis."
"I voted in favour of the fine own-initiative report on achieving real territorial, social and economic cohesion within the European Union by my excellent Romanian colleague, Petru Constantin Luhan."
"I back the report fully in its assertion that 'the achievement of economic, social and territorial cohesion is a necessary condition but that it is not sufficient to guarantee economic competitiveness at world level, which requires significant investments in key areas such as energy, the environment, infrastructure, education, research and development, creative industries and services, logistics and transport'."
"This sums up in a nutshell the major plan for investing EUR 1 000 billion that I have been calling for since the beginning of the current term of office and which is an essential condition for our continent's development through competitiveness and for equal opportunities for European citizens wherever they are in the Union."
"The European Union can be competitive only insofar as internal policies bolster its capacity to respond to today's challenges."
"A sustainable regional and cohesion policy is essential to remove obstacles to economic development and increase competitiveness in the internal market and globally."
"The importance of a coherent and coordinated regional policy in the European Union is clear."
"The financial and economic crisis, as well as the gas crisis that had previously dominated Europe, proved that the lack of a suitable regional policy is affecting the whole of Europe."
"I believe that cohesion policy is the EU's key policy for enabling the regions to overcome the problems that have arisen."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the development of territorial cohesion policy will have a direct impact on whether the goals set in the EU 2020 strategy are achieved and that it is necessary to analyse as soon as possible whether the support provided by the EU to specific regions builds on concrete results that will ensure the sustainability of regional policy."
"At a time when the territorial disparities between the different regions of the European Union are becoming more marked, one of the most effective tools for fulfilling the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is a smarter EU cohesion policy that relies strongly on innovation, research and development, whilst catering for the specific situations in the regions."
"Mr Luhan's report confirms this approach and presents EU cohesion policy as one of the key factors in our regions' economic vitality."
"This policy brings us closer to a more 'sustainable' European economy."
"I voted for this report because we must debate the measures adopted at European and national level on social and territorial cohesion which aim to fulfil the objectives of EU policies, including that of increasing global economic competitiveness."
"Actually, cohesion policy is the EU's key policy for enabling the regions to face the challenges arising from the economic and financial crisis, climate change, ageing of the population, social migration or energy."
"These goals can be achieved by supporting development at local and regional levels and, of course, by ensuring common living standards for all EU citizens."
"I would like to stress that Europe is united and so it is very important to reduce disparities in the level of development of the European regions and to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Furthermore, cohesion policy should be more results-oriented and it is important to aim for even more effectiveness and usefulness, because only then will this policy become more convenient and useful for consumers."
"In order to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, we must implement cohesion and regional policy and ensure that this policy is independent and covers all European regions."
"I congratulate Mr Luhan on his work in drafting this report, which I endorsed."
"I am convinced, in fact, that an effective cohesion policy that can reduce economic, social and territorial disparities can help to increase global economic competitiveness."
"In this context, regions that can rise to future challenges in the best way possible, thereby increasing competitiveness and steering Europe towards a sound economic recovery, become increasingly important."
"In the light of the financial crisis, which continues to affect the whole of Europe, and in view of the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, I feel it is useful to strengthen the Cohesion Fund and the structural policies through the greater involvement of the regions."
"Lastly, cohesion policy is essential for achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives, but to consolidate these results, continued investment needs to be made in infrastructure, as a basis for increasing Europe's economic competitiveness."
"The main objective of the report on achieving real territorial, social and economic cohesion within the EU is to increase the global competitiveness of EU companies."
"The whole premise of the report is wrong, because it considers, without further analysis, that competitiveness and cohesion are not contradictory and incompatible concepts."
"In fact, competitiveness, as it operates today, including at European level, means lower wages and cuts to the workers' rights and increasing privatisation for the benefit of big business; at the same time, it is out of kilter with the concept of economic and political cohesion."
"The report describes the problems faced by the regions in the EU, but is unable to propose convincing and viable solutions, remaining faithful instead to the Lisbon and EU 2020 strategies."
"Finally, it considers that the economic crisis and the disastrous consequences of it, which are affecting most European regions, is yet another problem which the regions need to deal with, but avoids mentioning the causes of it."
"In this way, it basically covers up the inadequacy and weakness of European cohesion policy before the crisis."
"That is why I voted against the report."
"The Union's cohesion policy has shown itself to be essential to reducing development disparities between the various European regions."
"There is a need to ensure horizontal and vertical coordination between the various levels of governance in order to achieve common standards of development, and economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Support for research, innovation and education is an essential measure for ensuring an inclusive labour market, and it needs to be accompanied by policies at regional level."
"The active role of local and regional authorities is crucial for ensuring greater economic competitiveness within the global market."
"The Treaty of Lisbon establishes as one of its founding values the promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the EU, and solidarity between Member States (Article 3 of the Treaty of Rome)."
"The main objective of cohesion policy is to promote balanced development between the 271 different regions of the EU, through the reduction of disparities between these regions' levels of development."
"Special attention is paid to the less favoured regions, such as rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, areas with severe and permanent natural and demographic limitations, and island, cross-border and mountain regions."
"With regard to this, I have been arguing for the need to align cohesion policy with the strategic objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and to encourage transparency in the allocation of funding."
"In my opinion, all information relating to the adoption and implementation of cohesion policy funding plans should be made available in real time on a website accessible to the general public, divided up by the most detailed NUTS classification possible: for example, implementation by NUTS level 3 should be presented wherever this designation exists."
"That is what I advocate in my opinion annexed to the Cohesion policy: Strategic Report 2010 on the implementation of the programmes for 2007-2013."
"The reality experienced today in the European Union is the strongest and most straightforward rebuttal of the assertion made in the report, that cohesion policy has responded effectively to the socio-economic difficulties caused by the crisis."
"Another idea runs through the report: the association of cohesion policy with the so-called 'Europe 2020 strategy'."
"It is well known that the Europe 2020 strategy, heir to the old Lisbon Strategy, follows the same political line of liberalisation, privatisations and flexibilisation of the labour laws."
"These guidelines, which have to be followed, do not contribute to cohesion: on the contrary, they accentuate disparities between countries and regions, and within each country."
"The redistributive function of the EU budget - essential for putting the principle of cohesion into practice - is seriously compromised by the smallness of its role."
"To this must be added the costs, to the most vulnerable economies within the EU, of entry into the single market, of Economic and Monetary Union and of the deregulation of international trade, aspects ignored by the report."
"The recovery of production in each country and region, the sustainable use of resources and the conservation of the environment constitute strategic channels for the economic development of each country, together with the creation of jobs with rights, and the strengthening of the network of public services and the social functions of the state."
"I agreed with this report because, in accordance with the spirit of the treaties, a cohesion policy which aims at reducing disparities in levels of development and prepares the regions to meet long-term and short-term challenges (globalisation, demographic change, the depopulation of rural areas, climate change and biodiversity protection), by taking into account their specific strengths and weaknesses, has proved to be essential in the process of European integration."
"A strong and well-financed cohesion policy is a precondition for delivering the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy."
"All regions should develop harmoniously."
"I am pleased that there are calls for the Commission to examine and propose working methodologies that promote urban-rural partnerships, combat the depopulation of rural areas and, at the same time, stimulate sustainable urban development, since nearly 80% of the EU population lives in urban areas."
"Urban and rural areas play a dynamic role in regional economic development."
"In the next programming period, there is a need for investment in urban as well as sub-urban projects and for better coordination with rural development programmes."
"There is a need to promote entrepreneurship and support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), recognising the key role they have played in fostering economic competitiveness and creating jobs, and we must facilitate access to funding, especially for SMEs, and ensure simplified access to risk capital and micro-finance."
"The Commission shall continue to simplify the procedures for utilising both the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in order to reduce the administrative burden on funding beneficiaries."
"in writing. - An improved quality of life through the creation of secure and better quality jobs and ensuring access to infrastructure of all types - be this transport, social or educational, or relating to research, development and innovation - has been the main reason for the public supporting the process of European integration."
"Cohesion policy can ensure the cohesive development of the EU through its specific objectives and instruments, hence satisfying the economic and social needs of the European public."
"At the same time, the EU Member States are being directly confronted with the effects of globalisation."
"This report, entitled 'Achieving real territorial, social and economic cohesion within the EU - a sine qua non for global competitiveness?' is intended to spur debate among the Members of the European Parliament on the interdependence and complementary nature of the measures adopted at European and national level to fulfil the objectives of EU policies, including that of increasing global economic competitiveness."
"The report seeks to provide a framework highlighting the integrating role of cohesion policy and the contribution it makes to increasing the EU's global competitiveness."
"I welcome the report and the debate."
"This report is primarily concerned with regional and European competitiveness and increased productivity."
"It is completely in line with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This means that the impact of the only interesting point made in the report, on 'quality public services for all citizens wherever they live and work' is cancelled out."
"I voted against this text."
"It has been through strong cohesion policy that the Union has succeeded in reducing development disparities between the various European regions."
"It is essential that it continues to ensure coordination between all levels of governance, in order to achieve the objectives that the EU favours with regard to development, and economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Aid for research, innovation and education is an essential measure for ensuring a labour market for all."
"They need to give everything in order to ensure greater economic competitiveness within the global market."
"I voted in favour because I support cohesion, if only so that all Latvian bribers will be locked up in gaol and therefore no longer in a position to interfere with the proper application of the EU Structural Funds."
"In this respect, we must put cohesion into practice at the level of the Public Prosecutor, the police and the courts, not only in Latvia, but also throughout the territory of the European Union."
"In this way, the billions of euro will be applied, firstly, as intended; secondly, in compliance with deadlines; and, thirdly, in the interests of citizens, and not in the interests of individual civil servants and political groupings."
"I am in favour of cohesion."
"Cohesion policy is a key concern of the EU in order to balance out the relationship between the richer and poorer regions."
"It is also intended to enable the results of uneven economic development to be levelled out."
"Accordingly, it should also be possible to ensure that common standards of living can be achieved."
"Particularly in a globalised world, a great deal of importance should be attached to the competitiveness of the regions."
"I am voting against the report, as it is not clear to what extent the regions of the individual Member States already have the necessary expertise at their disposal."
"The report on territorial, social and economic cohesion seeks to provide, in my view, a comprehensive framework highlighting the integrating role of cohesion policy and the contribution it makes to increasing the EU's global competitiveness."
"My vote in favour of the report is intended to spur debate in Europe on the interdependence and complementary nature of the measures adopted at European and national level to fulfil the objectives of EU policies, including that of increasing global economic competitiveness."
"An improved quality of life through the creation of secure and better quality jobs is one of the main reasons for the public supporting the process of European integration."
"Territoriality must be protected and developed via a social action to ensure the full integration - including the economic integration - of the public."
"Cohesion policy can now ensure cohesive development through specific objectives and instruments that satisfy the economic and social needs of the public."
"This particular own-initiative report, which I voted in favour of, follows on from a long hard debate on what is a very sensitive topic for Greece."
"It is true that progress to date in political cohesion has helped to reduce the equality divide between the regions."
"However, the economic times have changed and cohesion policy needs to adapt to them."
"As the most important Community instrument of solidarity between the poorest and richest areas of the EU, the new role of cohesion policy should be to step up efforts to prevent the creation of nouveau pauvres economic islands or regions within the European structure."
"We therefore face a clear and specific challenge."
"There are two points to which Greece will need to pay particular attention: 1."
"The cohesion policy Objective 1 regions; this point has to do with convergence in terms of gross national product, which needs serious strengthening."
"2."
"Regions which are being phased out (which include Attica); these will need to be examined case-by-case on the basis of their most recent economic data, as the economic crisis may have reversed the data for previous years."
"in writing. - (PT) This report results from an initiative by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) during the course of the debate on the future of cohesion and regional policy."
"The strengthening of the territorial, social and economic cohesion of the European Union is one of the directions that needs to be taken to contribute to global competitiveness."
"I agree entirely with the fundamental objective of this report, which is to emphasise the role that cohesion policy plays in reducing economic, social and territorial disparities, creating new jobs, increasing growth and building infrastructure."
"Territorial and social cohesion should be the foundations of the architecture of a new policy that is able to ensure sustainable growth and increased competitiveness at global level."
"I congratulate the rapporteur Mr Luhan on his excellent work and I agree with him that the need to improve quality of life through the creation of secure and better quality jobs and ensuring access to infrastructure of all types - be this transport, social or educational, or relating to research, development and innovation - has been the main reason for the public supporting the process of European integration."
"I completely agree with the idea that cohesion policy is the EU's key policy for enabling the regions to face these challenges in the best way possible and, hence, to help increase the EU's global economic competitiveness, by ensuring common living standards for all EU citizens and supporting development by harnessing local and regional specificities, thereby generating added value and economic productivity."
"We support our common cohesion policy and believe it is important for European integration."
"At a time of considerable tensions within the EU, it is important to stick together."
"However, we believe that regional policy should primarily be the responsibility of the regions and the Member States and that the EU's support should focus on the poorest regions and on various programmes for territorial cooperation."
"The report highlights the achievements of the cohesion policy, which is essential to the successful implementation of the EU 2020 strategy as an instrument for eliminating the disparities between regions."
"Approximately EUR 86 billion has been allocated to research and innovation for the 2007-2013 period."
"In the future programming period, it is necessary to promote and apply successful models in the 'knowledge triangle' to ensure the sustainable development of regional strategic framework programmes for research and innovation"
"The rapporteur calls on the European Commission to submit concrete proposals for defining and implementing consistently the objective of territorial cohesion, emphasising the importance of the principle of decentralisation down to local authority level (the 'bottom-up' approach), with a view to improving the level of absorption of funds (it is counterproductive that regions administer, on average, only 30.5% of the overall budget allocated to the cohesion policy, with the remainder being administered by central governments)."
"Consequently, in future, the partnership principle must be significantly strengthened."
"The report recommends that Member States and the European Commission pay greater attention to supporting major projects covering two or more operational programmes with a considerable impact at European level, which will generate added value, create high quality jobs and safeguard the regions' sustainable development."
"European Union cohesion policy is crucial to enabling the regions to face the challenges of the new international situation."
"By supporting development, reinforcing local and regional specificities and ensuring that the gaps between Europeans' living standards are narrowing, we are consolidating the European project."
"However, there is a need, through policies and measures at regional level, to strengthen support for research, development and innovation, together with the development of education and the skills needed by Europeans to ensure an inclusive labour market."
"This House has today adopted the own-initiative report highlighting the role that cohesion policy plays in reducing economic, social and territorial disparities, creating new jobs, increasing growth, building infrastructure and ensuring the cohesive development of the EU through its specific objectives and instruments, thereby satisfying the economic and social needs of the European public."
"Cohesion policy was one of the first policies to embrace its regional dimension, representing its added value and helping to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability."
"The manner in which each Member State harnesses the opportunities provided by belonging to the single European market depends on its maturity and level of development, which differ from one country to the next."
"It follows that each Member State is responsible for pinpointing the most effective measures for enabling its economy to function within this global system."
"The report proposes new guidelines for the future architecture of the policy, for enhancing its performance, and for guaranteeing strong, sustainable growth and increased global competitiveness."
"Throughout the production of this report, our group often expressed fundamental disagreement with the line suggested by the author."
"Ultimately, therefore, we had no option other than to vote against it."
"In recent years, money from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has contributed to the dynamic development of many towns and a significant proportion of rural areas."
"Cohesion policy is tangible evidence for EU citizens of the positive impact of actions taken at EU level on local communities and their regions."
"We are slowly exiting the crisis which has given rise to additional inequalities within the EU."
"Cohesion policy has turned out to be a flexible instrument which has managed to respond to the specific needs of individual regions and, to a certain extent, cushion the negative effects of the crisis."
"Cohesion between regions is a unique kind of added value which has a positive impact on the EU's economic competitiveness."
"By bringing the level of development of the regions closer together and ensuring a similar quality of life and equal access to infrastructure, the EU can face up to global challenges."
"It will be able to concentrate more on investments in innovation, research and development."
"A sustainable, green, knowledge-based economy will mean we are more competitive, since competitiveness will increase if unemployment falls in the regions and if we support the creation of a well qualified and mobile workforce, both in urban and rural areas."
"Support for small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ the majority of the EU's citizens, is a key issue."
"We need a strong cohesion policy, which, in turn, requires an appropriate budget, at least at its current level, in order to meet its ambitious targets."
"Economic, social and territorial cohesion is a necessary condition of competitiveness at global level, but is not sufficient to ensure it."
"European cohesion policy aims to reduce regional disparities, taking into account the impact of global challenges, such as climate change, demographic change, problems relating to energy and the protection of biodiversity, as well as the new challenges resulting from the economic and financial crisis."
"I therefore support the text put forward by the rapporteur, my colleague in the Committee on Regional Development, which reiterates the idea that cohesion and competitiveness are not contradictory or incompatible, but possess complementary elements."
"Competitiveness within the European Union may only be achieved through sustainable economic growth, which will see cohesion policy contributing to the successful implementation of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and to responses to societal and economic challenges."
"The regional dimension should therefore not be forgotten, but rather encouraged, whether through greater participation by regional and local entities, or through an increase in the role of urban and rural areas, as it is only through the stimulation of regional competitiveness that we will have solid competitiveness at global level."
"in writing. - This report sets out Parliament's plans to better coordinate EU structural funding and European innovation spending as a way of tackling differences between levels of development in regions across the EU, and to sustain regional competitiveness."
"I support these calls, along with further calls to simplify the procedures relating to this funding, in particular for SMEs, which we should be assisting in the current economic climate by reducing the administrative burden placed upon them."
"This report also lays down important markers underlining the importance of the principle of decentralisation (the 'bottom-up' approach) with a view to improving the 'partnership principle' with local authorities who are often best placed to recognise the needs of citizens across the EU, and especially in Wales."
"When we talk about cohesion in this Parliament, we talk about wish-lists."
"Our voters and we ourselves would like to live in a Europe where everyone is successful, no one is poor and there is no shortage of jobs."
"This report therefore rather resembles a list that a child might send to Father Christmas."
"The undisputable benefit of the report is that it includes perhaps everything we would like to see under the Christmas tree - if not this year then perhaps in 2020."
"There is only one problem here."
"All of these things cost money."
"Just as in a family with young children, we must decide on our priorities here as well."
"I cannot help thinking that this is the original role of this Parliament."
"The submitted report bears rather sad witness to the fact that not even the crisis will help us to perform this role any better."
"We always have too many priorities."
"There is, however, only one budget in every family and gifts are purchased out of what remains once the family has been fed and clothed, and all of the housing and energy bills have been paid."
"The support we so magnanimously demand for this or that represents money taken from the pockets of taxpayers; mothers and fathers who decide every month what is their real priority and what will have to wait."
"We must not forget this."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was opened at 15:05)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Question Hour with the President of the Commission"
"The next item is Question Time with the President of the Commission."
"I would like to welcome President Barroso to our monthly Question Time."
"We are ready to begin taking questions."
"The rules are the same as ever: one minute for a question, one minute for an answer and, in the event that any of the political group chairs wish to ask an additional question, another question and answer lasting 30 seconds each."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - On behalf of Mr Daul, the chair of our group, I want to ask the following question."
"The EPP Group would like to know your views pertaining to the current efforts to resume direct negotiations for the settlement of the Palestinian question."
"The United States has abandoned efforts to convince Israel to extend the moratorium on settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, probably because they are leading nowhere."
"What efforts are to be undertaken by the EU separately, or in conjunction within the Quartet, to get the negotiations under way?"
"In view of the present developments, how should one read the reiteration of the EU's readiness to recognise an independent Palestinian state when appropriate?"
"What is the assessment of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip after the decision taken by Israel in June 2010 to ease the closure of the crossings and the efforts for the liberation of Gilad Shalit?"
"President of the Commission. - As you know, the European Union strongly supports the resumption of direct talks."
"Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Council expressed the European position, regretting that Israel was not able to accept a new freeze of settlements as requested by the European Union, the United States and the Quartet."
"I would add that the situation is disappointing, particularly because creating the necessary conditions for a two-state solution is not only in the interests of Palestine, the region and the international community at large, but also, I believe, in the interests of Israel itself."
"Concerning negotiations, the Foreign Affairs Council also agreed yesterday on intensifying coordination with the Quartet and the United States."
"Special envoy Senator Mitchell will shortly meet Catherine Ashton to debrief her on the current state of affairs."
"The European Union will convey its full support for the peace process and its full engagement in the region."
"I believe the Quartet could be revitalised, with the European Union working very closely with the US."
"High Representative Ashton has been in touch with key players in the region, and we are also looking forward to the Arab League meeting this week."
"We need to give negotiations a new chance, a new impetus, because stalemate should not be an option."
"I am convinced that the way forward will be found with the United States."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - I would like to ask again about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip following the opening of the closures, and what is happening with Corporal Gilad Shalit."
"President of the Commission. - The situation in Gaza is not tenable."
"Economic recovery is crucially needed but, unfortunately, we have not seen the fundamental change of policy in Gaza that the European Union has asked for over the last months."
"That is why, last Monday, the European Union agreed on a three-pronged approach to support exports from Gaza, following a request from Prime Minister Fayyad."
"I recently received Prime Minister Fayyad and we spoke about this."
"Gaza should be viewed as a very important component of Palestinian state-building."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, the European Council is meeting on Thursday and Friday."
"I would like to ask you the following questions:"
"Firstly, do you believe that the introduction of Eurobonds can help to stabilise the euro?"
"Secondly, do you share the view of Chancellor Merkel that Eurobonds are not necessary?"
"Thirdly, in the event that your opinion differs from that of Mrs Merkel and you are in favour of Eurobonds, what do you intend to do in the Council this coming Thursday?"
"Fourthly, are you in contact with the Eurogroup President, the Prime Minister and finance minister, Mr Juncker, and, as President of the Commission, will you support him?"
"Fifthly, in the event that Eurobonds do not get the go ahead, will you inform Parliament immediately afterwards of the way in which you, as the Commission, intend to respond to a possible negative decision?"
"President of the Commission. - Eurobonds are an interesting idea."
"In fact, the Commission considered them already in 2008, in our document 'EMU@10' - the EMU's 10th anniversary."
"However, in the meantime, with a view to addressing this crisis, we have created the EFSF and the ESFS."
"These instruments are far from exhaustive."
"If need be, they can be improved and adapted much more quickly than any alternatives, interesting as they may be."
"At present, I think we must ask ourselves a simple question: is the crisis best addressed with instruments that are consensual, or by opening yet another discussion on which there is no consensus?"
"As your question suggests, there is indeed no consensus on the proposals made recently by Prime Minister Juncker."
"I think the answer today is obvious."
"We should concentrate on what can build consensus in the euro area, because not having this consensus will be detrimental for the markets' perception of the euro area."
"Let us not kill the very interesting idea of Eurobonds for the future, but let us concentrate, at this stage, on what we can do quickly and decisively."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have answered my questions with your inimitable diplomacy, but I do not want to let you get away with this. I will therefore ask you very specifically: in his role as President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker has announced that he intends to take the initiative in the European Council with regard to the introduction of Eurobonds."
"Will you support him in this?"
"Furthermore, are you likely to try to convince Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to join the majority of the euro states, or, when Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy say 'we do not want that', will you say 'okay, because two parties say 'no', we will dispense with the idea'?"
"President of the Commission. - I am going to give a very candid answer."
"I do not believe at this stage that there is the slightest possibility of getting an agreement on Eurobonds."
"There is reluctance on the part of several Member States regarding that proposal."
"That is why I think we should work to reach the largest possible consensus with the current instruments."
"I have said to you very frankly - and particularly to Martin Schulz - that I found the idea interesting and attractive."
"In fact, the Commission has made several proposals before - in the time of one of my illustrious predecessors - but at this stage, the conditions are not right for getting an agreement."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - I have a specific question but I want to say, Mr Barroso, that you have the right of initiative with the Commission."
"You can come forward with a proposal on Eurobonds, and that was what Mr Schulz was asking."
"OK, so you do not use that right, and that is a problem for the moment on this issue."
"I have a specific question on the 2009 discharge."
"There is a declaration of assurance by a Director-General of Regional Policy, who says, and I quote him, that for 38 out of 79 programmes, the Directorate-General does not have reasonable assurance on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions in relation to reimbursements in 2009 of expenditures declared."
"This prompts the question as to who is in a position to provide this reasonable assurance."
"The declaration continues that, for the 41 remaining programmes, significant deficiencies have been identified at an early stage, before any reimbursement in 2009."
"So my question to you is, assuming that you take political responsibility for this declaration with all its ramifications, what will be your line of action towards the Member States?"
"President of the Commission. - In answer to your comment, Mr Verhofstadt, let me tell you first of all that the Commission has already used its right of initiative."
"You will remember that, when we launched this mechanism, Olli Rehn and I introduced the possibility of collective guarantees, which was more or less going in the direction of Eurobonds."
"It was flatly rejected by the Member States."
"We could now put forward new proposals, but at this time, I do not think that it is responsible to put forward formal proposals again when we are in such a sensitive situation."
"It will only divide the euro area and the European Union. But the Commission has already made proposals."
"They were on the table and were rejected."
"That is the reality."
"Regarding the financial perspectives, I have already made a commitment to putting forward the proposal for a specific kind of Eurobond - euro project Eurobonds - and, even though I have already heard some negative comments from some capitals, I am still hopeful that this will come into being."
"Regarding your question, I think we have to ask more of the Member States."
"As you know, with the exception of four or five Member States, they are not ready to give their declaration of assurance."
"It is true what our Director-General said - as you mentioned - that sometimes, the Commission does not have all the necessary instruments to engage with the Member States as early as possible with regard to the way in which European Union funding is spent at national level."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, a year ago, you told me that GMOs had polluted your first term of office and that you wanted to refer the issue back to the Member States."
"A few days ago, 1 200 000 signatures were collected from European citizens asking for an independent expert report on GMOs."
"A few days ago again, the Environment Council rejected Commissioner Dalli's proposal by a very large majority."
"The opinions of both Council's and Parliament's legal advisers have also been negative."
"Lastly, you have witnessed the scandal at EFSA with the Banati affair and the questions raised by the panel."
"What is more, EFSA itself has decided to issue new assessment guidelines."
"What I would therefore like to know is are you willing to stay all new authorisations and all renewals of authorisations, such as that of MON810, until the new EFSA rules have come into force?"
"New assessments and authorisation renewals should be processed according to the new rules."
"Finally, are you willing to relaunch the debate so that we can get an independent assessment?"
"Mr President, as regards the initiative, you know that this new system has not come into force yet."
"However, we are naturally following all citizens' initiatives on this issue with great interest."
"In fact, the commissioner responsible met with the sponsors of this initiative even though it has not yet been formally approved."
"As regards the present question, we will be continuing to apply the legislation in its current form."
"We do not have a better alternative to EFSA."
"This is an independent agency which was set up to provide opinions."
"The agency gathers expert information on this subject and, of course, we need to abide by the opinions it issues."
"We are therefore going to continue abiding by Community law on this subject."
"The Commission cannot decide to suspend the application of Community law."
"I have already told you quite openly that I am not happy with the system governing GMOs in Europe."
"I am not happy with it because I do not think it is clear enough."
"However, this is the system that I am obliged to adhere to."
"Thank you for your answer."
"However, EFSA has already put in place new guidelines that are much stricter."
"Are you willing to agree that all new authorisations that have been granted over this latest period and the issue of MON810 should be reviewed in the light of these new guidelines?"
"We cannot accept assessments today that were carried out on the basis of old rules."
"That is why I am asking you this question very precisely and I would like you to start this whole debate again from scratch, instead of waiting until 2012."
"Directive 2001/18/EC is due to be updated in 2012: the process needs to be brought forward."
"As always, we take into consideration the proposals and suggestions of the independent agency, the Parma-based European Food Safety Agency."
"Therefore, if the agency puts forward a new guideline, we will study it very attentively."
"That is as much as I can tell you at this stage."
"However, the legal framework governing the approval of GMOs has not yet been changed."
"Therefore, I must stick to the present system until it is changed, but we will be ready to consider all new guidelines and study them extremely carefully."
"Mr President, Gazprom and the Nord Stream consortium have been laying what is known as the Northern Pipeline since 9 April."
"I do not wish to focus on the environmental aspects of this project, since this House has also already debated them."
"I merely wish to draw your attention to one issue - the pipe which has been laid makes it significantly harder for large ships to reach the Polish port of Świnoujście."
"This port is a major source of work for many Poles in western Poland, a region affected by a level of unemployment which is often fairly high."
"Poland has raised this issue in bilateral talks, but I have the impression that we are also dealing here with problems relating to competitiveness."
"The port of Rostock is right next door, over the border in Germany."
"I hope it will enjoy rapid growth, but I would like all ports in Europe to be treated equally, so that they really can compete and so that the technical solutions adopted by one of the Member States do not obstruct the development of a port in another."
"President of the Commission. - I am aware that there have been concerns at some point that access to the Polish ports concerned would be restricted."
"According to the information available to the Commission, however, the German Stralsund mining authority included a requirement for the Nord Stream company in its permit to prepare a revised risk analysis for a section of the pipeline in German territory, as plans were presented at that stage by the Polish side to adapt both ports for ships that would need a deeper water depth to float."
"As a result of the analysis, the pipeline will be laid in the seabed with a covering of half a metre for about 20 km."
"In addition, the analysis of the planned route of the German EEZ led to the decision to opt for an alternative track over a length of 12 km."
"The final permission was granted by the Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography in February this year."
"According to the information available from the German authorities and the developer, both of the above measures were taken in order to ensure unrestricted access to the Polish ports after construction of the pipeline."
"I am sorry that this is very technical, but it is the best information we have."
"Mr Barroso, you have proved many times that you treat Member States fairly."
"I hope that in this matter, the European Commission will treat my country in a similarly fair manner."
"I would merely like to draw your attention to the fact that you yourself admitted that you are relying predominantly on data presented by the German side."
"I would appeal to the European Commission to take the advice of independent experts, too, on this matter, although I would continue to stress that I have great faith in your fair approach to all European Union Member States."
"President of the Commission. - Thank you for your comments, Mr Kamiński."
"The Commission is indeed following the issue of Nord Stream very closely."
"We are aware of the sensitivity of the issue with regard to the environment and from other points of view, so we will be following it with great care."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, in response to Mr Schulz's questions, you said that the Eurobonds proposal will probably not be successful."
"Previously, we were told that nothing would come of the financial transaction tax, and other proposals have also come to nothing."
"We are now in the third year following the financial crisis and I am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package - that would, of course, be an additional measure - or whether we have to expect that, by the weekend, yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others."
"My question is: how expensive is this delay, especially as it is clearly costing a lot of money?"
"President of the Commission. - One thing we have to tell the European Heads of State and Government is the following: this week, when we meet - because the Commission President is also present as a member of the European Council - we will not just be addressing one another or addressing politics or the economy, we will be addressing the markets."
"These are extremely sensitive issues, where I believe we have to show some kind of restraint in the comments made."
"Because I have a duty to be transparent with all of you, I have already responded very honestly to the question put by Mr Schulz."
"We have seen some interesting Eurobond proposals."
"I think we should not kill the proposal, but it is obvious that there is no consensus at this stage."
"I will not insist on what, for me, is obviously a divisive issue at this stage."
"We have instruments now that were the object of a consensus, which we can work on to try and find a coherent, robust action to protect the euro area and the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, I just have a brief additional question: are there any other instruments that are still under discussion?"
"I feel rather poorly informed in this regard."
"Something needs to be done, and we are probably in agreement that the instruments that we have at our disposal should actually be used."
"President of the Commission. - We are discussing many issues and many possible alternative instruments."
"The last Euro Group considered different options and different ideas, and the Commission is in touch with all the parties involved."
"I myself and Olli Rehn have not only been consulting Member States, but also the President of the European Central Bank, the Executive Director of the IMF and other very important players in this field, but I do not think it is wise, as sometimes happened in the past, to make very important announcements that are not followed by concrete consequences."
"Next time, we have to do exactly the opposite and come up with real conclusions when we are ready."
"That is why the Commission is working very actively with all Member States and with other institutions to give a comprehensive response as soon as possible."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr Barroso, the recent WikiLeaks storm has led to mixed feelings, with some people saying transparency is good and others saying perhaps the leaks will damage international diplomacy."
"However, I was particularly amused by the references to you in WikiLeaks, where it mentioned your trip to Russia and the fact that you were ignored and excluded and the Russian view from upon high that you were nothing more than a glorified international civil servant."
"Mr Barroso, remember: we have discussed this before here."
"I have pointed out to you again and again that you have not been directly elected by the people and you therefore have no real legitimacy."
"Is the fact that you are unelected the reason why you do not command more respect on the global stage, and why increasingly, the peoples of Europe are holding you and the entire Commission in contempt?"
"President of the Commission. - I would not expect you, Mr Farage, to make common cause with the Russians - because that is what you are suggesting, that you agree with them!"
"Frankly, I was elected by this Parliament, by secret vote, so I think I deserve the respect of this Parliament, from all Members of the Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"The European Union of 27 democracies has an original way of electing a President of the Commission precisely because we are not a state."
"I am sure you would not be in favour of a European unified state."
"Since we are not a unified state, there is no direct election of a President of the European Union."
"We do not have one; we have a President of the Commission."
"You may like it or not - I like it more than you! - but in fact, I have been elected by this Parliament and there is a President of the European Council who was designated by the Heads of State and Government."
"This is the way we are, and I think it is a democratic way of handling the diversity of the European Union."
"I would hope that Members of the European Parliament, at least, respect the institutions we have in the European Union, even if others do not."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Well, Mr Barroso, I enjoyed that enormously!"
"That you can stand up and boast about the fact that you were elected in secret and that somehow this gives you democratic legitimacy is the most bizarre concept I have come across in my entire life."
"The fact is that the Commission has the sole right to propose the kind of legislation that is damaging Europe's economies in the way that it is."
"Are there any circumstances in which you think the peoples of Europe should have a referendum so that they can decide these issues?"
"(Interjections from the floor from various Members)"
"Colleagues, I am sorry we are not taking comments from the floor."
"We would like to go ahead with the proceedings."
"President of the Commission. - The election in Parliament was an open election."
"However, many people consider that the freest elections are elections where each person - or each Member of Parliament - can take decisions secretly."
"In totalitarian systems, secret votes are usually not allowed, precisely because of the pressure on individual freedoms."
"That is my first point."
"Secondly, regarding referenda, constitutional and democratic theory allows for referenda as well as for representative democracy."
"By the way, Britain is probably the country that has done most for representative democracy."
"A perfectly legitimate way of making decisions in a democracy is by representative democracy."
"The role of parliaments, be it national parliaments or the European Parliament, is immensely important in democracy."
"Personally, I believe that some comments made against representative democracy do not reflect a true democratic mind when they are made so negatively."
"China enjoys a large surplus on its balance of trade with the EU."
"Europe's surplus in services is too small to compensate for this."
"China achieves its trade surplus by an artificially low value of its currency, by suppressed wage rates so that imports into China cannot be afforded and so that export prices are considerably lower than European prices, and thirdly, by ignoring international patent rights so that Chinese companies can benefit from research and development not carried out by themselves."
"China is rapidly accumulating foreign currency reserves and control over scarce global resources."
"European countries are becoming the willing victims of a relentless global competitor with the instrument to destruct our livelihoods."
"European countries must individually - my preference - or collectively protect our industries."
"Why does the Commission allow EU business and workers to suffer unfair competition from China?"
"President of the Commission. - Let me tell you that we will be much more successful if we do it collectively rather than separately."
"Frankly, I do not see that our individual Member States have enough leverage to impose some kind of measures on China."
"The European Union collectively can engage with China, and that is what we have been doing."
"We are in favour of free trade, as you know, but we are also in favour of fair trade."
"When we have believed there is evidence of dumping for instance, we have launched anti-dumping measures regarding China."
"It was not easy because some Member States opposed those measures, but we took them."
"Every time we meet the Chinese leadership, we discuss intellectual property rights and the need for them to respect some basic principles so that we can keep open trade with them."
"That is exactly our agenda: to engage the Chinese positively whilst also being firm in terms of our trade interests."
"By the way, this was quite clearly expressed at the last summit."
"You said that you believed in fair trade, but fair trade is not on offer."
"What we have is biased trade in favour of China."
"Will the Commission be successful in getting China to remove its subsidies, allow its currency to appreciate or, for that matter, to respect international property rights which apparently amount to something like 5% of Chinese GDP?"
"Will it not be necessary, in the end, to block imports of Chinese goods altogether?"
"President of the Commission. - It is clear that the Commission will be successful if it has the full support of our Member States."
"We are doing that and we are very committed to reciprocity above all."
"The concept of reciprocity means that we want to keep markets open."
"We believe it is in our interest."
"The European Union is by far the biggest exporter in the world, bigger than China, and so it is important to keep markets open."
"We also believe, however, that our partners have to respect some basic rules."
"Regarding exchange rates, as you know, the European Union was in the front line at the last G20 attempting to ensure that this issue is addressed constructively and cooperatively, because we believe the matter should also be discussed when we address the problems of major imbalances in the world economy."
"We now come to the second part of Question Hour, catch-the-eye."
"The topic is WikiLeaks and cyber security."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Barroso, I am not going to ask you to address the problems of United States diplomacy, nor to comment on the virtues and failings of computer networks, on freedom of information, or on the shameful calls for the death of Julian Assange."
"What I would like to say is that we do not have the right to ignore any information that comes into the public arena."
"I asked the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights if we could revisit the investigation that Parliament carried out in 2007 into the activities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency in Europe, over which I had the honour of presiding."
"I paid tribute to you at the time: the Barroso Commission was cooperative and helpful, and acted with great transparency, quite unlike the Council, which made omissions and lied in its dealings with Parliament."
"The question I would like to put to you is very simple: is the Barroso Commission prepared to cooperate in a fully transparent manner with the European Parliament again?"
"The European Commission, over which I have the honour of presiding, always cooperates with total transparency with the European Parliament, and will always do so in the future."
"I have not the slightest doubt about this, and I thank you for your words about the Commission over which I preside."
"I believe that it is important for us to observe the highest standards and principles of transparency and fair institutional cooperation in all relations between the Commission and Parliament."
"I would like to ask the same question."
"Europeans are digitally dependent nowadays, and we wish to be digitally dependent, but with the proviso that we feel safe and secure on the Internet."
"It has to be a priority for the Commission to come up with proposals regarding the safety of the 500 million citizens of Europe."
"What are its plans regarding keeping security and privacy together in order not to neutralise one or the other?"
"President of the Commission. - Some of those matters fall within national spheres of responsibility, but in the areas that fall within our sphere of responsibility, we have recently proposed some improvements."
"As regards legislation on access to documents, we have put forward some proposals from Commissioner Malmström and they are now being considered by you."
"We have also been making proposals on cyber security because, as you said rightly said, we are becoming more and more digitally dependent."
"It is very important that in digital space, we have freedom, but this must, of course, be responsible freedom, with important rights like the right to privacy being protected."
"Data protection is therefore also a question of fundamental rights and we believe the Commission has put forward sensible proposals that strike the right balance between freedom - that is non-negotiable - and using the Internet in a responsible manner."
"The President of the Commission has given fulsome answers on WikiLeaks."
"Can I ask him about something on which his views have not yet been leaked by WikiLeaks?"
"President, you answered questions on the issuance of Eurobonds to provide current spending for governments."
"I understand and I share some of the concerns expressed about such a course of action."
"However, do you not recognise the capacity for borrowing which exists as a result of the sound management of the euro?"
"Since Mr Oettinger tells us he needs EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years for energy infrastructure investment - that is about EUR 100 billion a year to help tackle the twin challenge of climate change and energy security - and since that would be extremely ambitious for the European Investment Bank to take on, could you not bring forward proposals for the issuance of Eurobonds to finance investment in infrastructure rather than to finance current government spending?"
"President of the Commission. - Mr Watson, I did not come here to 'WikiLeak' with you!"
"You already know my position on this issue."
"In my State of the Union address to you, I mentioned that I will make proposals for Eurobonds, taking the shape of project bonds specifically for infrastructure."
"These would not be for Member States to have more debt or to cover excessive debt - because we have a problem with excessive debt in Europe - but specifically to fund some important infrastructure projects, mainly with the support of the European Investment Bank - as you correctly said."
"This is very much on the agenda and in our financial perspective."
"In June, we will make some concrete proposals on this issue."
"Let us try to build the necessary consensus, because I think that this is one of the ways to address our current problem."
"There are very important constraints on the budgets of our Member States and, at the same time, we need financing for some truly European projects."
"(ES) Mr Barroso, what I am concerned about is the content."
"It seems to me that we are shooting the messenger rather than getting to the heart of the problem."
"The major issue that is behind WikiLeaks is its content, which they are demonstrating is true."
"For years, you and other colleagues of yours, such as Miguel Moratinos, have denied the majority of its content."
"You have denied that there was European collusion with certain illegal practices by the United States."
"We now know that this is true, that it did happen, and we are still waiting for an answer from many foreign ministries and, in particular, from you."
"I believe that it is essential that you give an explanation regarding the content."
"Following that, I have another question regarding the campaign against Julian Assange."
"I think it is really important that we take into account the risks that this person is currently facing."
"We cannot forget that he did something that was necessary, which was to bring the truth to the table."
"That is what I hope you will also understand, and it is what we all hope for in Parliament: for you to give explanations, either here or in a committee that we should reactivate in order to ascertain the real truth."
"Regarding the content, all the information that has come to light relates to the activities of Member States, and not of the European Commission."
"The Member States need to provide all the clarifications, and I am confident that they will do so, like the democratic states that they are."
"I know that initiatives have been taken in some Member States to inform the public about specific operations of which they have been accused."
"With regard to the work of the Commission, as the honourable Member, Mr Coelho, reminded us a short time ago, the Commission has done everything in its power to provide the maximum possible information to Parliament and to the European public."
"With regard to Julian Assange, I have no comment to make."
"There are accusations against him of a criminal nature, which were made by a Member State - Sweden - which is a democracy and currently has a European Arrest Warrant out against him, which is being examined by the British judicial authorities."
"The Commission clearly has nothing to say about this, apart from the obvious: any defendant is innocent until proven guilty."
"(EL) Mr President, a real war is being waged in cyberspace at the moment."
"According to the press, over the last few days, thousands of hackers have launched cyber attacks on companies which have been trying to get WikiLeaks off the Internet or to undermine it financially and have its donations cut off."
"Companies such as MasterCard, Visa and PayPal have been hit by DDOS-type cyber attacks, with thousands of computers trying to connect to the same website at the same time, thereby overloading it and making it crash."
"We all realise that this causes problems for the public's transactions in general."
"The question is straightforward: do we consider - at European level - that we have a reliable safety net to protect the public's online transactions if this happens?"
"President of the Commission. - I believe we are not completely prepared for that, which is why the Commission recently put forward some proposals on fighting this kind of cyber attack."
"It was Commissioner Malmström's initiative, and now those proposals extend to all kinds of cyber attacks."
"Regarding the cyber attacks that you have mentioned, let me tell you that the United States State Department denies having issued any direct instructions to PayPal, Visa or MasterCard, so I do not have any comment to make on decisions by companies to service - or not to service - WikiLeaks."
"The Commission is against any kind of cyber attack made by one side or the other in that controversial case."
"(PT) Mr President, the publication of classified US diplomatic correspondence by WikiLeaks and by respected international media is only possible because of a colossal failure within the US security system, due to the excessive enlargement of the circles of distribution of the State Department and the Department of Defence."
"What consequences do you believe this failure could have for the transatlantic relationship, specifically at the level of sharing diplomatic and intelligence information?"
"Also, what lessons are being learned to strengthen the security of inter-European communications networks and the functioning of the European External Action Service, including the Correspondence Européenne network and security against cyber attacks?"
"Firstly, we believe that what occurred in the United States could occur within practically any security system."
"No security system is completely immune to the possibility of a person breaking the law."
"It is true that within the US system, apparently, according to information received, hundreds of thousands of individuals have access to extremely confidential information, but the truth is that within systems that value freedom, which is also the case for European systems, 100% security is impossible."
"It is for this reason that we are determined to work with our partners and friends in the United States to strengthen security, but always with respect for fundamental freedoms too, and we believe that it is important to find a good balance between these two precautions, as I said a short while ago."
"It is true that, in particular, because of terrorist activity, there is a need to exchange some extremely sensitive pieces of information."
"At the same time, we should do this in line with standards of caution and, in general, while observing the principle of fair balance."
"(IT) As the statements by the government representatives of numerous States demonstrate, the extraordinary zeal with which Julian Assange is being investigated is clearly designed to punish him and WikiLeaks for having revealed certain top secrets to the world, such as the concerns of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who asked the US embassies in Rome and Moscow for information on any personal investments of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Putin that might influence the foreign or economic policies of their respective countries."
"Mr Berlusconi is described as Mr Putin's spokesman in Europe."
"Clearly, what is taking place here is the unprecedented punishment and persecution of a man and an organisation whose only crime is to have made the world aware of certain grey areas that put governments in an uncomfortable position."
"Hence, it is our duty to protect the freedom of WikiLeaks and to guarantee fair treatment for Julian Assange, who should pay for his crimes, if proven, in a fair trial."
"I therefore call on the Commission to state its position on the WikiLeaks affair and to explain how it intends to monitor the situation so that this affair is not used to clamp down on freedom of information and to impose restrictions on the Internet, which has once again proved to be an exceptionally powerful democratic instrument, and which must therefore be protected."
"President of the Commission. - As I said earlier, I cannot comment on specific cases or criminal accusations."
"Regarding Mr Assange, an accusation has been made by the Swedish judicial system and is now being considered by the British judicial system."
"Both Sweden and the United Kingdom respect the rule of law."
"We have to let the normal process of law go on."
"I cannot comment - and I should not comment - precisely because I very much respect the presumption of innocence and everybody's individual rights."
"I cannot, therefore, comment on that."
"Regarding the other comments you made about some of the things in WikiLeaks, I do not think it is right for me to comment."
"The comments are attributed to United States diplomats and are therefore their responsibility."
"I cannot comment on them."
"I can only tell you our position, which is not the same as the United States' position. Our position - the European position - is clear on the matter that you have asked us about."
"We do not have to comment on specific leaks, whether they come from WikiLeaks or elsewhere."
"(EL) Mr President, I think that we are still missing the point."
"At least, I think, from your answers, that you are missing the point."
"First of all, I am absolutely flabbergasted - and I would like to know if you are equally flabbergasted - at the unbelievable silence on the part of the European bodies about this suppression of freedom of speech."
"Unfortunately, the defenders of freedom of speech are all absent from the House."
"They have disappeared."
"My question is this: do you think this is being used to suppress the facility to transfer data?"
"We all shout about the right of the Chinese and the Cubans to access the Internet - and rightly so; but what can and should we do now that this right is actually being suppressed?"
"What can and should the Commission do?"
"My question is very specific: what will you do to ensure that the European public can access the WikiLeaks website?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, the substantive issue that we have addressed is that freedom of expression, in all its forms, is not only a fundamental human right, but the cornerstone of all democratic societies."
"It is not negotiable."
"At the same time, it is also clear that there is information, be it private, commercial or legal, which, by its very nature, is sensitive and cannot be accessible to the wider public."
"Data protection is also anchored in fundamental rights."
"All our Member States have rules that protect data and some kinds of sensitive information for the sake of the public, and this is our position in terms of freedom of expression and data protection."
"Regarding accusations against a specific person, I am not a tribunal."
"Also, the Commission is not supposed to make comments on specific accusations against specific individuals because the Commission is not, and is not to supposed be, a tribunal and does not make presumptions as to the culpability of a specific individual."
"The new NATO concept calls for coordinating national cyber defence capabilities to bring all NATO bodies under centralised cyber protection."
"How do you see the European Commission's role in better coordinating our national cyber defences, which are on various levels, and enhancing cooperation with NATO?"
"Will, for example, Baroness Ashton take up some cyber security issues that are covered by defence policies?"
"Do you need more joint EU research to define a comprehensive answer at European level to cyber challenges?"
"President of the Commission. - This is, basically, not a Commission competence but Baroness Ashton's competence as High Representative."
"She is developing this kind of action with our main partners."
"At the last summit with President Obama, we put our cooperation in terms of cyber security on the agenda."
"This is an important issue, not only for NATO but also for our bilateral relations with the United States."
"We are working on that."
"We believe there are serious cyber-security threats."
"Some Member States - I presume your country also - have already been subject to cyber attacks."
"We believe this is an important concern."
"We have to address it at European level also, but this is a matter where Member States have some responsibilities."
"The High Representative is developing efforts to establish a coherent approach to cyber security problems."
"I fully support those efforts."
"There has been a lot of publicity on this particular issue all over Europe."
"One of the things that concerns people is what this is going to mean for the future of cyber security right across the EU."
"I do not believe that many people are too concerned about the individual involved here."
"What they are concerned about is how this is going to play out across Europe."
"I just think that it is important that the EU should have a policy on this."
"I would urge the Commission to involve as many partners in these discussions as possible, not only at Member State level, but also at other levels of government right across the EU so that, for example, cyber security is an important issue for regional and local governments as well."
"President of the Commission. - I fully agree with the concern that you have expressed."
"This is exactly the line we are developing."
"Not so long ago, the European Union witnessed cyber attacks against public and private organisations in Estonia and in Lithuania, in 2007 and 2008 respectively."
"Thousands of cyber attacks are committed daily against European Union institutions and other public authorities."
"The Commission recently responded to this alarming situation by proposing, on 30 September, a proposal for a directive on attacks against information systems, repealing the relevant framework decision from 2005."
"The overall goal of the directive is to combat large-scale attacks originating from and/or targeting the European Union."
"We are very attentive to these concerns, and we believe that the proposal for a directive is a good one."
"It penalises the users of tools such as botnets for committing the offences, and introduces a higher level of sanctions for committing the offences."
"It introduces an obligation for Member States to respond to an urgent request from both the public and the private sector via the 24/7 network of contact points within eight hours of receiving the request, and introduces a monitoring obligation for Member States to facilitate the collection and provision of data about cyber attacks, including the number of prosecutions and criminal reports."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the responses concerning Mr Assange's case and his imprisonment on account of his ideas of freedom are reminiscent of those of Pontius Pilate."
"I would like us to consider three points:"
"1."
"This is a case of fumus persecutionis, because the accusations are very weak; 2. the United States is putting pressure on a European country to extradite, even though it has not yet specified the legal grounds for this request; 3. a citizen's European bank accounts have been closed, meaning that he cannot receive any financial assistance in Europe from his supporters."
"What is more, all the statistics confirm that the European public is in favour of these principles of freedom, that it wants Internet freedom, that it is in favour of freedom, despite the doubts and the problems that have emerged in the wake of this initiative, which I personally do not fully support."
"Nevertheless, we would like President Barroso to state what the limits are and what the protection of human rights and of freedom of expression is really and truly founded on."
"Are we looking at a virtual Guantánamo here?"
"Are we facing the threat of an Orwellian total censorship of the Internet?"
"That is the danger, and we need answers on this matter."
"It is also important to keep a check on Mr Assange's prison conditions, because in Italy, not even Mafia members are held in complete isolation."
"President of the Commission. - I can give you some information on the legal aspects of this case, without prejudging the position, of course, because I am not a tribunal and cannot make a decision on that."
"First of all, Mr Assange was taken into custody by the British authorities on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant."
"The Swedish prosecutor issued an advertisement notice regarding Mr Assange in the Swedish system, the Schengen system and via Interpol, and that was the basis on which a European Arrest Warrant was issued."
"Now, according to Article 28 of the framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant, a person who has been surrendered pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant shall not be extradited to a third state without the consent of the competent authority of the Member State which surrendered the person."
"This means that, since Mr Assange was taken into custody in the UK, the British authority competent to decide whether or not to surrender him to Sweden would also have to give its prior consent to extradite him to a third country."
"This is the best explanation I can give of the legal aspects, but I cannot make any sort of presumption about the culpability or not of the individual in question."
"President Barroso, you have made various statements, including the statement this afternoon, about how the EU and its Member States respect fundamental rights and the rule of law, but the inquiry on extraordinary rendition, of which Mr Coelho was the chair and I was the vice-chair, reported prima facie evidence that around a dozen EU and other European countries had colluded in war on terror abuses, such as disappearance and torture."
"Frankly, I am afraid you gave a rather waffly answer to Mr Coelho."
"We believed that the Commission and the Council had not respected Article 6 of the Treaty and we urged them to ascertain the truth about what had happened and to take action if appropriate under Article 7, which means sanctions of human rights abuses."
"Frankly, there has been no result."
"This leaves the EU open to the charge of hypocrisy."
"What will you do now to get full political and legal accountability for European collusion in human rights abuses in the name of the so-called war on terror?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, the Commission has always respected fundamental rights and I absolutely reject any kind of criticism that the Commission has been involved in any kind of violation of fundamental rights."
"That is not true."
"The Commission has a completely clean record on that matter, and we are ready to work with the Parliament in full transparency on all those matters."
"There are some matters that are the responsibility of the Member States and they have to do their duty."
"The Commission cannot replace the Member States."
"We have a Treaty, we have a responsibility, we have duties and we have rights."
"The Commission has given this Parliament all the cooperation it has requested - and in full transparency - on the matters that you have just mentioned."
"(DE) Mr President, the Internet platform WikiLeaks is publishing - to put it simply - confidential information, and, naturally, that is always very unpleasant for the parties involved."
"It should also be noted that as yet, no legal proceedings have been brought against WikiLeaks."
"In the meantime, a proper cyber war is raging."
"On the one hand, WikiLeaks servers are being attacked and, on the other, supporters of WikiLeaks are bombarding the web servers of Visa and MasterCard in order to bring them down."
"My question, Mr President, is: will the Commission take action against such proxy wars?"
"You have already mentioned the activities of Commissioner Malmström."
"Is there already a timetable for this and do we already have any ideas of what we will do?"
"Is the Commission planning - and, in this regard, I would like a clear answer please, not excuses with details and judicial arguments - to take specific action against WikiLeaks in order once again to act as a willing agent of the United States on the sensitive subject of data transfer and to behave as such?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, we are not planning any kind of action against WikiLeaks."
"Secondly, regarding the directives we have put forward, they are now going to be discussed with Parliament."
"We have put proposals on the table to enhance cyber security."
"With regard to some of the issues that you want me to address in detail, I think it would be better to give you a briefing at expert level."
"I am sorry, I cannot give you specific answers in one minute, but my departments are fully available to you, if you so wish, to give you all the details about the way we see this important issue. But this is basically not a Commission issue."
"This is something that happened in the United States, and which had an impact upon the global community using the Internet, and it is a very serious and important issue."
"I am not underestimating the importance of it, but we have to be clear about what our areas of responsibility are."
"I am offering to provide, in an organised manner, those Members of Parliament who so wish with a complete briefing on the technical measures that we can take at European level."
"(RO) Mr President, I would like to ask you a question about recent events involving attacks on Visa, MasterCard and PayPal by hackers, with the intention of sabotaging their financial operations and causing financial losses."
"When these cyber attacks took place, causing fairly severe technical problems, was customers' confidential data secure or vulnerable?"
"This is my first question."
"While these cyber attacks are going on, carried out on ideological grounds or for the fun of hacking, there is the chance that hackers who are only after financial gain will also get into these systems."
"I would like to know whether this financial and personal information was affected and what methods and perpetrators are involved in this and whether you have the situation under control at the moment."
"I would also like to know whether the US and international authorities are dealing with this problem as well."
"President of the Commission. - I have no direct information on the leaks and how far confidential information or private data was leaked."
"I am sorry I do not have that information myself - I have nothing to do with that case."
"It is true that this issue has raised very important issues in terms of security."
"We had been working on some of those problems before this WikiLeaks case and I have told you about some Commission initiatives."
"I am sure that those on the other side of the Atlantic are concerned as well, so that is why I think we should work together on increasing cyber security, always respecting the fundamental freedoms - because freedom of expression is a sacred right for us in the European Union - while being clear that data protection and privacy are also fundamental rights."
"We have to find the right balance and that is why, in all our initiatives, we have to take on board those two principles, which are sometimes difficult to harmonise but nevertheless very important."
"Colleagues, we had 21 names on the list but only 14 of you could take the floor."
"I am very sorry, but the names were taken in the order on the list."
"That concludes Question Hour."
"Parliament's position on the new 2011 Draft Budget as modified by the Council (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Sidonia Elżbieta Jędrzejewska and Helga Trüpel, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2011, all sections, as modified by the Council (17635/2010 - C7-0411/2010 -."
"Mr President, after many months of negotiations, discussions and tension, we will have finally managed - tomorrow I hope - to adopt the European Union 2011 budget here at the European Parliament plenary session."
"I would like to start positively with what I believe to be the most interesting and effective of the achievements of the 2011 budget, and those that are of particular significance for European citizens."
"First and foremost, I am very pleased that we managed to reach an agreement on time, that the difficult negotiations with the Member States and the European Commission were completed before the end of 2010, and that we managed to avoid the hazard of a provisional 2011 budget, even though each of the parties, of course, had to compromise to a certain extent."
"I would like to draw your attention to several valuable and interesting aspects regarding the specific details of what we managed to negotiate."
"First and foremost, this relates to the joint position that we drew up, and the unanimous adoption of Parliament's proposal of October 2010 regarding the European Parliament's priorities in terms of budgetary obligations."
"All our proposals regarding increased funding for the budget lines which are vital for youth, education, mobility, innovation, research programmes and for programmes relating to key issues in international affairs were accepted by the Council and the Commission."
"I am pleased about this."
"It should also be noted that Parliament was very realistic and disciplined in its October reading."
"I am pleased that the Council and the Member States took note of this discipline and acknowledged the priorities we proposed, and to which we have been making clear reference since March."
"In summary, I am pleased that this triangle - youth, education and mobility - was understood and properly appreciated by the Council."
"I hope that the Commission will make every effort to ensure that these increased funds are used appropriately in 2011."
"I am pleased that we managed to understand our own fears to a large extent."
"However, our satisfaction that we managed to reach an understanding is, in very many respects, marred by several important elements."
"First and foremost, during the 2011 negotiations, we saw in practice how difficult it is to implement the Treaty of Lisbon, how many unknown areas remain ahead of us and how much joint work we have to put in to develop practical, pragmatic solutions arising from the new frameworks within which we are functioning."
"This process has by no means finished."
"It has also become painfully clear that the Member States are showing an ever-decreasing amount of solidarity when they have to contend with a crisis, and it is precisely European solidarity that is the first value to be lost when savings have to be made in national budgets."
"I regret greatly that the Member States have suddenly become so very short-sighted and that they want to make savings specifically on European integration."
"It is a sore subject."
"We must return to this debate, as it is by no means over."
"I would also like to ask Mr Wathelet two rather important questions on subjects that continue to puzzle me."
"I would like to know whether the Council intends to adopt the joint declaration - the draft of which we have seen, although I am unclear as to its status - on the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"Furthermore, the European Commission, in accordance with Parliament's expectations, presented a whole series of single-page declarations clarifying Lisbonisation, European added value and own resources."
"I would like to ask Mr Wathelet, who represents the Council here, whether the Council could explain its own position on these matters."
"Once again, I would like to thank my fellow Members from the European Parliament for their contribution and everyone from the European Commission and the Council for their constructive approach, and I will be grateful for an answer to these questions."
"Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for Parliament's budget, I can definitely speak of a political success in respect of this part of the budget."
"Parliament's position following the vote on the budget in October has been accepted almost in its entirety by the Council."
"My approach was to tackle this budget with a great deal of responsibility, with ambition commensurate with the Treaty of Lisbon, but also with self-restraint on our part, because, of course, we all understand the difficult situation we are in, but are nevertheless committed Europeans."
"This was precisely the conflict of aims that we had with Parliament's budget, as well as with the general part of the budget."
"The different institutions, in other words, our own House, but also the other small institutions such as the European Data Protection Supervisor, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Auditors, have been given the posts that they desperately need - not as many as they originally asked for, but a number that recognises what they really need."
"Parliament's budget - and I think this is important - has been cut by EUR 25 million compared to what the Bureau originally asked for."
"In other words, this is another clear sign of self-limitation and self-restraint, but not self-denial."
"Something else that was particularly important to me was for us to use more resources to make our buildings energy efficient."
"There should also be more bicycles here in Strasbourg so that we are not reliant on so many cars, and it should be possible to provide the staff of the institutions with cards for local public transport in Brussels."
"Thus, here, too, it is a question of environmental responsibility."
"The salaries adjustment in accordance with the court ruling has been properly budgeted for and will be financed by redistribution from other parts of the budget."
"That means that we have reached a good compromise between Parliament and the Council, and we have cooperated well."
"However, I will now, if I may, give you my political assessment of the general budget as budget coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"The increase in payments - 2.91% - is a very modest one, and it is a transitional budget at a time of necessary austerity in the Member States."
"Parliament, however - and I still believe this is an appropriate request - wanted a clear agreement with the Council on how the Treaty of Lisbon, which the Council and Parliament adopted together, of course - after all, we are not opponents on this issue - can actually be implemented."
"I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament is not going beyond the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We are merely demanding observance of the Treaty."
"However, we are also calling for the Council not to hide behind the results of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"There is a danger of this in my opinion, and it is something regarding which any self-respecting parliament must express its criticism."
"We Greens are not satisfied with what we have achieved up to now."
"There are a few weak statements, but that is not what we originally wanted."
"I am of the opinion that if we adopt an ambitious strategy for which there are genuinely good grounds, then we must also stick with it and not give up ahead of time."
"As Greens, we are pleased that we do not currently have the money for the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, because we do not consider this to be a real priority at this point in time and, from an environmental point of view, we believe that we should spend more money on renewable energies and environmental restructuring, rather than putting it into projects whose success is not assured."
"However, what we can now undoubtedly see as regards the next year is that the negotiations will continue."
"I very much hope that, in a pro-European spirit between the Council and Parliament, we will then be more successful together."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now on the home straight for the adoption of the 2011 budget."
"This has not been a walk in the park."
"There have been a few pitfalls, but I hope that we are finally reaching our objective in this budgetary procedure and that, as the rapporteur said to you a moment ago, we will be able to approve a budget before the end of this year."
"I think that that is really what drove us all on today, and here we have the proof that when all the budgetary areas said that they really wanted to reach an agreement, they were telling the truth."
"However, we perhaps also need to say that we have carried out a new exercise and we have inaugurated a new procedure, and I think - as the rapporteur said just now - that everyone has had to make concessions, everyone has had to make some compromises."
"On the one hand, the European Parliament has itself considerably amended the Council's draft on commitment appropriations."
"It has managed to get several projects and preparatory actions included, it has initiated debates and questioned the funding for a large number of policies, and it has truly played its role as a budgetary authority in full."
"It has also accepted the restrictions that the Council imposed quite strictly, particularly with regard to payment appropriations."
"However, there is also the joint statement to which the rapporteur referred, and which the Council clearly endorses, given that it is a joint statement."
"You will also be aware that we have received a letter from the Prime Minister of Belgium, the current President of the Council, addressed to the President of the European Parliament, telling us that the representatives of the next four six-month Presidencies have confirmed that they wish to undertake the procedure for developing future financial perspectives in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty."
"In a sense, then, this is the first implementation of the joint statement that we have adopted together regarding the development of future financial perspectives."
"On the other hand, the European Parliament has also put forward a list of requirements concerning its own ambitions in the procedures relating to own resources, and you yourselves have also had the opportunity to become familiar with the European Commission's statement, which demonstrated that, through exercising its power of initiative, it will, in fact, move forward on this agenda and, in this way, it will implement the new budgetary procedure, as well as the coming financial perspectives."
"Concerning the 2011 budget itself, it is true that this is a strict budget, with an increase in payment appropriations of 2.9%."
"In spite of that, however, we have been able to make sure that the European External Action Service can see the light of day."
"We have also managed to finance the three new financial surveillance agencies as part of this tight funding increase of 2.91%."
"By mobilising the flexibility instruments, we have also been able to take into account the political priorities that Parliament wanted to implement, providing EUR 105 million for new preparatory actions, youth projects and mobility projects."
"As you have seen, Mrs Trüpel, when we talk about Parliament's priorities, we use exactly the same words that you have been repeating time and again, both in the trialogues and in your last speech."
"Conducting this new procedure in the context of the Lisbon provisions was a new experience for all of us and, as I humbly admit, for me above all."
"It is true, however, that this has allowed us to have a number of meetings and discussions - sometimes heated ones - but once again, we can say today that we have reached an agreement."
"I would say that I still have a sense that too little has been done, and I have a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, unfortunately, regarding the possibility of moving flexibility from unanimity to qualified majority."
"I think that our efforts really brought us close to an agreement, and my fear is that this possibility will not arise."
"I consider it a shame that we did not seize this opportunity, either on the issue of flexibility itself or on the financing of ITER."
"This may not be a simple procedure, therefore, but if there is goodwill, and the will to succeed on both sides, we will get there."
"At this point, I would also like to thank all those who have genuinely helped to make sure that tomorrow, hopefully, we can confirm this agreement: President Buzek himself, who, I would say, really rolled up his sleeves during this budgetary procedure, but also Mr Lamassoure, the rapporteurs, Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel, and obviously Commissioner Lewandowski, who, in spite of the disagreements, came back each time with new proposals, making sure that this procedure finally reached a conclusion."
"So here is the proof that we can reach agreements, and also the proof that this new Lisbon procedure can be a success."
"Despite the pitfalls and the difficulties that we faced, we succeeded in reaching an agreement and we have this budget, which is much more than just a budget: it will also provide concrete results for the citizens with regard to mobility, youth, the Structural Funds that will be able to be released for those European regions that really need them, the External Action Service and the financial agencies."
"Yes, thanks to this budget, we will be able to implement policies in the service of European citizens."
"That is what must drive us on, and that is what has ensured that everyone has made the compromises necessary to reach an agreement."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome, on behalf of the Commission, the fact that Parliament is willing to vote on the 2011 budget, even if not all the elements of the original package - comprising a Multiannual Financial Framework regulation, a new interinstitutional agreement and also financing of ITER - have been finalised."
"By voting, the two arms of the budgetary authority demonstrate a sense of responsibility in avoiding a budgetary crisis at a time when Europe is facing severe challenges and when we face financial instability in several Member States."
"I have to stress the importance of Parliament voting in the same way as was voted in the Council, namely, to avoid further conciliation."
"The Council has taken steps to include Parliament's wishes in preparatory actions, pilots, reserves and budgetary remarks."
"I think this - to vote in the same way and avoid further delays in time - is a test of the will we have to deliver the budget, to deliver the means to European citizens to implement projects and the programmes that could and should be conducive to growth in jobs."
"In terms of commitments, the level to be voted is EUR 141.8 billion, corresponding to 1.13% of GNI, with, I think, major priorities of Parliament taken on board relating to youth, small and medium-sized enterprises and research in headings 1a and 3b, and to Palestine in heading 4."
"To achieve these goals, we need to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to the value of EUR 105 million."
"The payments are set at the level of EUR 126.5 billion, corresponding to 1.01% of GNI."
"That is the understanding of the budgetary constraints that the Member States currently face."
"The level of payments is set under the condition - which is very important for the Commission - that they agree on a joint statement submitted to act swiftly if needed to provide additional payment appropriations through transfers or amending budgets, in order to avoid any shortfall in payment appropriations."
"Of course, in the case of reserves, probably to be voted, I have to reiterate the position of the Commission and we are, of course, striving to respond to the conditions set by Parliament as early as possible."
"It is very important to have a budget in place, so that we can carry on the discussions in the other areas without the additional complication of working under provisional twelfths."
"This is really very important."
"What remains is the financing of ITER, and what is connected with the financing of ITER is the international credibility of a united Europe as a partner for global scientific and technological projects."
"If we fail to agree - and this is the last moment to agree - we lose around EUR 570 million of the 2010 margins and therefore also lose the field of manoeuvre in the 2011 margin."
"So I think voting and agreeing ITER should be a win-win situation for all of us."
"What remains is also the adjustment, the transposition of the Lisbon Treaty in the form of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the new interinstitutional agreement."
"I have to praise the efforts of the budgetary rapporteur, Reimer Böge, and Minister Wathelet to find agreement in this very area, involving also a degree of flexibility."
"That is right."
"I can hear in Parliament, in the discussion, that this is more limited than the current system, but this is a compromise that is really guaranteeing, in practice, the same level of flexibility that was applied until now."
"Therefore, it seems to be acceptable in this time of fiscal consolidation in the Member States."
"We have to pursue our efforts in the transposition of the Lisbon Treaty via the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the new interinstitutional agreement as otherwise, with stalemate and delay in these areas, we are in uncharted territory, not on solid ground when it relates to the legal conditions of our attempts for the future."
"This was the Lisbon Treaty tested in practice."
"This was not demonstrated as originally designed, as facilitating compromise and decision making, but I hope that we can draw conclusions from the experience and, anticipating the vote in Parliament, we have already started the preparations for the 2012 budget."
"This is a sign of our optimism."
"I thank all those involved in the compromise machinery over the 2011 annual budget, Alain Lamassoure, President Buzek, Minister Wathelet and the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, we are now trying out the effects of the Treaty of Lisbon on ourselves."
"We and, generally speaking, the European media have often said that the powers of Parliament have increased tremendously as a result of this Treaty."
"Well, it is true that the two arms of the budgetary authority are about equally strong, but the strength of this arm cannot really be put to use, as the Treaty has condemned us to agreement."
"The only case where the powers of Parliament would be more extensive, namely, if the Council were to vote itself down in the future, is completely unimaginable."
"We must all face the fact that if we carry on with one twelfths, we can only stumble from one month to the next, and not make a European Union, and therefore, essentially in agreement with the other groups, the European People's Party considers it necessary for the European Union to have a valid budget over the course of tomorrow."
"The basis of this budget will be the budget submitted by the European Commission back in the summer and deemed by Parliament to be well-founded and sound."
"The Council was more or less of the same opinion, as it did not modify it much, and only lowered the level of payments somewhat, on the grounds of the big crisis."
"It is a funny crisis if, apparently, it can be solved with four billion compared to the income of the European Member States."
"To be honest, this level of cut could be considered somewhat populist."
"What pleased me in the final agreement, when Parliament adopted this four billion cut, was that we did not cut down numbers on a lawnmower principle, but instead retained the important areas that Parliament was particularly sensitive about as priority areas."
"I for one consider it very important that there has been a significant, almost 15% increase in the funds available for cohesion policy support."
"It is also important that we achieve some measure of progress."
"I understand the signal, Mr President, I will stop in a moment, but I still need to say that Parliament made a big mistake at the end of the negotiation process, and interests rooted in party politics made it bitterly difficult for us to achieve all of our goals."
"Mr President, I would like to pick up on what Mr Surján said."
"We are dealing with a new procedure in which the two parts of the budgetary legislator, the Council and Parliament, are operating on the same level."
"I would like to address all those fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets who have complained that this debate has become politicised."
"I would like to say to you that the logic of this new procedure dictates that we go beyond technical budgetary matters and discuss real budgetary policy."
"With this budgetary policy, it has become clear that, in the other authorities and in the European Council, there is an intention to use budgetary policy to obtain a different European Union."
"I will therefore start with the Presidency of the Council - with you, Mr Wathelet."
"In my view, this Parliament is indebted to the Belgian Presidency, because I believe that it has helped to achieve something that I did not believe possible three weeks ago."
"In the Council, the government of the United Kingdom and the government of the Netherlands - we must also mention them by name here - were not prepared to agree on a compromise in respect of the involvement of Parliament in the Financial Perspective."
"The compromises that we wanted with the Council were rejected."
"Right up to the last minute, they tried to reach a compromise, but these two governments said 'no'."
"A very intelligent solution - a Belgian solution perhaps - was found, namely to get the governments that will hold the Presidency in the next two years - Hungary, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus - to issue a statement to the effect that they will involve Parliament in the development of objectives."
"I assume this will be as before, in other words, on the basis of the current interinstitutional agreement."
"Thus, four governments in the European Council have declared that they are of a different opinion to the government of the Netherlands and the government of the United Kingdom."
"That is a major success, because it has made it clear that the Council is not a homogeneous whole that can dictate a uniform objective, but that there are most definitely different opinions in the Council, for example, in the case of states like Hungary or Poland, who fear that, with the financing of the External Action Service, ITER and Galileo using the same budgetary resources that we have today, but with agricultural spending frozen until 2013, cuts will have to be made somewhere at some point."
"Moreover, the cuts would then be made in connection with cohesion policy."
"Thus, we have allies in the Council, namely, those states that do not want these cuts, and these include, in particular, the next two states to hold the Presidency, Poland and Hungary."
"In this respect, Parliament has achieved a major success."
"I do not share the opinion of Mrs Trüpel that we have given way - quite the opposite!"
"With regard to the second core political demand that we made, flexibility, no agreement was reached."
"The matter has been deferred."
"Mr Wathelet, you say that there is now unanimity and that you could have had the qualified majority."
"I will turn this on its head and say that those who want to have ITER must then also ensure that there is unanimity in the Council for cooperation with regard to flexibility, otherwise they will not get ITER."
"We have negotiated hard and in a highly controversial manner."
"At the end of the day, it was never about figures, but about political will."
"Finally, my third point is that, in a fierce debate, the Commission has positioned itself between the Council and Parliament."
"In the Council, there is not a single government that is prepared to discuss our own resources."
"We want to discuss our own resources."
"The Commission has taken its position."
"On this issue, it has sided with Parliament."
"Thus, the Community institutions are in agreement."
"In the spring, I expect the President of the Commission and you, Mr Lewandowski, to put forward a corresponding proposal on the arrangements for own resources in the EU."
"The Member States - the 27 governments - will then have to take a position on this."
"I am a little surprised that I am the only group chair to speak here today."
"I would also like to address my fellow Members in that regard."
"There was, to some extent, a heated debate between us and the budget experts."
"I believe that, in the end, this went in a positive direction."
"I would like to thank the budget rapporteurs, Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel."
"Through my increased involvement with the budget at a political level, I have learnt how difficult this business is."
"I would like to compliment you greatly on your work."
"Finally, I would like to apologise to all those members of the Committee on Budgets who have, at times, felt that I have provoked them."
"I have to say to you, however, that I considered this provocation necessary."
"Mr President, I would also like to start by thanking Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel for the sound and high quality work that they have done on the budget, and perhaps Mrs Jędrzejewska in particular, who has had an unbelievably difficult task under the new procedure."
"I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency, which made a fantastic contribution, and I also think that our chair, Mr Lamassoure, has done some splendid work during these negotiations. The Commission has, of course, also endeavoured to make a constructive contribution, particularly during the final phase here."
"From the point of view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, this is a good result for the 2011 budget."
"We have secured the necessary appropriations for research, energy and education, and in the area of foreign affairs we have found the money for Palestine and the banana-producing countries without making cuts in other programmes."
"This budget procedure has shown that the Multiannual Financial Framework is very strict and inflexible."
"We have still not solved the problem of the financing of the ITER fusion energy project for the next few years - something that has been mentioned by several people."
"The ALDE Group would like a solution to be found to this."
"If we are to continue to fulfil the ambitions set out in the EU's energy policy, we will face difficult budget negotiations over the next few years too, unless we have an agreement that ensures greater flexibility."
"I hope this will happen soon and, in this regard, I would like to thank Mr Böge for his untiring efforts to ensure that a good solution is found."
"Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, just a month ago, although we broadly had an agreement on the figures for the 2011 budget, the four large political groups intervened very loudly and forcefully, asking the Belgian Presidency to negotiate with the Council not only the 2011 figures, on which there was agreement, but also a genuine political agreement for the next stage, a political agreement which would allow us to work together, in the form of a convention or something else - it hardly matters - but also with the national parliaments and governments, on the future financial framework and on own resources."
"Everyone was in agreement."
"We asked for this at the time, just a month ago, because we thought that we had to guarantee the future of European finances, because we thought that we needed to come to the rescue of the budgets of the Member States, which are all facing difficulties, and because the European Union must have its own resources."
"Everyone agreed, and I would say that it was said in a very forceful way."
"One month later, where are we on this?"
"We have gone back to square one."
"The 2011 budget is about to be adopted."
"It ignores flexibility and ITER."
"I have no regrets about ITER, as you know, but on the other hand, the Belgian Presidency - even if it has gone to enormous effort, I admit - is sugaring the pill for us somewhat today by proposing that we make do with a Council statement, with the wisdom of the Commission - though I hope that it will always be on the side of Parliament; that is its proper place - and with the letter from Mr Leterme, the Prime Minister, which actually proposes that we should respect the treaties."
"It is a good thing that he is not proposing the opposite to us - that would be astonishing."
"You must admit, therefore, that this is a pretty lightweight proposal, and you must realise that we are a little frustrated."
"I am not even sure that the Belgian Presidency itself totally believes what it says, although, if the 'walk in the park' had lasted a little longer, Mr Wathelet, we might have been able to reach a better agreement, a stronger agreement for the future, which would give us more chance of providing proper guarantees for the future."
"You have the sense that there is too little here, and I do too."
"Even so, we will act properly, and we will accordingly approve the resolution, with all its drawbacks, and as for everything else, we have missed an opportunity, but rest assured that we will be there at the next meeting, because the debate on the perspectives is not over."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I shall try to be briefer than the previous speaker."
"My group proposes to adopt the budget as agreed by the Council."
"It offers a small increase and that is a reasonable compromise."
"Keep in mind that EU Member States and citizens have to cut their budgets."
"Unfortunately, the debate on the budget had a false start."
"The Parliament demanded an increase of 6%, which was ludicrous and showed that this congregation was out of touch."
"Here, the debate was even inflamed by hotheads who wanted to kidnap the budget to force access to own resources, in other words, EU taxation."
"We have always opposed that."
"Lisbon is clear on it."
"The Parliament has a right to advise, not a right to codecide."
"The Parliament lost this battle, as we predicted."
"Now it is moving to the position which the European Conservatives defended all along - a budget of 1% of GDP."
"The hotheads here must cool down, particularly the Greens."
"Just imagine that the EU had no budget next year while the euro was in a tailspin."
"Is that the image you want to offer the financial markets?"
"They would not be at all happy."
"I would like to congratulate the governments of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands for their principled position."
"I thank the Belgian Government for their role as honest broker and I thank the Commission for its knowledgeable and cool-headed work."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, with the adoption of the draft 2011 budget, we come to the end of a turbulent negotiating process."
"First, a few words on the budget itself."
"It is the result of the imposition of the governments' increases, which were residual amounts."
"The proposal tabled by the governments, and on which we are going to vote tomorrow, is well below the limits agreed when the Financial Perspectives for the period 2007-2013 were negotiated."
"My group contested this point of view because we do not agree with continuity budgets in exceptional times, and we do not agree with budgets that are unable to address the social crisis into which austerity policies have plunged our countries."
"This alone would be enough for us not to be able to vote for this budget."
"However, the underfunding has another consequence: it will require successive corrections throughout 2011, and the governments themselves are admitting it by signing a protocol that says exactly that."
"Now, about the future: the majority of those who will vote for this budget were hoping, at least, that this budget would not be repeated in 2012 and in 2013, but nothing could be less certain."
"Despite our criticisms, my group supported Parliament's positions throughout the impasse, in order to avoid this very real risk."
"However, the final commitment is a weak one."
"I guarantee you that, in 2012, we will be having a revised and extended version of the discussion that we had this year, because a minority of governments, led by the United Kingdom, believe the current European budgets to be excessive: they want less, they do not want more."
"Moreover, these same governments also want to reduce flexibility."
"These are the governments that like sanctions and detest solidarity; they are the governments that want hyper-austerity and not social progress."
"It is for this reason that this Europe - a Europe that rejects European bond issues, a Europe that refuses to tax financial transactions - is a Europe that is set to destroy its own European project."
"It is not a Europe that we can be at peace with, and so we cannot vote for this budget."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I will be brief to compensate for the time that Mr Portas took."
"Many Members in this Chamber will congratulate themselves on having obtained a 2.9% increase for the EU budget 2011."
"Others instead will complain that this is not enough."
"I, for one, deplore the fact that this Parliament ignores the crisis that Europeans are going through and only looks to satisfy its own ambitions."
"I, for one, regret that Mr Cameron approves such an increase while imposing severe cuts in the British budget, a situation that has started to generate civil unrest."
"This money is not going to improve the economy of those Member States, nor is it going to provide jobs for those who are losing them, but if kept in Britain, it would avoid the need to increase the tuition fees, for example."
"Of course we will not vote in favour of this budget as increased."
"(NL) Mr President, this morning, I received an email invitation to a cocktail party from the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets."
"They wanted to celebrate the fact that the European Parliament was able to increase its budget for 2011."
"If it were up to this Parliament and the Commission, a lot more money would have been taken out of our citizens' pockets."
"European taxes: a reason for a celebratory cocktail!"
"Member States losing their right to veto the budget: another reason for a party!"
"Mr President, I call that dancing on the grave of citizens' rights!"
"Fortunately, though, there is a cause for celebration."
"The budget increase has been capped, after heavy pressure from Member States."
"Unfortunately, this still means no reduction, which is what the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) wanted, but the increase is not nearly as high as this House wanted."
"We will not have any European taxes, to the anger of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and Member States will retain their right of veto."
"So, when I raise a glass today, then it will be to those courageous, stubborn Member States, like the Netherlands, that have refused to agree to this Parliament's demands."
"Long live Member States, long live citizens!"
"(ES) Mr President, Mrs Jedrzejewska, Mrs Trüpel, Mr Lamassoure, Mr Lewandowski and Mr Böge are the names behind a 2011 budget that I believe has ultimately proved to be moderate and realistic."
"The Committee on Budgets had already drawn up a draft which, in terms of commitment appropriations, was completely in line with the financial restrictions, and left payment appropriations open for negotiation, because as the European Commission said, there were, and continue to be, fears regarding changes in payment appropriations in the Structural Funds for next year."
"Unfortunately, following the vote in plenary in October, we got involved in political negotiations involving the Council, and since then, everything has gone badly: the 'letter from the Twelve'; the 2.9% increase in payment appropriations imposed by the Council; the pressure on Parliament and its Members; and the final failure expressed in the cancellation of the meeting of the Committee on Budgets that should have taken place yesterday in order to try to reach an agreement on the flexibility and future financing of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER)."
"Should we draw conclusions from this?"
"I think we should."
"The Council should draw conclusions; the subsequent presidencies should draw conclusions; the European Commission should draw conclusions; and so should we."
"I will give you a conclusion now: leave the negotiations on the EU budget for other years and to the specialists, who are those who have taken the floor today."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome my fellow Member, Mr Schulz, to the Committee on Budgets and remind him that the Committee meets in January."
"I hope that then, you will come with an alternative proposal as to how to finance the ITER, having lost EUR 571 million in the 2010 budget."
"(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Council and Parliament have been able to reach an agreement on the budget for 2011 in these difficult times."
"The budget is a good compromise inasmuch as we have been able to maintain a low rate of increase but have nevertheless found reasonable resources for our priority areas."
"I would like to say a big thank you to our rapporteurs, Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel, and to the Belgian Presidency, which has made a very constructive contribution."
"What concerns me is the long perspectives, because, in the long term, it will be unreasonable if the Member States assign new tasks to the EU but cannot agree on how they should be financed."
"That will be a major problem in 2012 and 2013 and, of course, as we prepare for the forthcoming financial framework, because it is now clear that a minority of richer net contributor countries, some of which have eurosceptic governments, want to slim down the EU budget at any price, regardless of the consequences."
"That is an unreasonable position, particularly as they are pushing hard themselves for increased expenditure in certain areas, the IT project for example, and are not able to point to where the savings should be made either."
"Should we cut back on agricultural aid?"
"Should we rein in the Structural Funds?"
"Some people want this, but the majority says 'no'."
"The problems we are facing in relation to the future are actually internal political problems within the Council and between Member States with different attitudes towards the EU and its budget in the future."
"The issue that is most controversial is the question of the flexibility mechanisms of the future."
"For us Social Democrats, there are two issues here."
"Firstly, it is a matter of principle that we should uphold an interinstitutional agreement that we have had since 1999 and that has worked extremely well."
"No parliament in the world would accept a reduction in influence, particularly if there were no compelling practical reasons for it."
"The Council has not been able to present any practical reasons for a reduction in flexibility."
"The Treaty of Lisbon does not preclude a new agreement with the same content as the current one; rather, it is a question of the political will of the Member States."
"Secondly, when the margins diminish at the end of the budget period and, at the same time, new tasks are added, the need for flexibility will also increase."
"This was pointed out by the Commission in its assessment of the current framework."
"Despite the fact that all arguments speak in favour of increased flexibility and that it should be easier to apply flexibility, the Council has gone in the opposite direction."
"That is unacceptable."
"We know now that there are Member States that see the current dispute about reduced flexibility as preparation for the big battle, resulting in a drastic slashing of the EU budget."
"If this turns out to be the Council's line for the future, I am afraid that we will be facing a more permanent budgetary crisis, because we will not accept that."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(NL) You have described the fact that a number of Member States are opposed to the increase in the 2011 budget, and that, as a result, fewer projects will be possible, as 'alarming'."
"Have you not considered the possibility that those Member States do not see that there is any need for those European projects?"
"Mr President, of course, I understand that, but there is a difference between those who are net payer Member States and those who are net beneficiary Member States."
"We must understand that."
"You could easily say that the UK, the Netherlands, even my own Member State, Sweden, would gain from a cut in the EU budget."
"But look at those Member States who are really having problems now."
"Look at Greece, Portugal and Ireland."
"They would lose if the EU budget were cut because it actually makes a contribution to their economies - not least via the Structural Funds and other parts of the budget as well - so I do not think that is a fair way to act."
"(SV) Mr President, at least we are now having a proper debate with the involvement of the Council's representative."
"This debate on next year's budget has long been about who has done what and why."
"In many people's eyes, this has been a debate between the institutions, which, in a way, is a shame, but at the same time, we can perhaps learn something for the future."
"A month ago, I was rather critical of how, in the Council, you are looking at the future and the possibility of financing the priorities that you yourselves have presented, and by this I am referring, in particular, to the Europe 2020 strategies, in other words, how we are to finance the ambitious targets that we have in Europe."
"My criticism still stands and I therefore think it may be interesting to look at the budget we now have in the light of this in particular."
"We have agreed on a budget with an increase of 2.91%, which I personally think is an entirely reasonable solution."
"If the Council had got its way, the research appropriations would have been cut by around half a billion euro compared with the amount originally proposed by the Commission, and in this regard, I have not yet fully understood what the Council was thinking."
"Parliament later rectified this in its own version, which is a good thing."
"This means that, in many ways, we went in a better direction, and even if the figures are the same as those the Council wanted, the content is significantly better than the Council's 2.91%."
"I think it is worth noting that, even if we keep the same figures, there have been significant shifts in the budget."
"Mr Färm took account of flexibility, and in this regard, the Council needs to consider how it intends, in specific terms, to find the money that is needed for the future investments that we have agreed on, because it will not be possible to find it in future years if it continues with the logic it is currently employing."
"Mr President, I am obviously pleased that Parliament has finally come to its senses, accepted what, to many of us, was inevitable all along and settled for a 2.9% increase, although I have to say for many of us that does not go far enough."
"Many of us would have liked to have seen a freeze - or perhaps, in our wildest optimism, a reduction - in the EU budget because the less money that the EU spends, the less it interferes in the lives of ordinary citizens."
"This is obviously a good result for David Cameron, for Mark Rutte, but it is also a victory for the hard-pressed taxpayers of Europe who have to pay all the bills of the EU institutions."
"At a time of austerity, at a time of cutbacks in most Member States, it was frankly madness for this Parliament to be trying to increase EU spending by 6%."
"I am pleased that there has been at least some modicum of common sense."
"To those who believe in the European project and who believe in European integration - and I am not particularly one of them - you did your cause more damage than anybody else could have done by trying to insist on this ridiculous increase in EU spending when everybody else, every other public institution in Europe, is seeing the pain of cutbacks."
"You have damaged your cause immeasurably."
"(NL) During the final phase of the budget procedure, the Council and the Commission made political statements, especially with a view to involving the European Parliament in the financing of the European Union in the long term."
"I have two questions about that."
"My first question is: how are the Council and the Commission going to give concrete form to this cooperation?"
"Will the European Parliament have a joint deciding role in this?"
"I very much doubt this."
"My second question concerns the European tax."
"In June 2011, the European Commission wants to put forward a proposal for the financing of the European Union for the 2014-2020 period."
"My question about this is: is an EU tax part of that?"
"If so, that means that the list of possible levies which the European Commission launched in October has been made even longer."
"If this is about a levy for the financial sector, then any revenue should, in my view, certainly go to Member States, because it was ultimately they who had to save the banks."
"Finally, Mr President, I fully support the position taken by the Dutch and British governments in this conflict."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mrs Trüpel, who have carried out the budgetary procedure with a great deal of responsibility and a clear focus on the priorities."
"With regard to the 2011 budget: when considering the EU budget, we must always remember that around 95% of the money goes back to benefit citizens."
"The best example of this is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"At 6%, the EU's administrative costs are lower than quite a few of its Member States."
"For many years, the EU budget amounted to plus/minus 1% of GDP."
"This financed the enlargement from 15 to 27 Member States without any additional budgetary resources."
"As a result of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have additional tasks."
"Budget increases are always difficult."
"However, with themes such as new projects and additional Lisbon tasks, the 2011 budget is also an investment in the future of the EU and in the functioning of its institutions."
"(FR) Mr President, given the exceptional constraints we face this year, the agreement that has been reached on the draft budget for 2011 is the best compromise possible."
"For that, we must thank and congratulate our two rapporteurs, the European Commission and the remarkable Belgian Presidency, to which I would like to express particular gratitude."
"Mr Wathelet is a little sad; he has the impression that too little has been done."
"He should see Parliament's gesture of granting EUR 570 million to the Member States, rather than assigning this money to ITER, as an act of gratitude to the Belgian Presidency."
"Since the start of these negotiations, Parliament has been anxious to show its awareness of its responsibilities."
"Now, at the end of the year, when the cohesion of the Union is once again being called into question, the Committee on Budgets is categorically recommending that we end the uncertainty on the 2011 budget."
"However, the basic problems remain intact."
"In contrast to some of the national budgets, the Union's budget is not threatened by bankruptcy."
"In terms of the statutes, it is a balanced budget, but it stands on the brink of political failure."
"Europe is financing its ambitions by indulging in words."
"Yet verbal inflation, the inflation of grandiose and illusory objectives is just as pernicious as monetary inflation."
"The Union no longer has the means to finance the decisions that it has already taken, nor the new competences given to it by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Union has also failed to introduce the procedures that would allow it to ensure that, in the absence of Community financing, major joint objectives such as Europe 2020 are incorporated in the national budgets."
"That is why Parliament attaches so much importance to the agreement achieved alongside the Commission and the future Presidencies for finding a way to secure the financing of future policies, via the Community budget, from new resources, which are no longer a drain on national budgets, and via the national budgets themselves, which are 20 times the size of the tiny European budget."
"In 2010, the Union has redefined its notion of financial solidarity."
"2011 must be the year in which we reinvent budgetary solidarity."
"(CS) Mr President, I would like to state again clearly today that the European Union needs a proper budget for next year."
"There is no reason for us to have a provisional budget."
"There is equally no reason for the European Parliament to make budget approval conditional on any additional demands."
"All European countries are currently going through a difficult period economically and need certainty in the form of proper budgets, both at national and European level."
"Households, businesses and local authorities also need this certainty."
"I can therefore state here on behalf of my colleagues from the Civic Democratic Party from the Czech Republic and colleagues from the Group of European Conservatives and Reformists that we will support the compromise reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the vote tomorrow."
"(RO) Mr President, tomorrow's vote can bring to an end the first approval procedure for the annual budget, in keeping with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Negotiations have obviously been difficult."
"Parliament has put forward extremely important political considerations, but the Council has refused to discuss them."
"Parliament initially presented a very strongly united front in maintaining its position."
"The Council was divided, but had the benefit of unanimity and blocked conciliation."
"We are currently in the position of agreeing on figures."
"The Council and Commission have accepted, through declarations, the large majority of the European Parliament's requests."
"It would have been much better to have an interinstitutional agreement, which would have provided greater security for the future."
"Unfortunately, Parliament is no longer as united as it was at the start of the negotiations."
"As a result, there is a lack of funding for ITER."
"I believe that it is of paramount importance for us to give the Union the budget which it needs during this crisis period."
"We have the time we need before the future financial outlooks are approved to reach an agreement on the topics which are still unresolved."
"The Council needs to understand that it is not beneficial to the Union that the main European policies will be approved through codecision, while the financial resources required to implement these policies are decided on by only one of the parties involved in budgetary cooperation."
"Parliament must be involved at the same level in both aspects: political and financial."
"(NL) Mr President, many Members here are taking a hypocritical approach in their statements on the budget."
"Mr Schulz makes little effort to keep his irritation with the Council to himself."
"Mr Verhofstadt seems to have limited his vocabulary to two phrases: European bonds and European taxes."
"Mr Daul has even suggested that the Netherlands might as well leave the European Union."
"That is tough language, but it supports only one side of the argument."
"When I proposed that we should tackle Parliament's own budget, however, these gentlemen and their groups did not appear to have heard me."
"Moreover, I was given the cold shoulder when I proposed that Members should be transparent about the reimbursement they receive for their general expenses every month."
"Nor did I get any support for my suggestion that we tackle Parliament's luxury car fleet."
"When I suggested that we should prune Parliament's luxurious information offices, it seemed to give many Members a headache."
"Voting against would therefore be a very appropriate thing to do, but my group and my country have managed to prevent the situation from being even worse and that is why I have abstained."
"Voting in favour of a 2.9% increase in the current climate would be totally inappropriate."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting this budget, the European Parliament is showing an enormous sense of responsibility."
"The truth is, in the face of an economic, financial and social crisis that is slow to loosen its grip on us, it would be bad for the European Union and its citizens not to have a budget for 2011."
"No one would have understood if Union institutions had sought broad agreements for their budgets from Member States and not succeeded in reaching minimum consensuses for these budgets."
"However, I believe that, although the 2011 budget is not bad, it could have been better."
"The need for unanimity in the Council for some issues made negotiations more difficult."
"This was a portent of the difficulties that the Council will face in reaching agreement on the next Multiannual Financial Framework and on new own resources, which, as we know, require unanimity in the Council."
"At this point, I would like to highlight the excellent work by Mrs Jędrzejewska as rapporteur, and also by Mrs Trüpel, the efforts of the Belgian Presidency and the conduct of the Commission."
"The priorities that we have set out are included in this budget:- I would highlight the strengthening of support for youth, education and innovation, and research."
"I would also like to highlight the preparatory action 'Your First EURES Job', which will boost the mobility of young people within the EU, in the area of employment."
"I worked on this proposal personally, and I hope that after acquiring legal basis, this preparatory action will give rise to a programme with a substantial budgetary allocation."
"Another positive aspect was the agreement reached for the Commission to present, by the end of September 2011 at the latest, updated values relating to allocations for cohesion policy and for rural development, and, if necessary, increasing these allocations."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Sidonia in particular, our rapporteur, for handling very difficult negotiations excellently on behalf of Parliament."
"That work needs to be recognised, as does that of the Council."
"I speak as the agriculture rapporteur, and I need the word agriculture to echo through this Chamber because we have concerns, not just about figures but also procedure."
"From my perspective, this new procedure needs fine-tuning."
"We could and should do our work better."
"I say that to myself, but I say it also to the Council and the Commission, and I think we need to examine and review how we have worked in the past."
"We have made some gains in agriculture."
"They are very small, but my concerns are for the future."
"I would like the Commission to talk about the massive cut of upwards of USD 800 million that there appears to be in rural development funding."
"I hope that that will not actually come to pass."
"I am concerned about the budget post-2013 and the possibility that agriculture could become a sector where people raid funds for other policies unless there is agreement on an adequate budget for all of the policies of the European Union."
"(LT) For the first time since the new Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the European Parliament has used the powers it was granted to participate fully in the composition of the European Union budget."
"The unsuccessful first attempt to reach an agreement and include the European Parliament's legitimate demands demonstrates a conflict that is still present among the institutions and that should not actually exist, as it is obstructing effective interinstitutional cooperation."
"Presumably, it cannot be denied that the objective of all EU institutions is to ensure that agreements which are particularly important for the whole of the EU and its citizens are adopted as smoothly as possible."
"In future, therefore, there must be fundamental changes in the operating principles of the institutions themselves and the inclusion of the European Parliament in all stages of negotiations, particularly in budget adoption, must be considered as particularly important for the implementation of the principle of representative democracy."
"(FI) Mr President, first of all, my thanks go to the rapporteurs for the hard work that achieving this comprised has entailed."
"These negotiations have called for some particularly mighty efforts, in the shadow of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the stringent budgets imposed in the Member States."
"For this reason, I would like to thank all our negotiators."
"This is the first time that the European Union's budget is being decided in one reading, and, if anything, I think that this process has further stressed the need for better dialogue between the two budget authorities, something that Parliament has been demanding for a long time."
"There need to be continuing negotiations and a harmonised approach regarding conciliation on annual and multiannual budget frameworks, so that the institutions are able to speak one and the same language around the negotiating table."
"Now, however, we can probably be satisfied that there is a budget in place for 2011."
"The uncertain elements need to be kept to a minimum in this economic maelstrom."
"(FR) Mr President, the 2011 budget as it has emerged from the numerous conciliation procedures between our Committee on Budgets, the Council and the Commission does not conform to the new institutional balances defined by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"These balances have not been respected by the Council or, in particular, by the representatives of a number of governments."
"In particular, it is unacceptable that Parliament's request to obtain a dialogue on the EU's future own resources has come to nothing."
"Our Parliament now has a joint decision-making power in budgetary matters."
"It must ensure that it is respected, and we have to realise something: genuinely balanced conciliation procedures will probably not be possible until this joint decision-making power is exercised in the form of a negative vote."
"At some point, the European Parliament will have to choose to assert its institutional position firmly."
"This issue of own resources will resurface in the coming months."
"If we want to succeed, we will have to be able to see our responsibilities through to the end."
"Mr President, I cannot vote for any increase in the Parliament's budget, and I believe that many people in the United Kingdom will be watching the proceedings here in utter amazement."
"In national economies across Europe, we have austerity measures and budget cuts."
"These are the order of the day and this is what our people have to face."
"The euro is in crisis, and I want the House to note that even though my constituency does not use the euro, we share a land border with the Republic of Ireland."
"The Republic represents a huge export market for us, so this crisis hurts our people as well."
"Beside all this crisis, we have a proposed 2.9% increase, limited from the 6% that Parliament already wanted, but on a budget that the Court of Auditors has not passed for many years."
"Most worryingly of all, we have a promise from the Commission to bring forward proposals by June 2011 for an EU tax."
"Is it any wonder that Euroscepticism is growing?"
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the thanks and congratulations addressed to those who have managed to conclude these very difficult negotiations."
"We are getting ready to approve a budget tomorrow which is a big step forward for the Europe of mobility and the Europe of young people."
"Above all, this budget demonstrates Parliament's determination not to abandon large-scale European investments during this crisis period."
"However, I would like to share with you my concern and my displeasure about the choice made today by some political groups and, in particular, the Socialists, whose representatives were in government jobs at key moments, to jeopardise ITER, the only fundamental long-term research project in the European Union in which we play a leading role."
"As you know, the European Union made a commitment last June to contribute an additional EUR 1.3 billion to this project, which is crucial for our security."
"It is therefore Europe's credibility in the world that is going to be called into question by our vote."
"This attitude has meant that we have lost nearly EUR 600 million of unused money in 2010, which could have been allocated to ITER."
"This is ridiculous!"
"Mr President, as a Member of the European Parliament, I feel responsible that we have a budget."
"As a Socialist, I am very sorry that we would not go for a financial transaction tax."
"As a rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I would like to underline that we support the ITER project, but we do not need a patchwork solution for one year: we need a sustainable financial solution for the next two decades."
"As a Hungarian, I am very happy that the Hungarian Presidency will hopefully not have to deal with the budget, but only to find a solution for ITER and for flexibility during the negotiations."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I shall be brief as I have already used up my time slot."
"In answer to Mr Belder, who may have already disappeared, the Commission's proposal on how to cooperate between the institutions was in direct implementation of Articles 312, 324 and, specifically, Article 311 of the Lisbon Treaty, for the specific procedure on the own resources decision in full respect of the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States."
"As for the own resources, this was clearly and explicitly within the mandate given to the Commission in December 2005, which was confirmed by Parliament, to start not only the expenditure but also the revenue side of the budget, including the British rebate."
"We were delicate enough not to touch the issue of the British rebate in our budgetary review and our eventual choice for the future is not to increase the expenditure but to change the proportions between the national direct payment and own resources, in line with the vision of the treaty and the founding fathers of the European Union."
"Finally, a more general remark: hopefully, if we vote tomorrow, our test of Lisbon, in budgetary terms, will be over and we will have to draw conclusions."
"It sends a good message to European citizens to have a budget without any deficits or debt and to show that we are not to be taken as a scapegoat for the failed policies in some Member States."
"Therefore, now having the budget in place, we should continue our discussion on the modalities of interinstitutional cooperation in much improved circumstances."
"Mr President, like the Commissioner, I do not have much to add in relation to this discussion."
"Quite simply, having heard some Members say that they preferred not to approve the budget in order to affirm Parliament's joint decision-making powers, I think that all the European institutions have much more to gain and will increase their standing if they can actually take the European Union forward by finding compromises, instead of everyone blocking each other and not moving forward with European projects."
"I think that this is a question of logic, and today I really want to thank all those who have chosen to build Europe and to move forward."
"Does the Council have everything that it wanted?"
"No."
"Does Parliament have everything that it wanted?"
"Of course not."
"Are we moving forward?"
"Yes."
"This codecision procedure has functioned; it has worked."
"Everyone has made some compromises."
"Everyone has made some concessions."
"Is there still much to be done?"
"Of course."
"Clearly, that is what the debate on flexibility and ITER is all about."
"I regret the fact that we were not able to reach an agreement, and I have heard it said that the proposal tabled was a step backwards."
"No."
"I repeat: we have this during every debate, and today it is unanimity."
"If the aim is to move towards qualified majority, then I think that the Belgian Presidency's proposal must be taken up."
"I think that this is essential when it comes to drafting the 2012 and 2013 budgets."
"I think that this mechanism really must be promoted, since it conforms to past practices, but it at least ensures that the 2012 and 2013 budgets can no longer be blocked by unanimity."
"I believe that you really must seize this opportunity."
"Concerning ITER, the way in which we have used this flexibility mechanism for ITER 2010 clearly shows that we will need this mechanism and that we must take up what is before us today."
"I would like to sincerely thank all those speakers - and I will not mention them all - who have acknowledged the work that we have done together to move forward."
"I would like to thank all those who preferred the logic of progress to the logic of blocking."
"I think that we really must promote this logic."
"Mr Lamassoure, you spoke of budgetary solidarity."
"In the Council, we had almost total solidarity, as everyone accepted the increase of 2.91%."
"We have gone from having a qualified majority to having total unanimity within the Council."
"Joking aside, I think that all of the statements annexed to this 2011 budget - because, yes, a budget in itself is also political, as Parliament showed with the political priorities that it included in the budget - whether on own resources, on European added value, on Lisbonisation - the Commission's declaration - or in the context of this joint statement, which is important and which has already been followed by a letter from the Belgian Prime Minister, the current President of the European Union, I think that all these statements show that all the stages are going in the right direction."
"We are certainly not moving as quickly as everyone would like, but we are moving quickly enough that we can say that the machine is in working order and that it is better to adhere to this logic of progress than to a logic of blocking."
"Mr President, from what the previous speakers have said, it is clear that we are all pleased that it will be possible to implement the 2011 EU budget efficiently and without unnecessary delays as of 1 January next year."
"However, all these speeches have also made it clear that there is still a lack of certain things."
"There is a lack of discussion and a lack of understanding."
"It is clear to me already that the Treaty of Lisbon opens up new, uncharted territory for us and that a very difficult debate awaits us regarding the new multiannual post-2013 European Union budget."
"This debate relates to a fundamental issue, namely, how we can reconcile the ever-greater divergence between expectations of the European Union, or, in other words, what the European Union is supposed to do - and we can see that the Member States and all interested parties, including the European Parliament, expect more and more from the European Union, since the European Union is supposed to deal with an ever-increasing number of subject areas, and is opening itself up to new policies, new areas of activity and setting new tasks for itself - a divergence between the aforesaid expectations and an ever-diminishing willingness to finance these new undertakings."
"We must hold joint debates on this increasingly dramatic divergence."
"We cannot avoid such debates, all the more so since we are currently experiencing a financial and economic crisis, and so there is no place for taboo subjects as far as funding is concerned."
"We should talk openly about all the issues: about the EU's own revenues, about what the EU should do, about what it should perhaps not try to do, about what is really most important for us and to what extent these priorities should be financed."
"In summary, I think that what happened during the adoption of the 2011 budget is both a basis for and a start of the debate, but by no means its end."
"I thank you for your willingness to engage in a debate, and I hope that there will be even more of this willingness next year."
"Mr President, I am pleased that I get to have the last word in this debate today."
"I will start by gladly accepting Mr Schulz's apology."
"He said that he had sometimes behaved badly."
"It is always good when he notices that he occasionally makes too much noise."
"His comment that we previously only dealt with technical budgetary matters and have now realised that this is a question of budgetary policy is something that I wish to firmly reject."
"I have been working in the Committee on Budgets for six years now and even before this, it was always a matter of budgetary policy and not just the technical aspect."
"Mr Schulz said that he has learnt a great deal over the last few weeks."
"I am pleased to hear that."
"In that case, he will probably understand this now."
"I will now turn to the anti-European tones that have just been heard in this House."
"I would like to emphasise clearly once again that if - as stated in the Treaty of Lisbon - we have a goal to discuss new own resources for Europe, this would not only be an additional tax for European citizens, but would also mean that the payments from the gross domestic product were reduced by the same amount."
"In other words, it would not simply put a greater burden on citizens, it would also provide a more transparent system for our own resources."
"This needs to be debated."
"I reject the attempt to manipulate opinion by implying that there will only be additional burdens."
"Rather, the goal is to find an intelligent financing system."
"The Council and Parliament should be prepared to do that."
"My second comment, because it has simply been presented here as if European taxpayers are always having things taken away from them by the European Union, is that there are education programmes for European citizens, there is new infrastructure, there are new languages and there is help for dairy farmers."
"In other words, what we are doing here is in the well-understood interests of European citizens, and that needs to be said loud and clear."
"What is the global role of the European Union in the coming years?"
"We have such successful countries as China, India, Brazil and others with which we compete at a global level."
"If, as the European Union, we want to be strong and to have new products that will hopefully also be sustainable, new production methods that are environmentally responsible, energy generation that is genuinely based on renewable energy sources, which was once again established as a goal in Cancún, then for this we also need appropriate resources and we need the European budget, which reflects our common interests."
"I hope that we will move in this direction in the next few years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:30."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome the fact that we have finally come to an agreement on the 2011 budget."
"This will ensure financial security for the vulnerable agriculture sector."
"EU agricultural policy needs a stable budget framework, in particular, during difficult times."
"A twelve-part budget would have caused serious financial difficulties for many Member States which have already passed on agricultural payments to farmers."
"Agriculture is heavily dependent on EU subsidies."
"Farming families need the security to plan ahead for the future of their businesses."
"Throughout the EU, direct payments represent 40% of farm incomes and provide financial security against a background of low producer prices, increasing production costs and fluctuating markets."
"The measures which form part of the rural development programme bring direct benefits for rural areas and stimulate regional economies."
"Farms in Austria, in particular, benefit from both the 1st and 2nd pillar measures."
"A total of 58 percent of Austria's annual agricultural budget comes from the EU."
"Farmers in the European Union have a wide range of responsible jobs to do which are increasing in number."
"They have to produce top quality food and comply with high standards of animal welfare while helping to prevent climate change, protect the environment and maintain biodiversity."
"In order to be able to provide these essential services, farmers must have a reliable income based on sensible, stable EU financial policy."
"As far as the negotiations on the financial framework for 2014-2020 are concerned, all aspects of agriculture must have the same level of budget funding."
"in writing. - (EL) The impasse in the first stage of the 2011 EU budget caused by the intransigent stand taken by a limited minority of Member States almost took us into the fiasco of twelfths and all that such a system implies, both in terms of the budgets of the economically weak Member States and the possibility of serious delay in payments of European funds."
"In order to avoid this fiasco, Parliament has demonstrated the necessary sense of responsibility and is prepared to accept a budget, despite the fact that it does not satisfy all its demands and is not up to par, as the European public might expect if we are to tackle the economic crisis."
"However, the problem as to how budgetary needs are to be addressed in the immediate future for 2012 and 2013 persists and I call on this small minority of Member States to demonstrate a proper sense of responsibility and to work with Parliament to find a solution that will give the EU the necessary flexibility to address its needs and prevent a new budgetary crisis."
"Credit rating agencies (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Gauzès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies - C7-0143/2010 -."
"Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, here we are in the third act of the financial legislation for 2010."
"Following supervision, following the directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are once again looking at credit rating agencies."
"I say 'once again' because Europe has not been slow in bringing in a regulation in this area which was conceived in 2009 and which is now taking effect."
"Credit rating agencies, in general, issue opinions, literally in the form of ratings, on the creditworthiness of businesses and states and on complex financial products."
"The rating reflects an assessment of the risk of issuers of financial instruments not being able to honour their debts."
"These agencies have gradually become very important in the financial world, for a variety of reasons."
"First, ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments."
"The second reason is that ratings have been a factor in the success of issues, since they have become a major indicator for investors."
"Yet, although credit rating agencies were not the main cause of the recent financial crisis, they did have a harmful influence."
"Indeed, they underestimated the probability that issuers of certain complex financial instruments would default."
"Faced with the need to restore confidence in the markets and to strengthen protection for investors, in 2009, the European Commission proposed a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies."
"Thus, in the same year, Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies was adopted."
"During the debates in the European Parliament preceding the adoption of this regulation, your rapporteur stressed the need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies' products and integrated supervision of them."
"At the time, European supervision of this type was legally impossible."
"However, the Commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines, and you, Commissioner, kept this promise."
"The agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the architecture of European supervision, which will enter into force on 1 January 2011, now makes the effective implementation of rating agency supervision possible."
"It is stressed in the Regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority that this authority will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies."
"That was the objective of the additional amending regulation on which we reached an agreement and on which we will vote tomorrow."
"What I wanted - and my colleagues supported this request - was for the other issues relating to credit rating agencies, allocation of sovereign debt, remuneration schemes and competition, to be postponed and dealt with in a study taking the form of an own-initiative report, which will precede the legislative proposal that you are due to make in the first half of 2011 and for which you have launched a consultation."
"I believe that, by establishing European supervision of credit agencies, we are taking a big step along the same lines as the supervision arrangements that have been implemented."
"I now want to thank the Belgian Presidency for its tireless efforts on the financial dossiers, you and your teams, Commissioner, and, obviously, my fellow Members in the European Parliament who participated in this study and who supported our positions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after Mr Gauzès and a report of this kind, it is clearly a pleasure to be among you on behalf of the Belgian Finance Minister, Didier Reynders, on the day of the debate concerning the amendment of the regulation on credit rating agencies."
"Once again, as you have just said, we are talking about a measure relating to financial services on which the three institutions have just reached an agreement in record time."
"We are also very pleased that this agreement will be voted on in Parliament tomorrow, as agreed, between the three institutions."
"The regulation will therefore be modified to allocate additional powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority."
"This will allow the authority to exercise stricter supervision of the activities of credit rating agencies throughout the Union."
"This is an important step which we also think will contribute to improving the stability of the financial markets, and which will support the development of a much more effective supervisory framework."
"Once the regulation enters into force, therefore, the authority will have powers concerning the registration and direct supervision of credit rating agencies."
"It will also have the power to determine that a credit rating agency has infringed the regulation in force and the power to impose appropriate penalties."
"Of course, a framework will also be provided for cooperation between the competent authorities in the Member States and the European Securities and Markets Authority."
"However, we are prepared to have a more in-depth debate on the issue of regulating the credit rating agency sector itself once the Commission has provided us with its proposal on the comprehensive review of this sector, which is set for next year."
"While I am obviously hoping for a positive result from your vote tomorrow, I would particularly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Bowles, Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and its shadow rapporteurs, of course, as well as Commissioner Barnier, who, alongside the Belgian Finance Minister, Mr Reynders, carried out important work for six months, securing swift agreements that have been transformed in this very Parliament into real decisions in the financial sector."
"Anyway, thank you for your fruitful and effective collaboration in this area."
"I am sure that you will continue this work during the Presidencies to come."
"Mr President, good afternoon to you all."
"You spoke very well, Mr Gauzès, as did Mr Chastel just now, on behalf of Mr Reynders, about the supervision and regulation of the large hedge fund and private equity sector, today, and about this second stage of credit rating agency regulation, tomorrow, which is clearly being undertaken with and thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, and thanks to the Council and to the initial work of the Commission."
"On the subject of regulation, Europe is making concrete and effective progress, and it is learning the lessons of the crisis, as all taxpayers, who are also European citizens, are demanding."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on the supervision of credit rating agencies is an important step, and I, too, would like to thank you, Mr Gauzès, and, of course, those working alongside you, the Committee Chair, Mrs Bowles, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Klinz, Mr Giegold, Mr Pittella and Mr Fox."
"In a few days' time, this Presidency will come to an end, having had much success and having made a lot of progress, and I want to give my sincere thanks to Mr Reynders and to his whole team for the good relations we have maintained throughout the last six months."
"This is a good agreement, even though I have to say that it would have been excellent if, in the final compromise, we had taken up the rules that the Commission initially proposed for reinforced transparency regarding structured financial instruments."
"However, as was indicated in the recitals of the regulation, we will come back to this subject, if you wish, during the next revision of the regulation in 2011."
"As Mr Chastel said just now, from July 2011, this amendment to the 2009 regulation will give ESMA, the new Securities and Markets Authority, the direct power to supervise credit rating agencies at European level."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the importance of this decision that you are taking today really must be understood."
"This is the first time that ESMA, this new European authority, will have the power to directly supervise financial institutions operating across Europe."
"This amendment completes the new European supervision framework."
"It strengthens ESMA's powers considerably, as you explained very well, Mr Gauzès, and as Mr Giegold, who is here, was also anxious to point out during the debate on supervision."
"This is therefore a very important subject for you, and it is also a very important subject for us."
"ESMA will become the institution responsible for registering rating agencies and supervising them throughout the Union, and it will exercise strict control."
"The legislation will grant it all the supervisory powers deemed necessary to force rating agencies to comply with the terms of the regulation."
"ESMA will be able to exercise supervision - I am thinking here of requests for information and the power to carry out spot checks - and if it notices that a credit rating agency is committing a violation, it will have to take the measures necessary to force the agency to put a stop to that violation."
"ESMA will also have the power, strictly regulated by clear rules, to impose fines and penalties on rating agencies which do not respect the regulation."
"Clearly, this regulation also guarantees the rights of defence of rating agencies, in particular, the right to a hearing, access to documents and other procedural guarantees."
"Finally, when exercising a supervisory power, ESMA will respect the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the other principles and provisions of European Union law, including the proportionality principle."
"The new regulation on rating agencies will also ensure a single point of contact for all rating agencies, a regulatory framework which is harmonised across the European Union, with equal treatment, and a more consistent application of the rules for agencies throughout the European Union."
"I therefore think that this represents a considerable gain in efficiency, transparency and security within the general architecture that we are constructing week by week in order to achieve intelligent supervision and effective regulation."
"Mr President, I do not want to speak at great length as I did just now, but I would perhaps like to expand on what Mr Chastel said and mention the next stage, since I myself said that we must go further to ensure the proper regulation of rating agencies, while noting that the agencies are not creating the problem and the turbulence on the financial markets."
"The thermometer does not cause the fever, but it still needs to work properly, which was not the case in the past, and that is what we want to remedy, so to speak, with these successive regulations."
"The Commission is already considering the next stage: a public consultation was launched on 5 November 2010 to broaden this debate and to collect the points of view of all the parties concerned, and, as you know, there is nothing artificial about the debates regarding all these regulations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I truly set great store by listening to every contribution, criticism or idea made in the context of these consultations."
"We shall now consider, first, the consequences of the issuer-pays model, which is widespread among rating agencies; second, the dependence of the banks and other institutional investors on credit ratings; third, the rating of sovereign debt - which is not a straightforward matter; fourth, increasing transparency in order to manage conflicts of interest better; and fifth, creating more competition and diversity in this rating agencies market, which is currently concentrated in too few hands."
"This consultation is open until next January and, on the basis of all the responses that we receive, and of Mr Klinz's own-initiative report, we will take a decision at some point in 2011, but not too late, regarding the measures that we want to implement in order to complete, through a third stage, these two regulations on rating agencies, which are now almost implemented."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, as a Vice-Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to present some important aspects that were the subject of the debates and amendments tabled in this committee."
"Firstly, at the present time, payment for the structured instruments evaluated by the agencies is made by the issuing company."
"There can be conflicts of interest because the rated companies are interested in having a good rating."
"Alternatively, it might be the users of ratings who pay."
"The users' interests are more diverse and therefore, there is not a single interest that can lead to a conflict of interest."
"There are users who prefer a good rating, for instance, when they want to sell shares, and those who prefer a bad rating, for instance when they want to buy shares."
"Secondly, the regime for the rating agencies could profit from the rules that have been established for the auditors."
"The rating agencies and auditors have a lot of responsibility for the good reputation of companies and the proper functioning of the market."
"Auditors, however, seem to be subject to far stricter rules than the rating agencies."
"Thirdly, the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, should have supervisory competence over the credit rating agencies in order to verify possible material discrepancies between the ratings given by different agencies for the same structured financial instrument."
"ESMA should also have greater power of enforcement."
"Fourthly, the directive introduces a new principle, taken from the latest US legislation."
"When an agency other than the one contracted to make the valuation can do its valuation for the same instrument, it is subject to the contracted valuation."
"For this, the first agency must disclose certain information regarding the valuated instrument."
"In such a way, two beneficial effects are obtained - firstly, there is a second opinion and, secondly, the liability that falls on the contracted agency is reduced."
"Finally, I want to underline the fact that the provisions of this directive, which represents a new regulatory frame, should only apply to the structured financial instruments, credit rating agencies themselves being an important part of structured finance."
"The remainder of the financial instruments, 150 year-old common shares or plain bonds which do not pose a systemic risk should not be part of this directive if you want to be tight but not to over-regulate, if you want to be competitive but not expensive in administrative costs, and if you want to hold capital in Europe and not drive it away to the emerging markets abroad."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to our now tried-and-tested cooperation, we have worked productively with Mr Gauzès on this regulation to ensure some important advances in the rules governing one of the most controversial areas for the stability of the financial markets."
"One such improvement is undoubtedly the plan for the newly formed European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to be able to directly penalise credit rating agencies for misconduct."
"This was a point that I very much insisted on."
"Parliament is showing in this way that it is fighting for the creation of a strong European supervisory body that is equipped with real powers."
"We are also aware that this regulation still does not tackle all the problems in a sector which, in recent years, has been seen to have exacerbated the crisis."
"The stumbling blocks to be overcome, which are the subject of a parliamentary report already being drafted by Mr Klinz, concern two issues in particular: the evaluation of Member States' sovereign debt and the general structure of a market characterised by an obvious oligopoly."
"The European Union must have a clear objective in relation to these issues, namely, to make finance less dependent on ratings."
"The references currently contained in the laws and regulations on credit rating agencies must be superseded by alternative creditworthiness standards."
"The United States and the G20 have already gone in that direction."
"At international level we need to have the courage and the ambition to change the rules underpinning Basel II, by which I mean the obligation to use ratings - a mechanism that has actually led the banking sector, in the past and still today, to completely give up on supervision, the consequences of which are plain to see."
"I shall conclude with a brief reference to the issue of sovereign debt rating: this should no longer be the responsibility of credit rating agencies, because too often they have exasperated market sentiment with their ratings, fuelling speculation."
"We should give thought instead to the possibility of a European institution - perhaps an existing institution, such as the European Court of Auditors - playing a role in this area."
"I really do hope that my suggestions will be endorsed by my fellow Members and will receive the full, authoritative support of Commissioner Barnier, for whom I wish to reiterate my high regard."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks' time, we will have a new supervisory structure in Europe, which has been shaped to a considerable extent by the European Parliament."
"Among these three new supervisory authorities will be one that is responsible for markets and securities: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)."
"ESMA will have the last word in connection with the registration and oversight of credit rating agencies and be responsible for ensuring that the credit rating agencies actually comply with the new regulations."
"If it so wishes, ESMA can delegate this cross-border responsibility to national supervisory authorities if these supervisory authorities are small and only operate nationally."
"This proposal is therefore nothing more than an adaptation of the regulation of April 2009 to the new circumstances, but it strengthens the role of ESMA."
"It gives the new supervisory authority more powers and - something that is completely new - it gives ESMA the power to punish non-application of the regulation."
"I very much welcome this, because I believe that strengthening the position of a new supervisory authority of European mould will genuinely increase its credibility on the market."
"I just have one point of criticism."
"When drawing up the regulation in April 2009, we took a political decision with regard to how we should deal with ratings from third countries in Europe."
"We said at that time that they can be used in Europe if they either comply with the equivalence procedure or are supported by a credit rating agency that is registered and approved in Europe, the so-called endorsement procedure."
"The Commission has now changed this at level 2 and said that endorsement will no longer be possible."
"Therefore, only the equivalence procedure actually applies."
"I consider this - as it was undertaken unilaterally - to be an undemocratic way of going about things, and I believe that we should stick to the decision that we made at the time in April 2009."
"As the Commissioner also mentioned, there are still a lot of outstanding issues where credit rating agencies are concerned, namely, the lack of competition, insufficient transparency, the business model as to whether the issuer or the investor should pay, which need to be looked at critically."
"There are questions with regard to the payment system and also with regard to excessive dependency, because in reality, it is the case that, as a result of regulatory provisions, many ratings agencies have become de facto regulatory certification authorities."
"I am taking this up in the own-initiative report, and I am pleased that the Commission is going to table a legislative proposal on this matter in the next year."
"Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, Mr Gauzès, ladies and gentlemen and shadow rapporteurs, I am indeed pleased that we have now taken this step and that for the first time, a sector of the European financial system will be placed under direct European supervision."
"It is also a step towards a strong Europe in an internal market and the firm control of a sector that contributed to the crisis."
"I would like to make one more comment on this."
"Mr Barnier, the selection process is, of course, currently under way for the new authorities, and the new authorities are only as good as their staff."
"I can only hope that the staff will genuinely be selected on the basis of expertise, independence from the financial industry that they are to control and the clear desire to serve in the public interest, and that we will not see national quotas again in the selection process that disregard these important criteria."
"In addition, we still have a great deal to do in the area of credit rating agencies."
"We still have no real transparency when it comes to the information with which the credit rating agencies work and there is far too great a use of regulatory ratings in the financial sector and in the regulations governing the financial industry."
"We have serious conflicts of interest, we quite clearly have a market power of three major providers and there is no liability for negligently issued ratings."
"Commissioner, it is good that the consultation is now under way and we await the results with interest."
"Civil society, in particular, should be involved in this consultation, but then you need to put forward a courageous proposal."
"I am already looking forward to your proposal."
"Please be as courageous as you have been up to now, and let us produce legislation together during the next year that solves the problems that are still present on the credit rating market in a genuinely European way."
"We owe this to our citizens."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Gauzès for his excellent work on this subject."
"I am pleased that Articles 8a and 8b were removed during the trialogue."
"Initially, the Commission's draft proposed creating secure websites."
"I was never convinced."
"We can see how the situation unfolds in the United States, and if the sites turn out to be useful, we can always introduce them here in Europe afterwards."
"Mr President, I am delighted to inform you that my group will vote in favour of this report tomorrow, and I thank Mr Gauzès once again."
"Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the last few months since the beginning of this year have shown the damage that credit rating agencies can do."
"There is therefore an urgent need for action."
"I, too, therefore welcome the directive, in particular, the fact that the supervision and registration of credit rating agencies will be transferred to ESMA."
"That is an important and positive step in the right direction."
"However, numerous good and progressive proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations on the report."
"I would like to mention this once again."
"Thus, the appointment of ESMA remains the only real and positive change."
"The proposals for a public database for the issuing of credit ratings have been dropped, as has any reference to the establishment of a public credit rating agency."
"The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about."
"Moreover, the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products."
"This, too, has come to nothing."
"I hope that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the reports on this matter that are still to come and that were mentioned by Mr Gauzès and by you, Mr Barnier."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we are nearing the time of fervent prayers in light of today's news, once again concerning the euro, for which we are grateful."
"I very much hope that, with your courageous approach, you will not be too far behind the times."
"I would like to endorse what the previous speaker said and ask you urgently to ensure, in your sphere of influence, that selections will not only be made on the basis of national quotas, but also that party political preferences will be put aside so that we can finally break with a very awkward tradition in connection with officials, which is specific to Europe, and actually bring in the best people."
"My second request is for much greater transparency with regard to the competitors on the international market outside the EU, which have constantly made a political issue out of their ratings and have suggested that they have an omniscience that in no way corresponds to what is actually happening on the market or even their importance."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Gauzès, ladies and gentlemen, it is truly a great pleasure for me to note that Mr Gauzès has created such an excellent report."
"The topic is of extreme importance, and looking at the habits and operation of credit rating agencies, it always has relevance."
"The rapporteur's effort to ensure that credit rating agencies and their products are controlled in an integrated way, on the basis of uniform EU standards, deserves support."
"However, it is important to know what exactly is being rated and how."
"We must ask these questions, as it is common knowledge that prior to the crisis, these credit rating agencies gave excellent ratings to several thousand billion dollars worth of doubtful or bad securities, thereby unfortunately providing unlimited ground for speculation."
"First of all, we must examine the issue of independence, because if it is true that banks and certain investor groups are financing the fees of the evaluations, we might ask the question whether the decisions of credit rating agencies are indeed free of external interests."
"The second issue is the methodology of ratings."
"The third issue is that with concerted downgrades and negative rumours, any country can be made insolvent, and in this way, it can be forced to take out new loans and thus remain an increasingly vulnerable client in the debtors' market."
"Small, open economies and Member States outside the euro area are particularly vulnerable."
"I am therefore convinced that it is incorrect to accept that credit rating agencies are not responsible for the ratings they give."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us put ratings in their appropriate place, and rely on them only to the extent of their credibility, and consider them as guidelines when establishing the regulatory framework."
"The report is more than worthy of support."
"The global economic crisis has shown that the regulation and EU level supervision of the operations of these institutions are necessary."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, credit rating agencies played, and are still playing, a dishonourable role in the financial crisis."
"There are too few of them, they are too powerful and too lacking in transparency, and their structure and importance is an example of how badly things have gone awry with our global financial system."
"Confidence in credit rating agencies can only be restored by establishing new, sound rules for them."
"Tomorrow, we will vote on one step in this development, the necessary adaptation of credit rating agencies to the new European financial market supervisory structure and adaptation to the new comitology procedure, the delegated acts."
"ESMA will be brought into being."
"It is authorised to permanently revise ratings, carry out a thorough inspection of credit rating agencies and also to impose penalties that are higher than the profit gained from breaking the law."
"All of these are new developments that are, as a minimum, absolutely necessary."
"However, I would like to point out that the European Securities and Markets Authority should be staffed in such a way as to enable it to actually carry out its tasks efficiently and not by a relatively small staff of ESMA employees who are expected to perform almost superhuman tasks."
"We should be completely open with regard to the forthcoming major reform of the credit rating agencies and today, we should discuss what seems to be almost impossible or hard to imagine."
"After all, special purpose entities in which banks deposited their junk bonds received the highest credit rating from the credit rating agencies."
"Thus, in the major revision, we should consider creating a European public rating agency and changing and examining the payment model."
"Finally, we should, of course, consider whether there is a need for a second rating."
"We need a serious, robust form of regulation so that it cannot happen again that three large agencies can bear so much of the responsibility for this current sorry financial situation."
"Mr President, this reminds me of a phrase in Latin that goes quis custodiet custodes, who will guard the guards?"
"The same is true here."
"Who is going to rate the credit agencies?"
"Thankfully, we now have an instrument that will do that and, certainly, the credit rating agencies have brought no credit on themselves; rather; they have discredited themselves by their behaviour over the last couple of years and they have exacerbated the financial situation rather than alleviate it."
"So I am delighted that the European Parliament and our authorities are taking control of the situation and I compliment Mr Gauzès, Mr Barnier and the Council for putting in place an instrument that will deal with this."
"I am certainly looking forward to tomorrow's vote on this and, if I am given the opportunity, I will vote three or four times to bring these vultures under control."
"(LT) Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the preparation of this very important document."
"To date, much has been done as regards the creation of a system for financial control and its operation in the European Union."
"Credit rating agencies play a very important role as they have a direct impact on the operation of the financial system, its soundness and stability."
"I feel that one major problem is the fact that the EU financial supervisory authorities being set up do not yet have real powers which would enable them to have a direct impact and to take binding decisions."
"I therefore support the proposals giving one of the European supervisory authorities, in this case, the European Securities and Markets Authority, greater powers to ensure and monitor the transparency of the work of credit rating agencies certified by the EU in order to avoid distortions of the principles of the financial market and the single internal market."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, if we wish to be honest, we must unfortunately declare that credit rating agencies are essentially subsidiaries of the international plutocracy."
"Through the agencies, they put pressure on countries in an attempt to influence their decisions."
"The greatest problem with ratings is that they are almost entirely subjective and do not offer an accurate picture of the economic condition of the countries concerned at a given moment in time."
"These ratings, which are a far cry from reality, clearly hinder countries in recovering from the crisis."
"Meanwhile, there are, of course, objective indicators, such as the general government deficit or external and internal indebtedness."
"On the other hand, the establishment of an organisation, a supervisory body, which essentially provides quality control for these institutions, and thereby prevents them from giving often erroneous ratings, is a big step towards a solution."
"However, I would, at any rate, like to address a question to Mr Barnier regarding the ESMA: we have talked much about how it would impose various sanctions, but when will we know what these sanctions will be, what their extent will be and when they can be introduced?"
"I thank you in advance for your reply."
"(RO) Mr President, the aim of the amendments suggested by Mr Gauzès's report is to provide additional details concerning ESMA's new powers in relation to national agencies."
"My view is that the remit should be defined very clearly."
"In addition, financial market participants should be able to identify the competent authority in the rating agencies sector."
"I think that the new authority should have sole responsibility for registering and supervising existing rating agencies."
"They should have the opportunity to access information about the financial instruments being evaluated by competitors."
"At the same time, access to websites should only be given if the confidentiality of the information requested can be guaranteed."
"Finally, I wish to stress the importance of a credit rating agency being registered by a competent authority and its validity throughout the whole EU."
"Mr President, I am pleased that this is before us here this evening."
"I have to say that one of the points that is very rarely made is that, until recently, the public sector in Ireland was being regulated by the private sector; it was being regulated effectively by the credit rating agencies and the markets."
"I am one of those who welcome the fact that we got away from the private sector and, at least, we have the shield of the ECB, the EU and the IMF in the circumstances we are in."
"I might not agree with the exact package but I think it is a better position for us to be in than to be at the mercy of the credit rating agencies and the markets."
"The markets are supposed to be free; I think that is something we might have a debate on some other day."
"But, in relation to the credit rating agencies, one of those agencies was getting USD 800 million a year for rating structured finances."
"Their impartiality really is being called into account and, when we look back on what they did in the past and even when we look back on what they do now, I think we will look back in dismay."
"It is time they were called to account and I am glad that there will be stronger supervision for these bodies."
"Mr President, I would like to respond accurately, but succinctly to all those who have spoken, to whom I give my thanks."
"First, Mr Bodu, I obviously share your point of view on the risks of the issuer-pays model."
"I made this point myself in my speech just now."
"It is therefore a subject which forms part of our consultation in the future proposal, the third stage."
"As I said to Mr Fox and Mrs Băsescu, we will indeed also return to the matter of structured products."
"Mr Fox, I listened carefully to your concerns about security as regards exchanges of information, and we will keep an eye on this; we will come back to this point."
"We will also continue to rely on the competence of ESMA in this area."
"For us, this is a question of efficiency."
"Mr Pittella, thank you for your encouragement."
"I think that it is good that, like Mr Klute and Mrs Gáll-Pelcz, you emphasise the importance of this new supervisory authority."
"There are still some difficult issues to be addressed, which we have identified, and you yourself quite rightly reminded us of them: the lack of competition in this sector, the issue of rating sovereign debt, which Mr Kelly mentioned just now, and which poses a particular problem."
"We will take these ideas into account in the new consultation phase."
"I share Mr Klinz's view on the importance of penalties and the ability of ESMA to impose them."
"Mrs Regner also mentioned this point."
"On the issue of third countries, Mr Klinz, the aim is to ensure that our requirements remain rigorous, and I say this also to Mr Mitchell, who mentioned Europe's credibility with respect to these decisions which must be taken."
"I am grateful to Mr Giegold for his positive assessment of the progress that we have made together today."
"On the subject of recruiting people to manage the European authorities, I obviously cannot provide any specific information about names at the moment, but I would like to say to you, Mr Giegold, and also to Mr Martin, that the process is now under way, that it is being conducted completely objectively, and that, as far as I am concerned, the criteria according to which the choice must be made are competence and independence."
"I would also say to Mrs Regner that the agencies will gain in power."
"From the very first teams, they will develop in accordance with the competences that they have been and will be given."
"We are anxious to ensure the credibility of the agencies' work in terms of methods and competences."
"Mr Klute, thank you for your comments."
"You have clearly identified the problems which remain to be dealt with, and I am conscious, as I have said to several Members, that we will have to thoroughly examine these issues."
"That is why the idea of dealing with this issue of regulating the agencies in three stages seems to me to be constructive and positive."
"Mr Balčytis, the agencies, as I have said myself, are not creating the problems."
"They just need to evaluate the problems properly and the thermometer needs to work properly."
"With regard to products, businesses and states, we have the right, considering the importance of these ratings, to expect and to take steps to obtain an evaluation or rating which is objective and credible."
"I think that from this point of view, Mr Balčytis, you should not underestimate the role that ESMA will play."
"Finally, I would also say in response to Mr Szegedi that, regarding the level of the penalties, the specifications for ESMA in the text that you will be adopting go into detail on this, and that ESMA will apply these penalties in accordance with the proportionality principle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you in advance for your vote of support for this new stage, which will show - I repeat once more - that Europe is making concrete and objective progress, that it is learning the lessons of the crisis, thanks to the support and the impetus given by the Belgian Presidency, and thanks to the support of all the groups in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to come back to the fact that many good questions have been asked in this debate."
"Commissioner Barnier addressed them one by one."
"I would simply like to say to you that this modification, this amendment of the regulation, is a first step in granting the necessary supervisory powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority, and that, as has been said, other revisions of this regulation will take place shortly."
"I think that, on this issue, and on many other important issues raised today, this will truly be an opportunity to bring together the whole debate in the revision which the Commission is getting ready to propose to us."
"On the same note, I would like to return for a few moments to the removal of the provisions on transparency of credit ratings and associated information, which Commissioner Barnier himself mentioned just now."
"I do not think that this in any way means that the European institutions do not support the idea of transparency of credit ratings - quite the contrary."
"However, at this stage, when a decision is being taken, the best solution was to coordinate ourselves in advance on the basis of developments on the international stage, in order not to affect the competitiveness of the European markets."
"For the moment, therefore, better solutions to this issue are still being researched, discussed and developed, and we think that the best political compromise is the one on which you will be voting tomorrow."
"In conclusion, I would like to repeat that this is an important step, as many of you have stressed, which will help to improve the stability of the financial markets and which will support the development of a more effective supervisory framework."
"Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, after the comments that you have heard, you can draw two conclusions."
"The first is that Parliament will overwhelmingly support this report tomorrow, which will show once again that Parliament, or a large majority of it, appreciates the actions on regulation and supervision that are being taken by the Commission and which have been strongly supported by the Belgian Presidency."
"The second conclusion that we can draw is that I will not come to a conclusion today, but that a new debate will open up, on the basis of this consultation, of Mr Klinz's own-initiative report, to examine all these difficult questions."
"Thus, we cannot avoid the fact that in 2009, when we brought about the first regulation, we were already asking ourselves these questions."
"If we have not dealt with these questions, it is because we have not found an appropriate response."
"I hope, therefore, that, thanks to the thought that is being given to the matter with the submission of Mr Klinz's report, the discussion about consultation which is taking place will this time enable us to provide responses to complete the regulation on rating agencies."
"In conclusion, however, if you will allow me, I will repeat a phrase by the President of the Securities and Markets Authority, who said that, at the very least, it would be good if the financial markets detoxified themselves of the rating agencies to allow investors to gain a greater personal appreciation of situations and risks."
"I think that that would also be a guarantee."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Wednesday, 15 December 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"As a result of underestimating the credit risk, credit rating agencies were one of the factors that triggered the global financial crisis."
"On the other hand, there is no real competition in the credit rating agency sector."
"This situation increases the danger of conflicts of interest and, by extension, of a lack of transparency and quality in terms of awarding ratings to the various financial instruments."
"On 1 January 2011, the regulation giving rise to the creation of the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into force."
"Its main power will be to supervise agencies of this kind. Introducing a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies at EU level is proving to be a necessity."
"I think that this new authority needs to exercise its mandate as soon as it is created."
"I would like to point out that the decision made by the United States to introduce tighter supervisory regulations has paved the way for global harmonisation."
"The European Union has already implemented rules, which will come into force at the end of the year."
"The rules for credit rating agencies that wish to operate in the EU and thus obtain a licence include, among other things, the obligation to register themselves and to comply with specific transparency and 'good behaviour' rules."
"I do not believe that these rules are strict enough, and I welcome the further measure that we are discussing within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"These agencies currently have a great deal of power; they can plunge a State and/or even a system (downgrading countries and causing a chain reaction of fear on the world markets) into crisis with one of their ratings."
"Their work is important in terms of guaranteeing reliability and stability, but there are doubts as to the rules and the criteria on which their ratings are based."
"Mr Gauzès's report, which proposes bringing credit rating agencies under the supervision of the European Securities and Markets Authority, is therefore along the right lines."
"Outcome of the Climate Change Conference in Cancún (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the Climate Change Conference in Cancún."
"Mr President, honourable members of Parliament, I am very pleased to be here today, in the European Parliament, once again, after the debate we had prior to Cancún and now that the climate conference has produced an outcome."
"I am also pleased to see a few familiar faces here again who were also present as a delegation in Cancún and who were given a mandate by the European Parliament to make a very useful and active contribution to the success of the conference."
"I think that this should definitely be highlighted and underlined."
"The climate summit in Cancún has ultimately been a success."
"It was uncertain, right up to the very last day, whether we would reach an outcome, but, in the end, that outcome has been a positive one."
"This was necessary, both for our climate policy and for the continued existence of the multilateral process."
"At the climate conference, we reached a decision which actually consisted of two parts: the first part could be considered to consist of a number of specific measures which could be applied quite rapidly, and the second part lays down a number of foundations intended to facilitate a global deal for the post-2012 period over the long term."
"Obviously, both of these elements were agreed in the framework of the 2 °C target, which was included as the starting point in the outcome of the climate conference."
"When I speak about immediate implementation or a number of actions which could be undertaken immediately, then I am talking about adaptation, technology, combating deforestation and financing."
"Perhaps I could briefly highlight a number of things?"
"First and foremost, adaptation."
"We have adopted a framework and established a committee."
"In that way, we will be offering support for the most vulnerable areas."
"Secondly, technology."
"Support will be provided for both mitigation and adaptation."
"There are two new structures being created: the Executive Technology Committee and The Centre and Network for Climate Technology."
"The idea is to further knowledge through research, dissemination and transfer of technologies."
"Thirdly, the fight against deforestation."
"The national strategies and action plans of developing countries will form the basis of financing action in the fight against deforestation."
"Finally, the Green Climate Fund must ensure that USD 100 billion is made available to developing countries by 2020."
"These are the specific achievements of Cancún."
"If we then look at the longer term and at the foundations which have been laid down, we should, of course, continue to work next year to bring about an international agreement after 2012."
"The mitigation measures of both developed and developing countries have now been included and embedded in the text, which is very important, because the outcome of Copenhagen has now also been officially included."
"In addition, there have been efforts to ensure greater transparency."
"The legal form in the longer term, in the post-2012 period, will not be determined until next year."
"Now, that will be a debate in its own right: are we heading towards a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and what are the emerging countries and the United States doing?"
"This is not an end, therefore, but a beginning, an important new step in the climate debate."
"I think that all of us - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - will have to continue to work hard together to ensure that we can take a major step forward next year and, hopefully, get a binding international agreement."
"In any case, I would like to thank Parliament once again for the efforts it made in Cancún."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think it is fair to say that we in the European Union went to Cancún with the fear that we risked getting nothing."
"Of course, we also went there with the very strong desire to ensure that this would not be the case and that we actually got a substantial and balanced package."
"As you all now know, that is what we got."
"This means that the multilateral process is alive."
"More than that, it is relatively well and, as it could have been dead by now, that in itself is important."
"I think that all those who were there also felt relief when the final deal was done."
"It was as though the whole international community simply wanted this to happen and wanted to prove that of course we need multilateralism when we are fighting global challenges."
"I also think that it is important to say that what we achieved in Cancún was not just about saving the process."
"It was more than that, which is, of course, the essential thing."
"We wanted to save the process."
"We wanted to save the prospect of having a global deal and we wanted to ensure that we also got something substantial done in Cancún."
"We worked very hard, together with the Mexican Presidency."
"We worked very closely with them and gave them our full support from the very beginning."
"I must say that the Mexicans fully deserve all the credit they have been given; they have done excellent work."
"A year ago, we took the first steps in Copenhagen."
"I think that, if we had met two or three days after Copenhagen was over, few of us would have thought that, one year later, all the elements of the Copenhagen Accord would be included in a binding UN agreement."
"That is really good."
"But in Cancún, we also took new steps."
"We strengthened the international climate regime with new institutions and new funds."
"I would like to stress three things that were particularly important to the European Union in the end game - which was very much Friday, as some of those present will recall."
"We had three priorities which we wanted to be reflected in the result."
"We wanted recognition of the gap between the emission reduction pledges of the Copenhagen Accord now being anchored in the UN text and the challenge of keeping global warming below 2 °C. It was very important, to state the obvious, that we are not there yet."
"We also very much wanted to have increased transparency - through measuring, reporting and verification (MRV), and international consultation and analysis (ICA)."
"Thirdly, we wanted the possibility of a future legal framework for the period beyond 2012 to be reflected in the text."
"On all three points, we made progress."
"For the first time, the 2 °C objective is acknowledged in a UN document, the pledges are anchored and the obvious has been stated, namely, that countries need to do more for the world to stay below the 2 °C rise. We also started a process to strengthen transparency and, as we said in Cancún, it is not enough just to say that you are in favour of increased transparency."
"What does that mean?"
"It is very important that the text now contains several pages spelling out exactly what the political guidance for MRV and ICA would be."
"That is very important and I would like to add one further point."
"I think that it is not just of interest to the international climate negotiations that, for instance, a country like China has now accepted international consultation and analysis."
"I think that is also an important signal that reaches far beyond the climate negotiations."
"This was actually a very important and significant step forward."
"Finally, we managed to keep open the discussion about the Kyoto Protocol and a future legal outcome."
"I think that, if we had not had the prospect of having a second commitment period, it is very likely that the process would have been dead by now."
"Having said these positive things, I would like to echo what Joke Schauvliege has just said to the effect that this does not mean that we have a very easy year ahead of us."
"We have a long and challenging journey to make."
"We saw in Cancún how slow the process is."
"When you take steps together in the UN context, it is slow by definition, so no one should believe that the road to South Africa is going to be an easy one."
"The year ahead of us is a very challenging one."
"The only thing I would say at this stage is that Europe will do whatever we can to continue to play this very constructive role and to try to build bridges between different points of view, while bearing our own priorities very much in mind."
"I think it is very important now that everybody goes back home and starts to do things in their own nation, in their own region and in their own municipality."
"All must now take action, as we are doing in Europe."
"We have our 2020 target and we have also initiated the discussion about how we could eventually increase our ambitions in the short term."
"As you know, in the spring, the Commission will present a strategy for completing the transition to a low carbon economy by 2050."
"That strategy will also include a 2030 objective."
"Let me finish with a word about the European Union in the climate change conference."
"I would like to highlight that we actually managed to speak with one voice."
"We were discussing earlier in this forum how important that is."
"The Commission, the Presidency and the 27 Member States ensured that the European Union played its part on the world stage."
"I am pleased to say that there was excellent cooperation between Minister Schauvliege and her team and my team from the Commission."
"I would like to thank Joke Schauvliege very much for her contribution towards this result."
"Last, but of course not least, I would very much like to thank the Parliament delegation."
"I think that they contributed a great deal towards conveying the message that Europe really was speaking with one voice."
"I would particularly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Jo Leinen."
"I think that it was crucial that, when members of the delegation were addressed and asked about the European position, they all tried to stick to the common denominator."
"I think that contributed a lot to the general impression that this time, Europe actually was speaking with one voice."
"Thank you very much for that."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to endorse the congratulating of Commissioner Hedegaard."
"We have learnt a significant amount from the events of last year, particularly with regard to speaking with one voice."
"If we compare the situation now with Copenhagen, we can say that we went to Copenhagen with high expectations and we were very disappointed."
"We went to Cancún with lower expectations and we nevertheless managed to achieve something there."
"I am convinced that next year in Durban, we will actually achieve the result that we are all hoping for."
"It is important that the UN process is now up and running and that in the European Union, we are aware that many paths lead to the same goal."
"Our common goal is to limit global warming to the celebrated 2 ºC."
"We have now managed for the first time to enshrine this in a UN document."
"However, even in Europe, we have come to realise that the famous binding agreement is not enough."
"We also need to recognise the efforts of other countries - and this, in particular, includes the large emitters like the United States and China."
"For us, it is extremely important from a political point of view that we are united in our efforts, and we succeeded in demonstrating this in Cancún."
"However, it is also important that, as the developed world, we not only live up to our historic responsibility, we also need to do something, and, above all, we must find a successor regulation for the Kyoto Protocol."
"It is also just as important that the developing world recognises that efforts are also required by them."
"I believe that we succeeded very well in doing that, and we are on the right track here."
"The details have already been mentioned."
"For me, what seems to be particularly important is the fact that we have made definite progress, particularly in the fight against deforestation."
"The individual countries are called on to develop national strategies, and we will then see what they achieve."
"That part is very important for us, including from a political point of view."
"We have a responsibility with regard to technology transfer."
"We need to take more of a leading role in this regard, but, overall, my assessment is a positive one and I would like to thank you once again, Commissioner, for your efforts."
"Mr President, we would like to thank the Commission and the Council, Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Schauvliege, for the daily briefings that the European Parliament delegation received in Cancún."
"We can truly say that, in Cancún, the EU was not part of the problem but, in many cases, was part of the solution."
"That should please all of us."
"The positive mood must now be utilised to bring new momentum to climate policy in Europe and also to the European Union."
"I would just like to mention three points."
"It was absolutely right for Parliament, in its resolution, to call for us to raise our ambitions and achieve a reduction in CO2 of 30% by 2020, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will adopt decisions on this in the spring."
"Secondly, we have the Green Climate Fund."
"We proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this."
"The people who rejected this must now come up with alternatives - we can no longer beat about the bush."
"Thirdly, we must do our homework."
"We must take the hot air out of the EU's carbon footprint."
"My final point is this: This climate conference is done."
"Now let us look to the next one."
"The work must now be stepped up."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have absolutely no interest in football but occasionally I have seen pictures of a game, and I have looked at the manager and thought of the Commissioner."
"Two-one down and, despite her best efforts, her team faces relegation; then a goal is scored."
"I do not know who scores it - maybe the goalkeeper on the opposite side walks into the net carrying his own ball - but one way or another it is a draw; a vital point is secured and relegation is avoided."
"It is not a triumph, but it is not a defeat; and the manager lives to fight another day."
"I am told that, at Cancún, a great cheer went up when there was a resolution to the negotiations."
"I can understand the relief of delegates there of it not being a defeat, but it was hardly a triumph."
"Where is the mention of curbing the rise in temperatures by 2015?"
"Where is the ambition to cut CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050?"
"Where are the post-Kyoto commitments?"
"Fudged and dodged and kicked into the long grass."
"But criticism is easy; what is being attempted has never been done before."
"It requires the governments of the world to join together in collective action; that, of course, is why the critics on the nationalist Right hate it so much."
"Every government in the world accepts the science and accepts that we are not doing enough to stop world temperatures rising by two degrees centigrade."
"Even China, this time, recognised that there are limits to national sovereignty and accepted that there should be international verification of its emissions because we are in this together: one race, one species on a single planet."
"There are some very difficult questions to be answered as we go forward."
"How do we move from here to make a post-Kyoto binding agreement that places requirements not just upon developed countries but also upon developing countries?"
"How do we secure the funding?"
"Really, how do we get the money that we promised for adaptation and forest protection?"
"How do we persuade our own governments to raise our 2020 ambitions from 20% to 30% cuts in CO2?"
"But maybe we have an answer to that."
"With China well on its way to reducing its carbon intensity by 45%, it is in our economic interest to make sure that we take these measures, or we are going to be left behind economically."
"Maybe now, thanks to our not being defeated at Cancún, we have the momentum - the sense that we are going forward again - to make the changes that are necessary."
"Mr President, like Mr Leinen, I wanted to emphasise the remarkable work that Commissioner Hedegaard and her team carried out in Cancún."
"Today, in a way, the success of Cancún means that we have to call a halt to the strategy of saying that, if the others take no action, we will take no action."
"The positive aspect of Cancún is that everyone must now engage with the machine of international negotiation, in particular, by strengthening their national or regional objectives."
"In terms of the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Europe now has to reach 30%."
"Reaching 30% is part of the objective of obtaining a decarbonised economy by 2050; 20% will not allow us to make this transition."
"Finally, in reaching 30%, we will also clearly be linking up now with the emerging economies: Brazil, China and South Africa."
"We know that these countries have some objectives which, up to a point, are currently superior to those of the European Union. We must therefore put a stop to inaction and the strategy of the status quo."
"The success of Cancún means that we must engage with the process of international negotiation in a much more constructive manner."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I was not fortunate enough to be on the Parliament delegation in Cancún, but I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone who was involved."
"I was perhaps a bit of a cynic about whether these sorts of meetings could achieve anything but, whilst there have been many voices in the press complaining about a lack of detail, particularly - as Jo Leinen suggests - about lack of detail in the area of financing for the Green Fund and many other issues that have been left unspecified at this stage, I take the optimistic view that this gathering was not the time or the place for dealing with minute detail, but was the time to flesh out the global aspirations and talk a bit about strategy, and I think that has been achieved."
"In my group, the ECR, we believe in light-touch government."
"We believe that you will achieve more by encouragement, not by haranguing, and I believe that this is a step closer to that."
"I can do no better than to close with the words of my Prime Minister, David Cameron, when he said yesterday 'The Cancún agreement is a very significant step forward in renewing the determination of the international community to tackle climate change through multilateral action'."
"I congratulate every one of my colleagues here who was involved in achieving that."
"The main objective yet to be achieved is a global agreement which is legal and ambitious and aims to keep the temperature increase below 2 °C, or even 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial levels."
"The measure of agreement reached in Cancún is a step in that direction."
"I agree with those who say today that we have a lot to do yet."
"The governments must build on that achievement now."
"The gaps must be filled."
"The difficult issues on the agenda must be tackled, and targets must be set now that are much firmer, clearer and binding."
"The deadlines between now and COP 17 in South Africa must be adhered to."
"My thanks also, therefore, to the Council and the Commission for what we have achieved, but we still face hard work ahead."
"In Europe, we must agree immediately to a reduction of at least 30% in CO2 leakage in Europe, not only for the sake of international agreement but for our own sake."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much for her splendid contribution and the excellent briefings given to all of us in Cancún."
"However, the whole climate conference, of course, focused on dealing in hot air and the setting up of a fund for developing countries."
"This is fine from my point of view, but who will check that the money is being given out correctly and does not end up in the personal pockets of dictators?"
"I would have very much liked to have seen the conference also discuss restricting the use of basic resources, the necessity of biodiversity for the natural regulation of the climate and population growth - a subject that all of the politicians of the world are shutting their eyes to, because in only a few years' time, the planet will have to feed around 10 billion people."
"How will we obtain food for them without increasing our CO2 emissions, and without this tipping the natural balance and the global climate?"
"The expectations of Cancún were extremely low and it was therefore a success."
"However, the door is now open for further cooperation ahead of COP 17, and I am pleased about that."
"Mr President, as carbon crooks and One World Government conspirators celebrate their advances at Cancún, UK Prime Minister Dave Cameron declared his satisfaction with the outcome."
"At the end of the coldest first half of December in central England since records began in 1772, Dave is satisfied that the Green Climate Fund will cost British taxpayers GBP 2.9 billion on top of the GBP 18.3 billion a year that the Climate Change Act siphons from British consumers for the corporate crooks in the green industrial complex."
"Coincidently, GBP 2.9 billion is also the amount the Treasury will save by increasing the debts of British students, condemning them to a lifetime of bondage to the banks."
"That scam has already caused student riots."
"Taxpayer riots over far bigger scams - bail-outs to corrupt and incompetent banks, propping up the zombie euro and the global warming hoax - are yet to come, but come they will and, unlike Prince Charles and Camilla, their targets will deserve everything they get."
"(ES) Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and the parliamentary delegation, led by our fellow Member Mr Leinen, on the work that they did in Cancún, a meeting that I was unfortunately unable to attend in the end."
"I believe that Cancún and its results can be viewed, along the lines of what my colleague, Mr Seeber, was saying, from the perspective of Copenhagen: Cancún viewed from the Copenhagen perspective."
"The first conclusion from this perspective is that there was a fundamental differentiating factor."
"In Copenhagen, the expectations were very high, and in Cancún the expectations were much more realistic, as a result of which the assessment of Copenhagen was very negative, while the assessment of Cancún, both by those who took part and by the media in general, was very positive."
"Cancún learned lessons from Copenhagen, and I think that is the first, very interesting, conclusion."
"I believe that measures have been taken and agreements reached which are not, of course, ground-breaking, but which could be very interesting from the point of view of efficiency."
"Among other things, I think that the creation of a committee and a technology network to promote technological cooperation is extremely important."
"Here, we are going to adopt a report during this sitting on energy efficiency, which is one of the fundamental keys to effectively combating climate change."
"Also, I think that matters such as the World Bank being more involved or official recognition of the actions of countries to reduce emissions returning to the procedure and framework of the United Nations are very positive."
"Finally, I would like to say that there is one year to go before we get to South Africa."
"It would be a very good idea if, in the same way that Cancún learnt from Copenhagen, we now learnt from Kyoto, and achieved an international frame of reference for an agreement against climate change that is more flexible, more transparent, more efficient and more integrative."
"Mr President, I do not think it is a conspiracy to say that we are one world sharing one planet and I think what I got out of Cancún was the reality of all those people working together."
"One of the best parts of being in Cancún was sitting on those buses going to and from the conference centre and listening to the delegates who would tell you about what they are doing: the Zambians working with the Russians working with the Japanese and the Chinese negotiator to get an agreement."
"We share one planet and we have no future unless we work together."
"I want to thank the Council and the Commission for the work they did."
"Europe did speak with one voice and, from our meetings with different delegations, it was very clear that Europe's leadership was appreciated and people were very aware that we had a 20% target but were thinking of moving to 30%."
"I wonder what the Commissioner thinks now of the prospects for being more ambitious before Durban because, from what we heard, I think that what Europe says in Durban will count."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with my fellow Members that the work done by Commissioner Hedegaard at the Climate Change Conference in Cancún is to be applauded."
"Cancún was a step forward, although, regrettably, a much smaller step that what is really needed."
"In any case, Cancún officially endorsed the emissions commitments made at Copenhagen."
"At the same time, it pointed out that they were not enough to keep climate change below two degrees and urged the industrialised countries to tighten up their emissions targets."
"Now, the EU leadership on climate change is, in practice, being tested: are we prepared to tighten up our emissions targets by moving from a 20% to a 30% decrease?"
"This would be the best way to promote the achievement of something we must have in Durban next year: a comprehensive international climate agreement."
"After Cancún, the claim that the EU is somehow alone with its climate targets is clearly no longer relevant."
"(PT) Mr President, I would also like to express my thanks for the work that has been done."
"It is a time for balance, certainly, but we all know that it is also time to make commitments, serious commitments: many important things have been said here, and the project specifications that we have in front of us are very long, enormously so."
"Important commitments came out of Cancún, but the truth is that none of these will be formalised before next year's conference in South Africa."
"We have a year ahead of us and a lot of work to do, as I have already mentioned."
"I would like to underline the fact that the rights of indigenous people and people most affected need to be integrated, as this is a commitment that must be raised and taken seriously."
"We must not allow the poor always to be the ones that pay more, because the environmental and climate crisis is a crisis of survival for all of us, and it is a matter that involves us all."
"With regard to ambition, I would also like to repeat what I have said before: we need to be more ambitious, like we used to be."
"With regard to cutting emissions, we need to achieve 30% again, with there being no reason for us not to meet this commitment, and the same for temperature and global warming."
"We can be more ambitious and take medium- and long-term measures."
"To do this, it is not just enough to say it: we have to demonstrate it, and now is the time, because in my opinion, we cannot take tiny steps along this path."
"Mr President, I hope everyone enjoyed Cancún."
"It is a lovely place but I am a bit disappointed to see that none of them has a suntan."
"Well, I suppose that is to be expected really because, while many of you were out there lecturing us on how we need to change our lifestyles to combat global warming, it was actually the coldest week that Mexican city had seen for over a hundred years."
"Back in the UK, we have also had the spectacle of scientists trying to suggest that one of the coldest Novembers we have seen in the last hundred years was actually caused by global warming."
"Do these people think we were born yesterday?"
"This also explains why even more British people now believe that global warming is a scam and a way to raise taxes and exert control."
"But what have you actually achieved in Cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers' money in the guise of the Green Climate Fund, which I suggest will end up being a lucky bag for African dictators to buy themselves more Mercedes Benzes and private jets?"
"Personally, I think the name of the Green Climate Fund should be changed, and I think the 'Politics of Envy Fund' would be better and closer to the truth."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Every government in the world accepted at Cancún the science that man's activities are changing the climate."
"Every government in the world agreed that, if we do not take action, more action, we will not be able to prevent world temperatures rising by more than 2 °C. What does the honourable gentleman know that the rest of the world does not?"
"You are giving the game away there, because what you are talking about is world governments, politicians."
"We are talking about scientists here."
"Science is a slow process, evidence has to be studied and deciphered, but politics is a quicker game and politics is running ahead of the science; that is where the problem lies."
"The fact of the matter is that the globe is actually not warming; it has not warmed since 1998."
"So the game is up, people are finding out that you have a problem."
"What you are doing is conning people; it is a scam and the people are finding you out."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am slightly concerned about the turn the debate has taken at this point, because I believe that one of the best things about Cancún was the fact that we were able to debate and to reason without splitting into two camps - the doomsayers and the deniers - which was perhaps the worst outcome of the Copenhagen summit."
"In Copenhagen, all the main global players came together; thousands of non-governmental organisations came and demonstrated and, in the intense cold of Copenhagen, we managed to come home feeling overexcited and overheated, with the added disappointment of having failed."
"In Cancún - under the extremely capable chairmanship of Mexico, which I think everyone was able to single out and thank for its ability to manage such difficult negotiations, which had previously ended in stalemate - we saw, in fact, that the multilateral process is still alive."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we must not waste this new opportunity, created in Cancún, to be practical and to negotiate; we must not go back to being supporters at a football match, because we are actually talking about something serious here: we are talking about the future of our planet."
"I would therefore like to cite the words of an Italian climatologist, who is also very well known abroad, to support my view."
"That climatologist is Franco Prodi, brother of the former Prime Minister Romano Prodi, and he calls for calm, common sense and no divisions, arguing a point that we should all agree on: he says that it will take us many years yet to know as much about climate change as we know today about meteorology."
"We must therefore help science to speed up its work and to be in a position to provide reliable policy-making forecasts as soon as possible."
"In the meantime, the environmental protection of the planet must be at the heart of any serious environmental policy."
"I therefore believe that we can continue to work practically on this issue, and I thank everyone for how the work in Cancún has been pursued."
"(DA) Mr President, the American writer Mark Twain once said 'rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated'."
"Likewise, we could say that, fortunately, the rumours surrounding the UN climate process have been shown to be greatly exaggerated."
"The climate process is alive and well."
"The conference in Cancún showed that the UN can indeed deliver results."
"However, it is, of course, also clear that the major hurdle - the big question of how much to reduce CO2 by and when to do it in order to be able to keep the temperature rise below two degrees - is a question that still remains to be answered."
"There is hope, however, particularly if there is someone who will show leadership."
"We in the EU must show that leadership."
"We did so in Cancún, but we must also do so with regard to the reduction targets."
"We have now promised a reduction of 20% by 2020."
"Here in Parliament, we have also agreed that we believe we should go as far as 30%."
"When we met with delegations from other countries in Cancún, with NGOs and with the leaders of UN institutions, we emphasised very many times how important it was for us here in Parliament to have shown the way and how much we hoped that we, as a European community, would decide as quickly as possible to take on the commitment of the 30% reduction."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency for their success in Cancún, because in Cancún, we were able to applaud the Copenhagen trauma away."
"I was also applauding this trauma away because now we can finally look ahead."
"We can look forward again and we can look at what we need to achieve in Durban."
"Let us be honest: the most sensitive issues - the second commitment period, Kyoto, financing, the mitigation targets - are still on the table."
"We have a crucial year in front of us ahead of Durban."
"Let us be clear."
"China and the US are still there and those two big blocs are still not moving ahead very quickly."
"That is what we need in Durban."
"So I have a very simple question for the Commissioner."
"What is the EU concretely going to do to make sure that we get other global partners like Brazil and India on board with the Europeans to strive for an ambitious deal in Durban?"
"Speaking with one voice is very good, but now we have to get our proactive diplomacy in place."
"(SL) Mr President, on Saturday morning, I woke up with a sense of relief after learning that both agreements had been adopted and that, of course, gives me confidence that global warming can still be kept below the 2 °C limit."
"This has left a bitter aftertaste, however, because the actual process of negotiation in the international community is far too slow and we should have adopted such an agreement at least a year ago."
"Now we find ourselves under great time pressure, primarily because we still do not have any figures and because we still have no specific undertakings as to how individual countries are going to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."
"One positive thing, though, is that the document is comprehensive and that it actually covers all the priority areas which the European Union defined even before the negotiations had begun."
"My assessment is that the European Union was successful in the negotiations and that it was also sufficiently ambitious, because it was ambitious enough to retain its leading role and promote the negotiations."
"If we were too ambitious now, we would be left by the wayside, as happened to us last year."
"I also think that we have learned a lot from what happened last year."
"I would like us to take this knowledge with us to the next round of negotiations next year and I would like us to avoid changing that strategy."
"This year, we face a very serious task, particularly in our dealings with third countries."
"On that score, I think that the European Union must exploit every possibility at its disposal to help the United States, so that next year, we can obtain a much more ambitious undertaking from them than has been the case this year."
"We in the EU will have to focus, in particular, on implementing the legislation which we have adopted over the past few years, because there are many new things that we will actually have to start putting into practice."
"The European Union is still the only region in the world to have limited its emissions by law."
"(PT) Mr President, I have already said here that, whereas expectations for Copenhagen were very high at the start, expectations for Cancún were not very ambitious."
"As a result, Copenhagen was considered a failure and Cancún was viewed as progress."
"However, there is another difference in favour of Cancún, which also resulted from the good work done by the Mexican Presidency, which did everything it could to make the conference a success."
"The European Union did the work within its remit, and contributed to the progress that was made."
"This included confirmation of the limit of two degrees centigrade, and the creation of a Green Fund for supporting adaptation in developing countries and the fight against deforestation."
"I would like to emphasise something else that I have already referred to here, which is the re-establishment of confidence in multilateralism and in the possibility of obtaining a binding international agreement on climate change, which needs to be next year in Durban, and we need to make an effort for this to be achieved."
"Mr President, like many people, we are just relieved that there is good news."
"While it is understated, rather than overstated, you have made progress in a calm way because we had lower expectations."
"I want to deal with one particular issue and that is reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, the so-called REDD programme, which is a very important issue, but I am concerned about a lack of policy coherence in the Commission in relation to this issue."
"For example, the Trade Commissioner is currently trying to do a deal with the Mercosur countries which will result in increased beef production in these countries."
"That can only come from land that will be deforested, which will add to the climate change problem."
"I would urge the Commissioner to bring this message clearly to the College and to address it in a way that shows us as acting in a coherent way, as the European Union."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although Cancún in itself does not yet represent a turning point, without it, we would not have the chance to reach a turning point one year from now in Durban."
"I congratulate everyone who contributed to this achievement."
"I have been following this process from Brussels and from Budapest, and it is an enormous accomplishment that there will be a chance in one year's time in Durban to reach a comprehensive international agreement that will lay down mandatory commitments after strenuous work."
"It is an important step in the right direction that emerging economies such as China, Brazil and South Africa are committing themselves to the 2 °C target for the first time."
"Finally, I consider it very important that the European Union not only spoke with a single voice, but that it changed the attitude it had exhibited in Copenhagen, and treated the other countries as partners and with empathy, and this contributed considerably to the success of Cancún."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 16th climate change conference in Cancún ended this time, too, with a non-binding compromise called the 'balanced package'."
"There was the birth of the Green Climate Fund, which will cost the most developed countries USD 100 billion a year as from 2020, while USD 30 billion will be immediately allocated to 'fast-start' funding, USD 410 million of which Italy will have to find."
"Meanwhile, no demands have been made of the most highly polluting countries; on the contrary, China alone has announced that it is going to double its energy production by 2020 and, therefore, since it has decided to stick with 80% carbon to 20% other energy sources, it will also double its emissions."
"We believe it is unacceptable to keep asking our companies to make sacrifices for companies in third countries."
"It is vitally important for COP 17, next year, to reach an overall binding agreement on combating climate change that includes sanctions for those countries that still refuse to cooperate."
"(PT) Mr President, the noticeably lower expectations that we saw before the Cancún conference should not justify excessively optimistic discussions with regard to its results, and it should be regarded as a success even less so."
"If there were any consistency to the analysis criteria, we would have to acknowledge that the results were, as expected, sparse."
"Where is the replacement for the Kyoto Protocol that was absolutely necessary a year ago?"
"Where are the targets for reduction in line with the timeframes proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?"
"The European Union itself remains outside these timeframes, the United States' target is a 3-4% reduction compared to 1990 levels, which it took away from Copenhagen."
"Where is the serious discussion on the ineffectiveness and perversity of market instruments, such as the carbon market, of flexibility mechanisms like the clean development mechanism, of the hot air and other juggling tricks that serve more to open up good business prospects for a few people than to achieve reduction targets?"
"These are questions that we did not ask today, at a point at which one-third of the period defined as being quick-start has already passed."
"(LT) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the delegation from the European Parliament, the Member of the Commission and the whole of the European Union on speaking with one voice at Cancún."
"Last year, we deplored the results of Copenhagen, or, to be more precise, the lack of results."
"Today, we are happy with Cancún, but my joy is still slightly reserved, simply because I would like more."
"It is clear that negotiating is a huge and complex task."
"It is a real challenge when there are so many different positions."
"However, what worries me most is the image of this issue in society."
"Really, society is not being won over."
"The difficulties faced in reaching an agreement, by which I mean achieving legally valid measures, is something that is important to us all but it is becoming a tiresome issue."
"I agree with the Member of the Commission that we must do our homework, we ourselves must achieve the target of 20% by various means."
"Of course, it is always easier to point the finger at those who are perhaps not doing something and to say that maybe we do not need to do it either."
"In spite of what you said - that we managed to achieve something - I would still like to ask whether you really would not have expected a somewhat greater result in Cancún?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the entire EU delegation, who have helped to keep the process alive."
"However, we have not solved the real problems: firstly, we need to give political expression to the Bali Declaration - in particular, with regard to what we in Parliament have already called climate justice - and we need to generalise and simplify the emissions trading system, because it is inconceivable to have a market mechanism where half of the emissions quota is given away free."
"Secondly, I would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring, reporting and verifying, in particular, those of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) range of services, of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, can I first say thank you very much for the many kind comments, including those of Chris Davies, although I know even less than he about football so I could not follow the picture, but I guess it was a positive one!"
"Several have asked about the 30%."
"How are we now stepping up, where is this process and, Linda McAvan said, what are the prospects?"
"I think all of you here know what the process is now."
"We are now doing the analysis of individual Member States: what are the problems, what are the challenges, what are the co-benefits, what can we do?"
"Then we will also have a discussion on the 2050 low carbon strategy that we will present by March - including, as I said, the 2030 target because, if we know where we are going to be by 2050, it is also very clear that there are some trade-offs involved."
"The less we have done by 2020, the more we have to do afterwards, and the more likely that it will be expensive."
"That is the kind of discussion we are trying to get here in the spring, and I am pleased to see that more and more Member States have started to hold this discussion among themselves and also come forward with different signals on how they see this."
"Chris Davies asked about 2050 and the 50% and some other things that were not there. That was very much dealt with in a special group with some ministers discussing the shared vision."
"The Swedish Minister was one of the two ministers leading that group and I can say for sure that Europe was trying to push this very hard."
"You all know why it is difficult to achieve this, but that is one of the topics we still need to have on the table on our way forward to South Africa."
"It will have to be on the agenda."
"Ms del Castillo mentioned that Cancún has learned from Copenhagen."
"I would say yes, but mostly perhaps in the sense that people realised in the last 24 hours that if they did not show the will to compromise, there would be a real risk of not getting anything done, and the whole process would risk dying."
"That argument was not just a tactical thing, but was a real thing in the room where people knew that this would probably be the last chance for many of them to save the only process where everybody was sitting around the table."
"There was quite a lot of pressure there because of the experience in Copenhagen to show the necessary political will in Mexico."
"One could ask what exactly the EU is going to do to strive for a deal in Durban."
"I would say we will be doing the same as this year, where we have actually done a lot of outreach, a lot of proactive thinking, and also a lot of thinking about where the deal could be done."
"Those of you who were there also know that many of the texts and much of the input were also due to a lot of European experts and a lot of European contributions, and we should do exactly the same this coming year."
"We should also build on what has been achieved in the Cartagena process in which 25 countries - developing and developed countries alike - really want to move forward."
"We will continue that work."
"We gained a lot of benefit from having this process in Cancún, because we were coordinating a lot across different regional groups."
"That will be one of the first things: we will try to get people together in the Cartagena Group and work there with them, as well as working with a lot of others."
"Then there was the question about the treaty that should replace the Kyoto Protocol."
"It is not there yet because the world does not agree on it, but this is definitely not because of the European Union."
"I would re-state that, had it not been for the European Union signalling its willingness to taking a second commitment period, had we said the same as other Kyoto parties in Cancún, then any prospect of having a legally binding deal by now would have been dead."
"Finally, Ms Morkūnaitwas asking if we did not expect a bit more from Cancún, and I would say no, actually not."
"In the last hours there, I sat with a check list."
"Sometimes you should take care not to get carried away when you are taking part in something."
"You think that when you can get some things done, maybe you could also get other things done that you knew before you left home you would never get."
"When I sat with that check list, I must say that the list of elements we wanted to see in there was in there."
"Of course, there are always things that you do not get, but in truth we knew, for instance, that the second commitment period could not be for Cancún, so we just wanted to save the prospect of having it and continuing to build on what we have."
"An adaptation framework, a technology framework, a forestry framework, all the elements from the Copenhagen Accord, the prospect of still having a legally binding deal and some substantial progress on MRV/ICA and a number of other issues, plus the fact that we now have all parties subscribing to the view that we have not all delivered enough together - I think that if we had discussed that result as we did before we left for Cancún, most of you would probably have agreed that it would be a good outcome."
"A final word."
"Now we have to think very carefully about the strategy for the way ahead."
"Many of us will need a break for Christmas and the New Year, but early next year, we should continue the very strong dialogue between Council, Commission and the European Parliament and come back to one another after we have done some reflecting and have digested the outcome of Cancún."
"As I said at the beginning, it is going to be a very difficult year, but we should build on the experiences we had here."
"If Europe sets a clear strategy, then we can actually move things in the right direction, and although that is not going to be less challenging for Durban, I am sure that we can do this."
"Maybe we just need a rest first and then come back to the dialogue in early 2011."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for making many positive comments about the agreement reached in Cancún."
"You all know that Cancún is a pragmatic, but very important step in climate policy and the climate debate."
"You know that the principle that we should, eventually, reach a global, legally-binding agreement, was retained in the Council conclusions adopted last October."
"However, we were all aware that it would be impossible to secure a global deal in Mexico and that had also been determined in advance."
"For this reason, we opted for a number of balanced partial agreements."
"They are also there and, as the Commissioner has said, the points that we felt were important in order to achieve that balance on the European Union's part have also emerged from the Cancún conference."
"We should also give the European Union credit for taking a very clear and transparent stance, a stance that has been incorporated in the Council conclusions and that was also defended with a single voice."
"Everyone from the Commission and the European Parliament made a very positive contribution to the promotion of this stance and, on the part of the Council, we did our utmost to ensure that we explained that stance as far as we could."
"Sometimes, it was really necessary to continue to emphasise that: what the content of those conclusions was and what the European Union's intention behind that stance was."
"We were building bridges; in Mexico, we also received many positive reactions to the fact that the European Union had taken the lead and that we had genuinely tried to bring several different positions closer to each other."
"We played that role well and I think that this was also clear to the whole world."
"Commissioner, it is true that we now have to take stock of one or two things, but that does not detract from the fact that we now have to proceed fairly rapidly."
"I can tell you that, as early as next Monday, we will be having an exchange of views in the Council about the outcome of Cancún."
"I also think that it is a good thing that, here in Parliament, we are already exchanging views on this issue."
"That said, it is true that we definitely need to develop a strategy and to do so as soon as possible."
"The Council has also decided to take up the debate about the 30% reduction in the spring."
"We have asked the Commission to carry out a second screening, so that we know what that 30% reduction would entail at Member State level, and the Council has agreed to reopen the debate in the spring."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to thank everyone once again for your cooperation and, in particular, Commissioner Connie Hedegaard, for the very pleasant and constructive way in which she has worked with us, and for your efforts, which led to some excellent achievements in Cancún."
"This would not have been possible without constructive cooperation on everyone's part and if the European Union had not been able to imprint such a clear hallmark on the agreement reached in Cancún."
"I therefore thank you very warmly for that."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Many view the outcome of the Cancún climate change conference, which ended last week, as a success, a breakthrough, the return of hope."
"I am, however, of the opinion that we cannot speak of success until a legally binding international agreement has been concluded as a continuation of the Kyoto Protocol, which will expire in 2012 - an agreement on which basis sanctions can be imposed."
"No decision has been reached about such an agreement in Cancún."
"In fact, some countries would rather have the Protocol itself abolished."
"The question of the usability after 2013 of the Kyoto quota surplus, which is of key importance to Hungary and considered to be a national asset, will thus remain unresolved until the climate change summit to be held in South Africa in 2011."
"The possibility still exists that Eastern European countries will inequitably and unjustly be deprived of the reward they would have received for fulfilling their actual emission reduction commitments in the Kyoto system, while infringing parties will face no penalties whatsoever."
"Moreover, the USA and China, the biggest emitters, are still not parties to the Kyoto Protocol, and therefore, the results we will be able to achieve in halting global warming will remain minuscule."
"Hence, as long as we do not have a legally binding international agreement that is able to both punish the bad students and reward the good ones, we can by no means speak of success."
"Mr President, I would congratulate the President of the Cancún conference on the transparent negotiations during such a complex process."
"Although it could have gone further, this agreement seems to be the best possible one at this time."
"The Kyoto Protocol could still be extended, which is positive: there will be a lot of pressure in Durban next year, given that the only binding agreement on climate change will be expiring, but it is very important that the agreement reached in Copenhagen now becomes an official United Nations document, as it is supported by all countries except Bolivia."
"I am glad that many of the socialist positions supported here in this House were introduced into the text, such as the creation of a 'Global Green Fund' to help developing countries adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects."
"I also applaud all of the countries that agreed to maintain the proposal of 1.5 degrees, a more ambitious objective on the table for the next summit."
"This is a very important signal, and the next step will be to ensure that it is reflected in CO2 reduction targets."
"After lengthy negotiations, the United Nations climate change conference in Cancún has reached a positive compromise."
"The outcome is no record achievement, but it is an important step towards combating climate change."
"Progress has been made in all the areas which appear for the first time in a UN document."
"I welcome the decisions made as they will facilitate the negotiations' advancement in the period ahead and will ensure significant progress is made, particularly with regard to the elements aimed at the developing countries and the countries most exposed to the impact of climate change."
"Furthermore, I support the narrowing of the gap between developed countries and undeveloped regions by granting financial and technical assistance."
"I think that this summit marks a crucial juncture where our negotiators have paved the way for an agreement to be signed next year in Durban in South Africa."
"I wish to congratulate the European Parliament delegation for the efforts it made and the success achieved."
"The outcome of the climate summit in Cancún could hardly be described as a great achievement."
"However, it is better than nothing."
"Some concrete steps have been taken, for example, in the fight against deforestation, and the go-ahead has been given for the establishment of a USD 100 billion climate fund."
"The whole thing, however, is moving at a terribly slow and tiring pace."
"It resembles nothing so much as the dancing procession of Echternach."
"Meanwhile, the global warming clock quietly ticks on."
"What was Europe's role in this story?"
"The EU has certainly learned from the mistakes of last year's Copenhagen conference."
"In Cancún, Europe was at the heart of the negotiations and acted as a united front."
"The entire world has its eyes on the EU model and looks on it with admiration, because we have the most progressive and binding agreements."
"Europe is a role model when it comes to climate."
"We have to hold on firmly to that leading role over the coming years."
"It clearly marks us apart from almost all other continents, in a positive way."
"It is an enormous asset in terms of our image and, at the same time, it entails major economic and social benefits."
"Mr President, I have been monitoring international climate negotiations for the last 15 years, and I am particularly happy with the agreements reached in Cancún."
"The decisions adopted represent real progress in negotiations."
"The main elements of the Copenhagen Agreement are now under the aegis of the UN."
"The United Nations has regained its credibility as a forum for drawing up multilateral climate agreements."
"Mexico organised a participative and transparent conference."
"The EU played a leading role."
"I would like to highlight the efficient management of tasks by the European Commission and the Belgian Presidency."
"There was significant progress with regard to technology, forests and adaptation."
"In particular, I welcome the creation of a Climate Fund."
"On the basis of the results of Cancún, hard work will be needed to make a success of the Durban conference in 2011."
"The Cancún conference has been dubbed a success and that is the right choice of word, considering that nothing had been expected to come of it."
"Nevertheless, it is important for the EU that we state the facts: nothing has stirred in the matter of emissions cuts and there have been no pledges made to reduce them."
"We have no global agreement in sight and we have nothing to give us cause to tighten up the EU's own, unilateral target to reduce them from 20% to 30%."
"At Cancún, Parliament's delegation met Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, who said, in all seriousness, that Europe has only benefited from the 20% target: it has apparently given us a boost and improved our competitiveness."
"That is why he supported the idea of making the target more stringent still."
"I would like now to call on all those companies involved in global business, and which believe that they are exposed to carbon leakage, to tell Achim Steiner and other similar influential leaders of organisations about the financial realities that you face."
"Show them the figures for the direct and indirect rise in costs due to emissions trading, if you disagree with the system."
"It is not right, as far as European citizens and workers are concerned, if our key decision makers, even the Commission, from which Steiner probably got his information, are living in a fantasy world where their feet do not touch the ground."
"Cancún's success lay in the fact that political pride was saved."
"It was agreed that there would be an agreement."
"We realise that the climate hype is abating and that climate change is becoming an ordinary, everyday issue."
"It is slipping out of the limelight and perhaps that is a good thing."
"Let us get back to a sensible, comprehensive policy of environmental protection."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0655/2010)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Subject: Protecting women's health"
"The Commission has adopted a new strategy on gender equality for the period 2010-2015."
"This strategy refers to the social divide that exists between women and men and indicates that women continue to be at greater risk of poverty than men."
"Women are at risk of losing their jobs faster than men."
"At present, many women are employed in sectors of the labour market that pay low wages, and too few of them attain positions of responsibility."
"The rate of employment among women is low because of child rearing, so that women's pensions are lower than those of men."
"In addition, it is not uncommon for women to lack social cover."
"The strategy provides for no specific measure or means to ensure that women's health is protected."
"Does the Commission intend to issue guidelines or proposals relating to the protection of women's health?"
"Member of the Commission. - Women and men are exposed to health risks in different ways with, consequently, different health outcomes."
"Women live, on average, six years longer than men but most of these additional years are lived in worse health."
"Certain diseases, such as osteoporosis, have a much higher incidence among women."
"This is why the EU strategy for Equality between Women and Men (2010-2015), which the Commission has recently adopted, points to the need for medical research and healthcare to reflect these differences."
"The strategy stresses that health services need to continue the process of adaptation to properly reflect the specific needs of women and men."
"The strategy for these actions, specifically targeting women's health, includes awareness-raising seminars on women's health and exchanging best practices on gender-specific health policies."
"We are not starting from scratch here."
"The EU Health strategy, adopted three years ago, already signalled the need to take gender-related issues into account in health policy making."
"To this end, the Community health programme has supported many projects on women's health aimed at promoting a better understanding and recognition of women's health needs."
"A good example of how the EU can help Member States improve women's health is cancer screening."
"It is estimated that 32 000 deaths from breast cancer alone could be prevented each year across the European Union if effective national screening programmes for breast cancer were implemented."
"This is why the Commission developed European guidelines on breast cancer screening."
"Finally, I am pleased to say that earlier this year, the Commission published a report on women's health, which contributes to raising awareness of the need for policies that are more responsive to gender concerns."
"(LT) I would also like to check something."
"Do we have sufficient data on the protection of women's health in the Member States?"
"Do we know the impact that this major economic and financial crisis, in particular, has had on women's health?"
"Should we not also examine the impact that poverty has on women's health, in particular, that of elderly women?"
"Are high quality health care services accessible to women living in poverty?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is trying to get as much information and feedback as possible and to set up a statistical base on all health issues."
"Naturally, our level of accuracy depends a lot on the response and feedback that we receive from the various Member States."
"I agree that we should continue to seek information and to see how health, especially the health of women, is affected by poverty."
"But health and poverty are interrelated; this is not gender based."
"In fact, we find that health is usually at risk in areas of poverty."
"We are also taking action vis-à-vis the elderly."
"As you know, the Commission has now launched an initiative, namely the innovative partnerships."
"The first pilot project on this innovative partnership will be healthy and active ageing."
"I am sure that this will affect the health of our citizens of both genders."
"(RO) At the moment, there are 120 million citizens in the European Union exposed to the risk of poverty."
"Women have obviously been hit very hard by the economic crisis and are more exposed to the risk of poverty, especially in the case of single-parent families."
"Healthcare systems are suffering a great deal due to the economic crisis."
"Budgets have been cut and large institutions in this sector have even been closed."
"I would like to ask you what measures you have in mind for us to ensure that the measures for the early screening of cervical or breast cancer will be available to all women, regardless of their social or material situation, and especially to ensure that we will have a fair healthcare system, offering good quality services throughout the entire European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Again, we repeat here that healthcare and health delivery are a competence of the Member States."
"The Commission has, in fact, issued its guidelines on breast screening and we have been pushing Member States to abide by these guidelines and introduce breast-screening programmes into their countries as fast as possible."
"I can say that in most countries, we do have adequate - and very good - breast-screening programmes which are bearing results; other countries, unfortunately, are still a little slow."
"I can assure you that, in all the contacts that we have with the Member States, this is one of the priority areas that we discuss."
"Subject: European Parliament declaration of 23 June 2010 on setting up a European early warning system (EWS) for paedophiles and sex offenders"
"On 23 June 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution 'setting up a European early warning system (EWS) for paedophiles and sex offenders'."
"The Commission had already, on 22 May 2007, published a communication entitled 'Towards a general policy on the fight against cyber crime'."
"Parliament called on the Council and the Commission to act on the Commission communication of May 2007 and also to implement Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks, and to extend its scope with a view to setting rules on preservation of the data of anyone who has uploaded Internet content, so as to enable the police and judiciary to tackle online child pornography and sex offending rapidly and effectively."
"Would the Commission please outline the action taken on this resolution?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am strongly committed to the fight against child abuse and, specifically, child sexual abuse."
"On 29 March 2010, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on child sexual abuse and exploitation and child pornography."
"This ambitious text covers prosecution of offenders, protection of victims and prevention of offences."
"To take account of risks brought about by technological developments, the proposal introduces, in particular, new criminal offences such as grooming, viewing child pornography without downloading files, online sexual abuse or advertising the possibility to abuse children, for example, through Internet forums."
"Special investigative tools should be made available, such as undercover operations for the police to infiltrate sex offender circles, and special investigative units should analyse child pornography material to identify child victims."
"Member States should also put in place national systems to block access to Internet pages containing child pornography and undertake actions to remove the content at source."
"We have looked carefully at the European Parliament declaration of 23 June 2010, and I would be interested to know about the honourable Member's proposal for an early warning system."
"I have also taken note of the proposal to extend the scope of the Data Retention Directive in order to retain data about searches made by users for child pornography material and child sex abuse content uploaded on the Internet or messages used to groom children online."
"The Data Retention Directive obliges communication and network service providers to retain traffic and location data and data about subscribers."
"It does not extend to information about content."
"Content can be obtained and stored in the context of criminal investigations by means of the instrument known as lawful interception."
"Lawful interception is solely governed by national law and differs across Member States, but in general, it can be used only if a law enforcement authority has indications that a specific criminal activity is being committed and requires further investigation."
"This investigative tool lies outside of the scope of the Data Retention Directive."
"Lawful interception occurs in the context of a criminal investigation which supposes the existence of a suspect."
"The Data Retention Directive, on the contrary, obliges operators to retain certain categories of data irrespective of whether the data holders are suspect or not."
"Extending the Data Retention Directive to huge volumes of personal and content-related data such as Internet searches for different key words in different languages, content uploaded, messages exchanged and the elements necessary to identify all users would have to withstand a necessity and proportionality case which has not yet been made."
"Such an extension would apply to content uploaded by everyone on every platform, at any given time and on every topic."
"The proposal put forward by the honourable Member raises serious concerns about its compliance with the principle of proportionality, even if its purpose is legitimate and deserves our full attention."
"The Commission believes that its recent proposal for a directive would be a more suitable instrument to achieve our common objective of protecting children from child sex offenders."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like the floor for just a few seconds because I am satisfied with the response and I am grateful to the Commissioner for it."
"I am glad that work is also being done to tackle the problem at its root."
"With reference to the declaration adopted on 23 June 2010, I would just like to point out that specific reference was made to uploaded data, not to the downloading of material from websites."
"This is because we believe, in fact, that the right to privacy of search engine users should also be duly taken into account."
"Nevertheless, I think that more can be done - that much more can still be done - because if, on the subject of the proportionality principle, citizens have no qualms in submitting to searches before boarding a flight, since they are aware of the superior privacy protection afforded to passengers at the time of the search, there is also every chance of a satisfactory compromise being reached to protect minors in this area, too."
"I would like to return to the statement that Parliament adopted on 23 June 2010."
"You will recall that the statement refers mainly to the creation of a fast and effective warning system against paedophiles."
"My question in relation to this concerns another issue - should individual police forces not create databases of convicted paedophiles, under the aegis of the European Union, since the police forces of other Member States could make use of these databases created in each individual Member State?"
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Poland recently introduced pharmaceutical castration for paedophiles and rapists, using hormone treatment to repress their sexual appetite, following the arrest of a forty-five year old man who had had two children by his underage daughter."
"This measure, as you can image, has provoked intense debate and reaction in Poland as to whose rights take precedence: the rights of society, which expects to be protected from rapists, or the rights of people convicted of sexual crimes, who may be subject to a punishment that many consider inhumane."
"Has the Commission taken a position on these issues and on the legalisation of chemical castration for sexual crimes?"
"Member of the Commission. - As I said at the beginning of my speech, one of the best tools for fighting child pornography and child sex abuse is the swift adoption of the Commission proposal of March 2010, the one against child sex abuse."
"The Commission is looking forward to seeing the draft report of the European Parliament and to starting trialogues."
"I count also on the Member States and the European Parliament to have a final text that will be essential to fight these crimes and I would like to draw your attention again to the principle of proportionality, which I think connects with the latest question on this matter."
"Member of the Commission. - Over the last two years, the number of young unemployed people in the European Union has increased by one million."
"There are now five million young people under the age of 25 who cannot find a job."
"The Commission is keenly aware of the difficulties facing young people on the job market today."
"Too many are on short-term contracts which offer slim opportunities for improvement, however well qualified the individuals might be."
"What is more, some groups have special difficulty in accessing jobs and staying in the labour market."
"They include young people from migrant backgrounds and those from ethnic minorities like the Roma."
"At the same time, demand for highly qualified people is projected to rise by almost 16 million and demand for people with medium-level qualifications by more than 3.5 million. This represents a big employment opportunity for young people and we must make sure that young people can take full advantage of it."
"The Europe 2020 strategy, which lays out the EU's detailed plans for growth and jobs for the next decade, lays special emphasis on young people and sets clear targets for educational attainment."
"In September, the Commission presented a set of policy initiatives for young people called 'Youth on the Move'."
"It sets out an agenda for improving education and employment for our young people over the next decade."
"The Commission recently presented another flagship initiative, an 'Agenda for new skills and jobs'."
"The Commission encourages the introduction of a youth guarantee to ensure that all young people are in a job, further education or activation measures within four months of leaving school."
"Another point is the need to reduce labour market segmentation in line with the common flexicurity policies."
"We propose that Member States with segmented labour markets should consider introducing open-ended contracts with a sufficiently long probation period and a gradual increase in protection rights."
"We also need to foster greater labour mobility and encourage innovation."
"Two instruments that will help here are the EU job mobility scheme - 'Your first EURES job' - and the European Vacancy Monitor."
"Your first EURES job will promote youth labour mobility and the European Vacancy Monitor will allow young people and job counsellors to see where there are jobs across the Union and what skills are needed."
"Meanwhile, the European Progress Microfinance Facility will provide support for young entrepreneurs who cannot find alternative funding to set up businesses."
"Of course, there is no single solution to the problems facing us, but we can learn a lot from each other by exchanging experience."
"The Youth Employment Framework we propose gives guidance on how policy makers, stakeholders and institutions can help things along."
"Public employment services, the social partners, employers and support services for young people at local level all have a crucial role to play."
"We will work to encourage more exchanges of experience and good practice among them at EU level."
"I firmly believe that, by pooling resources at EU level, we can help develop and promote successful policies to support young people."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied with the Commissioner's answer."
"In view of the global economic situation and the crisis, which has made conditions on the labour market much worse, affecting the most vulnerable group, namely young people, I would ask the Commissioner to give his verdict on the need for more emphasis to be given to European instruments such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which we need in order to retrain workers made redundant for reasons associated with the economic crisis and, hence, also as a result of globalisation."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to your reply to my honourable friend's question, but I should like to bring your attention to the following, to what is happening on the ground."
"The figures for the unemployed in Greece in 2009 were 20% for young unemployed men and 34% for young unemployed women."
"This situation got worse after the International Monetary Fund had become involved."
"At the same time, two programmes funded by the European Union through the National Strategic Reference Framework have take-up rates of 1.9 and 3.2."
"So the question is this: why this low take-up rate in Greece?"
"Is the Greek Government to blame?"
"And secondly, is the Commission considering any additional measures to address this employment problem?"
"Briefly, this is a very important, if sad, topic."
"I know that in my own country, 20% of young people are unemployed and emigration, which had finished, is starting again with what they call 'the brain drain' including, among others, members of my own family."
"And, following on from the last question, are some countries more receptive than others to the measures being proposed by the European Union, and what are the barriers being put in their place?"
"Member of the Commission. - I would like to thank you for the comments and for drawing attention to other funds apart from those I already mentioned: the Microfinance Facility, the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"They can also play a role, the latter especially in cases of unexpected mass redundancies which particularly affect people in manufacturing industry, but can affect other industries as well."
"We certainly believe that these funds are helpful and we believe they need secure funding for the next financial period or the next programming period, because unfortunately, even if prosperity is coming, we will have to anticipate significant redundancies in certain cases due to restructuring and cross-border relocations."
"We have to be attentive to specific cases."
"There is now an emerging divide within the European Union - a kind of dualism - with a core region where there is already GDP and job growth, but also countries like Greece and Ireland that continue to struggle under the pressure of the financial market."
"I recently held personal negotiations with Minister Katseli in which we discussed how the European Social Fund could be used more effectively in Greece."
"There have been several reasons in the recent past, including the crisis itself, difficulties in cofinancing and certain administrative difficulties that made it difficult to draw from the Social Fund in a robust way, but I can assure you that my services are working very hard and very closely with the Greek managing authority to find appropriate funding opportunities from the ESF in this period."
"I believe it really helps if we manage to fund in the appropriate way."
"It is true that in emergency situations, it is even more difficult and there is a need and also the room to restructure available ESF funding."
"For the longer term, I think we have to tailor the Social Fund in a way that can be more effective in specific situations and in counterbalancing the impact of uneven economic development inside the Union, which has already manifested itself in terms of demography as well, triggering migration flows that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in the previous period."
"We will pay attention to this and connect that with labour market trends."
"Colleagues, we now have 40 minutes until the closing time of 20:30 and so I propose to divide that time between Vice-President Reding and Mr Füle."
"The first question is to Mrs Reding."
"Colleagues, please make the calculation as to whether or not your question will be reached."
"I apologise that we have a short time tonight because of the overrunning of the last debate but I intend to stop at 20:30 to allow the interpreters to have their supper."
"I personally will be here till midnight."
"Part two"
"Subject: Gender equality in decision making"
"In view of the fact that that women occupy only one seat in four in national parliaments and governments, that only 10% of the directors of major listed companies in the EU are women and that only 3% of such companies are chaired by women, the Commission states, in its strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015, that it will consider 'initiatives', 'monitor progress' and 'support efforts' to promote women's participation."
"However, in order to combat this glass ceiling, targeted action is required now."
"Does the Commission intend to bring in quotas to ensure a greater role for women in the decision-making process?"
"Does it intend to encourage more actively the Member States to develop their childcare systems to enable mothers to strike a better balance between work and family life?"
"What other measures does it intend to take, notably to combat stereotypes?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - This is one of my favourite topics, by the way, which is why I am going to consider all legislative and non-legislative measures to redress the persistent inequalities in decision making."
"The latest figures are not very positive, which is why we really need to do something - most of all because the figures persistently remain at the same non-positive level."
"This is one of the five priorities of the Commission strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015, which I have already presented in this House, and I have also already announced that it would be good to have more women on boards and in management."
"That is why we need to speak with those who have responsibility."
"I will invite the leaders of the big listed companies to sit around a table in March to promote a dialogue with stakeholders in the business sector to get things moving."
"If things do not move, I will move to have targeted initiatives to improve the situation."
"On the question of data collection and the dissemination of comparable data, we know perfectly well that there is also a deficiency here."
"We do now have the gender equality agency in Vilnius, so we can start to rely on more serious data, comparable data and, in particular, a database on women and men in decision making, and regular reporting."
"It is true that the lack of a high quality care infrastructure is one of the reasons, but not the only one, why so few women are in decision-making posts, so we will have a look at the Member States' performance here."
"Over the period 2007-2013, half a billion euro will be available from the Structural Funds to develop childcare facilities and another EUR 2.4 billion to fund measures to facilitate women's access to employment and to reconcile work and family, including access to childcare."
"When you hear me saying this, you will understand that I am not very impressed by what many Member Sates are doing at the level of childcare, so this is also high on the political agenda."
"My colleague, Mr Andor, looks at these figures and actions in the Europe 2020 strategy, and I really am convinced that Member States should step up their efforts in this area."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response and, above all, for your commitment."
"I knew that this was one of your favourite subjects."
"In particular, I would stress the need to encourage a balance between working life and private life, for men as well as for women; it is only in this way that we will reach absolute equality."
"More than half of the Member States have not attained the objective of creating childcare facilities for at least 90% of children between three years of age and school age and for 33% of children under three years of age."
"I therefore wanted to ask you if you are intending to take retaliatory measures, or even to penalise the Member States that do not attain this objective."
"The word 'quota' is mentioned in the question and I did not hear a response specifically to that question about quotas."
"Secondly, I would regret it if children were seen as a 'problem' in relation to the participation of women in the workforce."
"Children are children for a very short space of time and women can contribute at all age levels."
"So please do not just focus on children as a problem."
"The problem is not children - in fact, what is a problem is that we need more children in the European Union."
"The problem is: how do women break through the glass ceiling that the questioner has recognised?"
"(RO) Although women account for more than 55% of university graduates, we still fail to find them in management positions in public institutions or often not in businesses either."
"In addition, there is also this 17% gender pay gap."
"I would like to ask you to consider some comprehensive programmes and even tighter controls on Member States regarding childcare facilities."
"If we fail to create a work-life balance, we will not be able to encourage young mothers to pursue a professional career so that they can attain a management position as well."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I fully agree with the analysis that many Member States are missing the Barcelona targets."
"Only eight Member States meet the Barcelona targets for children aged 0 to 3 years and only seven Member States meet the targets for children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age."
"As Commissioner responsible for equality, I am not responsible for social affairs and I know that all these questions are on the agenda for the Europe 2020 strategy."
"We will certainly have to look at all these questions because the problems are going to become worse with the ageing population."
"Who is going to care for the elderly, too?"
"Women are going to have not only the babies to look after, but also the elderly."
"So we really have to have a look at that and also analyse why the Member States are not taking up the money which is available in order to have more childcare facilities."
"Concerning quotas, in my answer I did not, I think, use the word quotas, but I have said very clearly that if there is no progress, then I will do something and I have said clearly what I mean by progress."
"Progress means having on the boards of publicly listed companies 30% women by 2015 and 40% by 2020."
"I hope that we can reach those targets without the need for strong intervention at European level."
"If not, well, quotas are on the agenda and, while there are those who may not believe that I will do what I say, I am known for normally doing things which I have announced."
"That is also why businesses now have a big chance to make it unnecessary for me to intervene, because if they do things right, we do not need to intervene."
"I completely agree with the figures which have been quoted."
"We women make up 60% of new university graduates; that means we should also somehow hold 60% of the management positions, but we are far from reaching that level."
"That is the reason why we need to help women to get into management positions."
"There are many reasons why they do not make it: one is culture and that is the most difficult to change."
"That is also the reason why women in decision making is one of the priorities of the Gender Equality strategy, just as is the gender pay gap - 17% on average at the European level, some countries being very high, some being very low."
"Next year, we are going to start a campaign to raise awareness of these facts."
"For instance, there is a very nice project in Germany which we could generalise to other countries where, in public spaces, there is a meter measuring how much longer a woman has to work in order to reach the same medium salary as a man."
"Of course, we also have to get the social partners into this discussion and we have to have transparency measures implemented."
"All this is on the agenda of the strategy for women and we are going to put that in place step by step - not in order to just speak about it, but to change things."
"Subject: Costs for Member States arising from interpretation, translation and information rights in criminal proceedings"
"The regulation on interpretation and translation rights recently adopted by the Council and on the information rights of defendants which is currently being examined are two basic measures of the road map proposed by the Commission to strengthen defendants' rights of defence."
"Will the Commission say:"
"Given that it is foreseen, inter alia, that Member States shall bear the entire translation, interpretation and information costs, what are the expected financial impact on and financial burden for Member States arising from the provision of such services?"
"Member States, such as Greece and Malta, receive large numbers of illegal migrants and are expected to face particularly heavy costs from the provision of translation, interpretation and information services relating to criminal charges and the training of police officers and prosecutors."
"Is the Commission expected to contribute to help these countries and provide them with financial assistance so that they do not have to bear the entire cost of providing these services to illegal migrants involved in legal proceedings?"
"If so, which criteria will be used to fix the level of such aid and determine which countries will be eligible?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - When I became Commissioner, I saw that a great deal had been done in the past on questions of security and very little had been done on questions of rights."
"That is why, having the tools of the Lisbon Treaty at my disposal and also having the Stockholm Strategy, where many points on how we have to advance have been put into place, we decided to act, and we acted very swiftly."
"First of all, let me thank the Parliament for the excellent work which has been done on the procedural rights."
"We have already come to an agreement on the right of a person before the court to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings."
"We are making good progress on the directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings: the famous letter of rights."
"If we want to become the continent of rights, we will have to have the procedural rights established little by little."
"Those come at a price but they are indispensable to safeguarding the rights of the defence for European citizens and also to making mutual recognition function properly."
"Before we make any proposal, we always make a thorough impact assessment of the financial consequences of the EU legislation for Member States."
"Only then do we submit legislative proposals."
"This exercise was, of course, based on the figures provided by the administration of the Member States."
"These figures reveal that the additional costs to be borne by Member States should not be too great."
"Regarding the right to interpretation and translation, the directive simply reiterates an existing obligation of the Member States already in the Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe, so it is not asking for something extraordinary."
"It is just asking for something very basic."
"The Member States - and there are many who already comply with the Strasbourg Court obligations - are unlikely to have to incur any expenses in addition to what they already spend on this."
"Regarding the right to information, the biggest share of expenditure will be in the initial one-off cost of drawing up a letter of rights."
"Here, the Commission has already submitted a model as an annex to the directive in all the EU languages."
"Member States just have to take this model and copy it, so the cost to them will not be very great."
"The Commission does not have a budget containing any appropriation which would allow the institution to provide financial assistance to Member States to meet those expenses."
"If Member States make a calculation taking in the risk of a miscarriage of justice, the legal remedies and the retrials, the loss of reputation of a justice system as a whole and sometimes the damages awarded by the Strasbourg Court or by domestic courts, then it is much more expensive not to have these basic rights financed by a responsible state."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply."
"You are absolutely right in what you say and I cannot but agree with you."
"However, I would clarify and ask once again: for countries such as Greece or Malta, for example, where you know how much pressure we are under both from illegal immigrants and from people who may need help in criminal proceedings, if, in addition to the standard letter and various standard documents at their disposal, defendants need any of the documents in their case file translated which, as you know, is a specialist job which differs from case to case, do we estimate what the cost will be, especially for some small countries under such huge pressure and with such massive problems?"
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for her answer as well."
"Like my previous colleague, I think one of the biggest difficulties that should be recognised is that - whilst we all understand the importance of access to justice in a format which is understandable to the person seeking the justice - these new rules cannot be used as a legal mechanism to delay further hearing of important cases, whether it is for deportation under immigration rules or whether it is to challenge certain criminal records and so on."
"Is there any piece within the legislation or the proposal that would allow for the court to ignore the necessity for every single document to be translated into the language?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I can only repeat that the cost of an improper functioning of justice, or the cost of not treating human beings as human beings should be treated in a Europe of rights, is much higher than the cost of investing in those basic rights."
"Of course, it is much more difficult for countries which are very much below the minimum threshold to reach that threshold, and it will be much easier for countries which already have a certain level of rights to do so."
"Is that a reason for not acting?"
"On the contrary."
"We have been analysing the possible costs for the different Member States on the basis also of the pressure under which they are operating."
"It is not a question of asylum alone."
"It is also a question of criminal proceedings, for example, in the case of an illegal immigrant charged with a criminal offence being brought before a court."
"We have not made it compulsory to have all the documents translated, only those which are essential to enable the person being prosecuted to understand what is happening to him or to her."
"By the way, the great majority of people affected will not be illegal immigrants."
"The largest groups affected are people travelling to another Member State, such as tourists for instance, or people who live in another Member State but who do not speak the language of that country."
"So this will provide a basic benefit for millions of European citizens."
"Imagine that you are travelling from Strasbourg to a neighbouring country."
"You are involved in a traffic accident."
"You have injured someone."
"You are taken to the police, you are taken to court and you have no idea what you are being accused of."
"In those circumstances, you would be very glad at least to know what you were charged with so that you could try to defend yourself."
"I think that is a basic human right and we should consider the cost to society of not putting this basic human right into practice."
"I am sorry but the questions by Ms Harkin, Mr Cashman, Mr Mirsky and Mr Crowley will not be reached tonight."
"They will receive an answer in writing."
"As I said earlier, we are running late because of the over-running of the previous debate."
"We now move to questions to Mr Füle."
"Subject: Enlargement of the EU to include Turkey"
"Could the Commission please outline the current situation regarding Turkey's application to join the EU?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Helsinki European Council of December 1999 granted Turkey the status of candidate country and accession negotiations with Turkey were opened in October 2005."
"The Commission has reported regularly to the Council and Parliament on Turkish progress towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria."
"On 9 November, the Commission published the 2010 progress report on Turkey."
"The report covers the period from early October 2009 to October 2010 and progress is measured on the basis of decisions taken, legislation adopted and measures implemented."
"Turkey has pursued its political reform process, in particular, through the reform of its constitution, and continues to sufficiently fulfil the political criteria."
"The constitutional amendments adopted by referendum on 12 September created the conditions for progress in a number of areas such as the judiciary, fundamental rights and public administration."
"The implementation of the constitutional changes in a transparent and inclusive way is essential for Turkish progress."
"The democratic opening aimed notably at addressing the Kurdish issue has not yet met expectations."
"The decision of the constitutional court to close down the Democratic Society Party and a surge in PKK terrorist attacks also undermined this policy."
"Significant reforms are still required on fundamental rights, in particular, in the area of freedom of expression."
"The high number of legal suits against journalists and undue pressure on the media undermine freedom of the press in practice."
"With regard to regional issues and international obligations, it is now urgent that Turkey fulfils its obligation of full non-discriminatory implementation of additional protocols to the association agreement."
"The Commission has recommended that, if there is no progress on this issue, the measures adopted by the European Union in 2006 should be upheld."
"This will affect the overall progress of the negotiations."
"Turkey has continued to express public support for the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem."
"However, there has been no progress towards normalisation of bilateral relations with the Republic of Cyprus."
"As regards the economic criteria for accession to the European Union, Turkey continues to be a functioning market economy that can cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union."
"Turkey has witnessed strong economic growth in 2010, recouping the losses incurred during the financial crisis, but the process of privatisation and structural reform needs to continue."
"Turkey continued improving its ability to take on the obligations of membership by aligning its laws and regulations with those of the European Union."
"Two negotiating chapters were opened during this reporting period - environment and food safety - adding to a total of 13 chapters that are currently open."
"Important progress has been made on energy security with the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement on Nabucco, and on cooperation in the aviation sector with initialisation of the EU-Turkey horizontal aviation agreement."
"Much alignment remains to be done, particularly on fisheries, social policies, justice and home affairs, and the customs union where longstanding trade issues remain unresolved."
"It remains crucial that Turkey improves its administrative capacity to implement and enforce EU-related legislation."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to apologise."
"We had a group meeting."
"Question time with Mrs Reding began at 20:00."
"I saw that on the monitor and then came here as soon as the second question was asked - she had six, after all."
"I thought that it would last half an hour, as scheduled."
"I therefore just missed my question."
"I would like to ask if you would be so kind as to still allow me to ask it after Mr Higgins's question."
"I really did arrive in the Chamber just as I should have been speaking."
"The problem is that, under Rule 116, if a Member is not in his place at the point at which a question should be replied to, then the question lapses."
"Attempts were made by the staff, although they do not have to, to call your office but there was no reply."
"I realise that there are difficulties but Question Time started 20 minutes late."
"I gave each Commissioner 20 minutes each."
"Mrs Reding had 20 minutes, she answered two questions, and we had agreed to move on to Mr Füle at 20:10."
"Mr Posselt, I am very sorry."
"I shall take the two supplementaries and we will see where we get then."
"(GA) Mr President, we must recognise that Turkey, although a Muslim state, is very helpful to the West, especially as regards Kuwait, Iraq and NATO."
"Although there are difficulties as regards a very large population, 74 million people, and difficulties as regards human rights, economic affairs and Cyprus, at the same time, can the Commissioner not admit that the situation is improving?"
"Is he able to give us any timetable, long term or short term, within which we will be able to grant Turkey the right to become a full member of the European Union?"
"Just briefly, notwithstanding the progress Turkey has made in certain areas, the Commissioner pointed out that significant progress needs to be made regarding freedom of expression and freedom of the press."
"If that is satisfied one day and they do join the European Union, is there not a danger that they will return to type and go back on a lot of the things that we are looking for and which have not been attained yet?"
"Member of the Commission. - Regarding the first question, I definitely belong to those who are not satisfied with the pace of our accession negotiations."
"I do not think it reflects the importance of the country, and the commitment on both sides, to open just one chapter per Presidency, bearing in mind that we were unable to open a new chapter during this Presidency even though there has been a lot of progress, in particular, on Chapter 8 dealing with competition."
"There are a number of reasons for this."
"Unresolved issues concerning Cyprus still being divided is one of them."
"The number of chapters available for us to open through the framework of the accession negotiations is indeed limited."
"We have only three chapters to open in the time remaining - on competition, procurement and social policy - and these are not easy chapters."
"Eight of them are being frozen, based on Commission recommendations, as a reaction to Turkey's non-implementation of the additional protocol, but there are other chapters which are being blocked by individual Member States."
"In these circumstances, it is difficult for the Commission to provide any reasonable timetable."
"I can say that today in Brussels, in the framework of the General First Council at ministerial level, we had a good discussion on the EU-Turkey relationship and the accession negotiations in terms of agreeing on the text of declarations."
"I am also pursuing a number of routes for intensifying this process."
"I am confident that after the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Turkey, both sides will indeed be ready to do exactly that."
"On freedom of the press, this is an issue of concern and one that the Commission is following very closely."
"The goal of this exercise is to go through all the 35 chapters, through all the opening and closing benchmarks, to make sure that Turkey not only aligns itself with the European Union acquis but also provides a track record of the implementation of that acquis."
"This very much concerns the political part of the Copenhagen criteria, which specifically relates to freedom of the media and the freedom of expression."
"Together with the Member States and with the support of the European Parliament, we are very keen that the enlargement process is not just an exercise in ticking boxes, which might later cause problems with the implementation of some of the legislation or with the working of the institutions."
"It is a serious process where the track record is playing a more and more important role."
"This is exactly the process Turkey needs to go through before the question of whether it will succeed in becoming a member of the European Union is put on the table."
"That would be the best assurance that all freedoms, including the one mentioned by the honourable Member, are guaranteed."
"Subject: Cooperation between Vojvodina and eastern Croatia"
"How does the Commission view the potential for greater cross-border cooperation between the Serbian province of Vojvodina and eastern Croatia (Osijek/Eastern Slavonia region), with particular regard to the development of cross-border infrastructure such as the project to construct a motorway from Sombor to Osijek?"
"Subject: The rise of an increasingly virulent form of nationalism in Albania and its prospects of EU accession"
"For a very long time, the main feature of political life in Albania has been the extreme fragility of its government."
"This instability is having an adverse effect on the process of far-reaching institutional reform needed if it is to join the EU."
"Amid this climate of prolonged political uncertainty, one cause for special concern is the rise of a particularly virulent form of fanatical nationalism, both in the media and in society, especially among young people."
"To give specific examples of this: the murder of an Albanian citizen of Greek origin in Himarë last August; acts of vandalism at Bobostiticë cemetery in which wreaths laid as a mark of respect were burned; and the repeated, intemperate verbal attacks by part of the 'mainstream' Albanian press directed at the head of the Orthodox Church of Albania."
"In view of the above, will the Commission say:"
"Is it aware of the specific events outlined above?"
"Is it concerned about the rise in fanatical nationalism?"
"Will it make appropriate representations to the Albanian Government to tackle this problem?"
"And finally, will all this alter the progress of Albania's bid to join the EU?"
"Member of the Commission. - I will provide succinct answers to both questions."
"The main objective of the cross-border cooperation programmes is to support the development of a common socio-economic environment for people, communities and economies, including the delivery of technical assistance."
"This should prepare countries to manage future cross-border programmes under the European territorial cooperation objectives of the European Union Structural Funds."
"Cross-border cooperation programmes between the Western Balkan countries also aim at overcoming the legacy of the past conflicts."
"Cross-border programmes under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance within the Western Balkans started in 2007."
"The results have so far been very positive."
"In the framework of their cross-border programmes, both Croatia and Serbia showed readiness to cooperate in the areas lying on either side of the Danube River."
"The annual allocation for the Croatia-Serbia cross-border programme amounts to EUR 1.8 million."
"This allocation of funds is used for providing grants to small joint projects proposed by local stakeholders in a variety of sectors such as the economy, culture, tourism, the environment and social issues."
"Project beneficiaries include municipalities, NGOs, chambers of commerce or cultural institutions."
"Large cross-border infrastructure projects, such as the project referred to in the question, are neither within the scope nor the objectives of the cross-border cooperation component of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance."
"The Commission might consider funding such projects under component one for Serbia - which is institution building - and component three for Croatia - which falls under regional development - if the respective authorities in Croatia and Serbia so request."
"As for the second question, if I may continue."
"As mentioned in the written reply to a previous question by the honourable Member numbered, the European Commission is aware of the deplorable incident in Himarë and is closely following developments."
"The alleged perpetrator has turned himself in to the police and is awaiting trial."
"The Albanian authorities bear the full responsibility for the efficient investigation of the facts and the equitable trial of those responsible."
"The Commission will be monitoring the processing of this case in conformity with the principles of human rights and the rule of law."
"In this question, the honourable Member also provides details of other incidents."
"Albania and Greece are closely linked by history."
"It is very much in the interests of both countries that they continue their cooperation and overcome any nationalist and extremist ideas which have been at the root of much misfortune suffered by the whole region in the past."
"The Commission has repeatedly stressed the need for a strict enforcement of the rule of law and for full respect of human rights, notably the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities."
"All applicant countries are aware of the importance of fulfilling these criteria for progress towards the European Union."
"In its recent opinion the Commission commented positively on inter-ethnic relations in Albania."
"However, efforts are still needed to enforce respect for and protection of minorities."
"(DE) Mr President, thank you very much for your generosity."
"I will be very brief, Commissioner."
"Would you possibly be prepared to take a look at the link between Sombor in Serbia and Osijek in Croatia?"
"There is a large bridge over the Danube there and in Croatia, there is an airport, but no adequate road."
"That really would be extremely important for the whole region."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened very carefully to your reply and I thank you for it, as regards the specific events."
"On the other hand, however, the reason for my question today was primarily the fact that, objectively speaking, there has been an outbreak of nationalism in Albania."
"This concerns and worries us in Greece, because this sort of thing should not happen in a country on its way to accession."
"We trust that these problems will be addressed."
"Mr Paleckis, would you like to make a comment about Belarus?"
"Yes, I have a question on Belarus."
"Thank you for your presents on the eve of Christmas."
"Recently, President Lukashenko visited Moscow and signed very important agreements with President Medvedev."
"How would you assess the new situation before the elections and after the signing of these agreements?"
"Commissioner, that is three questions."
"You have a maximum of three minutes please."
"Member of the Commission. - To the first question, the answer is yes, based on the request, for both of these countries."
"I am ready to look at it and see what the Commission can do to help."
"Secondly, any nationalist race is a concern for the Commission and is an issue which needs to be treated very seriously within the framework of our relations with the country."
"As you know, at the beginning of October, we presented an opinion on Albania."
"There have been a number of the so-called key priorities - 12 of them - which are preconditions Albania must meet before we can recommend opening accession negotiations."
"Within these 12 key priorities, my colleagues and I will make sure that the issue you have raised is tackled satisfactorily and that the Commission makes no recommendation to start the accession talks unless questions, such as the one you raised, are dealt with satisfactorily."
"On the third question, I hesitate as to how to answer it briefly."
"I think we have seen some limited progress in this pre-election process."
"We are very keen to see the report of the OSCE/ODIHR monitoring mission."
"Based on that, we are ready to take further steps on engaging Belarus, but that will be an engagement across the board, having very much in mind the steps which are to be made by the Belarusian authorities on the core issues of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights."
"I will stop here and will provide a written reply on the current work of the Commission and the Member States on the joint interim plan about which I will be talking to you and your colleagues from Euronest tomorrow, as well as the work on the mandate on the readmission agreement, the visa facilitation agreement and also additional information which would answer your question."
"I will also include my prepared speech."
"Mr Paleckis, I felt it was important to get your comments on Belarus on the record, given the ongoing election."
"I apologise to Mr Madlener, to Ms Theocharous and to Mr Hadjigeorgiou, who are also present."
"Their questions have not been reached."
"They will get a reply in writing."
"Mr Madlener, there really is no time."
"(NL) (without microphone) ... to ask that question, but now we are, in fact, simply being dropped from the agenda."
"Is this standard practice?"
"Could you not have let us know earlier or intervened, so that we could all take the floor?"
"Mr Madlener, under my chairmanship, we always try and end at 20:30."
"It has now run on for seven minutes due to the length of the replies and the fact that the previous debate overran by 20 minutes."
"It is not my fault, but I do think it is important that the staff get their food before they come back at 21:00."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20:40 and resumed at 21:00)"
"Energy Efficiency Action Plan (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Bendt Bendtsen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan."
"Mr President, the EU's target of achieving 20% energy efficiency savings by 2020 could be at risk of becoming yet another Lisbon prophecy."
"With the current initiatives, it looks like we will achieve 10 or 11%."
"That is not good enough."
"We must invest in energy efficiency for economic, commercial, environmental and social reasons."
"A greater focus on energy efficiency will mean, first and foremost, that we use less energy."
"This will result in savings and, according to the Commission's figures, the financial benefits of achieving our 20% target are in the region of EUR 1 000 per household per year."
"While China and the United States are now making significant investments in this area, things are moving more slowly in Europe."
"We are trailing behind."
"In China, the state subsidises these industries."
"The United States has fantastic framework conditions for business, whereas European citizens only think about how much luxury we will get for our monthly salaries."
"There is too little focus on innovation and on achieving results."
"From a political point of view, we must focus on some areas that can allow us to leave this world a better place than it was when we took it over - areas which will also provide a large economic return, create new jobs and improve our competitiveness."
"Energy efficiency also has the additional benefit of providing work for Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The three central pillars of the EU's energy efficiency policy are, as I see it, the national action plans, the product policy and buildings."
"These are three very different types of policies, and if we start with the national action plans, they have not proven to be very effective, but they nevertheless have a large amount of potential."
"We therefore need to streamline them and give the Commission the opportunity to use them actively as a tool."
"The Commission will have the chance to reject the action plans if they are not sufficiently ambitious."
"This will result in transparency for citizens."
"However, it is of the utmost importance that we maintain the Member States' independence and give them the opportunity to decide for themselves where they want to apply their efforts."
"Thus, in some countries, the potential for energy savings in buildings is greater than in other countries, just as entirely different countries will presumably focus on increased energy savings in connection with production."
"The second pillar is the product policy, which concerns both standards and labelling."
"Standards are, by far, the more important of the two, and it is very easy to demonstrate the size of the savings that will be made as a result of the standards, and again, this will increase innovation."
"The buildings policy is also important."
"Targets will be set in relation to the 2050 road map."
"Buildings are absolutely crucial in energy and climate policy. Forty percent of energy consumption comes from our buildings."
"This is an area where savings can be made that will be evident in the final accounts."
"I am convinced that these three areas will provide an important foundation for competitiveness and innovation for many years to come."
"Thus, the report recommends a financial instrument for leveraging investments in projects relating to energy efficiency."
"There are models in some European countries in which investments are leveraged many times over, and the question is whether the EU should not also arrange its finances in this way."
"I hope that Parliament can agree to adopt this report with a large political majority, as this is important - it is a very important area for Europe and for our enterprises."
"Mr President, honourable Members, first of all, I am grateful to Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Regional Development for the intensive debate and for the report that we are debating today."
"That applies to Mr Bendtsen in particular, but also to other Members who have been involved in this matter for a long time and have shown a high level of competence."
"If we just take stock of the interim situation with regard to the three 20% targets that we have been set - CO2, renewable energies in the energy mix and greater energy efficiency: with regard to CO2 and renewable energies, we are making good progress, but where energy efficiency is concerned, we are just beginning."
"If we do not take action, we will not meet the target."
"That means that, although we have been set a target - Parliament, the Council, all European institutions - our progress, particularly after the crisis, is not likely to result in 20% more energy efficiency; instead, as things currently stand, it would only be possible to achieve a maximum of 8, 9, 10% in ten years' time."
"My second point is that I am not completely happy with the term energy efficiency, because no one except us understands it."
"If you ask your neighbours or your friends, they understand energy saving, but energy efficiency is just some sort of technical term."
"In fact, the issue we have with regard to this target is that what actually needs to be achieved has not yet been conclusively defined."
"We have an overall assessment of energy consumption for 2005, supplemented by data from 2007 on account of the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria, and that year is the starting point."
"The level of consumption referred to there is well-known."
"At that time - it was before my time - all decisions reflected a normal forecast, in other words, an energy demand that would increase, and from that, in turn, 20% was deducted."
"If energy savings are disregarded, will our energy demand actually increase, I ask myself."
"In my country - Germany - probably not."
"However, in new Member States - I only need to mention motor vehicles, the number of cars per inhabitant, housing sizes, industrial development - it certainly will increase."
"However, up to now, there has been no objective report that assesses the forecasts."
"Twenty percent - of how much, we do not know."
"We have PRIMES and other models - I have doubts about many of the predictions of the figures."
"For example, there are founder members of the European Union who claim their energy demand will increase sharply by 2020 without energy savings."
"The deduction of 20% gives exactly the same figures as those from 2005."
"That is surely not possible."
"That means, first of all, that we need figures, perspectives and forecasts that have authority."
"We want to produce these by February or March."
"I am counting on the Heads of State or Government to take this matter just as seriously in February as they did before the crisis, as it seems to me that, as things stand, the Member States will not vote for binding targets."
"They may achieve a majority in Parliament, but the Member States want to work on a voluntary basis and they are still a long way from agreeing to the binding targets decided on two or three years ago."
"Thus, we need to clarify what the forecast for 2020 is without energy efficiency - more from a purely theoretical point of view - and then simply cut it by 20%."
"Then we need to ask: where do we start?"
"First of all, in the area of building stock."
"In the area of housing, work and industry, it is existing buildings where we have the most to do."
"In this regard, I see public owners - municipalities, states - setting an example."
"In other words, efficiency must, first of all, be sought wherever the state owns property."
"Secondly, we have structural programmes at European level and we have different refurbishment programmes in the various countries."
"We have to link these two together."
"We will perhaps have to provide less money for paving market places and have fewer bypasses, but instead, we will cofinance more energy efficiency."
"I also consider this to be a crucial objective for the next budgetary period at European level."
"Then comes the subject of transport."
"It goes without saying that we have to make savings there when we know that there are some Member States in which there are 550 cars for every 1 000 members of the population - petrol and diesel engines - and others where there are 100 or 120."
"This will be harmonised, but not at a level of 100 cars per 1 000 citizens in Germany, but at 400 to 500 cars per 1 000 citizens in Europe."
"We therefore need more energy efficiency in the area of transport."
"Incidentally, the most efficient form of transport is the one that is avoided."
"Thirdly, there is industry and, fourthly, the energy sector."
"The question of the binding nature of any such measures has been discussed at length in the European Parliament."
"We brought this issue up at an informal lunch in the Energy Council a few weeks ago. I can tell you that the Member States and the energy ministers are handling the subject of energy efficiency very sensitively, but are not yet prepared to take a decision on binding targets."
"Incidentally, consider an emerging Member State like Poland: will it manage minus 20%?"
"I doubt it."
"Or consider a saturated Member State like Germany, Austria or Italy: how would we get Austria or Germany, for example, to accept a cut of 30% so that Poland can adjust its economic development, number of cars per citizen and whatever else to the targets?"
"In this regard, we still have some tough discussions ahead of us with regard to how this will be implemented in detail in the various sectors - industry, the energy sector, transport and housing - and in the Member States."
"I will now take the report on board and I thank you for its contents."
"I want to debate this matter on 4 February in the European Council in order once again to see clearly how seriously the governments are taking this and I will then come back to you with a concrete proposal for a new energy efficiency plan."
"I am sure we will then have sufficient opportunity in spring and summer to discuss everything, including the question of binding targets."
"Bearing in mind the principle of subsidiarity, perhaps a two-stage plan might be the right approach."
"Stage 1 would be voluntary."
"We will expect national energy efficiency action plans to be provided on an annual basis and we will specify what we expect each year in terms of achieving the targets, but we will not wait until 2020."
"Instead, if appropriate, we will switch after two years to binding targets if we notice that in the first two years, the voluntary phase has not resulted in progress towards 20% in the Member States."
"Thank you very much for today."
"Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to make a correction: the German translation states that I am the chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but that is not correct."
"I am the rapporteur."
"However, in this role, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Bendtsen for his splendid work and excellent cooperation."
"He has presented an ambitious strategy on the subject of energy efficiency in the European Union."
"Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective means of lowering emissions and reducing our dependence on energy imports."
"This will create jobs in Europe, and the money we invest will no longer flow in the direction of Russia, the Middle East or other regions, but will remain in our economy."
"The Environment Committee has adopted a comprehensive opinion."
"I do not need to repeat everything it contains, but it is also very ambitious."
"Not everything it contains is of equal importance, either."
"However, I would like to emphasise two points once again."
"Firstly - we have talked about this, Commissioner - we propose that the European Union sets itself a long-term target in the area of energy efficiency, because if we plan up to 2050, we also need to know roughly how much we consume."
"Secondly, we have also pointed out the problems with the definition."
"I believe that we should take the quantity of energy consumed as the basis, as that is measurable and we have data for that."
"We do not have data for anything else as far as measurement per unit is concerned, for example."
"Therefore, this is the right approach in my view, and I hope that we can incorporate it into the strategy accordingly in the coming months."
"Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency is one of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next 10 years."
"It is also a key element of our energy strategy."
"At present, the priority is for the report's constructive provisions and the Commission's energy strategy to be implemented by the Member States."
"For this to happen, several problems need to be resolved."
"At EU level, we are still facing the problem of measuring energy efficiency."
"We are currently using the 2020 forecasts for this purpose; however, it would not be sensible to adopt binding legal goals based on these forecasts."
"In terms of the future, we are not clairvoyants."
"For this reason, new and better technology needs to be developed, and this has already been mentioned in today's discussion."
"This technology will allow us to achieve our goal."
"It is also important to take regional differences into account."
"The way that energy is used in Copenhagen is different to the way it is used in eastern Poland."
"There is no single plan of action that suits everything, and we have to ensure that these plans are compatible with reality."
"Regional and local authorities will be responsible for implementing policies on energy efficiency, and so the European Commission and Member States must coordinate their activities with local authorities."
"Otherwise, they will be perceived as bureaucratic red tape and the source of huge costs to regions and citizens."
"Without multi-level management and the earmarking of funding for this goal, the whole project will be condemned to failure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank those who have worked on this report and, in particular, Mr Bendtsen."
"I would like to mention two aspects and perhaps give you pause for thought."
"We are all agreed that energy efficiency, using energy economically, is the most simple and most sensible solution."
"The question is: how do we achieve this goal?"
"I would also like to ask the question: what have we actually achieved here in Parliament by keep going back to the people with new and higher percentages?"
"Have we really achieved more and had more of an effect?"
"Why and in which areas have we been using energy more efficiently?"
"I am told that industry, which consumes a lot of energy, is using energy more efficiency because it saves money by doing so and because it is beneficial for it."
"I am also told that when people know that a particular appliance consumes more or less energy, in other words, if they can see that and can see an advantage to themselves, they will decide in favour of energy efficiency."
"Perhaps working with percentages is completely the wrong way to go about it and we should instead take an incentives approach."
"My second question is: the Commissioner made some very eloquent and clear comments about how complicated it is just to explain what energy efficiency is."
"What is it in fact?"
"How differently is it implemented in the Member States?"
"My fellow Member has just pointed out that the Member States also have very different situations in terms of their economies and geography - completely different."
"Is it the right solution to work with a single binding figure, or should we not think of something else?"
"I think that, in terms of energy policy, we need, to a certain extent, to move away from the debate of the past, which sought to achieve something with simple figures, binding targets and miracle solutions, because we have clearly not achieved enough."
"Perhaps, for once, we should try the alternative route of differentiated, varied solutions, which takes account of the different situations, but then also achieves results."
"What matters is the effect we achieve rather than our particular circumstances."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, I have just one question for Mr Reul."
"Is it not possible to have binding targets in the course of development and yet still to regard them as differentiated?"
"You contrasted 'binding' and 'differentiated', whereas I believe that it is possible to unite the two."
"I am completely behind some of the steps that the Commissioner has put forward, but perhaps we can find a way to proceed in a differentiated manner according to the geographical and other circumstances, but still ultimately obtain binding targets."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, advocate differentiated solutions and, like you, Mr Swoboda, I am in the process of considering how such solutions can be brought about."
"We should not rule anything out at all in respect of where something is to be done."
"I will take today as my starting point."
"At the moment, I believe it to be the wrong approach to essentially buy ourselves a little leeway with binding targets and percentages."
"I would invite us all now to give more thought to what we can achieve and how, on a step-by-step basis."
"It saddens me that we have not achieved more."
"Perhaps we need to choose a different approach for that reason."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Bendtsen and the other rapporteurs for their productive cooperation on this report."
"We have succeeded in reaching agreement in many areas - not least, the ambition to harvest the low-hanging fruit resulting from boosting energy efficiency."
"There have also been areas of disagreement, however."
"We are not in agreement when it comes to setting ambitious and binding targets for energy efficiency."
"In my view, it is crucial that we stand firm on a minimum target of 20% increased energy efficiency."
"That is the way forward if we want a green and sustainable economy that can create a million new jobs in Europe."
"However, it is crucial that these energy efficiency targets are binding for the Member States, as it is plain for all to see that the EU has recommendations and objectives in a great many areas that are never realised in practice because they are not binding."
"At the same time, we have seen that binding targets do work."
"It is therefore obvious that this should also apply to energy efficiency measures."
"We know that this is easily the cheapest way of reducing CO2 emissions, guaranteeing the security of supply and, at the same time, ensuring that consumers have lower heating bills - and less expenditure on heating bills would represent progress, in particular, for the many Europeans affected by what we could term energy poverty."
"People suffer from energy poverty if a relatively large proportion of their income has to be spent on heating their home. There are currently no common definitions of energy poverty, nor are there any proper political initiatives in place to reduce it."
"The consequences of energy poverty are disastrous."
"It results in the deterioration of the health and the general living conditions of low income groups."
"We must therefore provide cheap loans for investments in energy efficiency in private homes and we must also use the Structural Funds for this purpose."
"I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow, and I hope that we can get a large majority to support the report and more forceful action to combat energy poverty."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I want to pay tribute to Mr Bendtsen who has worked extremely hard on this report and cooperated closely with the shadows from other parties."
"He has succeeded in bringing parliamentarians together on this issue and he deserves warm congratulations."
"Energy saving ticks an awful lot of boxes."
"First of all, climate change."
"Cancún has reminded us how much we need to do, and energy saving is the cheapest and easiest way of moving to a 30% reduction in greenhouse gases."
"Secondly, energy security."
"I was in Zaghreb last week discussing Croatia's accession with Liberal colleagues, and they told me that Croatia imports 50% of its energy and also uses twice as much energy as it would do if proper energy efficiency measures were in place."
"Now that energy is a shared European competence under the Lisbon Treaty, energy efficiency must also be a shared responsibility."
"By doing more on energy saving, we are also tackling the very practical problems that people face in their lives."
"Too many people are living in fuel poverty, struggling to keep warm in houses that are not properly insulated."
"Making homes more energy efficient puts money in people's pockets to spend in the local economy at this time of financial and economic difficulty."
"It would also create many thousands of jobs in the local economy."
"So, given all these positive effects, it comes as a great shock to realise that the 20% energy efficiency target is the one part of the 2020 package which is currently heading for failure, as the Commissioner said."
"Indeed, the latest figures show that we are on target to reach only 9% of the projected 20% by 2020."
"And the time has come I think for us to put up our hands and admit that we got it wrong in 2008."
"We should have made the target binding then, and we really need to go forward now and find ways of making it possible."
"I thank the Commissioner for having given us an insight into what he is preparing for the next year."
"I think the time has come to make a political decision here that we have to have a binding energy saving target because without it, we are actually undermining everything else that we do on the economy, on energy security and on climate change."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work and, in principle, clearly, to support the adoption tomorrow of the report adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"Let us come now to the unbelievable potential associated with energy savings, a point that has been made here."
"Reports from the European Commission itself say that if we called a halt to our excessive energy consumption, if we reduced our energy wastage by 20%, we could create one million jobs, we could save almost EUR 1 000 per European household, and we could clearly reduce our external energy bill."
"A 20% energy saving or reduction in Europe is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos in energy terms, and we are currently missing that target."
"Mrs Hall made this point, and the way I see it, we have trouble calculating."
"If reports show today that we are far from achieving 20%, then we can evaluate the savings that we make or do not make each year."
"We also know that this eco-design or eco-labelling approach for cars and so on does not result in overall coherence and does enable us to obtain the results that we are seeking."
"I am a little surprised at the debate that we are having here."
"Excuse me, Commissioner, but when you say that we have a problem in defining energy efficiency, this is perhaps true from a theoretical point of view, but the climate and energy package is very clear on the objective."
"It says that energy consumption must be reduced by 20% below the baseline level."
"This problem does not have to do with the definition of energy efficiency."
"There are energy levels that we need to return to - that is what the climate and energy package says."
"We are told that we do not need a binding objective. We are thus making one on renewables."
"A few days ago, in Cancún, the European Commission negotiated a binding agreement on climate change and tried to defend the Kyoto Protocol, and in this House we are citing the arguments of the United States and China by saying: 'We will go for voluntary targets, and then, if one day we realise that they are not working, we will create binding targets'."
"With regard to the report under examination, a number of Members have proposed strengthening the part on building."
"There is scope to take a large-scale European initiative on building, which nevertheless accounts for 40% of our energy consumption; we can go much further on renovation."
"Finally, citizens are today facing the cold."
"They are paying very high prices for their energy."
"If Europe emerges from the crisis, energy will be much more expensive internationally."
"Citizens will be confronted with a two-fold increase in energy prices."
"We must move much more quickly, and I would also ask you, Commissioner, to please stress to Mr Van Rompuy that the 4 February meeting should also be a meeting about energy consumption."
"From this point of view, the road map that he is proposing today is outrageous."
"Mr President, I would like most of all to thank the rapporteur for the very constructive and open cooperation in preparing the report."
"In my speech, I would like to focus on one issue."
"Our political group will not be able to accept the introduction of binding energy efficiency goals for the European system."
"First and foremost, we do not have a common methodology for measuring efficiency; too many indicators are not comparable."
"Goals should be set for each country separately so that the varying potential for savings is taken into account as well as current achievements in this area."
"I will give the example of my country - since 1990, Poland has improved its energy efficiency by 50%."
"Despite this, Poland remains a country of low efficiency compared to the European average."
"The introduction of a uniform, binding goal will be politically harmful and mean that the cost of making changes will be spread unequally between Member States."
"Mr President, I would also like to begin by saying that I believe this to be a good time to table a motion to review the Action Plan on Energy Efficiency and, if there are any doubts, I believe that the debate that we are having here today will clarify things."
"Energy efficiency policy is absolutely fundamental in a number of sectors, from buildings to energy infrastructure, information and communications technology, transport, matters of finance, all of these issues and many more, and all other sectors."
"It is essential that we have coordinated and joined-up policies, because otherwise, we cannot achieve our objectives."
"Energy efficiency policy is also essential to enable us to combat climate change, as I have already mentioned, in connection with the reduction of emissions to which we need to respond."
"We cannot have a discussion, on the one hand, in support of reducing emissions and, on the other, have another discussion relating to energy efficiency saying it is not possible."
"I would therefore like to make a few points that seem to me to be fundamental to this discussion."
"Firstly, it is important for us to set binding targets."
"As I have mentioned before, the situation whereby we still have voluntary criteria has simply brought us to where we are now: we cannot set binding targets because it will be impossible to achieve 20% energy efficiency by 2020, and we will tell the European public that, in the end, it was an empty promise, and that nothing of the sort is going to happen in reality, because we only achieved 9%."
"I believe that this is an unacceptable argument that contradicts itself, because the fact that we are not going to achieve 20% energy efficiency is precisely why we do not set binding targets to do so."
"If targets have this effect, they also have the effect of providing the motivation for policies and projects."
"If we do not want to do this, we are being cowards, and cannot depend on good will."
"We have to depend, unfortunately in this case, on political will."
"I hope that tomorrow, the political will is leaning towards setting this target of 20% energy efficiency by 2020, and not just because achieving this will enable one million jobs to be created: new jobs, and we are not in a position where we can miss the opportunity to create jobs."
"What seems to be happening here with this assumption of no joint commitment is the same thing that is happening with economic policy at European level."
"The European Union is showing itself to be incapable of having an economic policy for job creation."
"It is also showing itself to be incapable of having a common energy efficiency policy."
"I hope that this does not remain the case, I hope that we are successful not only in this sector, but also in the construction sector, and I sincerely hope that tomorrow, we are able to give a response that is not only coordinated and articulate, but a response to the crisis that we are experiencing."
"Mr President, the negotiated revision of the action plan for energy efficiency describes many ways in which the Europe Union might contribute to fulfilling its ambition for a planned reduction in greenhouse gas volumes by 2020."
"The philosophy of the submitted elaboration is based on the logical notion that we can achieve dramatic cuts in production costs and environmental pollution if we manage to handle energy rationally and if we take necessary and affordable measures to limit energy waste in all energy consumption sectors."
"The proposed measures do not apply only to the area of energy infrastructure, in other words, production and transmission of energy, but also to the construction sector, industrial output and transport."
"The measures are generally depicted as fundamental postulates, with no need to describe their expected benefit."
"It is undoubtedly a good thing that the EU will have a kind of summary list of measures enabling a gradual increase in energy efficiency. However, with regard to the target deadline for the EU commitment to reduce the volume of greenhouse gases produced in Europe by 20% by 2020, it would perhaps be a good idea to think about the measures, scope, cost and end result we are prepared to implement in the next 10 years within the framework of current options and powers."
"I am not saying that we should give up on promoting changes or on increasing efficiency in energy production and transmission, but in view of the cost and the amount of time required for planning, design and implementation, I do not think that much will change in this area by 2020, or even in a number of other proposed measures."
"I therefore firmly believe that it would be a good thing if the Commission could now select measures from the previously mentioned extensive document that are feasible from an organisational, financial and timing perspective, and on which we can concentrate in order to create a strong initial impulse for the adoption of an energy handling philosophy as a component in the thinking of the specialist community at first, and the wider public later."
"After all, Commissioner, we are already attempting to provide support with the heating of buildings, and encouraging people to swap consumer goods or cars, so that they can purchase more efficient and better ones."
"Let us continue with this in a more emphatic, and perhaps more sophisticated way, and let us provide further encouragement for the introduction of new and sensible measures."
"In my opinion, that is the way to boost energy efficiency."
"(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a question."
"Who knows how much oil and gas we import in Europe?"
"Who knows how much oil and gas we extract in Europe?"
"The answer is that, although we do extract a certain amount in Europe itself, compared to our requirements, we import oil and gas on a massive scale from the Middle East and Russia."
"This dependence on imports, which is on an upward trend, also means that it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to shape relations with these third countries on an objective basis."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, let us reflect for a moment on what this importation of oil and gas is."
"What does it mean for our populations?"
"It is, in fact, the export of Europe's money to these third countries."
"By importing oil and gas, we are actually exporting money."
"What do we know about the future?"
"We know that in future, the price we pay for oil and gas will only increase, for these resources are becoming ever less accessible and ever more expensive to extract."
"This means that in future, if we do not alter our behaviour, we shall continue to export increasing amounts of our own money out of the European Union to third countries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is a simple way of stopping this massive export of money from the European Union, and it is extremely simple: we do it by conserving."
"By conserving energy."
"By conserving energy, we are actually gaining money, which we can invest not in third countries but in our own economies."
"I therefore call on all my fellow Members to support Mr Bendtsen's report on energy efficiency, which is a way in which we can actually help our own economy. Thank you for your attention."
"(SV) Mr President, I, too, would like to start by thanking Mr Bendtsen."
"The conclusion is very clear in the report."
"We need binding energy efficiency targets as soon as possible, and this is important for a whole host of reasons: economic reasons and reasons relating to competition, jobs, the environment and the climate."
"Commissioner Oettinger mentioned the issue of language."
"This relates to energy saving or energy efficiency, and the question is: what are we actually talking about?"
"In my country, we usually say that it is stupid to let the fire go up the chimney."
"In other words, we should not use our energy resources in such a way that we get insufficient benefit from them."
"That is rather self-evident, and several of you mentioned the balance between energy production and the costs involved in production, taking risks with it and the consumption of energy."
"We must, of course, be as smart as possible."
"How are we to measure the targets that the Commissioner mentioned?"
"As in all other contexts where we have common ambitions at global or European level, we need to agree on a common measurement method and then decide on binding targets."
"What we are putting to the test right now is the inefficiency of not having binding targets and, using the step-by-step method, we are putting off making a change until the future."
"I think we should stop doing that and we should support Mr Bendtsen."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency has always been the biggest resource proffered to us."
"It is the sleeping giant with the hidden but enormous potential for the European energy economy."
"All that is true, and the nice thing about it is that it is so free of ideology."
"Above all, the approach to this issue can be technology-neutral."
"All that interests us here, and it is a point that is clearly also a little divisive, is the issue of whether or not the targets are binding."
"I have to say, Commissioner, in this regard, that I like your two-stage approach whereby you start by trusting in the Member States and by building voluntary agreements and then, if we observe that we will not achieve the targets by 2020, we perhaps get the thumbscrews out."
"That is the right approach to take."
"This report, by and large, moves in the right direction - there is little to criticise."
"There is one issue that I would like to raise, however, which is the role of the regional funds."
"You mentioned this issue, Commissioner."
"In the regional funds, together with the Cohesion Funds, we have an immense instrument in our hands in the European Union that we are not making use of."
"In this field of energy efficiency, we could finally create European added value which we could put to use in an innovative way to get to grips with energy efficiency in a way that has not happened in the past."
"As the current rapporteur for budgetary discharge for the Commission, I can see just how badly we have wasted money in the sphere of cohesion."
"Let us put a stop to that waste!"
"I endorse the focus that you are giving to this issue, Commissioner Oettinger, and the fact that you are seeking to bring about greater use of these funds, including for this energy efficiency instrument."
"That is the only way that we will ensure that there really is cohesion, at least in the energy sector."
"I feel I must warn against smear campaigns, as we saw with light bulbs and with shower heads."
"Such campaigns are the kind of things that alienate the citizens."
"We must thus ensure that we aim to achieve energy efficiency in general and that we keep this objective in mind without pursuing ideological smear campaigns that ultimately lead to the citizens losing their positive impression of the EU."
"(NL) First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bendtsen, for the report which he has prepared and which lays down the core of what needs to happen here."
"However, let us put everything into perspective."
"Everyone knows that, by 2050, Europe has to reduce its greenhouse emissions either by 80% or, as we advocate, by 95%."
"That is an incredible challenge."
"Where can we make the biggest savings?"
"The biggest savings are to be made if we consume even less energy."
"We would then need to import less energy, replace less energy, that is, develop fewer alternatives, and that is simply the cheapest way forward."
"It is therefore absurd that, while we are already aware that Europe is on course to fail to meet this very energy conservation target, we, and particularly those of us in the Commission, continue to focus on achieving reduction and renewable energy targets."
"This means that energy conservation, or using less energy, is a target that we are going to fail to meet."
"There is so much energy that could be saved from everything around us, though."
"For example, from the built environment."
"The built environment consumes approximately 40% of our energy, 99% of which is accounted for by existing buildings."
"They have to be adapted to make them more energy efficient."
"The current rate of adaptation in Europe is 1.4% per year: in other words, it will take us more than 60 years to replace our built environment in its entirety."
"That will take us up to 2070 but, meanwhile, we have set ourselves targets which we have to reach by 2050!"
"That is exactly what this should be about: we have to ensure that we can make energy savings in the built environment, for example, in a much faster timeframe, which is why we have submitted an amendment for a European Building Initiative."
"It will save everyone money, it is a cheaper option, we will be preparing ourselves for the future and - most importantly - it will save people money."
"They will not have to spend so much on energy."
"Now, that is an argument that you hardly ever hear."
"Ultimately, however, ordinary people will have to spend less on energy."
"That is what this should be about!"
"(PL) Mr President, ever since September 2009, Europeans have been exchanging traditional light bulbs, to which they had grown accustomed, for those produced with new, energy saving technology."
"The need for this change was justified by energy saving slogans, and the change has taken place despite signs that the financial costs to be borne by EU citizens would be too great, particularly over such a short period of time."
"It is an open secret that the data presented at the time by the European Commission regarding the effects of such a change came from the advertising materials of the producers of these new-technology light bulbs, and there is a great deal of evidence to indicate that this was the case."
"In the report being discussed, we can see similarly over-optimistic assumptions."
"Insufficient reference is made to the development differences between the EU Member States and, as a result, to the costs they will have to bear if the recommendations are implemented."
"If industrial plants are to make annual energy saving improvements of 2% as stated, while, at the same time, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the result will be an increase in production costs and the transfer of production outside Europe."
"(FR) Mr President, trying to make savings is a real challenge - a challenge which will enable us to reduce Europe's dependence, a challenge which will enable us to release substantial financial resources which can finance research into new forms of energy production, and a challenge which will enable us to revitalise our regions."
"While the energy efficiency of buildings must be at the centre of our concerns, it is essential that the objectives and actions of the Union, like those of the Member States, focus on social housing, because the poorest must benefit the most from our energy efficiency efforts."
"We must put an end to this scandal of making the poorest pay the highest energy bills, while at the same time, in the name of energy efficiency, fiscal loopholes are created which allow the richest to reduce their bills while paying less tax."
"A true energy efficiency policy should also mean an opportunity to sell electricity at a lower price to railways, metros and trams, as happened in France before the European directives on the single energy market prohibited it."
"Thus, one of the first measures would be to abolish the single electricity market within the Union, because competition on a product such as electricity, which cannot be stored and is hard to transport, is an aberration with regard to energy efficiency."
"Finally, energy efficiency will not create high quality jobs unless it is based on a genuine EU strategic industrial initiative which is free of the constraints of the free market."
"(PL) Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on system innovation, such as intelligent networks, intelligent measurement systems, easier integration of renewable energy sources and also the development of a comprehensive strategy for heat generation producers and distributors."
"However, I believe that the greatest savings and the greatest efficiency are to be achieved by fostering the personal responsibility of every European Union citizen."
"Just as we learned to save water, we have to learn to respect energy and use it efficiently."
"All procedures for granting permission for new infrastructure should be simplified and accelerated in order to maximise potential savings."
"Energy efficiency and energy security will be priorities in the upcoming Hungarian Presidency of the European Union."
"Poland, which will take over the Presidency from Hungary, and which has included the matter of energy security in its agenda, will also intensify the debate on modern legislative and non-legislative solutions that will allow the European energy sector to stay competitive while, at the same time, improving energy efficiency."
"I have to highlight at this point that for me personally, an increasingly critical issue is the plausibility of forecasts and the quality of the PRIMES model used by the European Union, particularly in view of the failure to achieve a consensus in Cancún."
"This is a subject for a separate debate, but I would like to appeal now for consideration to be given to a new, post-crisis approach to the issue of consumption and energy demands in the European Union."
"Transport seems to be the most appropriate way to implement modern, energy efficient solutions."
"Energy efficiency in the European Union should be adapted in the direction of demand, which is directly tied to expenditure and changes in citizens' habits."
"In my opinion, changes will be brought about by measurable benefits for consumers and appropriate incentives and long-term forms of funding for manufacturers."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bendtsen's report is positive for at least four reasons:"
"it reaffirms that energy efficiency is the most effective and fastest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that a firm commitment to provide resources and investment in this area will result in economic growth and job creation for small and medium-sized enterprises;"
"it makes valid proposals concerning workable financial instruments and calls on the Commission to firmly focus on professional training, access to information for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the refurbishment of existing buildings;"
"it sets specific objectives and confirms Energy Performance Contracting as an instrument for purchasing guaranteed energy savings and a launch pad for creating jobs and reducing European citizens' bills;"
"lastly, the report will be all the more useful if binding emissions targets can be set without any ifs or buts."
"We must make the 20% target an achievable one; we cannot let this opportunity pass us by, since it would send out an encouraging signal to Europe."
"(BG) Mr President, achieving a high degree of energy efficiency is the fundamental political aim of the European Union, as it is an integral component in the overall strategy of building a competitive, low carbon economy which will stimulate business activity and improve employment by creating plenty of new jobs."
"With tomorrow's vote on the energy efficiency plan, the European Parliament will send a strong signal to the Commission and the Council on the need for urgent and targeted measures in this area."
"In the first place, I call upon the European Commission to conduct a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of existing legislation on the renewal of the current housing stock and higher energy standards for new builds."
"Creating an effective energy infrastructure and developing modern technologies for vehicles are other important priorities which I hope will be part of the Commission's proposed new energy efficiency plan for 2011."
"In conclusion, I would say that energy efficiency has the potential to, and must, become a profitable business."
"It can do this on its own and produce a high social return."
"(PT) Mr President, reality shows that it is not enough to adopt an Action Plan for Energy Efficiency."
"An assessment needs to be made of the results of the 2006 plan, and policies put in place to help targets to be implemented, diversifying methods of increasing energy efficiency."
"The crisis argument cannot be used as an excuse for non-fulfilment of the 20% objective in 2020, nor for shooting down solutions for resolving the serious problem of energy poverty."
"It is important to report positive experiences from other countries, not forgetting China and the United States, and to invest in the funding of measures that increase energy efficiency in buildings, in social housing, and in transport and industry."
"The necessary resources should be included within the EU budget to support Member States and families that have greater difficulties."
"Energy efficiency also increases employment, reduces poverty, and is a factor in progress and social development."
"We need to invest in this."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, you put forward a very sound plan, and Mr Bendtsen made it even better."
"We must succeed in breaking through the equation 'more economic growth equals more energy consumption at the same time'."
"This poses a particular challenge of us, as politicians, as we have normal technological progress which is, of course, characterised by the fact that we have more energy efficient products and modes of economic operation."
"We must succeed, however, in reducing our energy bills despite stronger economic growth."
"In this connection, we need to bring forward truly innovative solutions and provide the right incentives through policy."
"Economic history, too, has shown that those societies that enjoyed the most success over the long term were those societies that made this efficiency - whether in relation to raw materials or energy - the motto that they lived by."
"This is a particular challenge for us Europeans, with our high standard of living."
"We need to drive forward energy efficiency if, realistically, we hope to attain our climate targets."
"I would also like to take the liberty of reminding you that reducing the dependence on imports of fossil fuels remains an important policy goal."
"In addition, the capital that is freed up as a result of the lower power bills releases a major potential for consumption which, furthermore, can contribute to our economic growth in the long term."
"That said, I believe that the approach that you have chosen, which is to say, not laying down these targets in binding form, is the correct one."
"We should not allow ourselves to get lost in debates about definitions and problems of measurement."
"It is important that we chart the path forward."
"The Commission and the rapporteur are taking the right approach in this regard."
"We should indeed leave this target as non-binding, but that does not mean that we should lower our ambitions."
"For the reasons stated, those ambitions must continue to be set high, but choosing a path where this can only be achieved through a binding target is not the right way to go and our group will therefore be rejecting that approach."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bendtsen on a very good report."
"Basically, I have just one comment to make, Commissioner, and that is that your background is in regional politics, in a large state in Germany, whereas mine is in local politics."
"We will not achieve the targets, whether binding or otherwise - and I advocate binding targets - if we do not address states, regions and communities directly and specify to them what can be done."
"When I think of the refurbishment of housing, transport policy - which, thank God, you repeatedly mention - and combating energy poverty, these are areas that are not regulated at the national level but essentially at the local, the regional and the municipal level."
"We therefore also have to be active at that level."
"It would be a major opportunity to win over the towns and the communities to our great European project of energy efficiency, energy saving and, of course, other areas of energy policy."
"I would therefore ask that you act accordingly and perhaps also give some consideration to how we can better get through to the citizens, specifically via the towns, the communities and the regions, as that connection is absolutely vital in order to make it possible to actually get those targets accepted - binding or otherwise."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, energy efficiency is crucial for increasing security of supply, improving air quality, reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and increasing the competitiveness of our society."
"Energy efficiency means doing more with fewer resources."
"This report sets out an ambitious vision for energy efficiency through, for example, the introduction of individual goals and positive incentives."
"Important elements are introduced with regard to the modernisation of energy infrastructure, such as smart networks, energy efficiency within buildings and transport, the use of information and communication technologies, and the development of scientific research in the area of energy."
"This report underlines the need to double the funding for scientific research into technological development and demonstration in the area of energy."
"In the area of funding, the report encourages the use of Structural Funds in support of energy efficiency, and calls for this to be made a priority within the EU budget after 2013."
"In the light of the above, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bendtsen, for the excellent work carried out and for the balance achieved, and would invite all of you to support this important report."
"(LT) Mr President, although many legislative measures have been introduced in the area of energy efficiency and saving, not all of them are producing the desired results."
"According to scientific research, at the current rate of progress, we will not even achieve half of the 20% target set."
"Therefore, it is necessary to take more binding measures and greater control in the Member States."
"I believe that when revising the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the European Commission must seriously take into account the fact that the Member States are not exploiting energy saving opportunities sufficiently, which is preventing an increase in energy independence."
"It is also necessary for individual Member States to set binding energy efficiency targets and monitor how they are implemented, because otherwise, the huge potential for energy saving will remain untapped."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I am happy to make a few comments on this report."
"It is an excellent report, because it will enable us to achieve a number of things simultaneously: not only environmental and CO2 reduction objectives, but also some of our production objectives and other objectives designed to ensure that we remain competitive."
"It will be kind on both the environment and the wallet."
"Commissioner, you have also spoken of your ambition to produce an action plan within a short timeframe."
"Allow me, however, to make three points: my first point concerns national energy efficiency action plans."
"There is a great deal more scope for improvement there and they need to be examined critically by the European Commission."
"Commissioner, you have indicated that you will be working in two stages."
"The first stage will involve consultation, but with some pressure being applied, and the second will possibly involve a degree of coercion."
"I have insisted on pressure being brought to bear in my earlier discussions with the Commissioner and in my amendments, and I am pleased that this issue is now gaining prominence."
"I have just one question for the Commissioner: will you have sufficient instruments to enable you to stay the course whilst moving into the coercion stage?"
"Could you give us an analysis of that, now, or in the near future, or in your action plan?"
"My second point is about regional policy."
"Mr Swoboda has also spoken about this."
"A great deal more could be done with those funds."
"In most countries, the funds that are available are not even being used to improve energy efficiency."
"I have therefore tabled an amendment to Article 81 in order to clarify its wording."
"It does not always have to mean more money; it is also about spending existing resources wisely."
"Lastly, my third point - and here, too, I agree with Mr Swoboda - we need to get citizens, local authorities and companies more involved in energy conservation, through measures such as quality marks, covenants with mayors and agreements with industry."
"In my country, the Netherlands, an agreement with industry alone has already resulted in a 2% improvement in energy efficiency a year."
"Now, that is a measure of what we could achieve in concrete terms!"
"Thank you, I wish you every success, and thanks to the rapporteur."
"(RO) Mr President, between 50 and 125 million European citizens are affected by energy poverty."
"This is why we think that priority should be given to energy savings and energy efficiency policies in the area of social housing."
"Only 1% of the buildings which will be standing in 2020 will be new buildings."
"This is why, when discussing existing buildings, we cannot talk about binding targets without allocating sufficient financial resources."
"For this reason, we think that innovative funding schemes are required, as well as fiscal facilities which will make investments in energy efficiency attractive and provide long-term institutional support."
"Commissioner, a meeting of the CONCERTO programme group was held recently in Parliament, five years after it was set up."
"Unfortunately, the 400 representatives from local and regional authorities mentioned that it is not known at local and regional level that all Member States have the opportunity to use 4% of the European Regional Development Fund allocation at national level for energy efficiency in buildings."
"For this reason, I would like to end, Commissioner, by asking you to use the mid-term review to allocate a larger sum of funding to energy efficiency programmes and, in particular, to promote the opportunities to use up to 15% of the European Regional Development Fund for energy efficiency in the future financial perspective."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Bendtsen for his precise report."
"The Commissioner opened this sitting by saying - and I agree with him - that we are somewhat rhetorical today when we talk about efficiency, that uncertainty surrounds the 20% target, given that it has already been halved, and we do not really know what we are referring to."
"I would add that the culture of energy saving and energy efficiency does not exist."
"We therefore find ourselves in a situation and at a point where we have no option but to change."
"How?"
"First, I believe that we should move towards innovation and new technologies in both areas - the energy efficiency of buildings and, above all, the energy efficiency of transport."
"I would also like to focus on the importance of having sufficient resources to achieve these objectives."
"I believe that we have to spend in order to save."
"Today in Parliament, President Barroso stated that Eurobonds are not going to be used and that he has other financial instruments set aside."
"Commissioner, we recently adopted a report that establishes a fund for financing energy efficiency through the use of the funds left over from the previous recovery plans."
"Even with a limited budget, I think the fund is highly symbolic insofar as it establishes the principle of attracting private capital in a public-private partnership (PPP) model, rationalising the funds that are already at our disposal - Cohesion Funds and others - and putting them into a container that can attract money, that, instead of giving money away, loans it through the development of major projects; it should be a revolving fund that gives meaning to all of this."
"I believe this is the right system for seeking resources and ensuring that efficiency is no longer a taboo subject."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be revised in accordance with a holistic approach that combines Europe's numerous strategic policies."
"While investing in energy efficiency is essential because it will help ensure that the emissions reduction targets are met by 2020, it is also important to emphasise those initiatives that will enable us to more fully exploit the EU's as yet unused energy saving potential."
"I am satisfied that ample attention has been paid to the energy performance of buildings; initiatives in this regard must be undertaken at European level also."
"Our businesses should think again about how they can make both their production processes and their products more efficient."
"Lastly, setting mandatory efficiency targets is a good thing, because without them, it will be difficult to achieve ambitious results within the EU."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to come back to one point: the importance of adopting a binding energy efficiency target for the European economy."
"Under the difficult economic conditions in a series of Member States which need powerful incentives for growth and for the protection and creation for jobs, a binding target will create a suitable investment environment for strengthening the competitiveness and export potential of European companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises trading in energy efficiency technologies and services."
"The Member States will acquire the incentives needed to strengthen those markets in each economy on which they can offer the greatest added value and create the most jobs."
"In addition, households, businesses and the public sector will have considerable comparative economic benefits, as they will have lower energy bills."
"I should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and call on the European Commission to implement the proposals in the Bendtsen report, thereby helping our economies out of the crisis at the same time."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, clearly, energy efficiency is a very important subject, and naturally we have to be very economical with fossil fuels."
"Clearly, the key figures required need to represent a challenge, but they must also always retain an adequate sense of proportion; they always have to be realistic."
"They need to be efficient for society but also for the individual, and it needs to be affordable for owners."
"For citizens, it must be comprehensible and explicable and, above all, it must also be economically feasible for them."
"This is because, without public acceptance, there will be no climate protection."
"This aspect, in particular, is an element I find to be missing from this report."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the negotiations in Cancún were relatively successful."
"Negotiations on climate change are progressing."
"Countries such as China have been waiting for the outcome from Cancún."
"They have been taking measures even since the failure in Copenhagen."
"If we do not invest in sectors such as energy performance and energy savings, we shall lose twice over."
"On the one hand, our households, our businesses and our public services will continue to pay absurd costs and, on the other, we risk losing the lead in the green economy in Europe."
"That is why we need to think that, if we are already having trouble competing with countries such as China, how will we be able to compete in future with a green China?"
"That is why it really is important for us to support a binding target for the European Union, in the aim of achieving 20% energy savings."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy efficiency policies implemented so far by the various Member States for 2020 will not enable us to achieve the target of a 20% reduction in energy consumption; we will be lucky to manage 10%, which is a decidedly disappointing result."
"If energy consumption continues to increase, achieving the 20% renewable energy target may also be in jeopardy, since that target is calculated as a proportion of the EU's final energy consumption."
"I am firmly in favour of setting a binding target for energy efficiency also, so as to ensure that Europe's climate and energy policies are mutually reinforcing."
"Unfortunately, the facts suggest that counting on the goodwill of individual Member States is not going to work."
"The European Union must show the way with clear and effective policies and objectives."
"Let us stop investing in new facilities to produce more energy, and let us plough our money and our efforts into the cleanest energy in the world, energy that we can avoid using."
"Lastly, I call for the adoption of Amendment 2, which calls on the Commission to launch an initiative on the energy performance of existing buildings in 2011."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy efficiency is the key word of our future economy, but it should be promoted, not imposed: the Member States must be brought on board to ensure that anyone who chooses to make his or her business or home more energy efficient is assisted in doing so."
"We cannot conceive of forcing private individuals to invest without convincing or encouraging them: improving energy efficiency means helping the environment and saving resources, but in such a sensitive area as this, it is crucial to combine these choices with European policies aimed at a single European energy market."
"Binding targets mean only unnecessary and very often ineffective expenditure; it is better to convince citizens, institutions and bodies that savings in this area have a bearing on people's security and quality of life, too."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our position is that the root of the climate change that has a growing influence these days does not exclusively lie in the environmental pollution caused by humanity."
"However, we all share the responsibility to put an end to the destruction of our environment, both locally and globally, and to make efforts to restore its original, healthy state to the best of our abilities."
"Accordingly, the call for energy efficiency is also welcome."
"The buildings we use are responsible for approximately 40% of the world's energy consumption, and therefore, addressing the matter of these buildings is of exceptional importance."
"We must take a step towards new, zero CO2 emission properties, and we must also find a solution for the problems of upgrading existing buildings in terms of energy efficiency."
"Additionally, we must continuously reduce the consumption and pollutant emissions of vehicles by urging the introduction of hybrid and fully electrical technologies."
"I am convinced that we, as Members of this House and politicians, must lead by example when it comes to energy efficiency."
"(RO) Mr President, I, too, would like to stress the importance of promoting energy efficiency as it can provide significant benefits for the whole economy."
"The social benefits must also be mentioned, which includes the creation of new jobs by 2020."
"I think that it is vital to develop and sell new, cutting-edge energy technologies."
"This is the way to maintain the competitiveness of energy intensive European businesses in the face of global competition."
"I support reaching an agreement on a common methodology for measuring national energy efficiency targets and monitoring progress on achieving them."
"I also welcome the Commission's work 'towards a single Energy network'."
"It ought to submit practical proposals to simplify and speed up authorisation procedures for infrastructure projects."
"Mr President, thank you to Mr Bendtsen for mentioning the construction industry in his opening remarks."
"I would just like to bring to his attention that my report on construction products will be voted upon in January and we did discuss energy efficiency in that report, too."
"However, two quick points."
"Mr Swoboda mentioned the importance of local authorities."
"I just wanted to bring to the House's attention the sensitivity at the moment, certainly in the UK, of budgetary cuts that are affecting local authorities."
"I think we need to bring that into the debate and the discussions which will come about."
"I also want to ask a question to the Commission."
"In the report we talk about the importance of smart meters and it gives a date of the end of 2011 for the minimum common functionalities."
"Will we be able to achieve this, Commissioner?"
"I am sorry we do not have anybody from the Presidency this evening, but I think that is important."
"I would also add to previous speakers in raising the issue about energy poverty, which I think all in this House would agree is vitally important to emphasise."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by endorsing Mr Swoboda's comment that implementation takes place on the spot - regionally and locally."
"In fact, we have manifold, mostly positive experience of refurbishment programmes - often with each euro of public money attracting six or seven euro of private investment."
"We will also need to examine whether our regional programmes can be involved in this."
"I find it difficult to imagine that a local authority would apply to the Commission directly for funding, but opening up the regional programmes to a greater extent to the vigorous refurbishment of the building stock would seem to me to be a very important step for the next funding period at the latest."
"There is then also the question of an interest-rate rebate on loans."
"Do we want to use public structural banks to reduce the interest rates for loans relating to the refurbishment of buildings?"
"There is also a point I would like to make in relation to building stock."
"It has been said a number of times that if you increase energy efficiency, you save money."
"That is true, but not immediately."
"If we look at Europe's housing stock, we can see that, on average, the required refurbishment for each dwelling - from windows, to active and passive insulation and right down to appropriate electric equipment and appropriate improvements to heating systems - would amount to EUR 30 000 to 60 000 per dwelling."
"You do not save the money in the first year."
"The result of this is that we need to invest for the next 10 years in order for energy expenditure to be reduced and reinvested for the next 40 years."
"In essence, this represents an intergenerational contract in reverse."
"Hitherto, my generation has built up enormous debts, as evinced by the currency problems we have been having."
"Now, for the first time, we have the opportunity to invest, through energy efficiency, so that in forthcoming decades, our children will reap the rewards via lower expenditure on energy."
"Can we do this?"
"Are we ready to do so?"
"I am counting on you."
"We need to lay down new priorities in relation to budgetary issues."
"Anyone who brings up energy efficiency refurbishment within the European budget also needs to address it from the point of view of the consequences."
"We will not receive any more money, so where do we want to reorganise?"
"That will be the crucial issue in relation to this subject at the European budgetary level, too."
"I have a second issue to raise as well."
"Two Members of this House, Messrs Jadot and Eickhout, have said that the basis is clear."
"I have to disagree, however: it is not clear."
"I say that with the decisions of the European Council on the table here."
"Incidentally, the last decision by the European Council from March of this year, which stated - and I quote - 'and moving towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency' is, in itself, something of a reduction in consistency."
"This is because 'moving towards 20%' also means that 18, 19 or 17% would also be sufficient."
"I am sticking by 20%, unchanged, although the European Council adopted something of a retreat from this for the first time in March."
"The decision of March 2007 refers to projections of energy consumption in 2020, which were to be cut by 20%."
"The body that supplies Europe with studies in this regard is PRIMES."
"I will cite three columns of figures to show you what problems we are facing in this connection, which have not been raised so far."
"Italy's energy consumption for 2007 was 173 million tonnes. The projection for 2020 was a rise to 208 million tonnes, from which the 20% was then to be subtracted."
"That then leaves Italy roughly where it was before."
"The projection goes up and the 20% is subtracted."
"Or let us take the example of a really small country - Luxembourg."
"Luxembourg's energy consumption for 2007 was 4.6 million tonnes. The forecast demand rises to 5.6 million tonnes, but that is then reduced to 4.5 million again."
"Or let us take Portugal as an example."
"The consumption for the reference year was 23.8 million tonnes, which then increases to 30 million, before being brought back down to 24 million. We urgently need to discuss the projections."
"This is the crucial point and it has been dealt with too briefly in the debate overall, country by country."
"Many of you have risen to advocate binding targets."
"I am an optimist and a realist."
"If we in the Commission were to put forward a binding target for each Member State, these would, today, be rejected by the Member States, of which we are all also citizens."
"There is thus no chance of us doing so, as we would then achieve nothing at all."
"Perhaps a two-stage plan, where we take the Member States with us, would be more realistic and more pertinent."
"In such a plan, I would instruct the Member States to now create national efficiency plans on a voluntary basis, but the 20% would apply all round."
"If we observe in two years' time that we have not made sufficiently consistent progress, then we will issue binding targets, which the Member States would then presumably not be in a position to reject."
"I ask you all to examine whether this - including to the knowledge of your governments - would not perhaps be the better European route for our common targets."
"Whether binding or voluntary, national action plans are required."
"We can examine the contents, the consistency and the impact of the plans from a policy point of view."
"We will also certainly not accept unchanged any plan whose contents do not meet our specifications."
"We would send back any such plan on a policy basis."
"Thank you all very much for today."
"I would be happy to return here to Parliament in March in order to formally launch the debate with a proposal."
"The report is an excellent first step towards this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for a constructive debate."
"If people are sitting and listening to this, it might seem as though there is a great deal of disagreement on energy efficiency."
"Binding targets or not, energy efficiency is something on which we need to take a stand."
"It is something that we need to do something about."
"I would like to point out that even though we have had a comprehensive debate on this subject - binding targets - the rapporteurs have, of course, also discussed the fact, and agreed, that it is important for us to ensure compliance with current EU legislation in this area."
"We have enacted legislation on a great many things."
"It is important that this legislation is complied with, and it is important that it is implemented."
"It is also important for us to take action in connection with urban development, buildings, the use of new energy technologies and in respect of a better product policy."
"Transport is also something that we need to take a stand on and, last but not least, it is important to get many of these energy initiatives financed in the future."
"From where I stand, there is still plenty of ripe fruit within reach that we have the opportunity to pick - in other words, opportunities to increase energy efficiency in Europe."
"Why is it so important now?"
"I will not repeat what my fellow Member, Mr Kariņš, from Latvia said in this context, namely, that Europe is paying out a great deal of money to both the Middle East and Russia."
"Could this money not be put to better use in Europe?"
"That is not all: there is no doubt that if Europe wants to lead the way in this area, it is necessary for us to invest."
"The investments will, of course, bring dividends in the form of higher employment, more innovative enterprises and new jobs - in particular, jobs for our small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe."
"Having said all that, I would like to thank all of those involved."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the relevant services."
"I would like to say that you have all been very willing to cooperate, and I would like to thank my own group, which has shown a great deal of trust and supported me right the way through the work on the report."
"I would also like to say thank you to the shadow rapporteurs for their extremely constructive cooperation, in which they also showed resistance."
"However, what is important now that we have come this far is that a clear signal is being sent from this Parliament to the Commission concerning the way we need to go in order to achieve energy efficiency in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Wednesday, 15 December 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Energy efficiency measures are vital so that the EU can achieve the targets it has set for itself for combating climate change."
"We have a target of cutting energy consumption by 20%."
"However, whereas we have directives for the other two objectives, clearly setting out how the target will be achieved, we have no such instrument for energy efficiency."
"This is why I insist on the need for an energy efficiency directive."
"Furthermore, to be able to achieve the results we want, energy efficiency must be promoted at every level, in every national and European policy."
"Innovation is one of the keys to success in this respect."
"This is why I think that the future Research Framework Programme ought to make energy efficiency a priority."
"Last but not least, I believe that public authorities must set an example in this respect and turn the buildings they own into energy efficient buildings."
"In addition, Member States can promote energy efficiency through the requirements stipulated in public procurement procedures."
"Therefore, priority must be given to businesses which use cleaner technologies."
"Finally, Member States can boost demand for green products using fiscal measures or subsidies compatible with the internal market."
"The Energy Efficiency Action Plan is not a competition in which obstacles and hurdles are placed in one's way, but the start of a cultural process, a key European policy objective aimed at influencing the behaviour of individuals and businesses."
"It is a process that is made easier not by strict constraints that create unaffordable costs for citizens and businesses, but by real incentives; a process that is realised by means of energy infrastructure, changing urban development, products, packaging and transport."
"I would point out that energy efficiency is considered to be the most cost-effective way of managing greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions resulting from energy production."
"Furthermore, according to a study carried out by Confindustria, the General Confederation of Italian Industry, in Italy alone, energy efficiency could have a socio-economic impact on the entire national economy worth some EUR 238 billion and could increase the value of total production, with an associated rise in employment of around 1.6 million standard work units, in the period 2010-2020."
"I therefore consider it vital not only to channel investment into this sector, but also to ensure the effective implementation and strengthening of the European instruments available."
"Energy efficiency, in the most general terms, is the restriction of individual consumption by rationalising appliance use."
"Essential opportunities for increasing gross energy efficiency are, however, to be found in physical and chemical industrial processes, which are based on: 1) better use of heat streams from fossil or nuclear fuels by a) transferring Carnot cycle conversion to a higher temperature and pressure, b) using appropriate recuperation of waste heat, e.g. in cogeneration processes; 2) reducing Ohm resistance during the transmission of current; 3) reducing heat resistance in heat exchangers; 4) increasing heat resistance by using insulating materials in construction; 5) reducing friction resistance; 6) reducing magnetic field losses; 7) shortening excessively long energy conversion chains."
"The political goal of 3x20 by 2020 does not therefore relate merely to limiting energy use by 20% gross, for example, as a result of price increases, as this would only cause a fall in living standards, but rather by means of rationalisation, which would allow 20% more useful work to be obtained from the same amount of primary energy."
"Appropriate methods for Member States to evaluate the implementation of this political goal will therefore be needed."
"The revision of the 2006 Energy Efficiency Action Plan is an increasingly urgent task since, in connection with the EU's 20-20-20 targets, the lack of progress is most evident in the area of energy efficiency targets."
"Many initiatives already point in the right direction, but the present achievements are still dwarfed by the range of unexploited possibilities."
"Europe has just begun to recognise its lack of progress, and has realised that it cannot afford the luxury of taking the development of energy efficiency lightly."
"Such investments can reduce emissions more cheaply than any other solutions, and can immediately invigorate the economy."
"One sign of a positive turning point is that on the basis of the European Parliament's decision, even the hitherto unused resources of the Economic Recovery Programme can be used for energy efficiency developments and green investments."
"The Energy 2020 strategy published by the European Commission in November also ranks energy efficiency as the highest priority."
"Now it is the Bendtsen report that formulates specific recommendations as to how we could exploit our possibilities more effectively."
"I am glad that innovative solutions such as smart grids and ESCOs that implement investments producing a return on energy efficiency have also been included in the report."
"However, financing still remains the most important issue."
"Energy efficiency aids must be included in future long-term EU budgets as well, having particular regard to the building reconstruction programmes of the former socialist countries."
"This is the area where impressive savings can be realised with relatively small outlay."
"Energy efficiency is one of the key priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy and the Energy Strategy for Europe 2011-2020, which also makes the submitted report highly important and topical in relation to the recent summit in Cancún."
"The report builds on the Energy Efficiency Action Plan from 2006, calls on the Commission to update this plan, to revise the directive on energy services and also to establish binding targets to achieve a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020."
"The report discusses arguments for the advantages of greater energy efficiency: social (potential creation of 1 million jobs or decline in energy poverty in the EU), economic (potential energy savings of up to EUR 100 billion), strategic (retaining the competitiveness of European companies through energy savings) and, last but not least, energy security (greater energy self-sufficiency for the EU)."
"The report includes recommendations in the area of energy infrastructure, the development of towns and buildings, information and communications products, tenders and financing."
"In my opinion, the role of the funding sources (the Structural Funds, the ELENA instrument of the European Investment Bank, national funds for energy efficiency, etc.) in financing energy efficiency projects is particularly important."
"Overall, I think that the report submitted by Mr Bendtsen contains an accurate analysis of this issue, as well as relevant recommendations on energy efficiency, and I therefore recommend approving it in its proposed form."
"It is the essential interest of the EU, and of all its Member States, to make the most of as little energy as possible."
"In doing so, the dependency on external energy can be reduced, energy security can be increased, and so can the competitiveness of the European Union."
"Energy efficiency must therefore have special priority in the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, and the drawing of as much of the energy funds as possible should be made conditional to its principle."
"In accordance with the targets undertaken under the Europe 2020 strategy (from 2005 onwards), Hungary's National Action Plan envisions very serious steps in the field of both energy produced from renewable sources and energy efficiency."
"The Energy Efficiency Credit Fund (EHA) has been in operation since 1991, and has been lending support to the energy efficiency investments of the citizens."
"Moreover, the Hungarian Government is planning to improve the energy efficiency of the biggest public sector consumers by 60% through the upgrading of public institutions (including the installation of solar collectors and the modernisation of insulation and heating systems) on the basis of the draft Complex Building Energy and Climate Protection Programme."
"These are great plans, but their implementation has been seriously jeopardised by the financial and economic crisis that continues to this day."
"Therefore, we must ask the Commission to pay serious attention to national action plans and their implementation, and to ensure that the EU directives adopted thus far are transposed into national legislation, as the implementation of the 2020 energy strategy and the achievement of the CO2 emission reduction targets can depend on this."
"Other than that, progress in this area can only be expected through the joint application of the appropriate financial instruments and the establishment of a suitable legislative framework."
"An increase in energy efficiency contributes directly to an improvement in energy security for the whole of the EU."
"If changes are introduced properly, they will result in reduced emissions of pollutants."
"This is definitely a very positive direction for development, which supports our efforts to combat climate change."
"Using up-to-date technologies in the modernisation of infrastructure will also ensure financial savings and, as a result, economic growth in EU Member States."
"Thanks to this, as the rapporteur himself emphasises, new jobs will be created not only in urban areas but also in local markets and in the countryside."
"Of course, all these goals will initially require appropriate resources and investment."
"However, I think that it is absolutely worth ensuring that Europe has an energy saving, efficient and environmentally-friendly economy."
"The European Union needs to take action to secure the future of its energy provision and protect its vital energy interests."
"Energy efficiency measures play a crucial role in achieving this by guaranteeing that the climate and energy targets set are achieved at the lowest possible cost."
"I think that wide-ranging consultations need to be initiated with local and regional representatives in order to set out well defined guidelines on energy efficiency and support must be provided in devising projects and ensuring access to the EUR 9 billion made available by the Commission via the cohesion policy."
"The smart use of these funds will enable us to achieve the 20% energy efficiency target, which will help, to a large degree, to meet the European Union's objectives on sustainability and competitiveness."
"Furthermore, decreasing consumption through energy efficiency is the most sustainable way of reducing dependency on fossil fuels and will bring about a significant drop in imports (approximately 25-26%)."
"Concerning the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, one of the most effective means of reducing emissions of CO2 and other gases is energy efficiency."
"It also has enormous benefits in the fields of job creation and economic growth."
"Since the adoption of the 2006 Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the economic environment has undergone significant changes."
"Therefore, I definitely consider the revision of EU energy efficiency policy, and its alignment with our current priorities, to be a necessary step."
"I am of the opinion that we should use the document evaluating the results and shortcomings of the 2006 Action Plan as the basis for this evaluation."
"We must do everything in order to be able to meet the 20% target set out in our Europe 2020 strategy."
"While values pertaining to emissions and renewable energy sources are easily measurable, data on energy efficiency are more difficult to calculate."
"In this, we need the assistance of the Commission."
"Through the statistical data supplied by the Commission, we will be able to track the changes of our energy policy."
"It is commonly known that the energy efficiency of buildings also holds considerable opportunities."
"We must therefore urge the upgrading of our existing buildings, since the proportion of new buildings being constructed is declining."
"There are numerous buildings, mainly in Central European countries, which, after appropriate renovation, could have serious potential in terms of efficiency."
"As regards legislative measures in support of energy efficient solutions, the US and China are far ahead of us."
"We must do everything in order to minimise our disadvantage."
"The European Union and the Member States must support measures and means for increasing financing in this area."
"Although the European Union has set targets for reducing energy consumption by 20% by 2020, these are not binding, unlike targets in the areas of reducing emissions and renewables."
"Member States are therefore not sufficiently motivated to achieve the best possible results in the area of energy efficiency."
"The technology and the practical processes for improving energy efficiency already exist, but since there will be no binding targets, these projects will not be properly financed and, consequently, will not be implemented."
"If the EU were to achieve its target by 2020, however, that would mean financial savings of up to EUR 78 billion a year."
"Apart from reducing dependence on imports of oil and natural gas, thereby boosting energy supply security, this would also mean significant savings for households."
"I consider this factor to be highly important, because the number of people living in so-called energy poverty, where electricity and gas bills swallow up most of the family budget, is currently growing."
"If binding targets were set, however, households could save up to EUR 1 000 annually, according to figures from the European Commission."
"Besides greater competitiveness, improved energy efficiency would also boost the creation of permanent jobs and would lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 780 million tonnes, which is more than is required under the Kyoto Protocol."
"in writing. - The benefits of reducing energy consumption and dependence in Europe would be, at once, economic, environmental and political."
"The Energy Efficiency Action Plan therefore has far-reaching implications."
"I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Environment Committee on the contribution of ICT to energy efficiency, and I know that one of the most important tasks here is to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources into the power supply."
"Smart grids can help to achieve this, whilst smart metering in households can make us conscious of when we can save energy and so help us to reduce consumption."
"The Commission needs to focus properly on these two elements in the Action Plan, and the Member States need to give their full support to installing the infrastructure needed to make it happen, if necessary, through public procurement contracts."
"in writing. - Energy efficiency (EE) is the most cost-efficient measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Through lower energy consumption, we are less dependent on imports of oil and gas and their varying prices."
"It is of crucial importance to focus investment on energy efficiency and to limit the money we spend on oil and gas imports."
"That money should create jobs in our SMEs, agriculture, forestry sector and industry."
"The Commission's estimates showed that a 20% increase in EE could potentially create as many as a million new jobs in Europe and an average household can save at least EUR 1 000 per year."
"A lot has been achieved since the last EEAP, but there is no evidence that the target can be met by 2020."
"New instruments towards boosting energy savings should be introduced at EU and national level with the emphasis on two main areas: renovation of existing buildings and measures to boost financing."
"Old buildings have the highest efficiency potential and the appropriate financial instruments to utilise that potential are missing."
"These two issues should be properly addressed in the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan in order to get things moving as desired."
"Repeal of directives regarding metrology (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Anja Weisgerber, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Directives 71/317/EEC, 71/347/EEC, 71/349/EEC, 74/148/EEC, 75/33/EEC, 76/765/EEC, 76/766/EEC and 86/217/EEC regarding metrology - C6-0467/2008 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, those who helped produce this report and everyone who contributed to this splendid result."
"Without the constructive and very open collaboration with both the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, it would not be possible to conclude this package tomorrow."
"As I am sure you can imagine, I am very satisfied with this result."
"The repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe."
"What is interesting in said directives is that they largely became obsolete because they have already been replaced by international standards that represent the latest state of the art."
"Member State rules and regulations are often rendered obsolete by harmonised European rules and regulations, after all."
"In this case, European rules and regulations have become superfluous thanks to international stipulations."
"If we want to make progress towards our target of having 25% less bureaucracy in Europe by 2012, we need to nail our colours to the mast now."
"To put it in the words of the Chair of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, Edmund Stoiber, we in Europe must not only purse our lips, we need to whistle loudly."
"In other words, our words must be followed up by tangible action."
"When it comes to that action, the devil is often in the detail, however."
"This directive repealing eight directives relating to metrology has shown this clearly once again."
"Measuring instruments for cold water meters for non-clean water, alcohol meters, certain weights, tyre pressure gauges and equipment to measure the standard mass of grain or the size of ship tanks have been replaced, in practice, by more modern digital equipment."
"The outdated equipment is used increasingly rarely and the rules governing such equipment can thus be abolished."
"There are also no consequences for the functioning of the internal market or for the high standard of consumer protection, which remains of great importance to us."
"Yet the Council has been blocking this package for some time."
"We have managed, however, to reach a reasonable compromise between the Council and Parliament in the informal trialogue, and even to do so at first reading - which is always the exception rather than the rule for us."
"The substance of that agreement is as follows: one directive - namely that concerning the calibration of ship tanks - is to be repealed immediately, which is to say, with effect from 1 July 2011, while the remaining seven directives will be repealed once the recast version of the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which the Commission is currently working on, has been adopted."
"The idea is that the Commission, when reviewing the MID, will also examine whether and, if so, what elements from the old directives should be retained and should therefore be incorporated into the MID to that end."
"If the Member States provide evidence that certain elements within the seven directives are still necessary, for example, on consumer protection grounds, such as provisions from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles, these sections will be incorporated into the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive."
"Once the recast version of the MID has been adopted, the remaining directives will be repealed."
"This is a signal that Europe is serious about cutting red tape and that we are eager to create the conditions for sustainable economic growth."
"I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is doing its bit, in this way, to help cut red tape and to produce better, more streamlined and simpler lawmaking."
"Allow me just to conclude with a brief word about the correlation tables."
"These are the tables that the Member States are supposed to draw up in order to document how they have implemented the directive."
"In the end, we agreed on a less strict wording in this regard."
"We fought for stricter wordings in future, however, and we achieved our goal in this regard."
"The Conference of Presidents will champion this cause accordingly to the Council and the Commission."
"This represents a success that we have the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs to thank for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating and thanking Mrs Weisgerber for the in-depth work she has done on an intricate and complicated proposal, which has been at the centre of a long debate; her work has therefore not been easy, and the fact that it has been possible to reach an agreement at first reading shows the rapporteur's skill in securing a good agreement."
"This decision certainly marks an important stage in the area of simplification and smart regulation."
"Better regulation must be something that the European institutions increasingly strive for, and the Commission is completely unanimous in wanting to focus on ever better European regulation."
"As the rapporteur pointed out, this proposal will actually repeal eight obsolete directives relating to six categories of legal measuring instruments, based on the fact that the instruments covered by the directive in question are now obsolete and that corresponding trade is falling."
"Furthermore, there are no barriers to trade in technically more advanced substitute products, which do not fall within the scope of the directives."
"In future, Member States may wish to enact national rules."
"However, this will not create new barriers to trade since there are international standards that already fully regulate these old instruments and most of the more advanced substitute products as well."
"Pursuant to the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Member States must base their legislation on these international standards."
"The Treaty on European Union stipulates that Member States must also mutually recognise equivalent products legally sold in another Member State."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the first-reading compromise between Parliament and the Council, which provides for the repeal of one directive by July 2011 and of the other seven directives by December 2015."
"Lastly, the Commission emphasises the joint statement made by the three institutions and states its willingness to re-examine the arguments in favour of harmonisation presented during the legislative process."
"As stated, we will refer to those arguments by the end of April 2011 and, where appropriate, submit the legislative proposal in accordance with the principles of better regulation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the rapporteur's position in relation to the Commission proposal to repeal eight directives in the field of metrology."
"In particular, I welcome the proposal concerning the advisability of giving Member States sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences of a repeal in the context of the review of the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID)."
"Indeed, while I support the general aims of better regulation and simplification, which are also promoted by the Lisbon Strategy, I think it is imperative to give the Member States the time they need to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty."
"This situation would actually help ease the concerns expressed by the various Member States about not having a reasonable amount of time to tackle the legal vacuum that a repeal would create."
"This is therefore an excellent compromise between the position adopted by the Commission, which is in favour of a full repeal of all the directives and against new regulations in this area within the framework of the MID, and the critical positions initially adopted by the Member States with regard to this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Weisgerber for the truly collegial collaboration that we enjoyed."
"I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that I am far from euphoric about the repeal of these eight directives."
"There are, in fact, a number of outdated measuring instruments for which the rules and regulations are being abolished, but we have noted in the debates that the devil is in the detail, as you yourself have said."
"It therefore was not always clear whether this route really was the right one to choose."
"My group will vote in favour of this compromise in light of the fact that we have obtained an assurance from the Commission that it will examine the idea of properly incorporating these measurement instruments into the European Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which is, of course, being drawn up at the moment, where necessary."
"This commitment to investigate - this, too, I am assuming - will also be taken very seriously and given earnest consideration."
"We are voting for the compromise on this condition, well aware that there are still one or two issues that need to be investigated."
"As for the correlation tables, I would like to say, at this point, that we have now stated that we are ready to accept the mild wording that is currently to be found in this text but that this is one of the last documents in which we have accepted this, as, for us, this really is about European law, which is created once the Member States have given their consent, being truly and properly implemented."
"We can only check that, however, if we have the information, and we only get the information from these correlation tables."
"We will continue to work towards that, at all events."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the other colleagues who have contributed to this dossier."
"Although it had initially appeared to be a very technical dossier, in the end, it was very clear that the political decision would find a solution for this report."
"There is a need to simplify the acquis communautaire by repealing those directives which contain provisions on means of measurement that are no longer used as a result of technical progress and the use of international standards."
"The Commission's approach is reasonable."
"If the mutual recognition principle ensures free movement and no specific barrier exists, then no further additions are needed and the technical specifications should be adopted by the Member States."
"However, the repeal of the directive should not lead to any new barriers to free movement or to additional administrative burdens."
"We also need to ensure that there will be no gaps between the old directives being repealed and the 2004 directive on measuring instruments."
"Furthermore, the first reading report adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection enabled the inclusion of provisions on the measuring instruments covered by the directives being repealed in the general Measurements Instruments Directive."
"The Member States have been given more time to investigate whether the repealing of the directives will lead to legal uncertainty."
"The report includes a provision that the Commission shall evaluate whether the measuring instruments falling within the scope of the repealed directives need to be included in the scope of the Measurements Instruments Directive."
"Taking account of the fact that a horizontal decision has also been taken regarding correlation tables, together with other shadow rapporteurs, I propose to support the text agreed at the first reading with the Council."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling cooperation."
"I think I can keep this brief as all the essential points have actually already been addressed."
"Clearly, our group will support the compromise, but we are also working on the assumption that the Commission will take another critical look at things in the review of the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID)."
"Clearly, we support the fact that this compromise on the correlation tables was found."
"This compromise has a time limit on it, however, and in future, the Council must react much more strongly."
"We are no longer prepared to give way."
"Ultimately, it must also be possible to monitor the Member States and for that, we urgently need correlation tables."
"Mr President, from the outset, I have personally supported the original Commission proposal to repeal all eight directives without compensation."
"I believe that the Commission proposal was a prime example of the right way to simplify European law and promote the approach of 'better regulation'."
"We should not push for harmonisation in all areas at any price."
"We should think about other regulatory instruments than just EU regulations, such as international standards, for example."
"We should also deploy these alternative regulatory instruments in cases where they would be more effective."
"With the introduction of regulations in the area of metrology, I would prefer a voluntary system of mutual recognition of national regulations, based on international standards, rather than a top-down centralised harmonisation."
"I am sorry that Parliament, along with certain Member States, does not support this exceptional and liberal approach of the Commission, preferring instead a conservative approach to eliminating excessive regulation."
"Despite everything, however, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for the effort she has devoted to finding a common compromise solution."
"I applaud her personal enthusiasm, thanks to which the Commission proposal did not disappear from view, and part of the original intention at least has come through."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of the report on metrology."
"It is a very technical text and one on which we have been waiting to vote in plenary for months."
"The report, which sailed through the competent committee, was submitted last March, and the situation has dragged on for so long because an agreement on the associated correlation tables had to be reached within the Council, between the 27 Member States."
"The real problem is that the European Commission has still not presented the proposal for a directive on measuring instruments, which should supersede the obsolete directives that we are repealing today and regulate this matter once and for all."
"I wish to criticise the Commission for having reached the stage where it is abolishing the obsolete directives without having presented, at the same time, a proposal to revise the Measuring Instruments Directive."
"Such behaviour is unjustifiable, and it is a long way from meeting the needs of businesses and citizens."
"At the same time, I would criticise the excessive fear of those who believe that the law of the Member States is incapable of filling the gap during the vacatio legis."
"Fortunately, European businesses have a system of international standards for the sector that is independent of, and goes beyond, EU rules."
"Therefore, the fears of a disaster happening in the period between the promulgation and entry into force of the directives are unfounded."
"Businesses will fill the legislators' gaps with their trade organisations, with their skills, with the rules that they have set themselves in order to create a dynamic and balanced market."
"We must remember our businesses, which continue to operate in Europe with great difficulty."
"We must stop squeezing them with taxes, red tape and absurd requests."
"Sometimes, work is done swiftly in Parliament."
"Common sense and a desire to reach agreements with the other European institutions transcend political divisions."
"(CS) Mr President, the eight obsolete directives on measuring instruments are not, at first sight, an interesting political topic, but in fact, their repeal represents the concrete fulfilment of the principle of subsidiarity, as well as an effort for 'better regulation'."
"In the area of metrology, there are already international agreements which were made necessary by the globalisation of science and trade, and any harmonisation at the European level is therefore really not necessary."
"I applaud the responsible approach of the rapporteur, Anja Weisgerber, who decided, on the one hand, to support the Commission proposal for a complete repeal of the directives, while leaving time in the case of seven of them for the relevant Member State metrological institutes to perform an analysis of the implications for national legislation."
"The solution, which we will surely approve tomorrow, will therefore also be an interesting test for other directives, as to whether the mutual recognition of regulations at the national level will be sufficient and will not lead to legal uncertainty, and will therefore be more advantageous than an amendment or full harmonisation."
"Personally, I would be surprised if Member States gave preference to harmonisation."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on achieving full support in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I would like to thank her for negotiating a consistent position with the Council."
"Mr President, first of all, I want to join in the thanks to Anja Weisgerber who is a stalwart member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and has done a number of these very technical reports with great diligence, and this is a good example of that."
"I think that when she started on this work, which was soon after the elections last year, we all felt that what appeared at first sight to be a deceptively simple proposal from the Commission to repeal what appeared on the surface to be outdated legislation would probably be dealt with relatively quickly and without much argument."
"The time that this has taken and the relative complexity of the solution show that deregulation and cutting red tape are nothing like as easy as people think."
"It is very easy to come up with these facile phrases about deregulation, but in the real world, there are always people who want to keep regulation in place."
"As soon as this proposal hit the Council, we began to realise some of the deep-seated problems that existed from country to country."
"There were countries which had problems with measuring the weight of ships, or alcohol meters, or tyre pressure gauges."
"Everyone had their own particular issue."
"My conclusion overall is not about the value of the proposal, because in a few months, we will have the alternative proposal which will effectively make this one outdated, and we could almost have waited for that."
"My appeal to the Commissioner is that the Commission does need to look at its impact assessment and its homework on deregulation proposals much more deeply and get Member States to engage with them before coming up with these proposals."
"On reflection I think we could have spent more time on that had we been allowed to do so."
"It is a success for the committee, but I would say a qualified success, and we need to learn the lessons from that as we go forward."
"Mr President, I, too, welcome the rapporteur's proposals and certainly we are living in a much smaller world than ever before."
"Interaction between people is far greater, and that is set to continue rapidly into the future, so obviously the more harmonisation we have in measurement instruments, the better."
"I certainly welcome the repeal of the metrology directives and cutting red tape by 25%."
"Sometimes, I think we underestimate the ability of people to adapt."
"I saw in my country how easily we adapted from the old pounds, shillings and pence to the euro and cents, and also only in recent years from miles to kilometres in terms of travel and speed limits."
"This has made life easier for many people and will continue to do so."
"I think this is a step in the right direction, so congratulations again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to everyone who spoke during the debate, because it means that there is interest in this proposal for simplification."
"That is why I wish to emphasise once again the advantages entailed by this choice and, hence, the benefits to be had from it."
"I am talking here about advantages for consumers, instrument manufacturers and national administrations."
"I also wish to assure you, in response to the specific issue raised by Mrs Gebhardt, that the Commission is ready to conduct the studies necessary to re-examine the arguments in favour of harmonisation by April 2011."
"In response to Mr Rossi, who criticised the Commission but has now left the Chamber - after making a criticism one would do well to listen to the response, too - there is a joint statement by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on this matter, which reads, and I quote: 'in accordance with Article 25 of Directive 2004/22/EC on measuring instruments, the Commission is invited, by the European Parliament and by the Council, to report, before 30 April 2011, on the implementation of that directive and to submit, where appropriate, a legislative proposal'."
"As I said in my speech at the start of the debate, I intend to abide by that statement."
"Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for your commitment and cooperation."
"Lastly, on the subject of correlation tables, the Commission supports Parliament's position."
"Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, including my appreciation of their valuable contributions to the debate tonight."
"After the vote in the morning, we need to shift our focus to the future."
"Naturally, we are looking forward to seeing how the individual rules and regulations turn out - the Commission has now announced that it will table its proposal for the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) by the end of April."
"It will then also be possible to check whether any of the individual legislative regimes that we are removing from circulation are to be incorporated."
"It is important, as Mrs Comi also said, that no legal vacuum arises."
"Mrs Gebhardt, I can tell you that that was also a very important concern for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and it was one that we were able to follow up on."
"For me, however, it is also important to mention that the Member States are required to document even more strictly why certain aspects or elements should be retained, as it is only in those circumstances that we really need European regulations; they are not an end in themselves."
"I am also looking forward to the Internet consultation that the Commission has announced and which will take place between 6 September and 1 November 2011."
"The consultation will also involve the companies affected, the authorities and so forth. Once again, I will be listening closely to businesses."
"When it comes to the existing directive, too, I checked whether these measuring instruments were still in use and, as it happened, the response every single time - for example, from my wine growing association, which I asked about alcohol meters - was that such items of equipment certainly are not used any longer."
"We therefore need to look very closely into this."
"If we really do want to make progress towards this target of cutting red tape in Europe by 25% by 2012 - and that, of course, is no longer very far away - we need to make major progress in this area."
"We, as Parliament, are ready to play a part."
"Finally, I just have one more thing to say about the correlation tables."
"I want to state, at this point, that, once again, what we have here is a compromise, but, with regard to the future, I would like to call on the Member States to commit to actually drawing up these tables because this really is about a uniform implementation of the rules and regulations throughout Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Wednesday, 15 December 2010)."
"Safety of toys (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on safety of toys by Andreas Schwab, Anja Weisgerber, Marianne Thyssen, Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Evelyne Gebhardt, Christel Schaldemose, Anna Hedh, Barbara Weiler, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Cristian Silviu Buşoi, Jürgen Creutzmann, Antonyia Parvanova, Nadja Hirsch, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Heide Rühle, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists - B7-0658/2010)."
"Mr President, in relation to the adoption of the Toys Directive, I would like to point out that, when we adopted the directive, we had an objective in mind, namely, making children's toys safer, as children, in particular, still growing and developing as they are, have a particularly sensitive reaction to hazardous substances and chemicals."
"Considering the most up-to-date scientific knowledge at that point, we laid down the strictest requirements anywhere in the world for toys through European legislation."
"As every year, this issue comes to the fore in the run-up to Christmas, and for me personally, too, as a mother-to-be, this issue is one that is close to my heart, and I think it is very important that we have the strictest standards."
"That is why I helped initiate this debate."
"I did so in the light of new expert opinions that have concluded that the strictest limit values for heavy metals are not strict enough, given the latest scientific knowledge."
"We included a clause in the directive specifically for cases like this, which makes it possible to modify and tighten up the limit values at a later date, and we now need to make use of that clause."
"Commissioner Tajani, that was something that we also called on your predecessor to do a year ago."
"I am pleased that, as I understand it, the Commission is to announce today, at least, that the limit values for certain heavy metals are to be tightened up, albeit with a delay from when we called on it to do so and certainly encouraged by the debate today."
"In general, however, we need to review all hazardous substances, and we should not, therefore, restrict ourselves to the heavy metals."
"Instead, we need to look into the latest information on the hazardous substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)."
"Should it also turn out that it is necessary to amend the limit values in order to protect our children, I call for a rectification of the legislation in this regard, too."
"At the end of the day, this is about the safety of our children."
"Mr President, year after year, we have this debate about the safety of toys."
"Year after year, we have to observe that there is still much that is in need of improvement."
"We are talking, here, amongst other things, about what are known as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMRs), substances that cause cancer and that may be very hazardous to the health and, in some cases, even the life of children."
"The new information does indeed show that we need to ensure that the limit values are adapted and we are calling on the Commission to finally do so."
"Commissioner, I really hope that this will actually happen."
"This is not the only problem, however."
"There is another problem in the shape of market supervision, and the Member States, too, have a responsibility here."
"They have a responsibility to ensure that only toys that truly satisfy the safety standards that we have adopted reach the market."
"That is not always the case, which is highly regrettable."
"We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved."
"The third and final point that I wish to make relates to the marking of toys."
"Many people wrongly believe that the CE mark is an indicator of safety."
"It is not, however, as the Commission itself says."
"It is therefore time, Commissioner, that the Commission gave some thought to how we could issue a European safety mark that is truly reliable and that is monitored by third parties, independent authorities or bodies, so that a dangerous toy simply cannot make it onto the market or into the shops where it can threaten the health of our children."
"I believe that we have a major debt to discharge in this regard, and there is still much that we need to do, and urgently so."
"author. - Mr President, the safety of toys is a subject of great importance, and not only because it is the time of year when sales of toys increase substantially."
"It is our duty as the representatives of EU citizens to ensure that we are looking after the best interests of consumers and protecting children."
"The revised Directive 2009/48/EC is meant to assure consumers that toys sold in the EU fulfil the highest safety requirements worldwide, especially those relating to the use of chemical substances."
"Market surveillance measures have been reinforced."
"The documentation which toy manufacturers and importers have to keep available for inspection now has to contain a detailed description of the design and manufacture of the toy, specific information on the components and materials used in the toy as well as an analysis of the hazards that the toy may present."
"However, concerns are raised by the scientific opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks on the evaluation of the migration limits for chemical elements in toys, which states that the method used to measure the migration of chemical elements is not really reliable."
"We therefore require clarification of the calculation method chosen to regulate CMR - chemical substances in toys."
"There is also cause for concern regarding toys designed for children under the age of three."
"Since this is the most vulnerable age group, toys designed for these children should be tested independently."
"The latest RAPEX reports also underline problems concerning market surveillance for toys."
"There are still a large number of toys entering the EU market that pose a high risk to the most vulnerable consumers."
"There are clear signals that the revised Toy Safety Directive needs to be strengthened in order to assure the highest level of protection for our children."
"We consider that these issues need to be addressed as soon as possible, making sure that there are no loopholes following the implementation of the revised directive."
"We need to remain focused on toy safety, market surveillance and the prevention of the use of hazardous substances in products specifically designed for children."
"author. - Mr President, I think the importance of the question that we are addressing tonight is the fact that this committee continues to be extremely vigilant about issues related to the safety of toys, as indeed it does on the whole gamut of consumer goods."
"So we put a huge amount of effort into passing the revised Toys Directive in 2009."
"But things do not stop there, and that is why I think it is a welcome opportunity to give you, the Commission, the chance to reassure us that you are keeping a very close eye on developments, on test results, and ensuring that the provisions of the existing legislation and the future legislation will continue to be updated to reflect the growing amount of scientific evidence about potentially hazardous chemicals."
"And that, of course, includes the need for consistent testing methods."
"Part of the issue here is that, in many cases, we find that toy manufacturers are faced with difficulties about getting some consistent standards against which to test, and I know that is something that you will address."
"But I also want to pick up the broader issue because I think, as a number of my colleagues have said, the issue here is not just about the regulation; it is about the whole supply chain for toys, much of which come from outside the European Union."
"I was recently invited by your colleague, Commissioner Dalli, to represent the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection at a major trilateral summit between the Americans and the Europeans in China to talk about toy safety."
"And one of the important things that we did there and that the European Commission did - and I give them credit - was to talk to Chinese manufacturers about designing safety into the product from the beginning: the knowledge of those directives."
"This is nothing to do with marking, it is nothing to do with third-party testing; it is actually the basic principles of transferring information and knowledge so that we get safety designed into the products from the beginning."
"And then those safe products are sustained in production by proper quality systems, not just for the toy itself, but for all its suppliers."
"Now that is how we ensure safety."
"It is not going to be about marking."
"It is about the right regulatory framework, which means getting everybody in the supply chain to understand their responsibilities."
"Mr President, I have a comment that I would like to direct to Mr Harbour."
"That sounds great, Mr Harbour, but I still think that we have some work to do on our side, too."
"It cannot be a coincidence that we debate the issue of toy safety in Parliament in the run-up to each Christmas, as we are doing again this year."
"Just last year, it was the carcinogenic substances in toys known as softening agents that we were debating."
"Commissioner Verheugen promised us specifically over the last year that there would be new studies and that he would take action where appropriate."
"These studies have been on the table since the middle of this year."
"According to the study by SCHER, the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, the limit values for the PAHs - the carcinogenic substances - are too high."
"The methods of testing, too, are not reliable enough."
"We need to give this some thought."
"My questions to the Commissioner are, how will he deal with what he has inherited in this regard and what action will he take as a result of this criticism and in this field?"
"The limit values for heavy metals, too, especially for lead, are 'no longer appropriate', to quote another SCHER study."
"What does that mean for us?"
"If we make adjustments for the heavy metals, will we provide different limit values in the comitology procedure?"
"I call on the Commission to take action in this area, too."
"In addition, we are also still awaiting the promised limit values for noise made by toys that is deleterious to health."
"We were promised these values when we passed the first reading; they should be presented to us soon."
"I hope that we will have these values soon."
"Last but not least, I would also like, once again, to come back to the issue of market supervision, as the best directives are only worth as much as their market supervision, which ultimately ensures the monitoring of compliance with the directives, and of course, to the tariff issue."
"Mr Tajani knows, of course, that we would be happy to collaborate with him in this area."
"In the shape of Mrs Schaldemose, we have a rapporteur who is looking to bring about further moves in this very area."
"We will work closely together on this."
"This will be the next important step, alongside the issue of the limit value for heavy metals and for carcinogens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate in plenary on the safety of toys in the European Union could not have come at a better time than this year, especially in the light of the recent events that have seen countries such as Belgium withdraw various types of puzzle mat from the market because the concentration of formamide, a chemical substance classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction, was high enough to be deemed a risk to children's health, and other countries, such as France, accordingly step up their market surveillance of these same products."
"At the moment, we are awaiting notification of the measures taken by the national authorities, and then we will see to it that the data provided are analysed immediately by our scientific committees."
"If it is confirmed as a result of these tests, as a result of scientific data, that such concentrations of formamide do indeed present a risk to children's health, then acting under the committee procedure, we will take all the measures necessary to amend the provisions of the directive accordingly."
"The directive - and here I wish to reassure Mr Harbour - does indeed provide for this mechanism, which means that it can be constantly updated to reflect the latest available scientific data."
"As Mrs Weisgerber mentioned, the Commission, for example, has already made these amendments for certain chemical substances, such as lead and cadmium, so that their values are in line with the latest scientific data."
"These amendments will be scrutinised in accordance with the regulatory procedure; hence, Parliament will be fully involved in this work."
"However, over and above the mechanisms provided for by the committee procedure - and I am addressing Mrs Rühle here - I personally undertake to keep you constantly informed of the progress of the work on these two substances."
"With regard to the other specific issues raised in the question tabled, I would like to start with the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, which refers to a study conducted by the Joint Research Centre to analyse the methodology used in laboratories to identify traces of heavy metals such as lead in toys."
"These analyses were carried out in accordance with the EN 71-3 standard."
"According to the study, 40 laboratories took part in the analysis, 15 of which are bodies notified by the Member States as being qualified to assess the conformity of toys within the meaning of the directive."
"Only three out of 40 laboratories misinterpreted the results of the analyses."
"The Commission has sent the results of these studies to the Member States that notified the names of the laboratories and to the laboratories themselves, inviting them to take the appropriate measures."
"The study in question has also been sent to the European Committee for Standardisation so that it can be incorporated in the review of the EN 71-3 standard, which is currently under way."
"The aim of the review is to establish a new standard by the deadline set, namely 2013, for applying the new provisions on chemical substances."
"As regards the new directive on toys, adopted in May 2009, it is based on a new legislative framework for the marketing of products and it provides for greater market surveillance."
"The Member States are bound to provide the instruments necessary to ensure that only safe products are accessible to European consumers."
"They have an obligation both to strengthen border controls and to ensure that their inspectorates monitor effectively products that have already been placed on the European market."
"Lastly, should the Member States discover any irregularities in toys, they must immediately notify the other countries of this information via RAPEX, the EU rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products."
"Mr Harbour, the Commission is cooperating very closely with the Chinese authorities, in particular, with regard to the safety of toys."
"European and Chinese experts on the subject meet regularly to exchange information on applicable legislation and standards, and on administrative practices, too."
"The Chinese authorities' inspectors are receiving training with a view to improving the quality control of products."
"As regards chemical substance limits, Mr Buşoi, it is true that a migration-based method is preferable from a scientific point of view, because it is based on the real risk to which children are exposed."
"However, setting migration limits means assessing the risk and the exposure to risk, as well as permitting acceptable daily intakes in order to calculate those limits."
"Given the large number of chemical substances - more than 1 000 - and the lack of sufficient information on all of them, we cannot implement this method with the scientific knowledge we currently possess."
"That being said, the directive already lays down migration limits for some chemical substances for which scientific information is available and permits, again via the committee procedure, the future introduction of migration limits should further scientific data be made available for other new substances."
"Mrs Rühle, as regards compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, these substances can be found in various consumer goods and not just in toys."
"Hence, the possibility of adopting specific measures has now been tested within the framework of the REACH Regulation, which has a broader scope, and this appears to be the most consistent and effective method."
"Toys intended for use by children under three years of age are subject to stricter rules."
"Children below that age are more vulnerable and require greater protection."
"Should there be any doubt about the age group for which a toy is intended, the manufacturer must apply the most rigorous standards."
"However, there does not appear to be any justification for making all toys subject to the same restrictions as toys intended for babies."
"The exposure to risk and the way in which those toys are used are not, in fact, the same."
"Furthermore, certain categories of toys that are intended for older children and for which no risks or accidents have been recorded would end up simply being banned."
"This method would be disproportionate and would contradict the objective of better regulation."
"The new directive also prohibits the use of chemicals classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction, but this Parliament itself decided that an outright ban without any possibility of derogation would have been neither justifiable nor realistic."
"However, if a substance presents no health risks, because it is inaccessible, say, then it may not be prohibited."
"Assessments must be carried out on a case by case basis using the scientific information available for each substance."
"Stricter limits may be adopted under the committee procedure to ensure an adequate level of safety."
"The Commission will propose this whenever a genuine risk and specific data deem it necessary."
"As you know, the new directive will apply to economic operators from July 2011."
"The obligations relating to chemical substances will apply from July 2013."
"Ensuring that all those concerned - Member States and economic operators - apply the new rules and integrating the necessary adaptations to scientific progress is a priority for the Commission."
"In particular, the Member States have already met twice to discuss the changes in certain chemical substance-related obligations, in October 2009 and in September of this year."
"A further meeting is planned in April 2011 to conclude the work."
"An expert group on chemicals has also been set up to give the Commission guidance."
"The group already held a meeting in November, which produced good results with regard to defining the issues to be addressed and the options to be suggested."
"A further meeting is scheduled for January 2011."
"Mr Harbour, with regard to market surveillance, I shall have an opportunity to answer your questions at a later date."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Toy Safety Directive marked an important step forward in the protection of children up to 14 years of age."
"It lays down the essential requirements that toys must meet during manufacture and before being placed on the market."
"The European harmonisation bodies drew up harmonised European standards on the basis of the essential requirements: the conformity of toys is assessed and guaranteed by the CE mark, which ensures a high level of safety with respect to international standards."
"Naturally, I hope that in time, the CE mark can be replaced by microchips."
"Moreover, I personally believe that the European Union is constantly striving to update its safety tests, adapting them more and more to new technologies."
"I must say that I am puzzled about the need to hold a debate, immediately before Christmas, on a study in which it is stated that the test on the migration limits for chemical elements in toys is non-compliant."
"Let us not cause a false alarm and disguise it behind the legitimate need to continually update our control systems, because that could also damage the many European businesses that operate in the toy sector and comply with all the rules in force, and it could do so at a crucial time for their production."
"Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that improvements in legislation must always be matched by improvements in its application."
"While our work here in the European Parliament will continue along the lines of improving the quality of toys, my hope for the new year is that non-European countries will use our standards as a model so as to improve the quality of their products at international level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the directive adopted in 2009 was a success because it updates the legislative framework governing the safety of toys."
"It is a major step in the right direction, because it is showing us which way to go, but it is not sufficient."
"We need to be constantly vigilant and alert to ensure that toys that are sold do not endanger the health and safety of children."
"All toys that are on the market have to comply with current legislation."
"We must revise and improve the monitoring mechanisms for detecting dangerous toys, due to substances that are considered to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR substances), fragrances, or other dangerous substances, such as heteropolyanion (HPA) compounds."
"The legislation to follow needs to be clearer regarding minimum age warnings and the dangers arising from inappropriate use."
"We need to ensure that the recommended age for toys is based on child behaviour studies."
"We need to be capable of adapting our legislation to scientific advances, based on sound studies, and be more rigorous in monitoring the market and toy imports."
"We need to work together, increase cooperation between Member States and rely on the customs services working together to monitor the route taken by imported toys."
"Europeans are preparing to make their Christmas purchases, and we must guarantee that the products that they buy comply with all the safety requirements."
"(CS) Mr President, the recommendation of the Commission's Scientific Committee regarding the limits for release of the six chemical substances is not unequivocal, and that has led to this question being put."
"I agree with the six experts who performed the assessment, that they could not clearly prove harm to children from these substances, because in simulating exposure, they use water and not children's spit containing lactose."
"We cannot leave parents of young children in doubt over the possible health risks of toys made from synthetic materials, however, and I would therefore like to ask whether the Commission intends to continue its investigation by starting experiments on mice, for example, as was the case when investigating the effects of bisphenol, which is released from baby feeding bottles made from synthetic materials and which will now be banned throughout the EU from March."
"I would like to ask two more specific questions."
"Does the Commission agree with the proposal of the Scientific Committee, which recommends assuming exposure for a child amounting to 50% of the exposure for an adult?"
"Furthermore, in view of the fact that the Scientific Committee recommends reducing the limit for cadmium from 0.5 micrograms per kilo of weight of the child per day to 0.36 micrograms, I would like to ask how the Commission will transfer this conclusion and also the other findings of the Committee into specific measures concerning limits for toys and also other consumer goods."
"Commissioner, we really would like to know what the timetable is for these measures, so that the parents of young children will know where they stand."
"(EL) Mr President, while listening to the Commissioner talking so knowledgeably about polycyclic hydrocarbons, carcinogens and toxic substances, I thought for a moment that he was a chemist, not a Commissioner."
"Then I remembered that he is the Commissioner responsible for this issue and, therefore, the first thing he should have done was to reply to us in detail on the CE mark, the issue raised by my fellow Member, Evelyne Gebhardt, the mark which is supposed to be a safety guarantee for the toys which our children play with. Then I realised that he had not replied for a very specific reason: this Friday, it will be two years exactly since the former Commissioner signed a safety agreement with toy retailers and importers in a toy shop outside Brussels."
"It is eighteen months today since we had a new directive; and yet, here we are again today, like last year, as the Chair quite rightly pointed out, talking about the same subject, the safety of toys, and this year, things are even more serious, because we have a recession and, in a recession, parents who want to buy toys and are short of money will go to the section of the market that sells sub-standard toys."
"However, sub-standard toys cause three problems: firstly, that section of the market does not know what it is doing; secondly, it has no staff and thirdly, there are no controls, meaning that we still have no protection."
"As we all know and accept, children are the most valuable thing we have and, as you quite rightly said, Commissioner, they are the most vulnerable members of society."
"Please reply on the CE mark, which is the safety guarantee."
"I beg you, Commissioner, to find a practical solution, so that, next year, neither you nor we are here addressing the same question."
"Mr President, the subject of toy safety is important to all families across the European Union."
"While it is a parent's duty to ensure the safety of the children they have responsibility for, they need to be secure in the knowledge that the toys their children are playing with are safe."
"In fact, I have brought some with me this evening just to remind us what some toys look like."
"Therefore, this easy-osy attitude to toy safety, and the fact that we are here at 11:30 at night to again ask questions about toy safety, does not rest well with me."
"I would like to know from the Commission which companies directly selling or distributing toys have been successfully prosecuted for misusing the CE marking?"
"On the subject of market surveillance, owing to the austerity measures impacting on many Member States, it is the very organisations that are there to protect consumers which are disappearing, merging with other cash-strapped organisations, and having their funding withdrawn and their powers diminished."
"At a local level - often the front line in the battle against unsafe toys - budget cuts will impact on the effectiveness of trading standards."
"Can the Commission and Council investigate whether these cuts will breach commitments made in the General Product Safety Directive regarding effective resourcing, and what monitoring is being applied to ensure that Member States are protecting children from unsafe toys?"
"To this end, will the Commission be bringing forward any legislation on the common European framework for market surveillance?"
"As in the question tonight, people have acknowledged the job of RAPEX."
"However, it is resource-constrained and there is more that can be done to exchange information and withdraw dangerous products from the market as quickly as possible."
"What support is being given to the sharing of best practice between surveillance officers in the European Union?"
"In addition, will the Commission introduce a comprehensive EU-wide database on accident and injury, introducing this in the first instance for children and toy-related harm, so that unsafe products can be removed from the market as soon as is physically possible?"
"I hope that in 2011, we will see improved commitment to tackling the problem of unsafe toys on the European market once and for all."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an eternal truth that our future lies in our children."
"Therefore, it is extremely important to keep them safe from the earliest age, and to ensure that they use high quality toys that do not present a health hazard."
"However, determination of testing methods is only one aspect of ensuring the safety of toys."
"What is the most important is compliance with legislation."
"Comprehensive testing, as well as the application of sanctions with a serious deterrent effect in the case of any irregularities, are particularly important in the case of imported products."
"We often hear about health hazards in connection with cheap, poor quality toys, which primarily originate from the Far East."
"As a practising father, I often find that instead of being deterred by more stringent inspections, such paltry products find their way into the hands of our children in increasing numbers and varieties."
"We must prevent the continued influx of such toys and support the widespread use of toys made from natural materials."
"(GA) Mr President, I spoke about this matter last year and, like other speakers, I am here again tonight, another year gone, and that is not good."
"Nevertheless, I suppose there is nothing more disconcerting than to see your child getting injured or dying as a result of playing with a toy."
"We think of this in terms of swallowing something or strangulation, but there is a more covert killer and that is cancer."
"The evidence is there that cancer is rising amongst young children in particular."
"Many people feel it is as a result of being exposed to chemicals in children's toys."
"PAHs are particularly mentioned and therefore, it is important that we reduce CMR substances in children's toys to the minimum."
"Therefore, we need to take action."
"(GA) It is time for us to do it and to ensure that the toys used by our children are safe for them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to point out once again, in response to the many questions asked during the debate, that the directive will apply to economic operators from July 2011 and that the obligations relating to chemical substances will apply from July 2013."
"During my speech, I said that the application of the new rules by all those concerned was a priority for the Commission."
"As regards surveillance, it is clear that strict legislation is not only necessary, but that it must also be applied correctly or else it will never be effective."
"That is why I am convinced that the Member States have a fundamental role to play; indeed, a toy that enters the internal market in Rotterdam or in Constanţa, Romania, today, may wind up in Bologna, Lisbon or Helsinki tomorrow, without any border controls."
"What gives consumers peace of mind, more than directives being updated every fortnight, is being able to trust in the rigorousness and proper functioning of market surveillance; in other words, in the fact that, if someone tries to sell unsafe toys, he or she will be punished and the dangerous products withdrawn from the market."
"Obviously, the same argument applies to businesses; those that abide by the rules pay the price for this situation."
"Indeed, they appreciate the fact that they are not being exposed to unfair competition from those that more or less knowingly sell non-compliant products and toys."
"In short, the real challenge is to give consumers peace of mind, businesses legal certainty and a level playing field, and market surveillance authorities resources and cooperation mechanisms."
"Hence, in 2011, the Commission will examine the possibility of developing a multiannual market surveillance programme for identifying the long-term measures to be taken and for making the necessary financial resources available, so as to ensure uniformly rigorous checks and consistent action by the Member States."
"I would also like to inform you that, in 2011, I intend to organise an event at Rotterdam port with the Dutch authorities, possibly to coincide with the entry into force of the directive."
"The idea is to see how the largest port in Europe will go about complying with the new rules laid down by the new directive."
"As regards the CE mark - which was one of the main topics addressed in my hearing before Parliament prior to my appointment, and which was also discussed in my hearings before the Committee on the Internal Market - I would remind you that it does not certify quality; it certifies only conformity to certain standards."
"Hence, it is a certificate of conformity to standards, not a certificate of quality."
"As I have said many times, a quality mark is something that we could only envisage in the future."
"Implementing the CE mark and preventing its misuse - something which unfortunately happens in the case of many products, including non-EU ones - is already a big job."
"Thus, I believe that we can continue to work on this matter, to develop the CE mark - and I personally am not against discussing the introduction of a quality mark in the future perhaps, but I think it is premature to do so now."
"As for databases, they will be included in the review of the Product Safety Directive."
"However, with regard to bisphenol, which is contained in baby feeding bottles, it is not a toy, it is not covered by the directive, but, as the honourable Member pointed out, it has already been withdrawn from the market."
"I believe I have answered most of the questions put to me."
"I am grateful to the President and to the MEPs who put questions to the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Thousands of new toys come on the market in Europe every year, and Christmas is the time when demand for toys in the shops is at its peak."
"Therefore, this is a timely issue."
"There are significant concerns regarding harmful chemicals found in certain toys."
"The Commission must address this without delay."
"Safety standards must be based on reliable methods of testing, and intensive research must be undertaken to ensure that no harmful substances are found in children's toys."
"Although all the toys that appear on the market from 20 July 2011 onwards will have to comply with the new Toy Safety Directive, and although we in Europe have the world's strictest legislation as regards toy safety, constant care is necessary."
"The Commission must be vigilant and strengthen the market surveillance of imports."
"Every recall of dangerous toys is a cause for concern, and an immediate examination of each case must be made."
"Consumers must have confidence in the CE mark which guarantees that a product is of EU standard and made from non-toxic materials."

"Oral Question by Mrs Bowles to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on establishing a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area (B7-0659/2010)."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, honourable Members, on behalf of the Council I should like to thank you, Mr President, for this opportunity to come before Parliament to present to you the issues that will be discussed by the European Council."
"By all accounts, the European Council meeting tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will be decisive for the strengthening of the economic pillar of Economic and Monetary Union."
"The major item on the agenda will in fact be the reinforcement of financial stability."
"We are living in exceptional times, which have created and continue to create significant challenges for both governments and citizens."
"We need to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the current financial crisis is overcome and confidence is restored."
"Since the start of the crisis we have demonstrated our determination to take the necessary measures to preserve financial stability and to promote a return to sustainable growth."
"In particular, the crisis has highlighted the need for an additional instrument to preserve the stability of the euro area."
"We had to establish an ad hoc mechanism, which we have just used to support Ireland."
"However, we really need a permanent mechanism in the medium term."
"To this end, and in close consultation with the President of the European Council, at the next meeting of the European Council tomorrow morning, the Belgian Government will submit a proposal for a decision to change the Treaty with a view to establishing a mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the entire euro area by amending Article 136."
"The European Council will be called upon to give its consent to this draft decision and to the launch of the simplified revision procedure as provided for by Article 48.6 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The objective is the formal adoption of the decision in March 2011 and its entry into force on 1 January 2013."
"In addition, the implementation of the report of the Task Force on economic governance endorsed by the European Council in October is an important step towards increased fiscal discipline, broader economic surveillance and deeper coordination."
"This issue, to which we attach a great deal of importance, is currently before both Parliament and the Council and should be concluded by next summer."
"Finally, I should like to underline the importance of the new Europe 2020 Strategy for growth and employment, which plays an important role in getting us out of the crisis."
"The Belgian Presidency has been committed to moving forward with its implementation, so as to pave the way for sustainable economic recovery."
"In addition to these economic issues, I would like to make two further points."
"The European Council will deal with the Union's relations with its strategic partners."
"The Foreign Affairs Council, chaired by Baroness Ashton, prepared progress reports on three of its partners, the United States, China and Russia."
"The European Council will therefore listen carefully to Baroness Ashton's presentation on the Union's relations with its strategic partners."
"Baroness Ashton will also be called upon to take this approach with other partners, such as Ukraine, Africa, India and Brazil, and to present a report in March 2011 describing the situation regarding her contacts with our partners."
"My final point concerns the application for accession to the European Union submitted by Montenegro."
"The General Affairs Council welcomed the opinion of the Commission on Montenegro."
"The country has made progress in meeting the political criteria set by the Copenhagen European Council and the requirements of the stabilisation and association process."
"Nonetheless, further efforts are needed, especially to implement seven key priorities set out in the Commission opinion."
"Taking account of the Commission proposal, the Council recommended granting Montenegro the status of candidate country and this issue will be examined by the European Council."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, President of the Council, honourable Members, this week's European Council will focus on two main goals: to agree on the key features of a future permanent European Stability Mechanism for the euro area and on the limited Treaty change that will make this mechanism legally waterproof."
"I therefore hope and expect this European Council to focus on delivery, steadying the course and strengthening the consensus."
"In reaching an agreement, this European Council will also send a signal of unity, solidarity and unambiguous support for the European project, but it will require a lot of hard work to get there."
"We all know that at the moment there is a lot at stake for the European Union and the euro area in particular."
"Many people are looking to the European Union for answers: the markets for one, our partners in the world for another, but most importantly, our citizens."
"What are they expecting?"
"How can we best reassure them?"
"For me the answer is clear."
"We need to show that the European Union is in control of events, that we have a course of action that we are sticking to, and that we speak with one voice and act as one."
"What we do not need is a beauty contest between leaders, a cacophony of diverging scenarios, or announcements that are not followed by action."
"Yes, we are facing serious challenges but, if you stand back and look at the facts, the European Union is meeting those challenges head on this year."
"We faced two particular issues with Greece and Ireland."
"In both cases we took the decisions needed."
"The reality is that in both situations the EU was able to act but we need to put far-reaching reforms in place to ensure that such situations do not arise again in the future."
"Real European economic governance is a necessary precondition for this."
"The economic governance package should therefore be seen as the key building block in a system which gives Europeans and the markets confidence that the right structures are in place."
"I hope that this Parliament will continue to treat these Commission proposals as a priority, so that they can be fully implemented by the middle of next year."
"Our future system will be one that rests on individual and collective efforts, responsibility and solidarity."
"We are moving fast in this direction."
"At the same time, public finances must be consolidated."
"Sound public finances are needed to restore the confidence which is so essential for growth."
"In many Member States, the current course of fiscal policy weighs heavily on the long-term sustainability of public finances, and requires corrective measures."
"Of course, we need to look beyond fiscal consolidation towards promoting growth, and we are sowing the seeds of Europe's future growth through the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"This offers a real growth prospective for Europe."
"I see more and more Member States fully grasping the potential of Europe 2020."
"Let us build on that by accelerating growth-enhancing reforms."
"Taken seriously, Europe 2020 can direct our local, national and European economies towards tomorrow's sources of growth."
"We are working hard to bring forward the first Annual Growth Survey in one month's time."
"I am confident that this will be a major theme for this Parliament next year."
"So too will be the future budget of the Union, and how its great potential can be used to help the task of boosting growth and creating jobs."
"We must also look at our banking system and take the necessary action in order to ensure that banks are in a position to finance the economy appropriately, particularly SMEs."
"When it comes to stabilising economies, much of our action was ad hoc or temporary."
"Another important element of our approach for far-reaching reforms must be a permanent stability mechanism."
"That is the objective of the European Stability Mechanism."
"After intense consultations, which went very well, we were able to come forward with an outline for this mechanism at the end of last month."
"I am confident this will be endorsed by the European Council this week, although the precise contours will have to be worked out over the coming weeks."
"The mechanism should also be supported by a decision to move forward with a limited and focused treaty change."
"Now that there is a consensus between the Member States to take the treaty change route, this approach must be swiftly implemented."
"The purpose of the treaty change is very specific."
"It is a straightforward, pragmatic amendment to meet a specific need."
"It needs no more than a simple change to implement it."
"So let us resist the temptation to overcomplicate or to make artificial linkages with other subjects, and let us not allow ourselves to be distracted from the task in hand."
"There is massive political will behind the euro."
"Both the temporary mechanism and now the permanent mechanism are key decisions which show that Member States are as willing as ever to put their weight behind the stability and integrity of the euro."
"All of these elements - economic governance, fiscal consolidation, securing growth-enhancing reforms, effective banks, the European Financial Stability Facility, and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism - are interconnected."
"They must be approached as a whole put together in an articulated way, so as to create a comprehensive response to the crisis, and to ensure that nothing like it ever happens again."
"The action that the European Central Bank is taking is, of course, a vital contribution to this goal."
"Everyone agrees that the action taken this year, most obviously for Greece and Ireland, is also in the wider interests of the whole European Union and all its Member States."
"It rests heavily on fundamental principles of solidarity, of collective responsibility, of sharing the risks and bringing mutual support at times of need."
"I know that these principles are close to the heart of this Parliament."
"They are close to my heart too, so I can understand why other ideas have been floated to give form to these principles through other possible mechanisms."
"On this point let me be clear. eurobonds in themselves are an interesting idea."
"The Commission itself put forward the idea back in 2008 when assessing the first ten years of EMU, but we are in a crisis situation and we already have financial mechanisms to address this crisis, like the European Financial Stability Facility."
"These are far from exhausted and can be improved and adapted far more quickly than any alternatives, however interesting they may be."
"So while I can understand that you want to think about every possible solution, this is a time for immediate action."
"Let us not kill the idea for the future, but concentrate at this stage on what can be the solution to achieve a consensus among Member States and can be done quickly and decisively."
"Let us work together to end this year with a message of confidence that the European Union has a unified vision for its economy and is putting this vision in place."
"Let us do it with a clear sense of our destination and let that destination be clear as well: a strong and stable euro area in an ever closer European Union."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Chastel, and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, for their introduction to the discussion."
"We are talking about something which is very important."
"Overcoming the crisis and creating jobs is the priority for our citizens."
"Tomorrow and the day after, the European Council will give its attention, first and foremost, to this very matter."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council, which opens this week, is taking place in a particular context: speculative attacks against the euro, the revival of euroscepticism and the beginning of reflections on Europe's finances, while this Parliament is preparing to vote on the 2011 budget."
"These are, of course, closely linked."
"The euro crisis and the solidarity measures have an impact on the purchasing power of the European people, who are wondering if all these efforts are worthwhile, if they are leading to anything, whence the euroscepticism even in countries hitherto traditionally pro-European."
"This is a phenomenon hijacked by populist and extremist political factions, which feed on fear and the temptation to withdraw into oneself and which, when they are in government, do not have a miracle cure."
"I will start with the euro, which we must protect and strengthen while, at the same time, asking ourselves some fundamental questions."
"My first question is this: has Europe ever had a currency as stable as the euro?"
"I say this to those nostalgic for national currencies: a step back would have catastrophic consequences for Europe."
"My second question is: who is behind the attacks to which the euro has been subjected for months?"
"Who is standing to gain from the crime, if I may call it that?"
"I am not a conspiracy theorist but, in my conversations with political leaders and financial analysts, the paths are converging on the source of our problems."
"When will we learn?"
"I think we can talk directly to our friends."
"My third question is this: why is the euro still trading above USD 1.30?"
"This is seriously hampering our exports and everyone is saying that the euro has had it."
"Why are our countries the only ones to practise a strict policy of orthodoxy while our competitors profit from their weak currencies to boost their economies?"
"This is what our citizens are asking us."
"These are questions I have been asked in the last two weeks in meetings with elected politicians."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what we need is a message of confidence that we will overcome the crisis, measures to encourage a return to growth and concrete measures like those taken recently by the Barroso Commission to relaunch the internal market or to make the financial markets more ethical."
"What we need, and the euro crisis proved this, is convergence in our social and fiscal policies."
"That takes courage."
"President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, go further and faster and we will solve quite a few problems."
"We are going to need a lot of courage in the years to come if we want to strengthen our countries in the arena of global competition and if we want to use taxpayers' money in the most effective way possible."
"This effort to streamline expenditure must be made at all levels: local, regional, national and European."
"The political and financial priorities of the Union need to be reexamined and the public finances of Europe need to be fundamentally reviewed."
"We need to ask ourselves the real questions and, depending on the answers we give, adapt our budgetary framework for the period 2014-2020."
"It is for this crucial debate that the European Parliament is calling and it is in these substantive discussions that, as the representatives directly elected by 500 million Europeans, we intend to fully participate, even if this displeases certain governments who wish to deny us this right."
"I ask the European Council to give us its agreement and, if necessary, to vote, so that those who deny us this opportunity to participate in the debate assume their responsibilities."
"It is not, for us, about power but about contributing to a crucial debate on the future of European construction."
"We must lance the boil, we must take the right decisions, the necessary decisions to ensure that the European budget increasingly becomes an investment budget."
"If our Member States, mindful of budgetary constraints, can invest less in education, training, research and innovation, let us do so at European level by combining our resources and, therefore, by achieving economies of scale."
"For the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the debate on Europe's finances must not be allowed to descend into a quarrel between Member States who want their money back."
"On the contrary, the debate should be about reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe by exposing them to the added value that concerted and visionary European action can represent."
"I am currently visiting the capital cities and I can tell you that the debate is taking hold."
"Do not miss this opportunity."
"Because we are coming up to Christmas and the New Year and this Presidency will soon come to an end, I should like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very good collaboration with Parliament, as well as José Manuel Barroso, who had the courage to undertake to present a document on capital requirements before the end of June."
"I believe that we must continue, together, in this direction and that the Heads of State or Government must follow us."
"We have to show them the way."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is not often that we have come together at the end of the year with greater cause for concern."
"We are deeply concerned because Europe finds itself in the midst of a growing and multiplying crisis of confidence."
"There are causes for this crisis of confidence and I would like to attempt to describe some of them here today."
"I believe that we are confronted by a double salami-slicing approach."
"There is the approach taken by those who are trying to conceal the actual situation from the citizens of a country."
"It seriously shakes people's confidence when governments say to them: 'Everything is fine, no problem, we have it all under control' and then suddenly turn around and explain that they need countless billions of euros in aid."
"This has occurred twice now."
"I do not know whether a government will once again say that it has everything under control and can finance its bonds, even if interest rates are rising, and then suddenly change its mind and say: 'We need a rescue package."
"Help us!'."
"This must not happen."
"We need an inventory of the actual national debts and bank debts."
"I believe that it will create more confidence if we explain what the real situation is, however bad it might be."
"If all the cards are on the table, then it is easier for us to look for solutions."
"However, there is also the salami-slicing approach on the other side."
"This is what happens when the strong countries say 'We do not need to help'."
"We hear the renationalisation message: 'We are not prepared to pay for the others', despite the fact that the countries which are saying that know that we will ultimately all have to stand together and pay up."
"The salami-slicing approach of not telling the people the truth, although you know that you will have to pay in your own interest, is just as damaging to confidence."
"We are currently preparing for a meeting of the European Council."
"What about the different voices there?"
"One is in favour of eurobonds and another is opposed."
"One says stabilise the rescue package and build it up, another says do not build it up."
"I wonder where the logic lies in explaining that these are all just temporary measures, because we have everything under control, but we have to include the temporary measures in the treaty, so that they are available in the long term."
"Everyone notices a contradiction of this kind and that also shakes people's confidence."
"It damages confidence when a government subjects its banks to a stress test in the summer and only a few months later realises that it was really a stress test for the euro and not for the banks."
"We are in the midst of a crisis of confidence and I must say to you, Mr Barroso, that although what you said this morning may be true, it gives the impression not that we will look for the best solutions and put them in place, but instead that we will discuss the minimum consensus which we can reach on Friday."
"That is simply not enough."
"It will heighten the crisis of confidence."
"A policy which pacifies the national markets in the short term is not enough."
"We need a policy which stabilises the markets and the euro."
"Why is no one in this House or in the European Council talking about the external value of the euro?"
"Today the euro is trading at 1.34 against the US dollar."
"Its lowest value during the crisis was 1.20 and when it was introduced it was worth 1.15."
"The euro is a stable currency."
"In intercontinental competition, where regions of the world compete with one another in economic terms, it is no longer the individual national currencies that count, but the currency structure of the entire region."
"In economic and social terms, the euro area is definitely the strongest region in the world."
"It is only being made politically weaker by policy makers who are implementing policies aimed at damping down national debate in the short term."
"The euro is strong and it could be much stronger if those who act as its political framework and those who are responsible for it would finally fulfil their obligations and take bold, consistent decisions on social and economic issues which would bring the crisis of confidence to an end."
"You simply need to look at what is happening in London, in Paris and in Rome."
"If we do not stop this crisis of confidence, we will have major problems over the next few years."
"This is why I would like to say to the Council that I am in favour of eurobonds."
"If there is another suitable measure, then please take it, but you must finally come to an agreement on stabilising the euro internally, because it is strong enough externally."
"Mr President, I think that, in life, there is a rule that applies everywhere: when a group is under attack it must react with unity and with solidarity."
"Exactly the opposite happened in 2010 when the euro came under attack, because, since the Greek crisis, we have witnessed nothing but disagreements in the debates, certainly no unity and certainly not enough solidarity."
"We need to have the courage now - and I am addressing the President of the Commission as well - to recognise that all the temporary measures taken are just not enough."
"This is not my analysis, it is the analysis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, of Mr Trichet, who is, after all, the head of the euro's monetary guardian, the President of the European Central Bank, and for whom all the measures that have been taken and all the measures that are in the pipeline do not go far enough."
"Everyone says that action needs to be taken on four points: first, a stability pact with real sanction mechanisms; second, a permanent, enlarged crisis fund - I am not the one proposing it, Mr Trichet says that it must be enlarged, the Heads of State or Government do not want to enlarge it, and we want confidence to return to the markets; third, real economic and fiscal governance, fiscal and economic union and, fourth, a single eurobond market."
"These are the four things that need to be done, because nowhere in the world, fellow Members, is there a currency that is not backed by a government, by an economic strategy and by a bond market."
"Such a thing exists nowhere on earth."
"And what are we being told here today?"
"We are being told 'Yes, it's a good idea, but we need to wait a little while longer.'"
"We need to wait for what?"
"Perhaps we need to wait for complete chaos or for the euro to disappear."
"The time has therefore come to take that decision and I am not expecting the Commission, Mr President, to tell us today 'Yes, it will be difficult, we must not continue these debates on eurobonds; it's a good idea but this is not the time, because we have the crisis fund, which we are going to make permanent now.'"
"The one has nothing to do with the other."
"The crisis fund is necessary now to counter attacks against the euro, but eurobonds are also necessary for the medium- and long-term stability of the euro."
"There is no contradiction between the two."
"Both are necessary, as is the case throughout the world."
"I therefore believe that, along with the Heads of State or Government, who are going to discuss tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and are going to say 'Yes, we are going to tweak the Treaty, and the crisis fund, which should normally be enlarged - which is what everyone else is calling for - may be made permanent', I believe that the time has come for the Commission to put forward as quickly as possible a package that is much more significant, courageous, global and coherent as far as that approach is concerned."
"With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, which has real sanction mechanisms, Parliament can do its work, because the package is here and we are going to revert to the Commission's initial proposals."
"As regards the other three points, an enlarged crisis fund, yes, but propose it."
"Propose it!"
"Take a stance on this point and say that the crisis fund needs to be enlarged."
"Why?"
"Because having an enlarged crisis fund will put an end to speculation against the euro."
"Secondly, propose a global package on fiscal and economic union and, thirdly, do not be afraid, propose a single eurobond market."
"We know that, when all is said and done, that is what will stabilise the euro in the long term."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is, however, something strange in all of this."
"Mr Chastel, you spoke of the next summit."
"You could have told us that things were going to be a bit shaky before this summit."
"You could have told us that you would have to curtail some of the debates."
"Mr Barroso, I believe that we will not make any progress, we will not move any further forwards, with all this waffle."
"Martin Schultz is right: we have to describe the reality of the crisis and to tell it like it is, but we must also describe the reality of our own political powerlessness and the reasons for this powerlessness."
"It is no use just saying that we took the right decisions."
"You know as well as I do, and everyone here knows, that we always took them too late."
"We are taking one step forwards and two steps backwards."
"I am not saying that it is your fault."
"Quite the contrary, I think that the Commission has even been a point of stability at a time when lucidity was in short supply."
"But now - I think that Guy Verhofstadt asked the real question - what should our strategy be in the coming months?"
"As I see it, the strategy is simple: the Commission should put forward a stability pact, which it already has, defining the necessary stability and therefore the responsibility of all towards the euro, and a solidarity pact defining the solidarity we need."
"There is no stability without solidarity."
"These discussions between Mrs Merkel and Mr Untel no longer interest us."
"Yes, the position of certain countries, including Germany, which say that there must be stability and that what has happened must never happen again, is right."
"Yes, if we do not say at the same time that solidarity forces us to create an opportunity to protect the euro with eurobonds to invest, to continue to make the ecological and economic transformation."
"We need to invest, except that, at national level, this is no longer possible."
"We have a two-sided currency: stability on the one side and solidarity on the other side, with responsibility in the middle."
"President of the Commission, put forward a proposal to reform the functions of the Union so as to achieve stability and solidarity with the eurobonds in such a way that there can no longer be any speculation against the debts of certain countries and, with the eurobonds, you have the opportunity to invest at the same time."
"Mr Oettinger tells us that he needs EUR 1 000 billion to reform the energy sector, but where is he going to get this money from?"
"Is he going to play the lottery or what?"
"It is utterly absurd to say that he needs EUR 1 000 billion without telling us how we are going to mobilise the necessary funds for this necessary economic transformation."
"So, the strategy is simple: the Commission proposes, Parliament amends and decides, and there will be a position from the Commission and from the European Parliament for or against the Council, and the Council will have to react to this common position."
"That is it."
"The only solution in today's debate."
"If we wait for Mrs Merkel to make up her mind to take a decision a quarter of an hour before she has to take it, you can be waiting till the end of time."
"By the time she takes it we will have missed the train."
"Of course, you can tell me that, as there will be another train, it does not matter, we can always catch the next one."
"But that is not true."
"Gorbachev was right when he said: 'Dangers await only those who do not react to life.'"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I do not want history to punish Europe."
"Face up to your responsibilities."
"We are facing up to ours and we must demonstrate to the Council that the political stability we need is here, in the Commission and in Parliament, and we will defy the instability of the Council."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I share the hope that measures will be agreed at the European Council to reassure the markets and reintroduce stability to the eurozone, because, whether we are members or not, we should all have an interest in that."
"Ahead of the meeting we are told that more sanctions are to be a central part of the solution, but sanctions need to be credible to be effective and the track record of the Union in this regard is pretty bad."
"Making them automatic will hardly make them more credible if the belief remains that a political solution might be found to avoid them."
"What is really required is for eurozone members to have the political will to deliver on their current obligations."
"We hear rumours that a key part of the solution is to make the private sector share the burden of future bail-outs."
"It would however be a terrible paradox if the main consequence of such an initiative would be to raise borrowing costs for some of the weaker eurozone Member States and contribute to the next crisis."
"Having just finished a major reform treaty process, a reform package, we are told, would close the book on treaty change for a generation."
"We are now, just a matter of months later, apparently to embark on another."
"We are reassuringly told, including by the Commission President, that the changes need only be limited, but that does not appear to be what the German Government believes."
"The German finance minister, Dr Schäuble seems to have opened the door to a new round of integration leading to a fiscal union and, ultimately, a political union."
"Where is this going to end?"
"Surely not another lost decade focusing on the wrong kind of reforms?"
"Europe needs economic reform, public finance discipline, deepening the internal market, changes to labour laws to boost employment, and a package of measures to make a success of the Europe 2020 programme."
"These are the key reforms, boldly and rightly set out by President Barroso in the programme for his Commission, but already I fear this opportunity may be slipping from our grasp."
"The terrible risk is that, despite the talk about building Europe, it may in fact be undermined, and while hoping for a stronger Europe, the failure to address its underlying economic problems will in fact just make it weaker."
"We believe the priorities of the European Council must be to agree a limited number of specific measures, so that eurozone members can help each other through the immediate crisis without imposing any burdens on Member States who have chosen to remain outside, and then to reassert the vital importance of dealing with the long-term crisis which we face: the risk of a permanent collapse in our economic competiveness."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been dealing with the global economic and financial crisis for three years now."
"One of the conclusions to be drawn from this long-lasting discussion is that our measures are obviously not tackling the roots of the crisis, but simply treating the symptoms."
"I would like to repeat once again that decisions at EU level must not be determined by the financial markets."
"We must not allow the banks to get away largely scot-free, to continue speculating and to leave the Member States to take responsibility for the risky transactions that the banks have entered into."
"The tough austerity packages imposed on Greece and Ireland will result in the people bearing the cost of the crisis which they did not cause."
"This will restrict consumer spending and prevent the necessary economic upturn from taking place."
"Drastic savings measures will put other countries that are currently at risk, such as Portugal and Spain, in the same position as Greece and Ireland."
"Simply readjusting the financial instruments or putting new safety nets in place will not help."
"A permanent mechanism for preserving financial stability must include measures which regulate the activities of the markets."
"These include, among other things, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and an obligation to meet minimum social standards."
"It is also important for us to change the statute of the European Central Bank to allow it to provide direct financial aid for ailing states, while circumventing the banks."
"These are the first steps we should be taking, but they are long overdue."
"To make the situation absolutely clear, a narrow-minded national approach is blocking the regulations needed for effective control of the financial markets."
"The Heads of State or Government are preventing us from making progress in the right direction."
"I include the Chancellor of Germany among them."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, 2010 will be remembered as the year when the deep flaws in the euro project were exposed and the public in Europe woke up to the sheer stupidity of their leaders."
"So here we have another summit, another crisis, confidence in the euro ebbing by the week."
"It is like watching a slow-motion car crash and now you want a permanent bail-out mechanism."
"You think that, if you have a fund of say a billion euros, all will be well."
"Well it will not be well."
"The failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation."
"It is nothing to do with the markets, be they currency or bonds, it is because the North and the South in Europe cannot today, or at any point, be put together in a single monetary union."
"It will not work."
"And politically, of course, you have to change the treaty."
"The reason being that the four German professors will win at Karlsruhe and prove that the bail-outs you have put in place already were in fact illegal under the treaties."
"Well, in many ways I welcome this treaty change because it will mean that there has to be a referendum in Ireland."
"And you never know, David Cameron might even keep his promise and hold a referendum in the United Kingdom."
"I am sure that, as democrats, you would all welcome a referendum on the EU in the United Kingdom."
"We should also reflect at the end of 2010 not just on the state of the Union, but on the state of Belgium."
"For six months the Belgian Presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply."
"What a farce this is."
"You have not had a government in your own country since June."
"Here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation."
"It truly is an absolute farce but nobody here dares to admit it because you are all in denial."
"Belgium is a microcosm of the entire European Union."
"Belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow."
"Happy Christmas, everybody."
"author. - Mr President, here we are again examining the sticking plaster and wondering if it is large enough and strong enough to cover the wound."
"Last July I asked when the Commission foresaw the expected legislative proposal for a permanent sovereign debt crisis management mechanism and what would be the legal base."
"I asked quite a lot more, such as the relative ranking of the different funds and the proportions in which they would be used."
"Events have shown that the answer really was that we do not know and it will be made up as we go along."
"I actually have some sympathy for that, in so far as we are in new territory and new plans need to be made."
"But I say again that, if there is not fulsome follow-up to statements, whether from the Commission or Council, this negates the benefit of conclusions."
"Answers to my July questions only emerged in the Irish rescue, which I think is a matter of regret, not least when the smallest fund, coming from the EU budget, is used for an equal share to the larger funds."
"Parliament was not consulted, despite my earlier questions."
"Today I stand here to ask further details following the October Council conclusions, in which the Commission was asked to work towards a limited treaty change required to establish a permanent crisis resolution mechanism."
"They also said that there would have to be private sector involvement, which spooked the market because there was insufficient explanation."
"It also highlights the regulatory problem I mentioned of zero risk weighting for eurozone sovereign debt, which undermined market discipline and created perverse incentives."
"Then the Euro Group announced that the permanent mechanism would be based on the European financial stability facility and that it might involve the private sector on a case-by-case basis following IMF practice."
"Firstly, can we now have more precise details about the Treaty change and the procedure?"
"Parliament needs to know that it will be adequate."
"A little more fiddling around with Article 136 is not an answer."
"Secondly, is the new instrument to be based on an intergovernmental approach, for that is how the EFSF works, or will it in fact be Community-based, which is how we think it should be done?"
"Thirdly, what are the technical options and conditions?"
"It is imperative that the mechanism is based on technical realities and is robust, credible and lasting - to which I would also add affordable."
"Fourthly, will Member States not yet part of the euro be invited to be part of the mechanism?"
"This seems especially relevant for those building debt in euros."
"We asked when it would take place and we have been told January 2013, but what role does the Commission see for Parliament?"
"Parliament and my committee are indeed determined to play their role, all the more so when we have been ahead in the thinking all the way along."
"If we do not find ourselves properly consulted and informed, where does that leave national parliaments and citizens?"
"This issue is inextricably linked to the economic governance package."
"The measures to improve the Stability and Growth Pact, surveillance and the European semester all aim at prevention of another crisis and serve to monitor emergence from the current economic crisis."
"This mechanism is not a charm that we can put on the wall to ward off market discipline."
"Indeed the solution for the euro is to recognise the need for full political discipline in combination with full market discipline."
"We have this crisis because both were undermined in the past."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank Sharon Bowles for her question and also for the draft resolution on the permanent mechanism."
"I will try to give you the Commission's view on the five questions included in the oral question."
"The October European Council invited President Van Rompuy to undertake consultations, together with the Commission, on a limited treaty change required to establish a permanent mechanism for crisis resolution."
"It is understood that a limited treaty change implies the use of the simplified revision procedure based on Article 48 of the Treaty."
"The constraints of this procedure are that, firstly, it allows only treaty changes of the kind that do not increase the competences conferred on the Union and, secondly, it is limited to changes to Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which relates to Union policies and internal actions."
"It seems that the Member States have a preference for a very limited treaty change which will presumably be placed under Article 136, whose provisions are specific to the euro-area Member States."
"The issue will be discussed of course in the European Council this week."
"Whatever change is suggested, Parliament will be formally consulted on it."
"Following the European Council decision in October, the Eurogroup agreed at its extraordinary meeting in November on the main principles of a European Stability Mechanism, or ESM."
"According to the Euro Group agreement the ESM will be an intergovernmental mechanism whose governance will be based on the model of the European Financial Stability Facility."
"The concrete details of the financial mechanism have yet to be decided and should be worked out during the first quarter of next year."
"Funding will of course be a key issue."
"The future instrument will need to be sufficiently robust and must enjoy strong credibility in the markets."
"Any support from the ESM will be based on strict conditionality."
"Assistance provided to a euro-area Member State should be based on a rigorous programme of economic and fiscal assessment and a thorough analysis of debt sustainability conducted by the Commission together with the IMF, and in liaison with the European Central Bank."
"Despite the intergovernmental nature of the financing arm of the mechanism, the policy conditions will remain firmly grounded in the Treaty so as to ensure full consistency with the common multilateral surveillance framework on which the whole Economic and Monetary Union is in fact based."
"To answer one of Mrs Bowles' five questions, no decision as to whether Member States that are not members of the euro area could take part in the mechanism has been taken yet."
"It seems, nevertheless, that most Member States have a preference for a transparent and clear framework where non-euro-area Member States would be covered by the balance of payments mechanism while euro-area Member States would be covered by the European Stability Mechanism."
"Having said that, it should still be possible to have some non-euro-area Member States associated in a support operation via bilateral contributions, as already applies today, in the case of Ireland, to the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark."
"Let me also comment on the discussion on the eurobonds."
"Let us recall that, in the context of establishing the financial backstops last 9 May - Schuman Day - and the following night, the Commission made a proposal for a European Financial Stability Mechanism, a Community instrument, which in fact was adopted up to EUR 60 billion, based on loan guarantees by the Union budget under the own-resources decision."
"Beyond the Union budget we proposed that this mechanism should be based on loan guarantees provided by the Member States, which would be channelled through this mechanism for countries that were in need of financial assistance because of financial instability over the euro area as a whole."
"This was rejected by the Ecofin Council on 9 and 10 May."
"Why?"
"Because many Member States considered that this proposal resembled too closely the Eurobond."
"This then led to the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility, which is an intergovernmental arrangement, and now we are using both the mechanism and the facility in the context of Ireland."
"So while the issue of eurobonds is certainly a very important matter, we also have to take into account that this proposal was recently rejected by the Council in the May discussions concerning the European Financial Stability Mechanism."
"To conclude, let me underline that the future European Stability Mechanism will be part of a comprehensive response to contain the crisis and stabilise the European economy, and the ESM will complement the new framework of reinforced economic governance which will focus first of all on prevention and will substantially reduce the probability of a crisis arising in the future."
"That is the whole essential purpose of the new system of economic governance and I am very grateful for your support for the Commission's proposals in this regard."
"(DE) Mr President, if you listened to the first round of speakers, you would have gained an idea of who was responsible for the crisis of confidence, and it is true that this is what it has now become."
"Firstly it was the Commission, secondly the speculators and thirdly the Council and, in particular, Mrs Merkel."
"It is all quite simple."
"Fortunately, someone pointed out - it was the chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - that the euro is stable, not only externally, but also internally, with the lowest rates of inflation."
"Speculation cannot be the cause of the problem."
"The euro is a stable currency."
"It was the basic terms of the treaty and the uproar in the Ecofin Council."
"There is new turmoil in every Ecofin meeting."
"Mr Rehn has just pointed out that the Commission has proposed the use of a European mechanism, but that the Council was not prepared to participate."
"We are now saying that the Commission did not act."
"I am not one of those who are constantly worshipping the Commission, but it was the right thing for the Commission to do in 2008 to draw up an accurate inventory, after the euro had been in existence for 10 years."
"It referred to four points that needed to be resolved: firstly, a consistent European supervisory mechanism, secondly, consistent economic governance, or whatever you want to call it, thirdly, consistent external representation and, fourthly, a consistent crisis mechanism."
"All of these things are now on the table."
"I would like to emphasise the fact that it was others who did not take them into account."
"If we are looking for people to blame, there is one guilty party we must not forget and that is the Member States, which have got themselves up to their necks in debt and which have not made use of the benefits of introducing the euro to implement reforms and to reduce their debt levels, but instead have lived above their means."
"I would also like to emphasise that there is a recurring theme among all these Member States."
"Regardless of who it was, they have all had social-democratic governments for a long period, some of them up until today."
"That includes Portugal, Spain, the UK, Hungary and Latvia."
"In Greece they have been doing the same stupid things for four years."
"This is the result."
"If we do not talk openly about the main cause of the excessive levels of debt in the Member States, we will not be able to resolve the problems."
"(The speaker agreed to take a question under the 'blue card' procedure (Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure))."
"(DE) Mr Langen, you can sit down again now."
"You have spoken very eloquently and you have said your piece."
"I have one question for you."
"Ireland is not a southern European country, as far as I know."
"It is in northern Europe."
"Ireland has huge debts."
"Can you explain to us where the Irish debts come from?"
"Would you be so kind as to tell us which party has been in government in Ireland for the last 30 years?"
"(DE) Mr President, I am happy to answer that question."
"The Irish Government made the mistake of giving guarantees without demanding reform of the banking sector."
"That was irresponsible and that is why it now has a budget deficit of 32%."
"We know that."
"However, you should not confuse the problems of other states with those of Ireland."
"Ireland is a completely different case, because it concerns the second level of the banking crisis and not a structural problem, as in other countries."
"Mr Schulz, you know that as well as I do."
"Please do not attempt to distract our attention."
"(The speaker agreed to take a question under the 'blue card' procedure (Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure))."
"(RO) Mr President, to err is human."
"To persevere is diabolical."
"Do you know who the Greek prime minister was under whose government all those excessive debts accumulated, causing the crisis in Greece?"
"It was definitely not Mr Papandreou."
"Do you remember which political family that prime minister belonged to?"
"It was Karamanlis."
"(DE) Mr President, after four years of the Karamanlis government ..."
"(Uproar)."
"No, the structural problems in Greece go back further than that."
"In 2000, this Parliament debated whether Greece should join the euro area."
"The social-democrats, the German Government, had been calling for this."
"With your help there was a two-thirds majority in Parliament in favour of Greece joining the euro area."
"That is a fact and it has nothing to do with nationalism."
"I would like to answer the question from Mr Schulz about debts in Germany and in Spain."
"Of course, Spain's national debt level is lower than that of Germany."
"Spain did not have to finance a reunification process."
"However, the Zapatero government in Spain has other problems."
"It has allowed 6 million people into the country and given 2 million of them Spanish citizenship and now unemployment is running at over 20%."
"This is a structural problem and it is caused by one person: Mr Zapatero."
"Mr President, in the Council and the Commission there are many who believe that we can only succeed in the global economy if we downgrade workers' rights, our collective bargaining systems and our pensions."
"In other words we must dilute, we are told, our social model."
"Public finances are to be reorganised with the single focus of bringing public debt down to an arbitrary 60% of GDP, and deficits are basically to be ruled out."
"That is the same Council which, if I remember well, agreed on a Europe 2020 Strategy, but it does not seem to care where the money to fulfil that strategy will come from."
"If we have to significantly cut our public debt year on year, if we have to avoid deficits above 1%, which the Commission proposes, and if we have to do all of this in a low-growth environment with high unemployment, how can we possibly deliver on the 2020 Strategy?"
"This is a wrong-headed economic strategy of cost competitiveness and extreme fiscal austerity and it will set Europe on a declining path at a crucial moment in its history."
"President Barroso is not here at the moment, but I think he needs to tell the Council that it needs to redefine the political agenda in at least three areas."
"First, we must complete Economic and Monetary Union by creating a European stability agency for common eurobonds and I am glad that President Barroso did not rule out the idea of eurobonds today."
"This will end speculative attacks, bring liquidity to the market for government debt and cut the overall cost of debt for the eurozone."
"Second, we must rebalance the proposed legislation on economic governance."
"We agree that fiscal discipline will require strong rules and strong implementation, but we must also align this with the proper implementation of the Europe 2020 objectives in each country, and that must be reflected in the legislation."
"Finally, we need new public financing sources."
"The crisis has wiped out years of budgetary efforts."
"A financial transactions tax is well overdue, and it is a scandal that the Council seems to be frozen in the headlights and unable to make a decision on this tax."
"These are the reforms we need urgently."
"- (FR) Mr President, in the history of parliaments, rarely have powers been given to them."
"When parliaments were offered more powers, they generally took them."
"This morning's debate leads me to believe that we - the rapporteurs of the economic governance package - are right to go further than what is being proposed, because, Commissioner, in substance, the Commission is telling us 'We tried but we did not succeed.'"
"The Council, for its part, is telling us 'We do not want to go any further.'"
"Well, as it happens, there's Parliament."
"Furthermore, it is the Council that wanted to increase the rights of Parliament, it is not Parliament that is exercising powers unduly."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, we are colegislators."
"So, I simply have the pleasure of announcing that the report I am tabling this morning also covers eurobonds, because the debate must take place here, in plenary."
"I do not accept it when Mr Barroso tells us 'Oh la la, it's all very complicated; we have already done a lot of stupid things in the Council, so now you really do have to shut up.'"
"We are going to do exactly the opposite."
"We are going to talk about it within the context of democracy."
"Secondly, there is also the idea of a European Monetary Fund, because, in fact, all these solutions which, as Martin Schulz said, are transitional, are not necessarily what our citizens expect."
"You can watch the trains go by or you can work."
"This Parliament is going to try to work."
"We do not have a blueprint, we do not claim to have the absolute truth, but I think it is totally unacceptable that the debate is taking place in the Financial Times or in the Zeit and not in the European Parliament."
"So we will do our work."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, I very much welcome the call made by Martin Schulz that we try to re-establish the confidence of our citizens and that means telling the truth and not resorting to oversimplification."
"The first oversimplification consists in saying that eurobonds take responsibility away from the Member States."
"This is patently false, because no-one has ever asked that the Member States pool 100% of their debts."
"In any case, under a eurobond scheme, the Member States will still have to go directly to the markets for some of their debts, and there they will be able to judge the quality of their signature, which will be reflected in the interest rates they will have to pay."
"This is an oversimplification that must be avoided."
"The second oversimplification consists in saying 'We are bailing out these Greeks, these feckless Irish.'"
"I would, however, point out that what we are doing is lending money, and lending money at rates that are particularly favourable to the lenders."
"We are doing good business on the back of this."
"And so, there are two possibilities: either we consider that, with our loans, Greece and Ireland no longer present a risk and that we should lend to them at a rate corresponding to zero risk or at least an extremely limited risk, or that there is a risk that they will default."
"I would like to end with a word to our German friends, especially the CDU."
"Mr Langen, you talked about reunification and you are right."
"When Germany was reunified, the entire deutschmark area, to which Belgium belonged and to which, in the end, France was very loyal, paid for it in the form of very high interest rates."
"It was the right thing to do."
"It was right both historically, because the reunification of Germany represented the reunification of Europe as we know it, and economically, because, in the end, everyone would benefit from the faster pace of growth this would lead to."
"So, today I say to the CDU 'Bear this in mind' and we ask that Germany does the same."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, it seems somewhat ironically appropriate that the European Council should be discussing a permanent crisis mechanism, as the euro certainly seems to be lurching from crisis to crisis at the moment."
"Although many of us in the UK always thought that the euro was a historic mistake, both for our own country and for Europe as a whole, we of course take no satisfaction in seeing this situation."
"We want to see it resolved at a European level by a decisive return to fiscal discipline across the Union."
"It will not be solved by more borrowing either at an EU or at a local level."
"But let us be clear where the responsibility for this situation for the euro lies."
"It is the duty of every Member State within the eurozone to fulfil its commitments to that zone and it is the job of other participating states to ensure that they do so."
"This is one of the key reasons why they have a separate meeting of eurozone ministers."
"To put it bluntly, the stable management of the eurozone is primarily the responsibility of the members of the eurozone."
"The rest of us can provide political support, but that is as far as it should go."
"There cannot be any justification for further burdens or any sanctions being imposed on those Member States who chose not to make the mistake of joining the eurozone in the first place."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is exactly a year since the Greek economy started to collapse and Greece got involved in the disastrous memorandum and support mechanism."
"One year on, Mr Langen, the country is on the verge of bankruptcy: firstly, social bankruptcy, given that unemployment is set to reach 15% next year, while just yesterday the government passed a bill abolishing collective agreements and today the whole country is on strike and, secondly, economic bankruptcy and, this time the deficit and debt have not been increased by the 'lying Greeks' in PASOK and New Democracy; they have been increased by alchemist Commissioners using Eurostat statistics as they so choose so as to increase the debts of the weak and reduce the debts of the strong."
"If, therefore, a mechanism is adopted like the one used for Greece, we are certainly heading for bankruptcy."
"If the Council is preparing such a mechanism, it will plunge countries into recession, leading to unemployment and favours for banks and big business."
"I wonder: is this the European vision that Mr Barroso, who is not here to explain, spoke of at the beginning."
"(FI) Mr President, in my opinion, each country is responsible for its own economy."
"Countries are not liable for each other's debts."
"This is also contained in Article 125 of the Treaty."
"When it suits people the Treaty is adhered to, but when it does not, the Treaty is ignored."
"This has been seen in referenda: France says no, the Netherlands says no, and Ireland says no."
"Two of these results were dealt with by Parliament and one by means of another referendum."
"The interpretation of the Articles in the Treaty seems to depend on which way the wind is blowing."
"The Finnish Government has imposed on Finnish taxpayers the sort of unfair guarantor liabilities that we will eventually have to pay."
"We do not understand why Finnish workers and small entrepreneurs should sweat blood working to pay the debts of gamblers and liars."
"It is simply not right."
"When there were problems in the Soviet Union they called for more socialism."
"People congregated in Moscow: more socialism."
"When there are problems in Europe, people congregate in Brussels: more integration."
"The end result will be exactly the same."
"This will not work."
"Healthy societies are built from the bottom upwards."
"Democracy is built from the bottom upwards: not downwards from some ivory tower up above."
"That is just the way it goes."
"A common economic policy for Europe will not work."
"Europe can only work as an economic and free trade area, the like of which it should become once again."
"I would just like to say a few words about eurobonds."
"I went to Mellunmäki in Helsinki to talk about eurobonds, and when I said what they were the women clutched their handbags tightly and the men wondered whether they still had their wallets on them."
"This will not work."
"(DE) Mr President, we have just seen a tragic accusation being made against Germany."
"It is an ominous reminder of the late 1920s."
"As an enthusiastic pro-European and stubborn supporter of the Euro, I would like to ask you: Have you not noticed that you are driving the European Union, this great project for peace and economic prosperity, into the ground?"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit has rightly said that we always react too late and always in retrospect."
"Now we must look to the future."
"Have you not noticed what is going on outside?"
"People are no longer interested in the squabbling between the socialists and the conservatives, either in my home country or here in the European Parliament."
"They are interested in solutions and in whether their money is still safe."
"We have to say honestly to them that this is no longer the case."
"We must bring forward the next step and admit that we need the courage to write off debts, we must finally make the banks pay, even if it affects our life insurance policies, and we must establish a new European political project which is not burdened with the problems of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We are caught in a trap."
"If we amend this article, we will find that Ireland will vote no in a referendum."
"We can expect the same thing to happen in my home country."
"In addition, we have a huge problem in the United Kingdom."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you must wake up to what is happening."
"(NL) Mr President, in this time of crisis we should not lose sight of the fact that, over the past ten years, the euro has brought us a great deal of prosperity and stability, as well as many jobs."
"The euro is therefore well worth strongly defending."
"However, this will require a decisive European summit and a whole lot more in the way of unity."
"Unity is in desperately short supply, not only when it comes to the permanent crisis mechanism, but also when it comes to robust financial governance."
"In this debate, Mr President, 'eurobonds' seems to be the magic word, as if it will make public debt problems disappear like snow melting in the sun."
"However, those in this House who are calling for eurobonds should also be aware that these entail significant obligations and a rigorous budgetary discipline which goes much further than the proposals for strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact that are now before us."
"President Trichet said 'a fiscal union'."
"Are those of you in this House who are calling for eurobonds prepared for that?"
"I have my doubts about that."
"Mr President, we must put our energy into the proposals now before us in order to strengthen the foundation under the euro."
"That is urgent and we in this House are working hard to achieve it."
"We also need a more rule-based approach in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, because prevention is better than cure."
"We must also ensure a greater level of joint responsibility amongst Member States, not just for the benefits, but also for the obligations and commitment which stem from the Stability and Growth Pact."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in critical situations, Europe has always found a way out of a crisis."
"Not because different interests have been played off against one another, but because we have combined our interests, which has allowed us to take new paths."
"I would have liked to ask Mr Barroso a question, but unfortunately he is no longer here."
"There will, of course, soon be important press conferences on the subject of how we can rescue Europe using the lowest common denominator, but Mr Rehn may be able to pass my question on."
"I do not understand why we are not taking the following route."
"Eurobonds are a sensible solution."
"Mr Schulz has said that on behalf of our group and, in Germany, where this is a critical issue, my party is saying the same thing."
"The German Government in particular has reservations and there are also reservations in other countries which are paying less interest."
"Why do we not proceed as follows?"
"We are saying that these problems can be solved."
"We are now planning to launch eurobonds, but we are putting together a sensible package."
"What do we need to enable Europe to act?"
"How can we put money into the coffers?"
"How can we create more taxation potential for a sensible, long-term economy?"
"We are launching eurobonds and we are linking this launch with the introduction of the financial transaction tax in the European Union."
"This package could result in a win-win situation, which would enable everyone to benefit."
"Ask Mrs Merkel at the European summit if she is prepared to do this."
"Why is it not possible?"
"Why does the Commission not make a proposal of this kind?"
"It would help everyone and enable a major new project for Europe to emerge from the crisis."
"I am waiting for the Commission to make this proposal."
"You must stop trying to talk your way out of it."
"It is time for you to act in the interest of the citizens of Europe and in the interest of the Member States, so that we can find our way back to a sensible path of growth."
"Our fate is in your hands, but you must have the courage to take the initiative now."
"(SV) Mr President, I think the past year demonstrates that a common currency requires clear, common ground rules, and it is evident that we do not currently have such rules."
"It is also clear that the euro area is suffering from a definite lack of credibility in the eyes of both the people and the financial market."
"I do not agree with Mr Bullman."
"Rather, I believe that the Commission has done a good job and has put forward ambitious proposals."
"As regards the challenges that we are currently facing, I think the problem does not lie with the Commission, but with the Council."
"Of course, the Council has a rather difficult meeting ahead of it over the next few days."
"I would like to say how pleased I am that the Commission has now also tabled a proposal that will enable us to correct macroeconomic imbalances in future."
"Up to now, we have focused solely on finances and deficits of the cities, and that is completely inadequate, as the case of Ireland quite clearly shows."
"What I am less pleased about is the way the Council works, as exemplified by the horse-trading between Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel with a view to making the Commission's sound proposals less binding, which will mean that the proposal will not lead to any improvements."
"We ought to remember what happened in 2005 when the Stability and Growth Pact was watered down."
"It was the same countries that created a situation at that point which, in the long term, was able to lead to what has now happened in Greece."
"I hope that the Council will get a grip on itself and realise what type of decision we need - otherwise we will not get ourselves out of this situation."
"(DE) Mr President, the Flemish politician Bart De Wever, in an interview in Der Spiegel magazine, said that Belgium had become a transfer society."
"This fact lay at the heart of the problem in Belgium and not the language issue."
"Solidarity had become a one-way street."
"The EU is in the process of doing just the same thing."
"We are turning a service society into a transfer society and the euro is one means of achieving this."
"It is opening up the path to cheap money in a number of states."
"As the President of the EU Council, Mr Van Rompuy, has said, it has become a sleeping tablet."
"It is undermining the competitive ability of the various countries."
"Now many European politicians are calling for the introduction of another sleeping tablet: Eurobonds."
"This will simply make the gap wider."
"If we continue in this way, within a few years the EU will be in the same position as Belgium is now: a transfer society whose political foundations are crumbling."
"Over Christmas I will be reading the book 'Save our Money' by Mr Henkel, former president of the Federation of German Industry."
"Perhaps you should do the same thing, so that you can find out what people in Germany are thinking."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the New York Times revelations, investigations are ongoing in the United States into the secret club of nine banks - one of which is European - whose executives meet every Wednesday to agree what action to take on derivatives."
"The Crisis Committee was completely unaware and Europe is a mere spectator."
"The Federal Reserve had to account for the USD 13 trillion spent to bail out the banks."
"Would you mind telling us what the Fed asked for the European bank rescue packages?"
"Is it not the critical situation in the banks - and not state budgets - that requires the sum in the European rescue fund to be doubled and the preparation of a EUR 2 000 billion bail-out?"
"What is stopping us calling on the European Central Bank to account transparently and in detail for its actions as was done in the United States for the Fed?"
"This would put paid to suspicions that it acted and continues to act discretionally and not in the common interest of the citizens and taxpayers of the European Union's Member States."
"Why on earth have discussions never been held over the adoption of measures to impose a genuine and effective separation between commercial banks and speculative banks, as in the Glass-Steagall Act?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on the need to create an instrument that is able to intervene in the event of a crisis."
"This instrument must necessarily be linked to rigorous and careful budgetary policies in the Member States."
"I hope this will mean that crises like the one we are experiencing in these months will not be repeated."
"Today's debate hinges on the best way to finance this instrument."
"As we are all aware, the private sector was partly responsibile for the crisis in some countries, and in such cases it is right that they should shoulder some responsibility, though their share should be assessed on a case-by-case basis."
"However, I think we need to find new and innovative ways to finance the anti-crisis instrument."
"One example could be eurobonds, which some see as a new burden on national budgets."
"However, this is not the case."
"On the contrary, by issuing eurobonds the anti-crisis instrument could be financed through the market, drawing on foreign capital and people looking to invest."
"A mechanism based solely on pro-rata contributions made by simply appropriating reserves would amount to a great burden for the Member States, which would have to find resources and capital to deposit that would not, however, bring any yield or return."
"In a situation like the present, in which Member States are asked to implement severe budget policies to reduce deficits and debts as well as to pay contributions to participate in the anti-crisis fund, there is a real risk of collapse."
"The European economy cannot be revitalised unless, at the same time, we use the strength of the euro on international markets and the resulting improved credit rating to heal it."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, you have heard a very clear message from this Parliament, a request for the Commission to act, to intervene."
"The Commission is requested to refrain from limiting itself to rubber-stamping the minimum possible consent between States, which is the same as saying that the Commission needs to stop being limited by the will of the most powerful."
"The Commission needs to shoulder its duty and obligation to take the initiative."
"I regret to say that the conclusions that we anticipate for the next summit meeting will not produce a solution, above all because the anticipated mechanism for intervening must be adopted unanimously by all Member States, and we need a European dimension, rather than a dimension that allows for all kinds of distortions and some countries to control others."
"On the other hand, reviewing the Treaty at this time will open up a Pandora's box, and in any case, I would have liked an answer to one question: will the new mechanism be able to buy government bonds?"
"Commissioner, an in-depth review is required, and the Commission cannot ignore the current debate on eurobonds, and provide no response to the initiatives that various actors are taking in the meantime, namely Juncker, Mário Monti, some elements within this Parliament and think tanks."
"The Commission needs to table a proposal and needs to be able to defend it."
"Lastly, one final note: the euro area does not have a global problem - well, it does have global problem, but one concentrated on its insufficient growth rather than unequal growth within it."
"Where are the means that need to be in place alongside economic governance and penalisation in order effectively to promote and bring the 2020 Strategy to fruition?"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Schulz is right."
"We are in the midst of a huge crisis of confidence and the members of the Council are pulling the wool over the citizens' eyes."
"They are telling them that everything is under control, we just need to make small changes to the treaty by introducing a permanent stability mechanism and then the problem will be resolved."
"In fact, the situation is not under control."
"The Member States are reacting rather than actually taking action."
"They are desperately firefighting, but they cannot put out the flames."
"The markets are asking themselves: Who is actually in control in Europe and in the euro area?"
"The EU has reached a critical turning point."
"If we do not choose the right path now, we will not even be able to maintain the status quo."
"Instead we will take a step backwards."
"What we need are further moves towards integration."
"We need more Europe."
"We must finish establishing the internal market, including the service sector."
"Alongside the monetary union, we need an economic, budgetary and fiscal union."
"We also need a strong Commission which has the right and the power to control and monitor this economic union and to impose sanctions automatically, in cases where this is justified."
"If we take these steps towards more integration, then we can talk about the introduction of eurobonds."
"Then we will have laid the foundations for them."
"However, during all of this we must ensure that we have the long-term investment funding that we need, despite all of the justifiable austerity measures, to secure the European Union's competitive ability in the medium and long term."
"We must finally tell the citizens the truth."
"We need solutions without blinkers, we must discuss the issues without bringing in ideologies and we must stop trying to muddle through."
"What we require is action for the long term, rather than short-term reactions."
"Madam President, let us start with the good news."
"Yes, there are signs of some recovery in parts of Europe's wider economy."
"But this is being threatened by the prolonged uncertainly which risks drying up funding and stalling investments."
"Everyone in Europe, including the UK, has a vested interest in the strength of the euro area's economy."
"Robust and transparent economic planning to control profligate government spending and unsustainable debt levels is a vital part of this for all 27 countries."
"The eurozone countries have realised the need for a permanent crisis resolution, but there are many questions, some of which are addressed in this Parliament's resolution."
"Firstly, what should be the nature of private sector involvement?"
"I welcome the suggestion of following the IMF precedent to protect public money with preferred creditor status."
"Secondly what treaty changes are you talking about?"
"This issue needs to be clarified."
"And finally the permanent crisis mechanism has been described as a tool to strengthen the eurozone."
"Those countries who seek to join the euro should be given the option to participate but those of us who have elected not to join should not be forced to contribute."
"(FR) Madam President, what worries the citizens of Europe as much as the financial markets is doubt."
"Now that Europeans have a united destiny are they capable of facing it in a spirit of solidarity?"
"Today, solidarity is manifesting itself in the depth of the crisis."
"That is fine, but it is not enough."
"United in adversity, Europeans must also show that they are acting in solidarity when mapping out the way ahead because, if the crisis affected Europe longer than other continents, it is because our economy had already been weakened by ten years of sluggish growth, just l% per year on average."
"The ten years of the Lisbon strategy were a lost decade."
"In Agenda 2020, European leaders came up with a plan to revive our economy, but they did not say how it was going to be financed and controlled or what the incentives or possible sanctions would be."
"That is why the time has come to supplement the Stability and Growth Pact with a solidarity pact, as has already been said here, in plenary."
"The word 'solidarity' appears 23 times in the Treaty: let us translate the word into action."
"A procedure for the coordination of fiscal policies is being set up to guarantee stability by preventing deficits."
"Well, let us broaden its scope, let us coordinate with one another to guarantee future financing."
"We need to spend less, but spend better, not each one of us alone at home, under the threat of sanctions, but all together."
"If they want to avoid the worst, Europeans must be united to prepare the best."
"(SL) Madam President, we Europeans are living with an interesting paradox."
"On the one hand, during its 12-year existence, the euro has proved to be the most stable of the global currencies."
"According to official figures provided by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, average inflation during this period has been 1.97%, which is only 3 percentage points below the 2% target."
"The euro's value against the US dollar has, throughout, to all practical purposes, remained higher than it was when the European currency was established."
"On the other hand, though, we have been hearing stories lately that the euro might even be at the risk of collapse."
"How could we have got into such a situation?"
"Grotesque and irresponsible behaviour caused by the populist policies of both the left and the right has brought us to this point."
"However, in defending our currency, are we really going to allow democracy to prove weaker than relatively authoritarian regimes?"
"We need responsible behaviour, we need five golden rules of responsible behaviour to be enshrined in our policies."
"Let us adopt them here in Parliament, let us decide how we are going to measure the level of responsible behaviour and behaviour which benefits the common good promoted by the policies in our Member States."
"The tax on financial transactions and eurobonds should therefore be the cornerstone."
"That is our duty today, to adopt such policies, in defence of our common currency."
"(ES) Madam President, what we need right now are clear rules, and what we are doing is precisely the opposite."
"I am therefore going to make a few proposals in order to re-establish clarity."
"In the European semester, Parliament wants to focus on a series of discussions, which are currently unfocused and do not fit with public opinion."
"We want the political responses to the recommendations made to the Member States over the next six months to be taken into account when establishing the penalties provided for in the legislative package on governance."
"My group would like to make it clear that there are no magic solutions in the legislative package for getting us out of the crisis."
"There are the well-known methods of budgetary discipline and structural reforms in order to maintain competitiveness."
"With regard to the crisis mechanism, as you said yesterday, Commissioner, President Barroso promised us here that it was going to be a European mechanism."
"Today the Council is proposing an intergovernmental mechanism."
"Is this European - in Mr Barroso's terms - because it appears that the fund will be based in Europe rather than in the Cayman Islands, or does the Commission intend to help us to create a mechanism following EU procedure in which Parliament has a contribution to make?"
"With regard to eurobonds, the Commission, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the experts say that it is a good idea, but that it is a premature idea, therefore we are late."
"What I propose to the Commission is that we begin a debate to shape a system of eurobonds that gives reasonable financing to the countries that do the right thing and punishes those that do not by forcing them to go to the markets at rates that are genuine deterrents."
"That is the only workable way of combining fiscal discipline and economic growth."
"Do not come back to me with discussions about whether it is too early or too late, because what we know now is that we have always been too late."
"Let us see if, for once, by changing the rules, we can be early."
"(FR) Madam President, the euro is our common asset and, today, the trade unions told Parliament that they were concerned that employees themselves were paying the price for the crisis through a weak euro, a euro under attack and not through a growth-promoting, job-creating euro."
"It is therefore essential that we do not pursue a simple technical revision of the treaties and that the two major dysfunctions of the euro area revealed by the crisis are addressed."
"The first approach is to introduce eurobonds, as we have heard."
"Eurobonds will not only stabilise the level of the euro, they will also immediately counter the speculative attack."
"The second approach to introducing fiscal justice and to making the financial market pay the price for the crisis is precisely to introduce a tax on financial transactions so that it is not employees who, as a result of fiscal injustice, pay the price for this crisis."
"Finally, a European debt agency must be established, which must be able to pool some of the sovereign debt of the Member States."
"Finally, I would also like to support Mr Juncker and to say that increasing the stability fund, which was proposed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Director-General of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is a good idea."
"Early intervention - as we have heard - not being late and choosing to become strong and not weak would enable us to perform an act of governance that would re-introduce the confidence called for by our President, Martin Schultz."
"(Applause)"
"(PT) Madam President, the first point that I would like to make clear here, and which is important that we reinforce in this Parliament, is that, contrary to what we sometimes read in the press and in the pronouncements of some European leaders, the euro as a currency has been crucial in our response to the current crisis."
"Without the euro, we would be in an extremely difficult situation, with the currencies of weaker countries facing enormous devaluation and the resulting deutschmark facing an impossible increase in value in order to sustain the German and European economies."
"The euro was therefore a stabilising factor, not only for countries within the euro area, but also for the currencies of the countries that have not wanted to belong to the euro area."
"Again, because we need to defend this Community that has succeeded in responding to a crisis like never before, and given that we will see, for example, what happens to the dollar and the United States in the future, we will also see how the euro does in fact have its advantages."
"We now have the responsibility, within this Council, to do everything we can to defend the euro, namely to create a stabilisation fund that follows community methodology and is able to introduce responsibility within countries that are in the most fragile situation, and solidarity within those that have met their obligations and have not always shown themselves, at least through their external declarations, able to adopt a position of solidarity within the context of the euro area."
"(ES) Madam President, the year that is coming to an end - 2010 - has been described more than once as the year in which we lived dangerously."
"I think, therefore, that this debate ought to be useful in highlighting the lessons of 2010, so that we can draw conclusions for 2011."
"The first conclusion concerns the unsustainable imbalances in the financial sector of the European economy and the distortions in its real economy."
"The second is the unsustainable imbalance in the single currency and the need for coordination of economic, fiscal and budgetary policies, which are still in a fragile state."
"The third, and main conclusion concerns the imbalance between the speed of the crisis and the slowness of response times."
"From an economic point of view, this means that the European Central Bank needs to be more active in response to speculative assaults on sovereign debt, and in 2011 we need to lay the foundations for a European debt agency that can issue eurobonds."
"Likewise, with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, there needs to be a debate regarding the necessary taxation, the banking tax and the tax on speculation, that is short-term speculative transactions, and on the need for own resources in the European Union."
"However, the debate that is important to Parliament is the debate regarding the political consequences of the crisis, because the European Union's motto is - I stress once again - 'United in diversity', and under no circumstances is it 'split by adversity'."
"Parliament therefore needs to confront those that seek to stigmatise some Member States in relation to others, dividing European public opinion and pitting Europeans against each other."
"Parliament represents 500 million Europeans from a Union that has 27 Member States, and as on Orwell's farm, there are none more equal than others."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the summit on 16 December."
"It would be good if the Council could say to us after the summit: We are aware of the gaps and the mistakes, we know where we have failed and we understand the limits of the treaty."
"Self-satisfaction and accusations of guilt, attempts to gloss over mistakes and a superficial approach will not solve any problems or create any confidence."
"Let us stop playing with Europe."
"This really is all about Europe."
"I endorse everything that Mr Klinz has said."
"As it is now only a few days before Christmas, I would like to say: Light a candle of determination and common interest, a candle representing the new seriousness, honesty and confidence in the future of the Europe Union."
"Light a candle for a change of political course in Europe, a move from the crisis to competitiveness, from the spirit of Deauville to the political union, from saving to investment and reform, from the monetary union to the political union."
"Because of Germany's constitutional problems, the addition to the treaty is simply a political crutch for the further development of the rescue package, nothing more and nothing less."
"It does not represent a solution."
"Do not try to make it more important than it really is."
"Stop the day-by-day policymaking and put forward a complete concept in response to the crisis which will move us towards political union."
"Put an end to the discord."
"It is enough, it is not enough and, actually, we do not know where things are going."
"We must call on the Commission to produce a concept for an economic, social and financial union, so that we can take the next step towards integration at the end of next year and really do the job properly."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, tomorrow sees the start of one of the most crucial European Councils in the history of the European Union as a whole and EMU in particular and the question is whether the Heads of State or Government will be up to the job."
"We very much doubt it, because the philosophy that certain heads have introduced into the European Council is not a philosophy of overcoming the crisis on the basis of solidarity and, of course, responsibility. It is a crisis management philosophy, a philosophy that focuses on and is confined to the details of a permanent mechanism."
"The European Council will not be up to the job, because it will not send out the message of economic and political cohesion that needs to be sent out, not only to convince the markets, but to convince, first and foremost, the entrenched European public, who are viewing each other with suspicion and who have again started to become xenophobic; to convince them of the value of the European vision and to remind them that there are more things that unite than divide us."
"Madam President, I cannot understand why the Socialists are trying to escape from the responsibility of Socialist policies."
"It is true that the reasons for the deficits we see in Europe are different."
"It is also true that Socialist governments have entered into budget deficit problems because of a deliberate policy of increased spending and increased deficits."
"We had this debate in Parliament in the spring of 2009 and we had it in a number of Member States."
"I remember the Swedish Social Democrats criticised the Swedish Government for not increasing the deficit and the spending."
"Then we have seen what has happened."
"This is for me a reason why we need stable rules regarding the Stability and Growth Pact but also stable rules regarding the consequences."
"We cannot have a situation where Member States which are causing problems for financial systems and causing increased interest rates are allowed to escape from the consequences by letting other citizens pay for those interest rates."
"We need to have stability, and eurobonds will not be a solution to that problem."
"We can have eurobonds for other reasons. maybe."
"As for the financial mechanism, it must be financed and based upon the risks that Member States are creating."
"If you take a bigger risk, run a bigger deficit, then you also need to finance the financial mechanism a little bit more."
"That is a way of taking responsibility for deliberate policies."
"Do not forget that the consequences we see in a number of countries are the consequences of the debates we had in national parliaments, and in this Parliament, when some of us argued for increased spending."
"Now we see the bitter results."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I can understand, Mr Hökmark, that you need to give a nice speech for the people at home in Sweden."
"However, would you please answer the following question for me: Which country in the European Union has the highest long-term level of national debt and which party is in government in this country?"
"(Mr Schulz continued speaking, with his microphone turned off) Madam President, I hope I can proceed without further interventions."
"First of all my message is very much to you, Mr Schulz, because I want you to remember what you argued here in this Parliament two years ago."
"You argued that the Union and the Member States should increase their spending."
"The problem is that some of the Member States have had Socialist governments, and in all these governments, in all these countries, we have seen the deficit going up a result of the policies you advocated."
"Mr Schulz, can you deny that?"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, as my fellow Member has not answered the question, I will answer it on his behalf."
"The country is Italy and its prime minister is Mr Berlusconi."
"The Christian Democrats have been in power in Italy almost uninterruptedly since 1946."
"(FI) Madam President, I too would like to ask our fellow Member how the Socialists in Ireland and Greece might have caused their countries to run into debt."
"Since you are now the leading political party at present in Europe and the Commission is inclined to the right, is it not now the job of the right also to show the way out of this crisis and not blame previous governments or the governments that came before them?"
"Madam President, I want to remind colleagues here that I said there are a number of different reasons for the deficit problems we have, but I also said it is true - and neither Mr Schulz nor his colleagues have denied this - that we have seen these problems coming up in all Socialist governments because it was a deliberate policy."
"I absolutely agree if we are talking about Ireland for example, that there were huge mistakes, but the interesting thing is that it was a deliberate policy to increase spending and deficits in order to meet the crisis and the problems, and now we see the results."
"That is the message to Mr Schulz and others."
"(The speaker agreed to take three blue-card questions under Rule 149(8))"
"Colleagues, just to let the speaker and everybody know what is happening, we now have three more people who want to ask a blue-card question."
"As this possibility has been introduced by the working group on parliamentary reform, I am very sympathetic to that and we have enough time, but nevertheless I have to ask the speaker if he will take all those questions."
"Then I would ask everybody whether we can take the questions in turn and then ask Mr Hökmark to answer."
"We will then finalise that part of the speaking time."
"Madam President, I want to say to Mr Hökmark, the point that you are making about Socialist governments may be true to some extent, but right-wing governments basically choose to do the same thing by piling up private debt instead of public debt."
"This is no better for the economy and is really a different way of doing exactly the same thing which is unsustainable."
"(DE) Madam President, I wanted to ask Mr Hökmark, as he has been here for some time, whether he remembers that Belgium, Greece and Italy had debts amounting to more than 130% of their national product at the start of the monetary union and that the figure in Greece has risen, while in Belgium and Italy it has fallen by more than 30% and more than 25% respectively."
"Does he remember this?"
"(EL) Madam President, I have a simple question to ask Mr Langen and Mr Hökmark, who like to idealise the debt crisis and obviously target socialist governments collectively:"
"Have you ever questioned your colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) who were governing my country up to a year ago about the fact that they gave you and the European Commission - you can ask Mr Rehn - official statistics that Greece's deficit for 2009 was 6.9%, not the 15% recently confirmed by Eurostat?"
"Madam President, this discussion has clarified some of the things that we need to remember."
"Let us not forget my first point, which is - and it is interesting to note that none of my Socialist colleagues have denied this - that all the Socialist governments which implemented Socialist policies have run into deep deficit crisis."
"We now see the crisis coming to country after country because of a deliberate policy that Mr Schulz and others defended in this Parliament two years ago."
"We can look at the records of this Parliament and see that this was exactly what was said in the debate here by you, Mr Schulz, and by your colleagues."
"Now you can see the bitter result."
"I wanted to underline that."
"I note that all you have to say is, 'yes, you are right but other countries also have problems'."
"However, you are not arguing against my main point, that your policies created the problems."
"That is worth remembering."
"I think it should be put on the record."
"Mr Lamberts also draws attention to these problems."
"But the interesting thing is that, while it is true that a number of countries have problems because of the financial crisis, it is also true - as I think Mr Lamberts will recognise and appreciate - that in most of the countries which are taking a stable view on public finances, the governments are non-Socialist."
"I do not think that you, or anyone else in this Chamber, can point to a Socialist government that has not run into deficit problems."
"Madam President, what matters are policies and not who applied them."
"Let him cast the first stone..."
"The crisis of the euro may not end with Ireland and we may have not seen the worst yet."
"The market predators will never endlessly attack any vulnerable opening, despite the painful austerity measures taken by all Member States."
"But if the EU wins this battle, and succeeds in adversity by demonstrating determination to do whatever it takes in solidarity and concerted effort to thwart regulators and convince the markets, then this would be the triumph of European integration and a great victory."
"This will be achieved as a result of collective wisdom."
"Let us prove wrong those who predict the end of the euro and the withdrawal of countries, strong and weak, from the eurozone."
"Fiscal discipline, economic governance and the rescue of the euro will be incomplete without a mutually agreed plan at European level to stimulate growth."
"In the past, an American Marshall Plan saved the economy of Europe."
"The challenge today is an equivalent from Europeans for Europeans."
"Madam President, today the Irish House of Representatives, the Dáil, will vote on the EU-IMF financial assistance package."
"These have been very difficult times for Ireland, with tax increases and cuts in expenditure."
"The last week's budget was only a mere reflection of the difficulties so many Irish people are going through at the moment."
"This follows 14% pay cuts in the public and private sectors."
"However, I strongly believe that the EU-IMF financial package will help Ireland restore confidence by getting the banks capitalised and lending again, and by repairing the public finances."
"I do not necessarily share in accepting the detail of the plan, but overall figures are supported by Fine Gael."
"The underlying economic trends in Ireland are quite good."
"It will require good government and Dáil oversight to ensure our finances never again get out of hand."
"It will also require some thought at EU and ECB level on the contribution made by low interest rates to property inflation."
"I was a lone voice in this Chamber for two and half years questioning Mr Trichet on this particular difficulty."
"With the establishment of a permanent successor to the European Financial Stability Mechanism, from which Ireland will be receiving EUR 22.5 billion in loans if it draws them down, the EU-IMF package is a positive move for the eurozone."
"May I say also in conclusion that there are many people here who consider themselves federalists and yet want to see some sort of harmonisation in taxation."
"In the United States over 50% of companies in the copyright business register in Delaware."
"Why do they do that?"
"Because of the tax situation in Delaware."
"There are some very ignorant comments made in this Chamber by self-serving people who want to advance their own national causes by making inaccurate statements, and they will be challenged."
"Madam President, the financial crisis has indicated that there is an even greater need for more Europe."
"The lesson to be learned is that acting predominantly on the basis of national considerations does not help any Member State."
"Tomorrow, therefore, is an occasion for joint action, fiscal consolidation and a stability pact with sanctions."
"This will also be the time to solve the long-standing paradox of Europe."
"The EU is based on a single market but this single market is still not complete."
"Now is the time to start the single digital market."
"We need to set up a permanent crisis management mechanism, preferably group-based."
"Secondly, as action should be led on prevention and early intervention, there is a need to better harmonise conditions for early intervention and for activating the crisis-management mechanisms, whilst avoiding, of course, over-regulation."
"Thirdly, the purpose of crisis-management funds should be clearly defined."
"Their goal is to ensure macro-financial stability."
"They should not be used to solve other current problems."
"Fourthly, supervisory rights should be defined more precisely at EU level, such as in the case of possible intervention into the activities of financial institutions, which will include the right to stop paying dividends or stop activities that pose unjustified risks."
"(FR) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I have listened to this long debate as a citizen."
"I would say that Mr Barroso's proposals were very interesting."
"We would like to see them acted upon."
"A clear and comprehensible political will and a discourse of truth are the necessary conditions for restoring our citizens' confidence."
"It is imperative that we do not mask realities."
"There is public spending, which we must cover or reduce."
"There are public and private debts, which we must repay."
"There are numerous experts who have ideas on everything."
"Those who did not see the crisis coming are now full of brilliant solutions."
"But in a difficult situation, let us use common sense."
"Let us not reproduce in the management of public finances the mistakes and errors of the private sector that led to the financial and banking crisis."
"Sophisticated arrangements do not create value and wealth."
"They create illusions and often benefit only the speculators."
"The fact of the matter is that the Member States have lived beyond their means."
"We must have the courage to draw the necessary conclusions and ensure that the burden of recovery is apportioned fairly."
"Madam President, firstly a complaint."
"You said this is an important debate, and it is."
"I find it somewhat unacceptable that Mr Barroso and many of the political leaders have departed the Chamber as soon as they have given their speeches."
"In fairness to Mr Schulz, he has stayed here from the beginning to the end and I would like to compliment him on that."
"Secondly, I want to say that, when all is said and done, one of the main reasons for the financial crisis is that governments failed to govern and political leaders failed to lead."
"Thankfully, we are now bringing that situation under control with the new supervisory architecture which should be coming in on 1 January, the credit rating agencies report which we dealt with last night, and today's permanent financial stability mechanism."
"They are all to be welcomed."
"If Mr Barroso were here, I would like to ask him if he can guarantee that a referendum will not be required in Ireland and elsewhere to make the minimum treaty changes he spoke of."
"Finally, I want to say to those who have asked that a written declaration be signed by Members that this is a direct attack on corporation tax in Ireland."
"That should not be done."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, an ideological debate has unfolded here, even though we could give several examples of how the Schröder government implemented a very serious reform policy, or how in Hungary the right-wing government currently in power used all means to hinder the then left-wing government in imposing fiscal discipline after 2006."
"Debates such as this lead nowhere."
"What is important is that the European Union should finally engage in proactive, rather than reactive politics."
"It would be welcome if the summit this weekend could reach an agreement concerning the European Stability Mechanism."
"The Hungarian presidency, the Hungarian Government, which will take over the rotating presidency of the EU in January, will do its best to speed up the ratification process and to ensure that the European Union can deal with substantive issues, such as making Europe more dynamic."
"(HU) Madam President, honourable Council, honourable Commission, Member States attempt to react to the crisis they find themselves in through individual solutions and their own responses."
"After setting a strategic direction, the Council and the Commission should consolidate and coordinate Member State solutions."
"This means that sanctioning Member States is not enough when it comes to economic governance."
"Of course it would have been good to see the consistency and strictness demonstrated today also exercised by certain Commissioners when they turned a blind eye to the doctoring of data."
"I am convinced that the responsibility for the failure to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact does not lie solely with the Member States, as it was the Commission itself that softened its control mechanisms."
"We must acknowledge that the austerity policy that has been practiced so far has not been successful anywhere."
"Thus, new and clear answers will be required of you."
"Innovative and motivating solutions."
"I can assure you, fellow Members, that the upcoming Hungarian presidency will fulfil this coordinating role."
"Madam President, Ireland has been mentioned many times in this debate."
"I would like to start by making it clear that I support deeper economic governance in a European social market economy."
"We should thank Ireland's partners in Europe for their solidarity at this time of crisis - a crisis created largely by incompetent Conservative governments over many years."
"You will not be surprised that solidarity is being presented by Eurosceptics as a loss of Ireland's independence."
"That distortion is heightened by the failure of the Commission and the Council to engage with this Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding with Ireland."
"When, Mr Rehn, will that Memorandum of Understanding be brought before this Parliament?"
"Commissioner Rehn, one of the meanest conditions and obligations in the Memorandum of Understanding is the obligation to cut the minimum wage in Ireland by EUR 2 000 per year."
"The Irish Government is claiming that you demanded that cut, Mr Rehn."
"Can you clarify that matter for this House?"
"A second incomprehensible aspect of this agreement is the 3% margin which you have demanded..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Madam President, it is not acceptable that essential measures should continue to be put off, measures that disregard the increase in unemployment, poverty, inequality, disparity and economic recession that these austerity plans will cause, while economic and financial groups continue to make ever larger profits."
"This just leads to more questions:"
"Why have the statutes and the guidelines of the European Central Bank not been changed with regard to their loans made directly to Member States at a rate of 1%, the same as for private banks, who then charge rates three, four or five times higher, thus aggravating sovereign debt?"
"Why has it not been decided to apply a tax on movements of capital, and not take the necessary measures to put an end to tax havens and derivative markets, ending speculation on sovereign debt?"
"Why not decide to increase the community budget for a real policy of economic and social cohesion that aims to increase production and create jobs with rights ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"- (SK) Madam President, we are debating a proposed financial stability instrument for the eurozone - an instrument which should help our friends from countries which are currently unable to pay their debts."
"Everyone here is talking about creating a common financial stability mechanism guaranteed by all eurozone countries, and we expect those who have managed to keep their debts under control to show solidarity with those who have not yet managed to do that."
"After experiencing the solutions to date for assisting Greece and the one-off protective bulwark erected last time, I wonder what would happen if the financial wizards from the markets picked up their calculators and began working out the actual worth of the solution and discovered that not even this was reliable enough to make them willing to risk investing their money in the area?"
"I wonder if we have any subsequent solutions and subsequent steps prepared?"
"The credibility of the solution at this point in time, according to this scenario, is very low."
"Madam President, most ordinary people see crises as tragedies."
"Eurocrats see them as opportunities to extend their tentacles of power."
"The European Council is to decide on a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, backed up of course by treaty amendments."
"We are reliably informed that these controls, and of course these treaty changes, will apply to non-eurozone countries too."
"The coalition government in the United Kingdom has promised a referendum in the event of any further transfer of power to the European Union."
"However, this promise will be as reliable and as honestly followed as the Conservative pledge to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For Conservatives, promises are tactics, not obligations."
"(PL) Madam President, the end of the year is approaching."
"It would be a good idea to take a closer look at what we have done."
"Let us look at what we have decided and what we have said, and let us answer this question: what have we done about it?"
"Each of us should look carefully at our own decisions in areas where we have had responsibility."
"It is good that we want to add to the Treaty certain provisions which will impose discipline on what we do."
"However, we do still have, after all, the Stability and Growth Pact, which continues to be in force."
"Why did we not adhere to its provisions?"
"Why did the Commission and its services not react earlier in the case of Greece or Ireland?"
"The European Union is a democratic institution which comprises many Member States."
"It is not, therefore, able to act unilaterally in the way that individual states do - I am thinking, here, for example, of China, the United States and other countries."
"This is why there was a lack of decisive action to protect the euro."
"Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new approach to economic governance, to create a true economic union, to improve coordination and to harmonise financial and even fiscal policy."
"(RO) Madam President, as has also been mentioned by previous speakers, the European Union has obviously not made sufficient progress up to now in terms of ensuring the financial stability of its markets."
"Against a background where speculators are jeopardising the stability of the single currency on a daily basis by isolating and exerting pressure on Member States, the solution can only be achieved by maintaining solidarity at EU level."
"Indeed, creating a permanent mechanism for safeguarding the euro area's financial stability has become a necessity and will have to be coordinated using the Community method."
"Citizens' interests are best protected when EU institutions are fully involved in the decision-making process and the general good takes precedence over the interests....."
"At the same time, we must bear in mind that it is vital for all 27 Member States to be involved in this future mechanism as part of the single market."
"The instability of other currencies will always have a considerable impact on the position of the euro."
"- (PT) Madam President, the next Council meeting is, in fact, very important."
"Important in its response to a crisis that is extensive and international, important also in its response to a specific crisis of governments that have not done their homework on time, that have spent too much and that did not carry out the necessary structural reforms."
"This is why I have come here to support the need for a stable instrument to defend the euro."
"The response cannot and should not be on a case by case basis."
"For this very reason I support this being done according to the community method, not according to the intergovernmental method, ultimately rewarding governments for not having done what they should have done in time."
"I emphasise the need for a growing role for the European Parliament in the discussion of these matters, with debates like the one we have had here today: spirited, with differences, but defending a stronger European Union and an ever-improved euro."
"- (LT) Madam President, in truth, I agree with all of the ideas mentioned today on establishing a crisis mechanism and on additional measures that I believe both the European Council and Parliament will debate in the future."
"Today we heard many conflicting assessments and perhaps also some accusations over previous mistakes."
"These came from all sides."
"They came from the Member States, the European Commission and the Council, as well as commercial banks whose activities I believe will also be closely scrutinised in the future."
"I would like to talk about another matter."
"I liked the idea expressed by President Barroso that in this difficult situation we must work together in unison, shoulder to shoulder, and, Commissioner, I would really like to ask you to make every effort to ensure that all countries can participate in this newly established crisis mechanism, regardless of whether or not they are in the euro area."
"As we opened our markets when we joined the European Union we pay the same amount of money into the budget and many other things besides."
"(PT) Madam President, there is no stability mechanism that addresses the greatest causes of instability within the European Union."
"The policies that brought us to this crisis are the same ones that they now want to continue with and develop. An Economic and Monetary Union brought about in the interests of some and to the detriment of others, loosening the reins of financial speculation, with priority given to the free, that is to say the unfettered, movement of capital, the imposition of the market on all areas of society, the devaluation of work as a source of the creation of wealth, and by the same token, of rights."
"At the start of the second decade of the 21st century, this European Union is not shaking off its association with the greatest social decline that Europe has endured in recent decades, the result of an unparalleled attack on people's rights and living conditions."
"Economic and financial groups continue to accumulate enormous profits, unemployment continues to spread, and millions of workers are becoming poorer as they work."
"This is the message that is echoing in the protests across Europe, and it is time to listen to it."
"- (DE) Madam President, the citizens' confidence in Europe and in the euro has been seriously damaged by the financial crisis and the political manoeuvring."
"The citizens of Europe need easily understandable, clear prospects, which can be relied on in the long term, for the security of their currency."
"The Stability and Growth Pact defines the upper limits for deficits and overall debt."
"However, it is relatively ineffective."
"New rescue packages will only gain the necessary broad acceptance among citizens if they also offer effective controls and sanctions."
"In the case of the controls, Eurostat must be further reinforced and the sanction mechanisms must be easily implemented and effective."
"The existing system includes sanction options."
"Future rescue packages must involve continuous controls, a rapid and coordinated approach and effective sanctions."
"- (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, you are going to propose the creation of this permanent mechanism, under Article 136."
"I regret that you have not used Article 122 which would have allowed us to include all Member States, but we are initiating a political debate insofar as Parliament will be consulted pursuant to Article 48 on the simplified review procedures and I should like to put on the table two political issues."
"Firstly, the euro area is not enough in itself."
"As a minimum, Commissioner, we should include all those States which are obliged, without delay, to have the euro as their currency, and this represents 25 Member States."
"The second issue relates to parliamentary political control."
"This is not an emergency mechanism, it is a permanent one."
"Therefore there should logically be some parliamentary political control under appropriate conditions, ones that you should propose to us because it is the role of parliaments, especially the European Parliament, to exercise control over the executive with regard to this provision."
"(PT) Madam President, making accusations does not solve our problems, and reveals, in some cases, a lack of knowledge of the various situations."
"We need measures to halt speculation on sovereign debt."
"A lot is spoken about the Portuguese situation, but a report this month by the International Monetary Fund concluded that Portugal has been one of the countries putting the most reforms in place to ensure the sustainability of the public finances and social security."
"Before the crisis, in 2007, Portugal had economic growth of 2.4% of GDP and a deficit of 2.6%."
"Between 2005 and 2010, Portugal was one of the countries that most increased its exports; what we need is more unity, more responsibility and more solidarity so that the markets calm down."
"(PL) Madam President, we are concentrating on the euro area, but 150 million citizens remain outside this zone, which is one in three citizens of the European Union."
"This is why it is important for us to have a healthy euro and a healthy euro area."
"We want to say this very clearly - less of national governments, more of the Union, more of Parliament."
"In Poland, the opinion of the German Chancellor is much more important than that of Mr Van Rompuy, and the loudly resounding voice of Mr Cameron is more important than the opinion of Mr Barroso."
"What we need, then, is a stabilisation pact, a pact for stable European solidarity."
"Mr Schulz is right in wanting more Europe in our thinking and new tools for our work, such as a tax on financial transactions, eurobonds, supervision of banks and coordinated budgetary discipline of Member States."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable members, let me first thank you for a very substantive and responsible debate on the European response to the current crisis."
"Indeed this latest stage of the financial crisis is proving increasingly systemic in nature, which calls for an equally systemic response from the European Union."
"Therefore Europe's policy response must be comprehensive, consistent and determined."
"It will necessarily have to combine broader measures applying to the entire European Union with specific measures taken by the Member States."
"What should be done?"
"In the Commission's view we have five avenues of action."
"Firstly, we need a determined, collective effort to deliver on the agreed budgetary commitments."
"Every Member State should stick to its fiscal targets."
"The best defence against contagion is the ring-fencing of our budgetary positions."
"For instance, Spain and Portugal are taking very convincing decisions to this effect now."
"Secondly, we need to advance the next round of bank stress tests and do them in an even more comprehensive and rigorous manner than last time by using the new European architecture of financial regulation and supervision which will enter into force as of January next year."
"Thirdly, we need effective financial backstops, and that is why in May the Union created the European Financial Stability Mechanism and facility for a temporary three-year lifespan."
"Soon the permanent European stabilisation mechanism will be set up, to take effect as of mid-2013."
"To go further and deeper, several initiatives on eurobonds have been floated recently."
"As a concept, the Eurobond is a broad church that covers a wide range of possible applications."
"The current focus of policy-making is, rightly and reasonably, on making the existing European Financial Stability Facility more effective and agile, to help us in the immediate response to the current stage of the crisis."
"But certainly we have to continue analytical discussions on such rational alternatives that can help Europe to overcome the systemic crisis by improving the functioning of the bond markets, by facilitating fiscal consolidation through more reasonable borrowing costs, by providing a basis for enhanced budgetary coordination among Member States and by reinforcing the incentives for fiscal prudence in the Member States."
"The fourth element of the comprehensive response has to be structural measures, as outlined in the strategy for Europe 2020."
"These are indeed necessary for increasing our potential growth and for creating sustainable employment."
"We must make the most of our single market, especially in services and energy, make the tax and benefits systems more conducive to employment growth, make more focused investment in knowledge and innovation and simplify our regulatory environment."
"Fifthly, an essential element of our systemic response, which is very much in your hands, honourable Members, is the rapid and ambitious adoption of the legislative package on reinforced economic governance which the Commission proposed in September."
"I am glad that Parliament and the Council have agreed to finalise this package by next summer."
"This is a matter of the credibility of the economic and monetary union of the European Union as a whole."
"It is also a most effective crisis prevention mechanism, as it reinforces long and short-term confidence in the European economy, as well as confidence in the immediate future."
"Moreover, in response to Mr Karas, it is also an essential stepping stone for completing the Economic and Monetary Union by finally complementing the strong monetary union with a true and functional economic union."
"It is indeed high time for the 'E' in the EMU to be infused with life through the creation of a real and effective economic union as the final step in European economic policy integration."
"Commissioner. - (FI) Madam President, I would still like to make a couple of comments in Finnish because of the speech by Mr Soini."
"Perhaps he has now managed to get back here, as he left this meeting a short while ago."
"We have been able to, and should, approach Mr Soini's speeches with a sense of humour, but, as in recent times he has gained a certain amount of support, they obviously need to start to be taken seriously."
"First of all, I do not believe that belittling the Greeks in the manner that Mr Soini did is very useful, or even professionally appropriate."
"Greece is at present introducing important, actually epochmaking reforms, which deserve our respect and not our contempt."
"I think that Mr Soini should recall the old Finnish saying that teaches us to be aware of our own situation, while respecting others."
"That is a far better way to build a peaceful Europe based on cooperation."
"Secondly, I do not think it professional either to compare the European Union with the Soviet Union, as Mr Soini did."
"Someone with no sense of humour might even think it was insulting."
"Freedom, democracy and the rule of law were not the Soviet Union's trademarks, but they are the basic values of the European Union, which the Finns have defended throughout history, Mr Soini."
"The powers of comprehension on the part of the Finns should not be underestimated either, not even those of the supporters of the True Finns Party."
"The people certainly know that the EU is not the Soviet Union."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Madam President, I assume that you agree with me that it is very rude of some Members to ask questions and then to leave."
"I would like to apologise to Mr Rehn, because it really is outrageous for him to give detailed answers after some of the Members have already disappeared."
"I believe that we should work together to ensure that this no longer happens in future or at least not as often."
"Mr Swoboda, I fully support what you have said."
"It is very rude and lacking in respect."
"Mr De Rossa, a point of order?"
"Madam President, on the other hand, Commissioner Rehn has not answered the questions that I put and I am still here."
"- That only touched on a point of order."
"Mr Rehn, you do not have to respond to this."
"You can, of course, but this is not question time with the Commission."
"The next speaker is Mr Chastel on behalf of the Council."
"Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I personally find that the Commission has contributed a great number of responses to this extremely instructive debate, all the more so given that Parliament is closely involved in the response to this crisis."
"In addition to the Commission, I should like to address two issues relating to what is at stake tomorrow and the day after during this summit."
"Firstly, I would like to make a point about economic governance and the involvement of the European Parliament."
"As you know, the Presidency has already made contact with the European Parliament, with those responsible for the matter of economic governance within this Parliament."
"Furthermore, the Presidency wishes to achieve the best possible collaboration with this Parliament, especially through informal consultation, before the formal stage of negotiations begins."
"In light of the importance of this issue and potential repercussions on the markets, the Presidency, as has been said, has made a commitment to fast-track it, in line with the European Council's wishes."
"Furthermore, in order to expedite the work, the Presidency has set up a working group to deal with this issue alone."
"This group started its deliberations at the end of November, following on from the attention paid to the issue by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The second element on which our Heads of State or Government will focus tomorrow and the day after, is the future permanent crisis management mechanism."
"I do understand a number of questions about this mechanism, on the extent of the response to be made to the crisis."
"Yesterday at midday, in the company of President Van Rompuy, in the General Affairs Council, many of us still had unanswered questions."
"I can testify to you how much the Member States want to respond to this crisis, how aware they are that what is at stake today are the overall European market and the euro, and that it is not simply a question of one country after another."
"The response must be a comprehensive one and we must do all we can to reduce the uncertainties hanging over this market."
"However, in my mind, we must also avoid arousing or creating expectations that cannot be satisfied at this time."
"Therefore, everyone contributed their own new idea about how we should respond to the crisis."
"When we know that we have to get agreement from a number of Member States for any new idea, this does not appear today to be the best possible solution."
"I must tell you that what will be important tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, Friday, at the conclusion of this European Council, is firstly that we can give a clear signal to the markets about the will of the Member States to respond to the financial crisis, to the euro crisis today; secondly, to affirm our will to set up a simple mechanism for amending treaties."
"You know precisely why this must be a simple mechanism on account of the ratifications which must take place in the different Member States; and, finally, to set up this future permanent crisis management mechanism which must also be transparent because it must be unassailable, especially before the Court of Karlsruhe."
"I have received one motion for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 16 December 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"At the forthcoming European Council summit, decisions will probably be made concerning the form of the permanent anti-crisis mechanism which is to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area after 2013, and the process of making changes to the founding treaties will begin."
"While I understand the need for exceptional measures which has been brought about by the economic crisis, I do, however, have concerns over the speed of the changes and the way in which some Member States are trying to impose certain solutions on others."
"Some of the ideas - such as eurobonds, for example - are being rejected without careful consideration."
"I think that in spite of the exceptional situation, decisions which are important for the European Union should be made calmly and with respect for the principle of solidarity and the equal rights of all Member States."
"I would also like to endorse the position of the Polish Government on the changes to the way in which the level of public debt is calculated."
"Poland and 10 other EU Member States have undertaken reforms of their pension systems, and these reforms are currently generating significant costs for national budgets."
"In Poland's case, the introduction of reforms was made necessary by the growing inefficiency of the old system, which was a source of ever greater costs."
"The current debt is not, therefore, indicative of a lack of prudence, but is the effect of changes whose long-term objective is the reduction of budgetary expenses allocated to making pension payments."
"I hope the Member States' representatives will agree to the changes suggested by Poland. Thank you for your attention."
"in writing. - The establishment of a permanent crisis mechanism for the EU to strengthen financial stability is a step in the right direction."
"Together with stronger and more coordinated economic governance, the permanent crisis mechanism could, and would, guarantee the stability of the euro area."
"The specific situation in the new Member States should also be kept in mind while establishing this mechanism."
"These countries should be actively involved in the debate and given the possibility to participate in the mechanism if they are willing to do so."
"At the same time, Member States should keep their national tax policies."
"It is important to keep tax competition as a tool to facilitate cohesion and boost EU economic growth."
"Shifting policies towards tax harmonisation or a common consolidated tax base will only further aggravate the gaps in economic development and hamper cohesion."
"Member States that create a greater risk by their deficits and debt burden should contribute more to the assets of the crisis mechanism."
"This would definitely encourage strict fiscal discipline and enhance the added value of having a proper economic and fiscal policy."
"While events of recent months demanded that governments take emergency measures and decisions that could be applied directly, the establishment of a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area must be founded on unquestionable legal bases."
"Consequently, it is evident that the European Parliament must intervene as colegislator to implement the fundamental reforms that have become necessary to stabilise the economic and monetary union."
"A purely intergovernmental solution cannot be the right answer."
"The reform of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a crucial task and one with considerable implications."
"We are all aware of the value of the single currency to the European project."
"However, the current fragility of the EMU requires courageous and innovative solutions."
"In a context such as this, recourse to 'eurobonds' is a course of action which deserves to be explored and debated and not be treated as a no-go area."
"Nonetheless, at the present time there are many obstacles."
"We must be aware of the significance, on an institutional, legal and financial level, of the introduction of such an instrument, which changes the nature of the European Union."
"Counter to what some of its advocates believe, it would mean even greater discipline and rigour."
"in writing. - (DE) I would like to draw the attention of the Council to a problem which is threatening to paralyse the cooperation between the two institutions on the subject of fisheries policy."
"This is about the regulations for long-term management plans."
"These regulations lie at the heart of the common fisheries policy."
"The Council and a majority of the Member States do not accept that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Parliament the right of codecision on these regulations."
"The ministers are acting in opposition to the Council and the Council's legal service, in opposition to the opinion of the Commission and in opposition, of course, to the will of the European Parliament."
"The Council currently has two management plans which cannot be adopted."
"The Commission cannot submit further plans, which are urgently needed in the interests of our fishermen and our seas and which have long since been completed and are lying in a drawer."
"This situation is unacceptable."
"I am calling on the Belgian Presidency and the future Hungarian Presidency to start negotiations with Parliament immediately, so that we can find a solution."
"We are ready to begin discussions. Thank you very much."
"in writing. - Let us remind ourselves that the eurozone crisis is mainly a sovereign debt crisis which has been exacerbated by two significant events."
"One is the bail-out of private financial institutions, whereby private debts were taken over by sovereign debt, and the other is the stimulus packages used by governments to slow down the economic decline."
"We ignore these two events and treat all countries as if they were a reckless happy-go-lucky group lazing in the Mediterranean sun."
"Any mechanism we put in place to deal with crisis prevention and recovery should bear in mind that, in normal times, countries were duly following plans to reduce their deficits and subsequently their debts."
"Errant countries were the exception and not the rule."
"By all means, let us increase the surveillance mechanism and put some reasonable sanctions in place, but we should not lose sight of what we want to achieve in the medium term: growth and employment."
"These goals are not achieved by sanctions and imposed austerity measures."
"They come about when we understand how imbalances are created and reduced, and we work together to achieve these goals."
"This is what the citizens of the EU expect from us."
"in writing. - (RO) The European Council meeting due to take place on 16-17 December will debate and adopt the measures required to reinforce the economic pillar of the Economic and Monetary Union and consolidate the EU's financial stability."
"In this context, we must also examine the measures required to ensure that the European banking system can finance the European economy, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Europe's citizens expect more robust measures from the EU institutions aimed at not only bringing financial stability but also, in particular, at returning to sustainable economic growth."
"In 2008, 116 million European citizens were exposed to the risk of poverty and social exclusion."
"This number rose due to the economic and financial crisis, with young people and the elderly being the groups most exposed to the risk of poverty and social exclusion."
"European citizens' main concern is still about keeping their jobs and ensuring a decent living."
"The economic and financial crisis has had a major impact on national budgets and caused a decline in education, healthcare and social protection systems It is time for the EU to adopt the measures required to ensure sustainable economic growth through investment in an industrial policy which creates jobs and guarantees competitiveness, as well as through adequate investment in research, education and health."
"Citizens' initiative (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Zita Gurmai and Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the citizens' initiative - C7-0089/2010 -."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, the European citizens' initiative is a unique opportunity."
"It is the first time that European citizens can get together and let us know, with one strong voice, if they think that we, the European decision-makers, are not doing our job properly or missing out important issues."
"We badly need this."
"In a time when only 42% of the people who are entitled to vote in European elections take the time to actually vote, every new European instrument - especially an instrument like the ECI - is of great importance."
"However, we realise that the high expectations that surround the ECI may lead to disappointment and frustration."
"We can avoid this with a regulation that provides for its safe and efficient use, and we can help to bridge the famous gap between ourselves and European citizens."
"I would like to welcome the citizens here as well."
"Mr Lamassoure, Ms Wallis, Mr Häfner and I were all conscious of the huge responsibility on our shoulders."
"Many points were raised during the discussions and we had to base our work on everyone's strong sense of compromise."
"We were lucky to have good partners in this who showed reasonable flexibility and had the same goal as Parliament's rapporteurs, namely to reach an agreement as soon as possible, while maintaining the quality of our work and making sure that one year after the Treaty of Lisbon we have a regulation for the most citizen-based provision of the Treaty."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Šefčovič and the Belgian Presidency, particularly Mr Chastel, and their teams."
"We should also not forget the Spanish Presidency who contributed to advancing the dossier right at the beginning of the process."
"Today we are presenting to you a compromise text which is supported by the Commission and has also been adopted by the Coreper."
"If we decide to support it and the Council adopts it - which we hope - the regulation can enter into force on 1 January and be applicable 12 months later in 2012."
"We are pleased to say that Parliament's key demands were accepted in the discussions."
"The admissibility check on an initiative will be based on clear criteria at the point of registration, not after many signatures have already been collected."
"To ensure the initiatives are well founded and have a European dimension, a citizens' committee of at least seven members from seven Member States should be set up to register an initiative."
"Apart from reducing the risk of unserious initiatives, the citizens' committee offers incontestable advantages for organisers as well."
"If the initiators of an ECI are disorganised at the beginning of the process, they have a network and have many language versions of their initiative."
"They would have significantly less difficulty in collecting one million signatures."
"It is clear that, even though the requirement for the citizens' committee initially seems to be a constraint, it would in reality streamline the rest of the procedure."
"The Commission will help organisers of an initiative by providing a user-friendly guide and setting up a point of contact."
"If an initiative manages to collect one million signatures, a proper follow-up will be guaranteed, including a public hearing at Parliament."
"The review of the regulation is of crucial importance as this tool is the first of its kind."
"As per our suggestions, it is extremely useful with regard to the difficult issue of how to verify the signatures."
"It is up to Member States to do this, but we urged them to demand as little personal information as possible."
"Member States will have some flexibility in choosing what information is required in each country, but I am glad to say that many of them are going for less data than originally planned."
"We believe that the regulation reflected in the compromise text is citizen-friendly and does not create cumbersome obligations for, and frustration amongst, the organisers."
"Madam President, today the European Union is opening up to participatory democracy."
"It is not yet direct democracy, citizens will not take the decisions themselves, but they do win the right to question directly, publicly, in huge numbers, those who take the decisions in Europe, over the head of their government and their elected representatives."
"From now on, the citizens will enjoy the same power of political initiative as that enjoyed here by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament."
"We have benefited, as Mrs Gurmai has said, from the excellent preparatory work carried out by Commissioner Šefčovič and his teams, and from the intelligent and efficient support by the Belgian Presidency."
"On the part of Parliament, the text is the result of the work of four rapporteurs, a gang of four, including you, Madam President."
"We are honoured by your presence."
"We wanted to come up with the simplest, most citizen-friendly procedure for the public."
"Who might participate?"
"Citizens, that is to say natural persons, all citizens, including, possibly, elected representatives, but only European citizens."
"The Treaty leaves no doubt on the subject."
"The right to participate in the citizens' initiative is now yet one more of the privileges enjoyed by citizens throughout Europe."
"Who might launch the initiative?"
"It only needs seven citizens in an organising committee, not 300 000 as the Commission proposed, nor 100 000 as the Council envisaged, seven citizens from seven different countries, that is a quarter of the Member States."
"Who should be contacted for information if one wants to launch an initiative?"
"The Commission itself will publish a guide to the citizens' initiative and will set up a specialised point of contact."
"What is the procedure?"
"Extraordinarily simple."
"A single request to register the initiative and check its admissibility."
"The criteria for admissibility?"
"The Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"What support can be used for an initiative?"
"Any kind of support: political, financial, local, national, European, international, lobbies, NGOs, churches, and so on."
"Just one condition: total transparency."
"Those who are invited to sign must know what lies behind the initiative."
"So it is up to the citizens to assume their responsibilities."
"What are the formalities for collecting the signatures?"
"Incredibly simple."
"Signatures on paper but also through the Internet."
"Of course, it is only the Member States that can monitor them, but we have been careful, as Mrs Gurmai has said, to ensure that the forms are harmonised to the greatest possible extent."
"In the long term, it is a veritable single European system which will have to be adopted in all 27 countries and a third of Member States are already prepared for it."
"Finally, what will the political outcomes be?"
"This is a point on which Parliament has been very insistent."
"Indeed, in accordance with the Treaty, the Commission will be the only judge of whether or not to provide legislative follow-up to a successful initiative."
"Therefore the Commission must be protected against political pressure seeking to make legislation proliferate at a time when the Union already regulates too much."
"However, at the same time, the citizens must be protected against the risk that there is no political follow-up in cases where the Commission deems supplementary legislation inappropriate."
"Hence the creation of two new rights to benefit authors of successful initiatives: the right to be received by the Commission to present their motion and the right to a public hearing, which can take place before the European Parliament itself."
"In short, here we have a simple, innovative, democratic procedure."
"It is now the citizens' turn to take the floor."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - (DE) Madam President, like all policy, European policy must not exclude the citizens, go over their heads or take place behind their backs."
"European policy must be made by the citizens, for the citizens and through the citizens."
"We want to close the divide between the citizens and policy and between the citizens and the institutions."
"To achieve this, we need procedures which allow citizens to become involved in decision-making and to express their opinions."
"We have succeeding in creating more democracy within the European Union, but we have not done enough to enable citizens to participate more effectively in decisions and in European debates."
"Today's decision on the introduction of the European citizens' initiative will bring this about."
"We have held tough negotiations and we have achieved many substantial improvements."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the document which we are voting on today, you will see that wherever there is bold text, and Mr Lamassoure has also just referred to this, this is the text that we have proposed which replaces the results of the negotiations, the original draft from the Commission."
"You will notice that we have rewritten around two thirds of the text and introduced significant improvements to the document which the Commission enthusiastically submitted to us."
"I will only mention the most important points."
"We have significantly lowered the barriers."
"In particular, signatures will only need to be collected in at least a quarter of the Member States and not one third."
"Of course, we would prefer signatures to be collected all over Europe, but we are talking here about minimum levels."
"Most importantly, we have succeeded in almost completely removing the barrier which, right from the beginning, threatened to be extremely unsuccessful and which required an admissibility check to take place after 300 000 signatures, before the citizens could continue collecting more signatures."
"'Almost completely' means that we have proposed the idea of involving a committee of initiators at the start which will ensure that not every mail which the Commission receives and which has the words citizens' initiative on its subject line will undergo the full administrative procedure."
"The initiatives must be reasonably serious."
"In other words, anyone who wants to collect one million signatures must first involve at least seven countries in his proposal."
"We have introduced greater transparency and mandatory hearings at the end of the process."
"These hearings will take place in the European Parliament in the presence of Parliament and the Commission."
"They will give citizens the opportunity to explain their concerns."
"This represents a major step forward."
"We have fought for this not on our own behalf, but - and we must never forget this - on behalf of the citizens of Europe, their rights and a more effective and simpler process for citizens to become involved in Europe."
"There are some things which we have not achieved and many of these are now in the amendments tabled by those on the left."
"In any case, the negotiations have now been completed."
"We have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission."
"We have had to give in on some points, but the other side has also made huge concessions and we know that the amendments are more about appearance and less about substance."
"This means that there will be no opportunity to change the results."
"However, we will be able to do this during the review in three years' time."
"I would like to thank everyone involved, including the employees, the secretariats, the co-rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council, for working together so effectively."
"I believe that this type of cooperation across committee and group boundaries could be a model for the future."
"Overall I would like to see a Europe for citizens in which citizens regard themselves as part of Europe and become more actively involved than they have in the past."
"I would just like to say that it was a huge privilege for me to be involved in Parliament's team in what I regard as a hugely impressive piece of work on behalf of Europe's citizens."
"Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, rapporteurs especially, one of the most important promises of the Treaty of Lisbon was to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"I do not believe that I need to list here the examples which have shown us, before and after the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon in December 2009, the extent to which a rapprochement of this nature is necessary."
"Therefore it is not surprising that any measure that furthers the objective of interesting and involving citizens in European integration is a priority for all the institutions including the Council."
"I am therefore particularly keen to be able to address you about the regulation that implements the citizens' initiative, this flagship innovation of the Treaty of Lisbon as regards improved citizen participation in decisions at European level."
"This regulation was, of course, one of the priorities of the Belgian Presidency of the Council as it may be that this citizens' initiative is the most fitting symbol for the new post-Lisbon role of the citizen in the Union."
"Through a citizens' initiative, as the rapporteurs have already said, a million European citizens will be able to submit to the Commission a legislative proposal with the obligation incumbent on the Commission to examine it and express its opinion on it."
"We should stop for a moment to appreciate this innovation that we are implementing today which is only the first element, as Mr Lamassoure has said, of participatory democracy at supranational level."
"Therefore it is not only a first at European level, it is quite simply a first at world level."
"Lets us return to the legislative issue we are debating today."
"I am delighted with the compromise reached on this regulation in the course of the negotiations between the three institutions and, obviously, I too welcome the spirit of cooperation and the will for compromise that prevailed in the three institutions throughout the entire negotiations."
"I would, of course, like to thank personally the rapporteurs for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Petitions (PETI), Mrs Gurmai of course, Mr Lamassoure, Mrs Wallis and Mr Häfner for their efforts and constructive contributions to drafting this regulation."
"I am therefore particularly delighted with the vote on Monday in the AFCO Committee, which confirmed the text approved by the institutions."
"If the up-coming vote confirms the same text ratified by the AFCO Committee, we shall be able to consider this agreement at first reading as a model of fast and efficient legislation at European level."
"How could we fail, in this respect, to extend our praise also to Commissioner Šefčovič for his availability and pro-activeness."
"In short, I feel that, on this matter, we have all benefited from the many opinions expressed at the negotiation table."
"The European citizen has emerged the winner from this trialogue and from this agreement."
"I am convinced that the compromise reached between the institutions is a good one, not only insofar as each institution has managed to win what was dear to it, as we just recalled, but also insofar as it will result in a good regulation which will allow citizens' initiatives to be organised flexibly and efficiently."
"On behalf of the Council, I welcome the will of the other two institutions to take account of the needs and the constraints hanging over the Member States in accomplishing the task that has fallen to them, that of checking the signatures which must obviously be genuine signatures, and ensuring that there is no fraud or manipulation when they are collected."
"Furthermore, Member States had to be given enough time to adopt those measures of national law necessary for the regulation to be applied."
"I obviously understand Parliament's concern to see the citizens' initiative implemented as soon as possible and it is one that I share."
"On the other hand, it is clear that there must be national measures if this initiative is to develop along the right lines and therefore enough time must be left for them to be adopted according to the existing regulatory framework."
"Indeed, the Council has always considered that the citizens' initiative, as an element of citizen participation in European decisions, should go hand-in-hand with the other element, that is, the election of the European Parliament."
"Finally, to sum up, I am delighted with the compromise reached in the negotiations and I obviously cannot but recommend that you adopt it at today's vote and I wish the citizens' initiative all the success that it is predicted to have."
"I note that the first initiatives are already under preparation and I hope that a great number of initiatives will give fresh impetus and new ideas to European integration."
"I would just like to say another big thank you to everyone for your collaboration on this issue."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you so much for your leadership during the presidency to get this through."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I am also very happy to be here with you this morning because we have accomplished very good things together."
"Just one year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are holding a discussion on the forthcoming adoption of the regulation on the citizens' initiative."
"As Mr Lamassoure said, we are introducing a totally new layer of participatory democracy which will complement the representative democracy in which we operate in the European Union."
"But for the first time we are offering citizens an innovative way of expressing their wishes, interacting with the institutions and shaping the agenda of the European Union."
"I believe it is a very important as a means of widening the European space."
"It is very important in terms of bringing more European topics to the national capitals and creating European-wide debate."
"We all know that the European Union needs this very much."
"To achieve the potential benefits the Treaty of Lisbon and the citizens' initiative can bring us, we need to establish a clear procedure."
"It was very clear, from the public consultations and the consultations with the European Parliament, that we needed a procedure which would be easy, understandable, user-friendly and well-balanced."
"I think we have achieved this goal."
"That was really thanks to the in-depth discussions we had, very often here in the European Parliament."
"I would like to thank all of you for organising a number of hearings, not only in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Petitions (PETI) but also in most of the political groups, because these hearings have been very important for all of us."
"I can assure you that they served as a very important source of inspiration and new creative ideas which, in the end, helped us improve the initial Commission proposal."
"I appreciate also the innovative way in which the European Parliament dealt with this initiative."
"We had four rapporteurs from two different committees."
"Alain Lamassoure called them the gang of four."
"I must say it was a very nice gang."
"It was a pleasure working with all of you."
"It was a pleasure for me to receive your new creative input into our common thinking, because each of you approached the subject from a different angle and brought your own experience to bear on how to improve the initial proposal of the Commission."
"I really appreciate it."
"Thanks to this new innovative approach we achieved broad consensus within the European Parliament."
"I am particularly pleased about the very clear vote in AFCO."
"One of the important ideas which came from the rapporteurs was what kind of follow-up we should give to the citizens' initiative."
"I believe the idea that an appropriately high-level Commission representative should receive the organisers of the initiative after its successful completion came from the European Parliament."
"The idea of organising hearings as a compulsory stage during which we could discuss the goals of the initiative more broadly also came from this Chamber."
"I would like to stress that we are very pleased and satisfied that these public hearings will be organised on neutral ground, here at the European Parliament, because this will ensure that the Commission will not be in the uncomfortable position of being judge and jury at the same time."
"The Commission will be represented at those hearings at an appropriately high level, where possible by the Commissioner or Director-General with responsibility for the subject, and will carefully follow the debate."
"I would like to assure you, and through you all European citizens, that we in the Commission are absolutely conscious of the importance and the value of one million citizens supporting a particular proposal."
"We will treat it with respect and great care."
"The only regret I have in this debate is that we will need to wait a little while before the citizens' initiative can be fully used."
"But we have to recognise that, if we want to offer our citizens an improved service, we need to change some internal rules in the Member States and we have to develop the software for the online collection system."
"I am sure we will do it in the prescribed time, however, and European citizens will have a chance to use this initiative as soon as possible."
"I greatly appreciate, therefore, the fact that we are aiming at agreement on the first reading, because this will allow our citizens to use this new instrument much faster than initially expected."
"Let me thank you once again for the excellent cooperation with all the rapporteurs, with Ms Gurmai, with our Chair, Ms Wallis, with Mr Häfner and Mr Lamassoure."
"As I said, all of them brought very new and very important ideas to make this proposal better than the initial proposal from the Commission."
"I would also like to thank personally Olivier Chastel, because he demonstrated his enormous ability for consensus building."
"I know how difficult it was in the Council, how many divergences he had to overcome, and thanks to his efforts and thanks to the excellent work of the Belgian Presidency we now have this wide consensus also in the Council."
"Madam President, I would like to convey my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs for drafting the text on which we are going to vote, today."
"I hope that we will put this mechanism in the hands of the citizens, today, and that it will be further developed by the Commission."
"I do, of course, agree."
"It has been made as simple as possible."
"What we are going to vote on, today, is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I do understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved, on our behalf, a result which is practicable and feasible."
"Personally, I regret to have to give up the provision which gives 16-year-olds the right to sign an initiative, but I will support the text in the negotiated form, because I am certain that there should be no further delay and that the initiative should be handed over to the citizens."
"I am sure we are, in fact, creating this next part of the system, today, in order to act upon something which was said many times in this Chamber by the late Bronisław Geremek - Europe is united, and the time has come for Europeans to be active."
"Today, we are taking a constructive step in this direction."
"We are not writing the Bible, here."
"In three years' time, the procedures being proposed, today, can be looked at and improved, on condition that they are being used, which is something I strongly encourage people to do."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (HU) Madam President, as one of the representatives of the LIBE Committee, I would like to join those congratulating the rapporteurs, and would like to thank the Commission for its work, as well as Mr Šefčovič and Mr Chastel for their work in the Council, as they contributed considerably to the creation of a sound and viable text which truly represents a step towards simplification, and which I believe will gain extensive support."
"There were intense debates, and a multitude of good proposals were tabled."
"The large number of good proposals also meant that they had to be consolidated, to make the final proposal as user-friendly as possible."
"Collecting one million signatures is an enormous achievement and requires an enormous amount of work."
"We would also like to reach out to those who cannot contribute online, but would rather express their opinions on paper."
"We would be pleased if we could receive feedback, and we would be pleased if we could resolve any problems arising in the process as early as possible."
"It is certain that Europe will benefit considerably from this instrument."
"Madam President, prior to the decision to adopt the Treaty of Lisbon, politicians spoke warmly of the opportunity that citizens' initiatives would bring."
"We must now ensure that this becomes a powerful reform for democracy and not a paper tiger."
"I was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and I was pleased to table proposals that would make things easier for citizens. For example, we wanted to get young people involved and therefore proposed an age limit of 16 for raising an initiative."
"An age limit of 18 was decided on, which I may regret, but these are still young people we are talking about."
"We also extended the time frame to 24 months."
"Now it has become 12 months, but I am nevertheless pleased to have a compromise, because I am essentially a positive person."
"On the other hand, we note that a large amount of work will be necessary on the part of those who submit an initiative, but I hope that we will take up the challenge to ensure that citizens' initiatives are received with respect and in a constructive and positive spirit in the institutions of the EU."
"Finally, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their excellent cooperation on this important initiative."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (ES) Madam President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is going to vote enthusiastically in favour of this report, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council on this agreement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the 1980s we coined the phrase 'democratic deficit'."
"By this we meant that in the European Union decisions were taken only by the Council of Ministers, based on Commission proposals, and that Parliament was only consulted."
"Parliament has been battling since the 1980s, through the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, the Constitutional Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, to close that democratic deficit, and I believe that through the Treaty of Lisbon, with Parliament's new powers and the participation of national parliaments, we have achieved that objective."
"We are adding to that achievement today through this citizens' initiative, which in the work of the Convention was due to the sound cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"I would like to recall the following names here today: Jürgen Meyer, our German Social Democrat colleague, and Alain Lamassoure, who were responsible for bringing this initiative to the plenary of the Convention and getting it approved."
"I therefore believe that we have completed the circle, Madam President."
"I believe that today, when we adopt this initiative, we will have signed the death warrant of the idea of a 'democratic deficit'."
"Now it is up to us to act responsibly, ladies and gentlemen, and today we also have the opportunity to do so."
"By adopting the Union budget we will be fulfilling the role that is expected of us: as a responsible Parliament with codecision powers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good day for Europe."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (ES) Madam President, Democracy: The Unfinished Journey is the title of a book by a recognised analyst of the theoretical and practical changes that contemporary democracies are undergoing."
"We are indeed in the middle of an unfinished journey in which many stages have been completed, but we are in a period of risks, uncertainty and many doubts."
"However, among those doubts, we do have a few certainties."
"The first is that the structure that has endured has been representative democracy: our institutions; without free parliaments based on the will of the people, democracy has never survived."
"It is, however, also true that democracy now needs innovation, reforms and changes to improve its quality, while maintaining the structures that have served us so far and the strength of their foundations."
"What type of changes do we need?"
"We need to move towards a style of democracy that expands the participatory forum, so that citizens are more than just voters every four or five years."
"We need a democracy that increases the space for debate, in which citizens discuss, reason and exchange views, and one which increases social capital, in which citizens are no longer isolated and can integrate into the community."
"We also need a European dimension for this style of democracy."
"I think we have achieved that by bringing in legislation for this citizens' initiative."
"There are now no longer two types of legitimacy, rather there are two voices for citizens: one is here in Parliament and the other is in the citizens' initiative."
"This will give us a stronger, more participatory and more legitimate democracy."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, I wish to thank everyone for their cooperation."
"This has been a splendidly straightforward process of cooperation."
"The citizens' initiative is a welcome addition to active citizenship."
"I hope that it will be important for provoking political debate."
"Not all initiatives gain sufficient support, but they can bring new perspectives to the debate."
"Parliament wanted to make the citizens' initiative as userfriendly as possible, and it has mainly succeeded in this."
"I am especially pleased that the Commission and Parliament will have to organise a public hearing when a million signatures have been collected."
"This will compel the EU institutions actually to listen to what the signatories have to propose."
"At the same time, the Commission will have to justify thoroughly to them its possible negative stance."
"I would have been pleased if this citizens' initiative could have been signed not just by these citizens but also by the people who live in each country, but there was not enough support for this."
"The significance of the citizens' initiative will not be seen until it enters into force."
"I hope that it will some day provoke a wider debate on EU affairs than has been the case today."
"Madam President, I am very happy that this dispute, which not long ago seemed to be a never-ending story, has now found a solution."
"Like the foxtrot with our beloved European External Action Service, this has taken too long."
"A slow foxtrot makes your back ache, and your partner may end up disappointed."
"The partner here, however, is none other than our citizens."
"I hope that this new form of democracy succeeds, and that we do not betray our citizens' expectations."
"For me, the saddest thing in the whole debate was that too often we saw distrust towards the citizens, the fear that citizens would come out with brainless ideas."
"This fear is unfounded, as we will indeed see."
"Mr Šefčovič, I would also like the Commission to start to trust its own citizens more."
"As a representative of Estonia, I want to thank the Council too, which has retained the option of a digital signature, because this is essential for my people."
"Europe is eagerly awaiting the creative ideas of its citizens. Thank you."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, the European citizens' initiative (ECI) is a much needed sign of engagement by the EU, and is a great opportunity to increase democratic participation in Europe and to strengthen the links between citizens and politicians."
"Although the obstacle of the obligation to provide passport numbers remains applicable in two-thirds of the Member States, I and other members of the ECR Group have helped make this citizens' initiative more user-friendly by deleting the terribly bureaucratic double admissibility check proposed by the Commission and ensuring that the ECI was made available to popular movements and not just large organised interest groups."
"Now, truly grassroots initiatives stand a change of succeeding, even if they do not follow the spirit of European federalism."
"Most importantly, the Commission will be obliged to indicate the exact reasons for refusal of an ECI, as well as indicating exactly how it intends to follow up on a successful initiative."
"Transparency in this process is key."
"It is about time that the European Union began to properly acknowledge the views of European citizens and listen to the voice of the people."
"I am hopeful that this scheme will engender a greater sense of democracy and of the democratic accountability of the European Commission, and inspire discussion on the future course of the EU."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, it has already become clear this morning during the debate on the forthcoming European Council meeting that we have a problem of legitimacy within the European Union."
"Its roots lie primarily in the fact that policy all too often bypasses the day-to-day interests of the citizens."
"They rightly expect to be more involved in policymaking."
"The protests taking place in numerous EU countries are an eloquent expression of this."
"The introduction of the European citizens' initiative, which we are voting on today, means that for the first time in the history of the EU there will be an instrument that allows the citizens of Europe to express their expectations and requirements directly, to launch initiatives immediately, to follow them up and to participate directly in policymaking."
"The current regulation is good, but my group is of the opinion that it could and should have been even better."
"Whether the citizens and residents of Europe will really use the citizens' initiative will ultimately depend on us here in Parliament."
"How seriously are we taking our self-imposed commitment to support the necessary open approach?"
"Will we be prepared and in a position in three years' time to stand up to the Council and the Commission about the further development of the initiative?"
"The subjects are already laid down in the current regulation and we want to vote on these points again today."
"The value of the citizens' initiative will not be measured in terms of the interinstitutional compromise reached between the Council and the Commission, but in terms of whether it is really used."
"The fact that today's result is significantly better - and I would like to thank specifically Mrs Gurmai, Mrs Wallis, Mr Lamassoure and Mr Häfner for working closely together and making such good progress on refining this regulation - is also due to the many members of civil society who have subjected our considerations and our debates to repeated reality and practicability checks."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank them."
"I am calling on the citizens of Europe to take the initiative."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Madam President, since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force a year ago, an unprecedented amount of power has been transferred to the EU's institutions, and throughout the past year we have seen how the European Parliament in particular has been in a position to exploit this situation - divesting the Member States of an enormous amount of power."
"There were two glimmers of light when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force."
"One of these was the citizens' initiative."
"That is also why - on behalf of both my party in Denmark and my group here in the European Parliament - I entered into the negotiations precisely with a view to getting the citizens' initiative in place, which, in spite of everything, was a tiny glimmer of light in an otherwise very dark and very federal EU."
"There have been areas where we have disagreed."
"Several rapporteurs have already mentioned that someone wants to extend the right to submit a citizens' initiative to people who are not citizens and someone else wants to be able to decide on the voting age in other Member States and so on - something that we have not been able to agree on."
"However, the framework that we have now agreed on nevertheless contains positive elements and therefore, in the spirit of democracy and in order to promote the positive elements that, in spite of everything, are contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, my group will also support this initiative."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens' initiative, as proposed by the treaties and laid down by this regulation, is a parody of democracy."
"Firstly, it leads citizens to believe that their voice can be heard by the Eurocracy, despite the fact that the latter systematically refused to listen to them when they made it clear, by means of referendum, that they did not want the construction of a European super-state."
"Therefore start by listening to the public when they say 'no' or when they tell you to call a halt."
"It is also a parody of democracy in terms of the restrictions on admissibility."
"Citizens' initiatives must be in accordance with the treaties and the so-called principles that underlie them."
"Therefore, in the name of the principles of freedom of movement included in the treaties, there will be a pitiless refusal of any request to protect our economies, a refusal to put any brake on the financialised globalisation whose devastating effects we are now suffering, to reverse in any way migratory flows."
"Any initiative seeking to halt negotiations with Turkey is likely to suffer the same fate, insofar as we can request the Commission to act but cannot request it to stop acting."
"If an initiative receives enough signatures, the Commission is not obliged to put it into effect, merely to justify its decision."
"This is a veritable parody of democracy."
"- (FR) Madam President, firstly I should like to pay tribute to the huge amount of work done by the rapporteurs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are some unprecedented moments in the European Parliament."
"Today is one of them."
"We wanted to provide citizens with a clear, simple and effective instrument in order to bring them closer to the institutions."
"Firstly, we must emphasise the efforts that have been made to simplify the procedure."
"The registration phase is now quick and clear."
"It is our duty to disseminate the criteria that an initiative must meet in order to be registered: respect for the values of the Union, respect for the powers of the Commission, in relation to the application of the treaties."
"Secondly, I would draw your attention to the one-year deadline for the Member States."
"The fact that they are meeting this deadline and guaranteeing data protection will send a strong signal to our citizens."
"Thirdly, I would like to express my satisfaction over the three-month deadline, over the political and legal arguments and the procedure that the Commission must follow for organising public hearings jointly with Parliament."
"Certainly, with these three points, it can be said that an instrument will shortly be in the hands of the European citizen that is simpler than expected, clearer than it appears at first sight and supposedly more effective."
"Finally, I shall remain alert to the possible perverse effects of political parties financing the initiative and this is something for which I still believe that the citizens will perhaps be in a position to reproach us."
"Having said that, I count on all of us to sound the alarm at the first signs of it being used for party political purposes because, first and foremost, that is our commitment and we shall vote for an instrument of participatory democracy that belongs to the citizens alone."
"Madam President, may I start by congratulating you on your contribution as the co-rapporteur of our Committee on Petitions."
"As you may know, the citizens' initiative was a major priority for our S&D Group."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate all four co-rapporteurs from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Petitions on their joint work in delivering this remarkable report, as well as on the way in which they negotiated with the Council and the Commission to achieve such a good result."
"I would also like to mention the very special role played by the Vice-President of the European Commission, Commissioner Šefčovič, and his readiness, openness and commitment to negotiate with both the Council and Parliament."
"I am glad to be voting today only a few months after the beginning of the procedure on this unique and key instrument for participatory democracy in the European Union."
"The European Parliament has contributed a great deal to this text."
"Two-thirds of the text comes from Parliament, showing once again its constant commitment to involving European citizens in the political debate and bringing the European Union closer to them."
"I consider this document to be well-balanced and to contribute to our common goal, which is to give the citizens' initiative an important role in the practice of European democracy and enhance the capacity of European citizens to make an impact on European policies."
"Indeed, this instrument is designed to promote in-depth debate throughout civil society."
"As our group has emphasised from the beginning, this instrument is accessible and simply designed, as well as being clear and detailed in order to avoid creating frustration."
"I would like to thank you very much and to wish you success after this remarkable beginning."
"Madam President, contrary to the assumptions of some speakers, my belief is that the citizens' initiative was always intended to be able to be used by citizens to request the Commission to propose an amendment to the treaties."
"I am very pleased that the final wording of Article 2 of the regulation faithfully repeats the wording of Article 11(4) of the Treaty itself."
"A Commission proposal to change the treaties is certainly the Commission functioning legally within the framework of its powers, and we all know from experience that it is frequently necessary to change the treaties in order that their objectives can be fully achieved."
"So citizens should be bold and fully exploit this great new experiment in post-national democracy."
"(PL) Madam President, as Mrs McClarkin has said, our political group will support this scheme, because it is a good one, and it should be endorsed when the vote is taken."
"I am pleased that during work on the scheme it was possible to eliminate several features which were a cause for concern."
"Amongst other things, protection of personal data has been increased and the minimum age for supporting an initiative has been raised from 16 to 18 years."
"This is a good result."
"However, I do have several critical remarks."
"Firstly, as my colleague Mrs McClarkin has said, it is, in fact, the Commission which is going to decide whether or not an initiative is accepted, and so the voice of the people is still going to be dependent on officials, even if they are acting in good faith."
"Another matter is that it should be considered whether the 300 000 votes needed for an initiative and the one quarter of the Member States which have to be represented is not too low a threshold."
"In Poland, an initiative of this kind requires the signatures of 100 000 people."
"On the much larger scale of the entire European Union - Poles constitute only 8% of the population - I think this is questionable."
"However, in spite of these doubts, the scheme is worth supporting and the European Conservatives and Reformists will certainly endorse it."
"(GA) Madam President, I would first of all like to thank both you and the rapporteurs."
"The work of the rapporteurs represents a significant improvement on the Commission's proposal."
"However, I am disappointed that some aspects of the proposal will lead to people who should be involved being excluded."
"I would ask Parliament to give serious consideration to the amendments adopted by large majorities in the Committee on Petitions and which we have yet again tabled to the plenary - Amendments 71, 72, 73 and 74."
"We should ensure in particular that we do not suggest to people resident in the EU who have not attained citizenship that their views are not necessary or not welcome."
"Similarly, young people should be encouraged to participate in the issues related to EU policies."
"In the current situation, not all EU residents - including long-term residents - will be able to sign the citizens' initiative."
"Participation will only be open to those with EU citizenship."
"The purpose of Amendments 72 and 73, therefore, which we have tabled once more to the plenary, is to ensure that residents' signatures will be included in the 1 million signatures requesting the Commission to take action."
"(NL) Madam President, I am not sure what to make of this citizens' initiative."
"Involving citizens more in decision-making sounds nice enough, although, of course, it would be better to allow the very same citizens to vote on the Treaty of Lisbon in a referendum."
"Calling a treaty that has been rammed down our citizens' throats a dialogue with citizens is, from my point of view, both cynical and ironic."
"Madam President, I fear that the citizens' initiative will merely prove to be a giant piece of window dressing."
"The Commission has carte blanche not to consider proposals."
"Clearly, the hobbyhorses of the left Europhile elite, who evidently represent a pro-European position, will be accepted."
"Or can the Commissioner rid me of these concerns?"
"Suppose we had citizens' initiatives to stop the negotiations with Turkey or to abolish this House - which, of course, would be fantastic."
"Will the Commission then take them seriously?"
"I would like to hear your thoughts on that."
"Madam President, the confidence of citizens in the European Union has already hit rock bottom."
"I suspect that this citizens' initiative will do very little to change that and that does not worry me, actually, because the more people recognise the collapse of the European Union, the better."
"Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs I have been fully committed to helping shape this new right to political initiative for the citizens of Europe with a view to really empowering the people."
"I support the final compromise and congratulate Mr Lamassoure."
"It makes it user-friendly, simple and accessible for citizens."
"I welcome especially the transparency as regards both political and financial support."
"However I regret that financing from political parties and groups is allowed and national politicians are allowed to be initiators."
"I do not want to spoil the party here, colleagues, but let us be realistic."
"There is a risk that the democratic process in Europe could not only be boosted but also derailed, and the citizens' initiative could be exploited, if not hijacked, by extremists and populists."
"I think we all have now to take our shared responsibility and make sure it is really used for the citizens."
"I call upon elected politicians in Member States to respect the fact that they have representative democracy to express their views and this initiative is for citizens."
"I call upon the Commission to properly inform citizens to avoid raising false expectations, and to be tough as regards the admission criteria."
"I call upon the media to play their role in giving correct information, and on Member States to respect personal data so that the people will feel enough trust to participate."
"I really hope that we will be able to give our citizens the chance to be part of this debate and enjoy using this instrument."
"(DE) Madam President, I am not a member of any of the committees that are directly involved, but nevertheless I have given our rapporteur, Mrs Gurmai, my full support and I would like to thank all the rapporteurs."
"I believe that we have taken a significant step forward in the process of democratising the European Union."
"I know that many people are concerned about a possible misuse of the instrument."
"However, it is up to us to take into consideration the worries and the problems of the citizens in our policies and then they will not be able to misuse the citizens' initiative."
"It is up to us to use our policies to oppose the citizens' initiatives, if we believe that they are going in the wrong direction."
"Opposition is certainly more useful than ignoring them."
"In contrast to Mrs Corazza Bildt, I think that a good compromise has been reached."
"I believe that political parties should not use the initiative instrument, because that is what the political parties and Parliament are there for."
"Of course, it is absolutely right that politicians should not be excluded from the debate."
"Therefore, I think that this instrument represents a move in the right direction."
"It is now up to the political parties to implement the right policies under the watchful eye of the citizens and the citizens' initiative, to take up the wishes and concerns of citizens, to bring them into Parliament and to enter into a dialogue with the citizens to a much greater extent."
"This instrument also forces politicians to act more sensibly and to shape Europe in such a way that it really is close to the citizens and not remote from them, which is a criticism rightly made by many people."
"Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work."
"I believe that this is a major step forward for democracy in Europe and ultimately this is what we in Parliament are fighting for: a democratic Europe."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to add my voice to the expressions of support and approval for this scheme."
"On the other hand, the expression of certain doubts and comments does not indicate a lack of support, it just reflects a concern that the scheme will be used in the right way."
"I would like to point out, here, that many of the opportunities, hopes and also fears which are being talked about - Mr Migalski, amongst others, has mentioned this - concern the hope that this tool, which is so much needed and which will do so much to strengthen and extend democracy, will not, in practice, be misused."
"Paradoxically, this tool might easily be misused in practice, and not only by extremists, but also by very strong and powerful interest groups, and I say this because we think a threshold of 1 000 000 statements of support is not a big threshold when compared to the Union's demographic potential."
"If we point out that a decision to accept or reject an initiative is, however, going to be dependent to a great extent on an arbitrary evaluation, this, too, may attract serious criticism from the citizens themselves."
"In summary, I think we should accelerate work on the scheme and make it a priority, but what is also needed is for the scheme to be subjected to a very thorough, prudent and sensible analysis."
"Madam President, I stand here as a democrat and someone who believes that greater participation in the democratic process is to be encouraged."
"Let us be honest, there is a disconnect between policymakers and citizens."
"It is therefore very important that the voice of the ordinary citizen is heard."
"The ECI in theory is a sound concept, yet my enthusiasm is tempered with the fact that the Commission still holds considerable power."
"We also cannot ignore the fact that the mechanics for gathering the signatures for an ECI, even with the requirement for participation reduced to a quarter of the Member States, may mean that it is very difficult for anyone but large lobby organisations which already operate on a pan-European basis to gather these required signatures."
"This truly needs to be a tool of the citizen and not the NGO."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Council, I wanted to say that this citizens' initiative represents a very important step towards the recognition of the constitutional nature of the European Union."
"Only a constitutional entity, whether or not it has a written constitution, is in a position to provide its citizens with an instrument that has this capacity, and I recognise in our action something of great value: the value of providing the European Union with this constitutional nature."
"I also wanted to say that this is a very important step for citizens and for solidarity between citizens."
"By having one quarter of the countries as a minimum condition for launching an initiative, we are also creating a trans-European and pan-European movement, because it is much more difficult to be taken over by lobbies or by partisan interests."
"Contrary to what is being said here, it is much more difficult when we require the citizens of seven or eight countries to sign up to this initiative, and I am therefore convinced that it will also be a way of strengthening solidarity between European States, solidarity between the citizens of European States, solidarity that at this point in time, two days from this December's European Council meeting which will be so decisive, solidarity which we need now more than ever."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is the stuff of democracy and therefore the implementation of the citizens' initiative was not merely a technical exercise but imposed crucial choices that made it possible to turn the citizens' initiative into an instrument effectively capable of helping to build a genuine European political space."
"Parliament undoubtedly exercised its prerogatives in an exemplary manner, significantly improving the original proposal."
"The main results have already mentioned and I do not need to remind you of them."
"I would, however, like to emphasise another one, to which our group made a significant contribution: European political parties will also be able to promote a citizens' initiative."
"This is an outcome of great significance because the fate of European democracy lies at its heart, since there can be no genuine international democracy until European political parties take on an effective role in the democratic process."
"Today we are taking a step forward in this direction and this is another reason why it is a great day for European democracy."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for the timeliness of the work carried out and the good compromise achieved."
"As Chair of the Committee on Petitions, please allow me to offer my particular thanks to Mrs Wallis and Mr Häfner in addition to the shadow rapporteurs who - making up a sizeable team - were able to correctly channel all the feelings that emerged in the debate conducted within the Committee on Petitions."
"I think we worked in full awareness of the importance of the task we were carrying out."
"Indeed, the citizens' initiative is a significant goal in the process of building a Europe of the people, a democratic Europe and a truly participative Europe."
"We in the Committee on Petitions worked with this in mind, cooperating with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, applying the procedure laid down in Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure."
"As many fellow Members and the rapporteurs have emphasised, we aimed to make the procedure as usable, burden-free, transparent and effective as possible."
"We worked with this in mind to impose obligations on the Commission and to limit its scope for evaluation regarding the criteria of admissibility that we have introduced."
"I should like to reassure the fellow Members who raised legitimate and understandable concerns, which we covered during the debate and to many of which we sought to provide responses."
"Lastly, because this topic is close to my heart, I should like to emphasise the importance of introducing a public hearing for representatives of a citizens' initiative, which will be organised by the Commission together with the European Parliament."
"As Chair of the Committee on Petitions I should like to express my satisfaction because, under an agreement between the parties involved, this task within Parliament is likely to be entrusted to the committee that I chair."
"(DE) Madam President, firstly I would like to thank everyone who has made this possible and, in particular, the former vice-president Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, who did much of the preliminary work during the previous parliamentary term to ensure that the day would come when the European citizens' initiative would become reality."
"Sometimes the citizens of the EU feel as if Europe and its institutions are very remote."
"This instrument, the European citizens' initiative, will bring the institutions closer to the citizens."
"This is an excellent instrument which will strengthen democracy, involve people more and enable them to take the initiative."
"I believe that two things will be very important over the next few months."
"One is creating access, including digital access, to the citizens' initiative over the Internet in a way which makes it easy to use but is also secure."
"The second is that if a citizens' initiative is successful, it should be followed by a legal act."
"My question to the Commission is therefore as follows: How will we decide in future which initiatives will result in a legal act and which simply in a hearing?"
"Perhaps you could explain this, Mr Šefčovič."
"I would also like to thank you once again for your work and for the work done by the Council."
"Madam President, the launching of the citizens' initiative is unquestionably one of the most important developments in the process of European integration."
"It constitutes a qualitative redistribution of power within the European Union and has the potential to generate significant innovation in European politics."
"The placing of citizens at the same level as Parliament and Council, by offering citizens the right to call on the Commission to bring legislation forward, has far-reaching implications."
"For one, the new institution creates space to question one of the fundamental features of the way in which the entire integration process has been designed - namely that, from the outset, it has been elite-led."
"In many respects, this has been very successful but there is equally little doubt now that, without the active support of the citizens, the integration process runs into obstacles."
"Indeed, there is growing evidence that citizens see the EU as remote, complex and impenetrable."
"They have had very little reason to engage with the EU because the means of doing so have been absent."
"This is what the citizens' initiative will remedy."
"It sets up an instrument that has the capacity to bridge the gap between the EU and the demos."
"It is in everyone's interest that the instrument should now work and should work as effectively as possible."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to congratulate all the rapporteurs, and especially my colleague and neighbour Mrs Gurmai, for their outstanding work on this issue."
"The creation of the citizens' initiative is one of the most interesting innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In my view, it constitutes a new legislative power within the European institutions placed in the hands of the citizens."
"In a context in which the feeling of belonging to the Union is still too weak and where rates of abstention at the European elections, especially, are particularly worrying, this new tool will enable European citizens to become fully-fledged actors in European democracy."
"Moreover, this issue gives rise to huge curiosity and undoubted interest."
"Therefore to highlight exclusively the risks that citizens' initiatives might pose would send a bad signal."
"While it is, of course, necessary to tackle this provision appropriately, we must not be afraid of the discussions that might arise."
"The compromise between Parliament and the Council is perfectly balanced and the question will be, once this text has been adopted, to ensure that this tool comes into force as quickly as possible because the citizens are expecting this of us and this is an important opportunity."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am speaking above all to thank all the members of my committee for their good work, particularly Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai, who did a great job in achieving the aim of implementing one of the most important changes in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The committee also listened to the opinion of all national parliaments and experts, working in close contact with the Commission - for which I offer my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Šefčovič - and with the Council's willingness to engage in dialogue, for which I should like to thank Mr Chastel."
"Applying Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure also worked very well, allowing us to work effectively with the Committee on Petitions."
"I personally supported the need for an annual deadline for the entry into force of the regulation and this was certainly not to delay its application but, quite the contrary, to ensure that its initial implementation will be carried out comprehensively and conscientiously so that all Member States, without exception, are able to fulfil the requirement to prepare participation and checking instruments."
"I believe that the greatest positive effect of the new scheme is to increase the awareness of EU citizenship, which has now been enriched by the power of participation in the legislative process, including providing the stimulus."
"I am also certain that the mechanisms provided will guarantee easy participation for citizens, while also preventing abuse."
"Ultimately, I believe that, with the Christmas festivities only a few days away, the adoption of this regulation represents a nice gift for European citizens and Europe itself."
"(DE) Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak after my successor on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I supported this project for 10 years and the European citizens' initiative was included in the text of the treaty almost at the last second."
"Back then, it was the Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments who took the initiative in the Convention."
"This opens a new chapter in the relationships between the citizens and the European institutions."
"All of us hope that this will reduce the distance between people and politics in Europe."
"The citizens' initiative is not the cure for all our ills, but it can be a huge help."
"Above all, I would like to see more openness in Europe, in the form of a cross-border debate on current issues which are of interest to citizens."
"In my area, the environment, I can think of a number of subjects which could be put on the European Union's agenda using this instrument and, in particular, on the agenda of the Commission in its role as European government or executive."
"I would also like to ask the Commission how it is preparing for these future initiatives."
"We must not disappoint the people."
"I would like to thank everyone and especially the rapporteurs Mrs Gurmai and Mr Lamassoure for their excellent work."
"(LT) Madam President, this is a really happy and important day for the European Parliament."
"I very much hope that we will approve this mechanism which will enable our citizens to participate in creating the European Union's future, not just electing the European Parliament, but also actively participating in the creation process."
"It is very important for citizens' voices to be heard."
"A few years ago I myself had the opportunity to represent tens of thousands of European Union citizens when I presented a petition to the European Parliament and I am very pleased that at the time the European Parliament adopted a resolution based on the petition."
"It is a great thing when you feel that your voice, your voice as a citizen, is heard in the European Union's institutions."
"There must be dialogue between the European Commission and citizens, and there must not be any situations that would de-motivate citizens."
"This is a step towards closer cooperation not just between institutions and citizens, but among citizens themselves."
"This is about recognizing and identifying certain problems and providing a single solution to them, but the process must be safe and transparent and we must apply the principle of subsidiarity."
"Madam President, first I want to congratulate Zita Gurmai and Alain Lamassoure for this report."
"I strongly welcome the citizens' initiative mechanism."
"It is a very positive grassroots initiative."
"It will serve to greatly reduce the democratic deficit between the people and the European Union institutions."
"Notably, it gives citizens a platform to express and propose ideas for European legislation."
"The need for a minimum of one fourth of all Member States to collect signatures for the initiative ensures that the initiative will represent the need for a legislative proposal by a cross-section of society."
"Finally, I would like to stress that it is important to have full transparency regarding the founding of the initiative and sources of financial support for the organisers."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, because their work is going to give European men and women the opportunity to convert their concerns into initiatives in the European Parliament."
"Today we are improving democracy, bringing decision-making processes closer to citizens and making them more open and deliberative, always looking towards people."
"This regulation is part of the Europe 2020 policy, and is a basic tool for managing the knowledge and talent available in society."
"It is also going to require us to learn new skills so that we can be more visible as political leaders in virtual communities, in the digital society, and lead in different way that is closer to the people and more human."
"It is a step towards political innovation, which must help us to be more transparent and restore people's confidence in politics."
"Finally, the citizens' initiative is going to be an opportunity for the regions to overcome the lack of recognition that they have in the current institutional structure of the Union."
"I am sure that, with resolve and imagination, the regions will also use this mechanism to bring their proposals directly to this House."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, until the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union was not open to the requests of its citizens, partly because two of its main bodies - the Commission and the Council - are appointed and not elected like Parliament, and also because there was no provision for public participation."
"With the entry into force of the new treaty, European citizens can submit proposed initiatives by collecting a sufficient number of signatures."
"We are somewhat in favour of the regulation, because it improves on the Commission's initial text."
"The admissibility procedure for the proposal is combined with the registration procedure and is followed by the collection and verification of signatures."
"Unfortunately, the report is inadequate due to the lack of any mechanism to verify the authenticity of signatures."
"This could lead to the submission of false signatures and therefore detract from the popular democratic value of the initiative."
"Madam President, the citizens' initiative has many guises."
"Is it a petition?"
"Yes, but not a freely drafted one."
"The petitioner is told beforehand what he might ask for, which is something within the competence of the Commission, and what he might not ask for, which is something deemed by the Commission to be lacking in seriousness or contrary to so-called European values."
"Is it a referendum?"
"Absolutely not."
"It has been described wrongly as an example of direct democracy."
"However, there will be no popular vote involving all citizens."
"Even if a million signatures should be collected, the Commission will not have to act on it."
"It will not even truly be a citizens' initiative."
"Ordinary citizens are unlikely to organise themselves autonomously."
"Only powerful interests will find it easy to mobilise opinion."
"Most of all, it will be a quasi-democratic cosmetic for an undemocratic institution."
"Does that mean we are opposed to it?"
"No."
"I am confident that concerned opponents will use it to undo the European project."
"(PL) Madam President, the European citizens' initiative is to be a tool which enables the citizens to participate more fully in the life of the Union, and this, in turn, is to strengthen the clearly impaired communication between the European Union and the citizens."
"Name, address, nationality and signature - I fully agree that this should be sufficient in order to ensure that the person who signs does exist and has not signed twice."
"Dropping the requirement for identification using an identification document - a decision which, unfortunately, has not been made - could be very influential in creating a citizen-friendly tool."
"In times when the protection of personal data gives rise to particular concerns, collecting confidential personal data such as identification numbers may discourage many citizens from signing an initiative."
"The officials who have been promoting the obligation to present an identification document clearly have not appreciated this matter."
"Enabling European citizens to submit proposals for new legislation on a matter of social importance is an invaluable part of democracy, and I feel honoured that I can be part of the process of giving this tool to the residents of Europe."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work."
"We decided to include the right of citizens to request legislative initiatives by the Commission in our European Constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Our citizens have taken that on board and have already set the first initiative in motion by collecting over one million signatures."
"The issue they selected is an issue which truly concerns us all, an issue on which, even without the signatures, the Commission should take an initiative."
"They have raised the issue of the independence of the EFSA in the face of the interests of biotechnology companies, an issue which Commission Dalli recognised, and have requested a moratorium on crops until reliable control mechanisms can be set up to ascertain the impact of modified organisms on human health, biodiversity and food safety."
"I call on the Commission to take this initiative."
"(FR) Madam President, I too would like to thank our four rapporteurs who have carried out some outstanding work and who have brought significant added value from the European Parliament to the text initially proposed by the Commission."
"The citizens' initiative that we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), are on the point of enthusiastically adopting is a major step forward from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Let us make no mistake, this instrument can truly change the European political landscape as long as we use it both sensibly and bravely."
"It can contribute to enabling European citizens to participate directly in the European political debate."
"It can contribute towards eliciting European public opinion, namely the opinion of European men and women who come together to debate, who adopt a common position and who rally together over truly European issues."
"However, let us not disappoint our citizens."
"Let us urge our Member States to be quick to take the application measures where needed, let us not disappoint our citizens, as the strengthening of European democracy depends on it."
"(NL) Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate everyone, especially our citizens, and I look forward to us working together constructively."
"It is indeed true that we need, in particular, to ensure we maintain a low threshold and that means allowing everyone to participate in a citizens' initiative."
"It is therefore unfortunate that young people under the age of 18 have been denied this possibility, because they are precisely the people that we so badly want to involve in politics."
"It is also unfortunate that we have left it to Member States to decide whether or not to set up initiatives online."
"Surely, you cannot expect us to still work with paper in this day and age when having a presence online has proved to be a very efficient tool for organising people, both politically and in terms of their interests."
"What is it exactly that we expect we will be able to achieve with the citizens' initiative?"
"I do think that the Commission should be able to say, at a very early stage, whether certain proposals, such as those that have been put forward here, like the one about abolishing Parliament, will actually constitute a citizens' initiative or not."
"What can you do about that?"
"Who will develop these things and when can we expect a legislative proposal?"
"We politicians live in glass houses."
"People are allowed to look inside and people will now also be able to drop in and participate."
"I look forward to some constructive cooperation."
"For those of you in the Chamber who wanted to take part in the debate under catch-the-eye, I will not be able to take any further speakers, but I would remind you that you can, under the Rules, submit a written statement that will be appended to the verbatim report of the debate, so I would urge you to do that if you wish to do so."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, first I would like to thank the honourable Members of this Parliament for their great support for this regulation."
"I would also like to thank them for the very positive European energy radiating from this House during this debate."
"As we saw this morning, this year is rather challenging for Europe, but I think this debate has shown that today is a very good day for European citizens and a very good day for Europe."
"I would like to underline that the Commission wants this important initiative to be a success and we will treat it in a very constructive spirit."
"In answer to some questions that have been raised by Members, I would like to assure them that we are going to help the organisers."
"We are going to organise the contact points, and we are going to organise the helpdesk through which we will advise organisers about what is possible, what is not, what kinds of regulations are in the pipeline, what kinds of initiatives are being organised or what kinds of competing or opposite proposals we have received from other organising committees."
"We will try to be as user-friendly and as citizens' initiative-friendly as possible."
"We take the concerns raised by Ms Corazza Bildt and Mr Casini very seriously."
"Therefore, during the whole process we will insist on the importance of preserving the institutional balance in this regulation and preserving the exclusive right of initiative for the Commission, because the Commission is responsible to all citizens - not only to the organisers of the initiative, but also to general European interests."
"This is what we have to follow up in this process as well."
"In reply to Mr Groote, I would like to assure him that once the European citizens' initiative is successful we will follow the procedure established by the regulation."
"We will receive the organisers at appropriate level - Commissioner or Director-General level - then we will be present at the highest possible level at the hearings organised by the European Parliament."
"Within three months we will establish very precise reasons in the communication if we want to follow up with legislative proposals, if we need to study the issue further or, should the initiative be too controversial, if we will not proceed with subsequent proposals."
"I hope that this new instrument will help us to have a better European debate in Europe and more European topics in national capitals."
"I hope that the ECI will be a very successful project and that we will see this when we review it for the first time."
"Thank you for your support."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, honourable Members, let me say a few words after Commissioner Šefčovič."
"As the debate has shown, this is a fascinating subject."
"Some questions remain unanswered, not all fears have been dispelled."
"This is a true compromise."
"Let us bring the citizens' initiative to life."
"Let us judge the regulation in the long term, as this will obviously allow us to develop its mechanism."
"Thank you again for your cooperation."
"I wish the citizens' initiative all the best."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for all of their remarks."
"I am very glad that the majority among us is favourable to adding a new layer to our European democracy."
"It is completely natural and just to be expected that there are fears, but if we try our hand at something completely new we cannot answer all questions and calm all fears beforehand. However, I am confident that the regulation that we present today tackles many of the challenges that we could imagine during the preparation of the regulation."
"We should not be afraid of this new facet of democracy."
"We shall listen more clearly to European citizens' voices, and we should not be afraid to do so."
"This is one of the long-term goals, is it not?"
"We should only be afraid that the ECI is used not in the spirit of the Treaty, not for its intended purpose but abusively or not at all."
"We have done our best to reduce this risk in the regulation with the help of Sylvia Kaufmann, who made the first report on the ECI in this Parliament."
"I would also like to thank Maroš Šefčovič's and Alain Lamassoure's whole teams and our other colleagues."
"I would also to thank the team working for the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union for their cooperation."
"I would like to underline that the implementation of the regulation is crucially important and, to this end, I would like to offer my help and cooperation to the incoming Hungarian Presidency."
"I am confident that the vote in an hour will support the compromise reached between the European institutions."
"This is the only way that we can give a nice Christmas present to European citizens: a solid regulation on the European citizens' initiative."
"Let us not make them wait any longer."
"Thank you very much for your attention and I would like to wish you, and all of the citizens here who bore witness to this, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, at this time and hour, everything having been said, I am happy to leave you the last say in this matter, which you know as well as I do."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I wish to congratulate the authors of the report for the outcome of the vote achieved in committee."
"The citizens' initiative is of great symbolic value and offers one of the most effective ways of strengthening democracy in the EU."
"Citizens must find the new instrument easy to use, accessible and credible."
"I should mention that during the negotiations with the Council, Romania managed to achieve a balance between the initiative's accessibility and stipulating provisions preventing its abuse."
"I think that the latest amendments include faster 'admissibility' for checking proposals, a lower threshold for the number of participating countries and an easier process for signing petitions."
"I would like to stress how important it is to regulate this instrument throughout the whole of Europe."
"We must look for a solution which will encourage the general public's involvement."
"With this in mind, communication activities and information campaigns play an important role."
"The citizens' initiative is finally to see the light of day."
"This incredible democratic innovation will lay the foundations for a new European citizenship."
"It will become the instrument which enables the European public to give direct expression to their concerns on subjects which may be crucial to our common future."
"The scope for intervention is as important as the extended mandate of the Union."
"The European Parliament is encouraging rapid, effective implementation."
"This initiative was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and it still remained to the European institutions to come to an agreement on practical arrangements."
"The conditions for organising an initiative, which Parliament wanted to be flexible (a million people from at least a quarter of the Member States, which equates to seven countries today), will give citizens concerned all they need to request the Commission to propose a new legislative text."
"This will become a possibility next year."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon, we conferred nationality upon the residents of the EU."
"The next step is for the citizens of the EU to be given the citizens' initiative."
"It is a rare moment when a legislative authority or an executive transfers some of its powers to the citizens."
"This shows great maturity."
"It is our response to the democracy deficit."
"Our work is not based only on representative democracy - it is also based on participatory democracy."
"Earlier development policy and consultations with citizens in the decision-making process have not always met the expectations of the European Union's residents."
"The citizens' initiative, which is the result of a difficult compromise, has, firstly, ensured full transparency."
"Secondly, we have simplified the whole system."
"We have also brought in an innovation in the form of the option to submit statements of support online."
"Today, major efforts at promoting the citizens' initiative await us, and these will have to be undertaken by the Commission and Parliament as well as by the Member States."
"We should also consider if openness to the citizens' initiative might be threatened by demagogic or populist proposals."
"I do not think this will happen."
"Every initiative put forward by the citizens will of necessity involve increased responsibility on the part of the Commission and Parliament."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has laid the foundation for the new European citizens' initiative, which had so far been lacking in the European Union's decision-making process."
"I personally welcome this new opportunity, which responds to the frequent criticism that the functioning of the EU has a democratic deficit in its decision-making processes."
"This new tool enables EU citizens to directly approach the Commission and request that it submit a legislative proposal to address a particular matter."
"This deepens the relationship between EU citizens and EU institutions, as it eliminates this often-criticised democratic deficit in decision-making processes, and gets citizens directly involved in decision making."
"In my opinion, the ECI brings European institutions closer to the citizens and it thus fulfils the principle of subsidiarity as a basic principle of the decision-making mechanisms of the European Union."
"I would also like to mention that the Committee of the Regions has said that local and regional authorities have taken an interest in the ECI."
"Such bodies could get involved in the process in the capacity of organisers or supporters; after all they are closest to the citizens of the EU."
"That is just one of many reasons why I support the introduction of the ECI."
"in writing. - I was eager for European citizens to benefit from this powerful instrument as soon as possible, and I am delighted to see the end of the legislative procedure one year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The citizens' initiative is a major innovation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It provides European citizens with a new right whereby one million citizens may ask the European Commission to propose a new EU law, thus bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
"The citizens' initiative is a valuable tool by which citizens can achieve ambitious results through teamwork - this is the essence of the European project."
"This initiative will ensure that the Institutions continue to work on the issues closest to their citizens' hearts, while encouraging cross-border debate on European issues."
"This is a work in progress and the Commission will present a report every three years on the implementation of the initiative."
"Today's vote on the European citizens' initiative is a milestone for more democracy in Europe."
"I welcome the compromise and I will support it, because the report produced by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai is the first step in the right direction."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must not be afraid of citizens having more opportunities to express their will."
"We must give the citizens of Europe more codecision rights, not just every five years at the European elections."
"This needs courage, stamina and strength."
"Courage to keep returning to the dialogue."
"Stamina, because decisions cannot necessarily be made more quickly and strength because our representative democracy includes, at last, in my opinion, more participative elements."
"Our goal must be to increase the dialogue in Europe between the citizens and the politicians."
"I am pleased that we are moving one step closer to the Europe of the citizens today with the European citizens' initiative."
"I am convinced that one day we Europeans will take joint European decisions, in the form of citizens' decisions."
"in writing. - How to bring Europe closer to citizens and how to bring citizens closer to Europe is one of the main issues under discussion probably since the beginning of the European Community."
"The Convention on the Future of Europe worked out the basis for the current Treaty of Lisbon and also laid the ground for the mechanism for the citizens' initiative."
"We now have this on our tables in concrete form, and in the very near future all citizens in the EU will have the possibility to bring issues important to them to the attention of European decision-makers."
"This initiative is one of the strongest measures for uniting citizens in Europe - an initiative which requires joint action, cooperation, coordination and the will to work together for a common European goal."
"Every voice in society matters, but only a united voice can make a real difference."
"I call upon the Commission and the Member States to promote this initiative and to ensure that it is easily accessible for everyone."
"I especially welcome the proposal for joint hearings with the Commission and Parliament."
"It is highly important that the directly elected European Parliament is closely involved and follows the concerns and issues of citizens."
"It is very important for citizens to have the opportunity to take initiatives in connection with the issues that have the greatest influence on their lives as soon as possible, in a pre-defined manner and within an appropriate framework."
"As it is well-known, I am the head of one of the longest-standing representative groups for persons with disabilities in Hungary, the over one hundred year-old Hungarian Association for the Deaf and the Hard of Hearing."
"Based on the experience I have gained during my work there, I would venture to say at this point already that the work of Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai will have tangible results in the form of citizens' initiatives."
"I note with particular regret that the 'million4disability' initiative launched in 2007 by the community of 80 million persons with disabilities living in the European Union, which produced 1.35 million authentic signatures, remained unsuccessful."
"Such an initiative would now have consequences and results, and I thank everyone for their work in this regard."
"in writing. - (FI) The citizens' initiative is a welcome addition to active citizenship."
"Alongside the actual legal initiative, it will have an important role in provoking political debate."
"The scope of the citizens' initiative, however, is not yet cut and dried."
"The European citizens' initiative should be a way to seek amendments to the EU Treaties."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon, even the Commission has the authority to make proposals regarding this."
"That is why the citizens' initiative should also have the potential for formulating initiatives."
"One might see initiatives in the area of social issues, for example, justification for which could perhaps be found in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The debate on the need to amend the Treaties should therefore not end with a narrow interpretation of the citizens' initiative: it must be more flexible and take account of the public viewpoint."
"The launch of the European citizens' initiative proves that bringing the European Union closer to its citizens, which was one of the principal objectives of the process of reviewing the Treaties resulting in the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, is more than just a simple abstract notion."
"The European citizens' initiative will make a significant contribution to making the European political system more democratic, as it establishes a direct link between Member States' citizens and EU institutions."
"Parliament's text meets the requirements for providing citizens with a simple, easily accessible instrument and the opportunity to gather signatures online demonstrates the ability to adapt to the reality of modern societies."
"The initiative will offer Europe's political parties the chance to change from being structures bringing together national parties into organisations which mobilise the will of citizens in joint projects."
"However, the impact made by the European citizens' initiative must be measured not only on a European, but also on a national scale."
"Indeed, the fact that, from now on, a minimum of 24 750 Romanian citizens will be able to join forces to propose such initiatives with other citizens from a minimum of a quarter of Member States cannot be separated from another fact, which is that, according to the Romanian Constitution, a minimum of 100 000 Romanian citizens are required to submit a legislative initiative in a strictly national context."
"in writing. - (LT) I am delighted that barely a year since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, an agreement has been reached on the regulation on the citizens' initiative."
"This regulation is a great achievement strengthening the principles of democracy in the European Union."
"The right to initiate the legislative process that has been given to a million citizens will stimulate interest in EU policies and participation in them."
"It is very important that Parliament managed to simplify the procedures for submitting and organising initiatives."
"An initiative will only be successful if it is easily implemented and accessible to all."
"It must be clear and understandable and citizens must be able participate in it and want to do so."
"On the other hand, it is also necessary to ensure the transparency in the organisation and funding of this initiative, and the initiative must remain an expression of the citizens themselves rather than political or other groups."
"I believe that the final text of the regulation on which we will vote today will help ensure this balance."
"One of the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon is to bring citizens closer to Europe, and the citizens' initiative will help achieve that by establishing this new unique form of citizen participation in politics."
"Setting the conditions for the functioning of the European citizens' initiative was a complex process of negotiation and compromise and involved many debates in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The not-for-profit sector was also involved."
"During the debate, certain problem areas became apparent, such as how to maintain the European dimension of the initiative, transparency, the method for collecting signatures, and other procedural issues."
"However, the most important issue is the general approach to the citizens' initiative."
"If we are to make the most of this new resource, then we must not be afraid to put a stop to the open debate and actually put it into practice."
"Yes, there will be populist and thorny issues, but that is why it will be so important to have the registration process for an initiative before any signatures are collected."
"This process will assess whether or not proposals meet with the basic values of the European Union."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education, I welcome the compromise that has been forged, especially the reduction of the minimum number of countries needed to register an initiative to one quarter of the Member States, and the fact that the European Parliament will play an active role in the public hearing of successful initiative proposals."
"Of course, I am of the opinion that elected representatives should also have the opportunity to get involved in the organisation of the initiatives."
"I firmly believe that the European citizens' initiative will, in future, become a true expression of European citizenship."

"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make the following explanation on behalf of our group about Amendment 13."
"This is an amendment which my colleague Mr Färm tabled to the Committee on Budgets on behalf of our group."
"We have not tabled this amendment again, but the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has retabled it with 40 signatures."
"We will abstain from voting on this amendment."
"However, I have come to an understanding with the Greens about this and we are of exactly the same opinion."
"As we have said that we, as a group, will not table any new amendments, we are abstaining."
"However, I would like to make it quite clear that we support this point, the financial transaction tax, and we hope that the Members on the other side of the House will support us on votes in the near future."

"Parliament's position on the new 2011 Draft Budget as modified by the Council ("
"(PL) Mr President, I think the Members should be given a word of explanation."
"We are voting on the draft presented to us by the Council, with no changes, because this draft is exactly the same as the position which the Committee on Budgets adopted last week."
"It is in accord with what we negotiated during the very long negotiations, which lasted for 10 months."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank in particular the specialist rapporteurs from the European Parliament committees."
"Thank you for your unceasing confidence and support. Thank you for making it possible for us to adopt the 2011 budget, today, so that it can be put into effect efficiently at the very beginning of January next year."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, honourable Members, Parliament has therefore approved the Council's position on the 2011 draft budget without amendments."
"Clearly I cannot but be pleased, on behalf of the Council, with our common agreement on the 2011 budget."
"(Applause)"
"Please listen to this statement."
"It is important."
"For the first time in history, we have applied the procedure set down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Last year, we followed a simplified procedure."
"This was the first time the full procedure of the Treaty of Lisbon has been followed."
"Therefore, I would like to make the following statement."
"The European Parliament has adopted the Council's position of 10 December 2010 on the draft general budget which was presented by the Commission on 26 November 2010."
"The budgetary procedure has been completed in accordance with Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"In accordance with this article and point 4(a) thereof, I declare that the budget for the year 2011 has been definitively adopted, and I will now sign the document officially."

"I am taking advantage of the fact that the resolution on the work programme of the European Commission, plus Amendments 19 to 28 have not, at 12.40, been translated into French to draw your attention to the unacceptable deterioration of multilingualism in the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you."
"We will bear this in mind in future and pay attention to such matters."

"For the first time in the history of the European Union."
"This is an extremely important step, which opens up a completely new basis for cooperation between a group of Member States of the European Union in situations in which it is not possible to achieve the consent of all 27 Member States."
"This is a very important decision."
"We have confirmed, today, that this procedure works well."
"I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the Council in particular for the position it adopted as part of its work with the European Parliament."
"It is an example of perfect interinstitutional cooperation."
"During work on this resolution, Parliament featured only as a consultative body, while the frequency of meetings and the inclusion by the Council of all the proposals which were put forward by the European Parliament and voted on by the Committee on Legal Affairs - their inclusion in the final document - is a perfect example which augurs well for the enhanced cooperation procedure for the future."
"I also thank the Council for its strong support for our proposal on conducting a rapid review of Brussels IIa, which is essential to find detailed solutions, for example, to questions concerning the need for a forum necessitatis rule, a matter which allows Member States to retain certainty as to the working of their internal legal systems while at the same time giving our citizens the hope that in the future they will be able to make a free choice not only of applicable law, but also of court."

"In recital 22, we should cut the second sentence and in article two, I also suggest that we cut the second sentence."

"Since then, two of them have been arrested and yet Russia has been awarded a prestigious football tournament - the World Cup - in 2018, over and above five EU countries."

"Explanations of vote"
"Dear colleagues, we have a lot of explanations of votes so we will have to be extremely strict with the time."
"I will cut everyone off after one minute."
"I apologise for this but that is the way it is going to be."
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I want to explain why I voted against the 2011 budget."
"I voted against it because, in a time of austerity, the EU should show restraint."
"We should be cutting our expenditure, not increasing it."
"In my view it was shameful that the Commission initially proposed a 6% increase and Parliament supported that."
"I believe that my Prime Minister, David Cameron, did a good job in forcing the level of increase down to 2.9% but we know that this was a compromise."
"It is not a compromise that British Conservatives are particularly pleased with and I was proud to vote against EU extravagance."
"(FI) Mr President, it is significant that Parliament for the first time had a chance to approve the budget."
"In subsequent budgetary policy I think that Parliament should ensure that the priorities are that the EU is able to increase its own contribution, that the budget supports material efficiency and policy on climate change through its own choice of policies, and that in this way the Europe 2020 Strategy and a greener economy are achieved."
"Mr President, like my colleague Mr Fox, I too share the concern, as many British Conservatives did."
"At a time of austerity, when governments across the European Union - and in fact governments across the world - are looking to tighten their belt and to rein in spending, how dare we ask for an increase in taxpayers' money?"
"Surely it is a time to tighten our belts and to set an example."
"We should not have been asking for an increase, we should not even have been asking for a freeze, we should have been asking for a cut in the EU budget so that taxpayers across the European Union can take their politicians seriously and know that we understand the pain that they are feeling at this time and that we share the pain with them, rather than looking like an elected elite who pay no attention to the people who put us there."
"(DE) Mr President, the right to draw up a budget is the central right of a parliament."
"This also applies to the European Parliament."
"Responsibility, trust and partnership are the three key aspects of the cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The consultation process on the 2011 budget was not a confidence-building measure in this respect."
"I call on the Commission and, in particular, the Council to respect the rights of the European Parliament, because, as I have already said, the right to draw up the budget is the central right of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, yesterday I wondered whether I had fallen through a kink in the space-time continuum and ended up in the 1970s."
"Today I am wondering whether it is the 1770s."
"Let me quote an observation that Thomas Jefferson made about remote government."
"He said that 'at such distance and from under the eye of their constituents', governors must of necessity tend to 'corruption, plunder and waste'."
"What a perfect description of what happens in the EU budget, with its unapproved accounts, the misallocation of resources, and these constantly rising figures, despite the attempts of the 27 Member States to rein in their spending."
"It is what happens when you have no link between taxation, representation and expenditure, when the EU expects bouquets for spending money but not brickbats for raising it."
"The only way in which we will be able to bring these figures back in line with public opinion is when we restore budgetary responsibility to national parliaments and to national parliamentarians who have to justify themselves to their constituents, who are also their taxpayers."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of the measure and thank the rapporteur, who was very precise."
"We nevertheless believe that this work should force the European institutions to continue to monitor future developments in this new discipline, because in the past unclear situations have unfortunately arisen all too often, which have had a negative impact on the financial system, to the detriment of businesses and savers."
"We consider it very important to have a new European system for agencies and to supervise all central banking authorities in order to ensure that ratings respond effectively to the modern financial system and are useful to the public. I therefore thank the rapporteur."
"(DE) Mr President, the question is: Who monitors the monitoring authorities?"
"Even football referees have to undergo a monitoring or an approval process."
"If this applies to football, then it must surely apply to the financial markets."
"Here the process of evaluating the creditworthiness and soundness of financial products, of banks and even of whole countries has been left to the credit rating agencies."
"However, when these agencies become a monopoly and manage to avoid any form of supervision, then they take on a godlike status and we find them being worshipped."
"We must not allow this to happen."
"It says in the Bible: 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me.'"
"This report is attempting to put the situation right, by introducing supervision of the credit rating agencies."
"At the appropriate time, Parliament should ask itself whether these measures really have been successful."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's vote on the 2011 budget confirms the closing of a new procedure, which, however painful it may have been, showed the responsible and steadfast attitude of the budgetary authorities."
"Although it is a compromise solution involving sacrifices by both Parliament and the Council, it has prevented the introduction of a system of twelfths that would have had serious consequences for the funding of European Union programmes."
"Parliament is satisfied with the goals we have achieved."
"However, it points the finger of blame at those who caused the failure of the agreement on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor programme and on flexibility."
"The Union has in fact lost credibility with its international partners and risks not being able to fund its commitments and not being able to fill the new spheres of action deriving from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Starting from January 2011, we must therefore set priorities and make them financially sustainable for the years to come."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need to modernise measuring systems while improving regulation prompted us to repeal European directives on metrology."
"I too am convinced that this is the first step to starting radical and more precise reform in this area."
"There is also no doubt that we need to agree on a sufficient timeframe to allow Member States to assess the effects of repealing these regulations on their own laws and to make any necessary adjustments."
"Lastly, the decision to repeal the various directives responds perfectly to the need for greater simplification, which is particularly keenly felt in all sectors.."
"We hope, however, that the cure does not turn out to be worse than the disease."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced a key innovation in the democratic functioning of the European Union by providing this new practical tool for civil participation in European debate and integration."
"In fact, the European citizens' initiative introduces a new concept of international democracy and gives the European Union a new form of participatory democracy."
"All our citizens can apply directly to the European Commission to submit a legislative proposal."
"We welcome the proposal from the Commission, since the involvement of civil society and the formulation of policies in decision making strengthen the democratic legitimacy of our institutions and bring the European Union closer to its citizens."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to express my satisfaction at the approval of the European citizens' initiative, for which I was the shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education, while complaining that Parliament has failed to vote on two issues that I consider fundamental: the rights of young people over the age of 16 to sign this initiative and votes for residents."
"We know that these initiatives are not covered by the Treaty of Lisbon and these are some of the reasons why we are opposed to this treaty."
"(DA) Mr President, the Danish Liberal Party has today voted in favour of the citizens' initiative, because it encourages participation by citizens and will make the EU much more accessible."
"Parliament has succeeded in listing a few standardised conditions to make the citizens' initiative accessible irrespective of the Member State in question and to ensure that the instrument remains easy to use."
"However, as a minimum, citizens must come from quarter of the Member States - the number of citizens from each Member State must be at least equal to the number of Members of the European Parliament from that Member State multiplied by a factor of 750, and citizens must be old enough to vote in parliamentary elections."
"We believe that these conditions are important in order to ensure that the citizens' initiative also attains the validity that is required for it to be perceived as a serious contribution to the development of democracy."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the citizens' initiative."
"It is true that the Treaty of Lisbon meant that we availed ourselves of a new initiative which encourages our citizens to participate in democracy."
"When a million citizens sign a petition, the Commission agrees to deal with it, but is that all there is to it?"
"In my opinion this is an excellent initiative, but we have to consider how it can be taken forward."
"The premise is that our citizens would participate in the democratic process mainly by voting in the elections."
"That would be a way for us to take forward matters which are important to people."
"Consequently, this new initiative will obviously perhaps give a boost to citizen involvement, though, on the other hand, I myself see how it could result in a situation where the Commission only replies to initiatives, with nothing concrete emerging."
"That being the case, we need to rethink how we might genuinely encourage people to take part in political decision making."
"(DA) Mr President, just to add to what has already been said in respect of the support of the Danish Liberal Party, I would like to say that, as already mentioned, this is an extremely important initiative."
"It is also an experiment, which - and this is what I am calling for - we must monitor very closely and ensure that the three-year period that has now been laid down for this initiative is actually followed up, and we must consider whether it is actually a proper citizens' initiative or - if I may put it this way - whether it is being used with other interests at heart."
"It is important for its success - the success that we all hope this initiative will experience - that it is, quite simply, the citizens who take the initiative."
"In this regard, I would also like to say that I personally hope there will be some forward-looking, constructive and positive issues that citizens wish to raise concerning the EU project, so that it does not continually turn out to be the 'no' camp that always monopolises the use of this sort of initiative."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been following the legislative procedure for the European citizens' initiative very closely and I am happy - partly on the basis of the statements by the Council and the Commission - that the first petitions will be launched a year from now."
"I am also proud to be able to announce to the European Parliament that in Italy a broad grassroots movement of citizens, associations and committees has sprung up in the wake of the approval of the outrageous directive on animal research."
"This movement will not sit on its hands this year, but will work to prepare a proposal for the Commission: a proposal to give the European Union modern and civilised laws and that says 'no' to animal testing - a cruel and scientifically ineffective practice - while strongly encouraging alternative methods."
"Saying 'no' to vivisection must be an objective of the European Union, since it is a desire of its citizens."
"Mr President, I believe that the citizens' initiative could be useful because it will allow citizens to speak directly to the Commission, but the question remains as to how the Commission will react to proposals it does not like."
"I think we can expect a whole host of initiatives asking the Commission to do more, asking for there to be more Europe, and no doubt the Commission will respond enthusiastically to that request."
"How will it react, however, to proposals for less Europe, or perhaps for Europe to do things better, or to waste less money, or perhaps a declaration that there would never be any European taxation?"
"I wait to see with interest how the Commission reacts to those proposals."
"Will it treat those proposals with respect?"
"If it only responds to the proposals it likes, then this initiative will be redundant."
"(GA) Mr President, I was happy to vote for these proposals, and I think that the two rapporteurs have done a very good job, not only for the European Union but for our citizens in general."
"The citizens' initiative was a very important part of the Treaty of Lisbon being passed in Ireland a little over a year ago, but it did seem for a while that the whole process would be stymied by complication and regulation."
"Thanks to the work of the rapporteurs, simplification has been brought to the process and particularly welcome is the idea that a seven-member panel from seven different countries would initiate the process."
"I think this and other measures will ensure that genuine citizens' concerns can be brought forward while hopefully stopping those of vested interests."
"(GA) I would like to end, therefore, with a proverb from my own language that says that a good start is half the work."
"A good start has been made here."
"Mr President, this is really a sham of democracy, is it not?"
"It is such a shame that you did not actually want to hear the people of Europe before you implemented the Treaty of Lisbon which has brought in this citizens' initiative."
"To answer Mr Fox a few moments ago: after the first phase of this, the Commission could decide that it is not a worthwhile exercise."
"That is the problem with this, because it has no binding mandate."
"It can just be disregarded by the Commission."
"Once again we see the European Union not taking into account the wishes of the people of Europe."
"For Christ's sake, please listen to the people because they do not want this."
"Mr President, I welcome and voted for the Commission work programme for 2011."
"The financial crisis is the big challenge, and it has to be met head on."
"I wish the Commission well in terms of the goals that it has set out."
"As regards the euro, it is absolutely crucial, from the point of view of the integrity and the cohesion of the Union, and from the point of view of solidarity within the European Union, that we have the common currency and that we do everything possible to protect it."
"As regards jobs and the economy, I welcome the fact that in January 2011 the Commission will adopt its first annual growth survey."
"That annual growth survey will analyse the economic situation of the Union, including potential imbalances and systemic risk."
"This is essential to Europe's transformation into a smart and sustainable economy."
"Last, but by no means least, we are a Community of 500 million people."
"We have got to punch above our weight on the European stage and the world stage internationally."
"I wish the Commission well in the year ahead."
"(NL) I have voted against this motion for numerous reasons, but the most peculiar paragraph is the one which states that, according to this Parliament, Member States should be required to spend 0.7% of their gross national income on development aid and that the Commission should ensure compliance with that obligation."
"Apart from the question as to whether or not development aid makes any sense, this also constitutes a serious breach of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Another peculiar thing is paragraph 52 where the Commission is being urged to take advantage of the momentum, as it were, for the enlargement process."
"Can somebody tell me which momentum?"
"Are you talking there about Turkey's constant provocations or the massive human rights violations in that country, not to mention the ever-increasing islamisation?"
"(NL) There are certainly a couple of good things in this resolution, such as the condemnation of President Mugabe, who is a criminal, participating in the Lisbon Summit, and the reference to the harmful consequences of brain drain from the African continent."
"The resolution also rightly emphasises the crucial role of the development of agricultural capacity."
"On the other hand, we really have to get rid of that absurd 0.7% standard."
"The USD 1 billion of development aid that has flown to Africa for 60 years has served only to plunge this continent further into misery."
"Instead of granting ever more aid, we need to put our energy into combating illicit capital flight, amongst other things, which is something that this resolution has highlighted anyway."
"Neither was I impressed in any way by the paragraph on migration, which is why I ultimately voted against."
"Mr President, when we look at the poor state that we see many African nations in, of course we in the EU and in the different Member States of the EU all want to help them out of poverty, but I think we should be more sensible about our use of aid."
"When there is a disaster it is absolutely right that aid plays a vital role in the short term but when we are looking at long-term development sometimes our aid is misallocated."
"Surely it is not right for our taxpayers in different Member States of the EU to be sending money to governments in Africa who are not governing their country in a decent way and that money does not flow down to those who really need it."
"The best way to help development is to help the entrepreneurs in poorer countries who can create wealth in their own communities and take their own friends and neighbours out of poverty."
"Let us open up our markets, let us aim our aid at encouraging trade and development rather than just aid money."
"Mr President, along with a number of Members of this House I recently attended the ACP Summit in Kinshasa, officially the second worst country in the world."
"The UN runs an index of happiness and it places the Democratic Republic of the Congo above only Zimbabwe."
"But, of course, the Congolese, unlike the Zimbabweans, cannot tell themselves that things would improve if only there were a change of government: they have had their multi-party elections, their internationally approved constitution, and so on."
"The Democratic Republic of the Congo exaggerates and concentrates the tragedy of Africa."
"You can, I think, blame the colonial experience there with somewhat more force than in neighbouring countries, without wanting to rehearse the whole tragedy of the Congo Free State."
"There is, of course, the curse of natural resources, which breaks the link between taxation and expenditure, and makes politics a scramble for honour and wealth."
"But, above all, there is the heterogeneity, the lack of national feeling, the lack of linguistic or ethnic unity of purpose."
"'If you love your country, pay your taxes' said a plaintive sign in Kinshasa."
"Of course nobody does."
"You can, I am sure, guess why I am mentioning this."
"The President of the European Council said that patriotism leads to war."
"Well I would love to bring him to a place where there is no patriotism whatsoever, and see what it leads to."
"(HU) Mr President, we all know that as a result of the financial crisis, the state pillar of the pension system, which offers a greater degree of security, is becoming increasingly attractive in several European countries."
"Many countries are reviewing their own systems, and are making efforts to reinforce the state pension system."
"Although the pension system is a matter that essentially falls within the scope of national competence, the direction that debates take on these issues in Europe is still important."
"I therefore welcome the fact that point 30 of the Decision on the Commission work programme, which was adopted now with the support of the three largest popular, social and liberal groups within the European Parliament, highlights that the first, that is to say, the state pillar of the pension system needs to be strengthened."
"My home country, Hungary, took an important step in this appropriate direction with the act adopted yesterday."
"The pension debate within the EU, concerning the white, and subsequently the green papers, must continue in this spirit, this is what the European Parliament is calling on the Commission to do, and I am therefore very pleased with this proposal."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new institutional framework introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon stresses that the effective protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms underpin democracy and the rule of law in the European Union."
"I supported this report because I am certain of the need for a new internal human rights policy for the Union that is effective and comprehensive, and which ensures effective accountability mechanisms, both at national and EU level, to address the numerous violations we see every day."
"We wish to stress that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has radically changed the face of European Union law."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights now has the same legal force as the Treaties and represents the most modern codification of fundamental rights, offering a good balance between rights and solidarity, and encompassing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as well as third-generation rights."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I decided to vote in favour of this report not merely because this was a decision taken by my political group, but also because I am absolutely convinced that this report is of great importance in institutional terms and is necessary at a time when Parliament's powers are defined but taking time to organise."
"We clearly wished to make our first approval of the budget under the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon a significant event."
"It was therefore necessary for all of us to establish a common position; hence the rapporteur's efforts to find compromise amendments to prevent the decisions that will only mean it takes longer to come to a definitive line on the application of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I therefore thank Mrs Gál for her work and hope that this report will lead to a collective improvement in the activities of European institutions."
"(FI) Mr President, firstly I want to congratulate Mrs Gál on this excellent report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union."
"This, however, is just a report."
"We have to remember that we still have much to do within the European Union."
"Unfortunately, not everyone's fundamental rights are being implemented in practice, even if in theory people say that they are."
"We have an example in the huge Roma minority, whose fundamental rights are not being implemented in all respects."
"We also have problems with freedom of opinion."
"It is for the sake of freedom of opinion that we awarded the Sakharov Prize to a Cuban dissident, but we also still have problems within Europe."
"Not everywhere can people speak freely or make known their opinion."
"We have a concrete example of that in one of fellow Members here in the European Parliament, who goes around surrounded by security guards because he has to fear for his own safety."
"We must stand up for fundamental rights in Europe and fight to ensure that everyone has freedom of expression in the European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that the activities of the Italian Government represent a constant violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We only need to think of the agreement between Italy and Libya, which succeeded in infringing dozens of articles of the Charter, or the proposed 'bavaglio' law that set out to gag the press and the legal system."
"We are talking about a government supported by a parliament elected in an undemocratic manner, without allowing citizens the chance to express a preference, a government that yesterday won a vote of confidence with votes from the opposition benches from Members of Parliament who publicly admitted that they had been approached with promises of standing at future elections and cash for votes."
"(The speaker was interrupted by a heckler)"
"The facts prove that corruption has taken place."
"This is business as usual for the corruptor Mr Berlusconi, as the final judgments handed down in the Mondadori and Mills cases reveal."
"(Do not tell me the European Parliament is letting fishwives in now?)"
"On 9 December, the European Parliament celebrated International Anti-Corruption Day."
"Yesterday, the Italian Parliament launched its first day in favour of legalising the corruption of MPs."
"Ms Ronzulli, sit down and stop talking please."
"This is not appropriate in the Chamber of the European Parliament."
"You do not have the floor and you may not disrupt other speakers in this way."
"Please respect this."
"Ms Alfano, please continue."
"I shall give you another 30 seconds."
"(IT) Mr President, on 9 December, the European Parliament celebrated International Anti-Corruption Day."
"Yesterday, the Italian Parliament launched its first day in favour of legalising the corruption of Members of Parliament."
"Ms Ronzulli, this is the last time I am going to say this to you."
"If you stand up again and interrupt the sitting, I will ask you to leave the Chamber."
"Is that clear enough?"
"Do not do it again."
"(FI) Mr President, with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon one of the most crucial new areas for our citizens' wellbeing is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, now binding on us all."
"The next step is for the different EU institutions to focus on the monitoring and promotion of fundamental rights in all the Union's policy areas and in all Member States, in a way that is binding and effective as possible."
"To achieve this, it is important that individuals as well as the different institutions work to ensure that the Directive on equal treatment, which at present has run aground in the Council, is taken forward and that, as a result, we acquire the legally binding means to intervene in cases of discrimination in Member States."
"May I also say that it is especially important to intervene in cases of tacit, as well as blatant, discrimination."
"Tacit discrimination affects older people, for example."
"(NL) Mr President, I have, obviously, voted against this politically correct report."
"As a Flemish nationalist, I find it totally unacceptable that this Parliament should automatically equate nationalism with xenophobia and discrimination."
"The proposal to complement infringement procedures against Member States with a procedure that will block certain policy measures, until such time as the Commission decides whether or not to initiate formal infringement proceedings, is downright dangerous."
"This boils down to nothing short of keeping tabs on Member States and this situation is unacceptable."
"In the future, the European Commission will be able to block an effective deportation policy and, in so doing, it will far overstep its authority."
"Implementation and exercise of these tasks should be left to individual Member States, not to the European Commission."
"Mr President, in an appendix to 1984, George Orwell wrote a chapter on 'newspeak' and he talked about how language could be vitiated and changed, and thereby change our thought."
"The example he gave was the word 'free'."
"He could only envisage the word 'free' being used in newspeak to mean this dog is free from lice, this field is free from weeds; so the concept of intellectual or political freedom disappeared, because there were no words to express it."
"It was an uncannily prescient example, because that is more or less what has happened to the word free in our lifetime."
"It used to mean a freedom against state coercion: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of worship; it now means an entitlement."
"I have a freedom to work;"
"I have a freedom to use the national healthcare system or whatever. This report on human rights has moved from the concept of rights as a guarantee of personal liberty to a right as a claim on everybody else."
"Instead of guaranteeing our rights to be treated equally, it asserts our rights to be treated differently."
"There is not a crisis of human rights in Europe, there is crisis of democracy; and we do not tackle that crisis by shifting power from elected representatives to unelected jurists."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for what happened earlier, but as an Italian I cannot stand a certain type of attitude."
"I am fed up because Mrs Alfano continues to use up minutes of the explanations of vote to tell lies and distort what is really happening in Italy."
"A vote of confidence took place yesterday in the Italian Parliament on a uninominal basis and under absolutely democratic conditions."
"I therefore waive my explanation of vote, declaring that I voted in favour of the report by Mr Juvin."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am convinced of the important role that advertising can play in stimulating competition and competitiveness between businesses to increase the choice offered to consumers."
"Europe must nevertheless succeed in applying tougher regulations to a sector that otherwise risks becoming increasingly invasive, particularly as a result of the use of new technologies It is in fact increasingly common for consumers to provide sensitive data without being aware of the results that may be derived from them."
"This is why I welcome the report by Mr Juvin, particularly because of its focus on the most vulnerable individuals, such as children, who are not capable of independently assessing commercial offers presented through increasingly aggressive advertising."
"(FI) Mr President, advertising is often a useful source of information for consumers and helps them to make sensible choices."
"The industry has also engaged in excellent self-monitoring procedures as regards codes of ethics, which determine what kind of advertising is permissible and good."
"In recent years, however, this practice has fallen by the wayside, as we can see, for example, in how children are used as well as in advertising targeted at children."
"It is for that reason that I believe that Parliament should intervene in this matter, and at a later stage use this excellent report as a basis for examining whether the directive needs to be revised and made more stringent."
"Mr President, advertising is a crucial part of a well-functioning internal market to foster competition and give choice to consumers."
"I voted in favour of the report on advertising."
"It does not propose new legislation or regular advertising nor does it control or limit the Internet."
"The report contributes to raising awareness on the need for responsible advertising to combat unfair commercial practices in advertising and to respect consumers' personal data and privacy."
"I call on the business community to take their share of responsibility with self-regulation, with voluntary actions to avoid misleading, hidden and intrusive advertising."
"I especially appeal for children to be freed from advertising."
"Stop using Batman, Spiderman and Bamse against our children."
"(GA) Mr President, I welcome the Bendtsen report, and I voted for it."
"We must emphasise energy conservation as a way of reducing energy demand and therefore of achieving energy efficiency throughout the European Union."
"We frequently discuss the renewable energy sources, but it is very easy to forget our electricity consumption."
"I voted for this report because it is extremely important."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur."
"Mr President, we have some interesting aggression from our Italian colleague up here."
"Last week a lot of people travelled a long way to Cancún, but they did not move far in the fight against climate change."
"With today's votes on energy efficiency, we actually took a step forward."
"As this report rightly points out, energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and fastest way to reduce CO2 emissions."
"Yet the measures being undertaken in the Member States are far from enough."
"On the basis of our current efforts, we will only make it half way to 20% by 2020."
"That is why we need the binding target on energy efficiency."
"This report contains many of the solutions."
"Now they need to be implemented."
"I would like to thank Mr Bendtsen and congratulate him on his excellent work on this report."
"(LT) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Bendtsen on this very important report on Revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan."
"I voted in favour of it because I believe that it is important not just due to economic considerations, but also in light of the Cancún conference."
"We did succeed in reaching some common ground there, and thus the most important thing is to continue the work the European Union had begun at home to reduce CO2 emissions."
"Energy efficiency is one of the most appropriate routes."
"The Member States must have effective national action plans in this area, including financial mechanisms."
"There needs to be agreement between the Member States and the European Commission on specific assistance."
"All Europeans would benefit from decisions like today's, because we are talking about many independent areas - transport, new technologies and the efficiency of buildings, manufacturing and transfer infrastructure."
"This document is a collection of measures, aimed not just at protecting the environment, but also assisting national economies."
"(FI) Mr President, I also voted for this report on energy efficiency by Mr Bendtsen."
"In the European Union the Europe 2000 programme has also committed us to energy efficiency, energy savings and the use of renewable energy sources."
"We have to remember, however, that when we set these sorts of targets for ourselves, everyone has to commit to them."
"This has been a problem across Europe: there have been good targets, but Member States have not been committed to them."
"Of course, it is to be hoped that when we talk about the efficient use of energy it will not just be confined to Europe but will apply more widely."
"Obviously, there is no case where energy efficiency and savings can be allowed to be an obstacle to competitiveness: we must also ensure that we can compete in global markets, thereby ensuring prosperity and competitiveness in Europe."
"As I said, it is important to adhere to the commitments that we have made."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union cannot back down from the energy challenge that will decide the fate of the planet."
"We must dispel the myth that the economic development of a country is closely tied to an increase in energy consumption."
"Europe must pioneer a new sustainable economic model, based on lower use of resources, including energy, with greater productivity."
"We must therefore break the link between economic growth and an increase in energy sold to industries and the public and instead link it to an increase in energy services that create employment and energy efficiency."
"For these reasons, I believe that energy efficiency represents a priority for the future of the EU, in both economic and environmental terms, and I hope that the Commission will immediately take the necessary measures to implement the binding objectives that Parliament established today."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted for a more binding and ambitious policy in this Energy Efficiency Action Plan, and I am very pleased with Parliament's final position in this matter."
"Climate change will not primarily be prevented just by having international commitments or declarations: we need a practical solution for achieving the emission reduction targets."
"Improved energy efficiency is a very crucial major project in this endeavour."
"For us to be able to achieve it, we need a very broad and comprehensive policy on improved energy efficiency, one which is binding and, if necessary, financially motivated, and which includes sanctions."
"This Action Plan is a good step in that direction."
"Mr Silvestris, are you applauding me or are you asking for a point of order during the explanations of votes?"
"That is a remarkable thing to do, but go ahead."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you can see I am applauding, while also taking the opportunity to make a point of order."
"Mr President, do you also intend to take steps against Members who are in a fortunate enough position to use the time available to them to offend the governments of their country?"
"In your presence, a fellow Member has just offended the Italian Government, which yesterday obtained a vote of confidence from the Italian Parliament and also enjoys the confidence of the Italian public."
"The Member in question may not like this, but it is her own problem and she can sort it out with her friends."
"This Member took advantage of her time here to insult the government of her country, which is also my country, instead of explaining her vote."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you if you intend to tolerate these things despite the Rules of Procedure, because if this is the case I will attend all the explanations of vote in the future to speak in favour of the government that leads Italy legitimately, with the consensus of the country and its Parliament."
"I hope that you appreciate the fact that I allowed you to speak, although what you raised was not really a point of order."
"My job is not to monitor what Members decide to say."
"My job is to ensure that they say it when they have the time to say it, as opposed to interrupting each other and doing so, I might add, in a rather rude and loud way."
"So thank you for your comment."
"I will insist, when I chair at least, that Members conduct themselves in a civil way with each other, and I will try to keep the time as best I can."
"What Members say in the room, in a democratic room such as this, is their business, not mine."
"(GA) Mr President, I have a few points to make on this topic."
"I think in the fight against climate change, nearly all the emphasis up until now has been put on renewable energy which is obviously very important."
"But so much more could be done in the area of energy efficiency and that is why I welcome this report."
"In the area of buildings, so much more could be done, particularly in relation to this building itself, the buildings in Brussels and many more public buildings."
"It is very important that we should make them more energy efficient."
"The same applies to so many modes of transport."
"So many huge diesel-guzzling engines."
"The manufacturers should be compelled to make them more energy efficient."
"One group I want to commend though."
"In my own country the schools do fantastic work in the area of the green flag."
"That should be recognised and encouraged because through them they are getting to the children and to their parents and creating a positive attitude."
"Written explanations of vote"
"European Union budgetary practice meets a certain number of principles including that of specialisation."
"This means that a sum allocated to a particular policy can only be used for that policy."
"This principle, along with others, safeguards the good financial management of the Union."
"However, it also gives rise to a degree of inflexibility in the budget."
"The annual budget and even more so the multiannual financial framework cannot predict all the expenses that the Union will face."
"That is why, for some years now, there has been a 'Flexibility Instrument'. This consists of a financial reserve, the amount of which is included in the budget each year."
"It enables the financing of policies and projects, the cost of which it had not been possible to anticipate."
"My colleague Mr Böge's report recommends that this instrument be used to finance the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and aid to Palestine."
"As these are three areas where I believe in the Union's positive action, I did not hesitate to vote for this text."
"in writing. - (LT) I agree with the European Parliament's decision to allocate additional financial assistance to implement the Lifelong Learning Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme in 2011."
"The objective provided for in the Lisbon Strategy of turning the European Union into a globally competitive and knowledge-based economy, based on sustainable economic development and new jobs, striving for better social cohesion, could be achieved by implementing these programmes."
"In order to increase the global competitiveness of the European Union, particular attention should be paid to small and medium-sized enterprises, providing them with the required assistance and financial support."
"Furthermore, investments in green innovations and the development of scientific research would stimulate the use of renewable sources of energy, which would facilitate the creation of new sustainable jobs in various sectors, including energy, manufacturing and transport."
"in writing. - The Böge report on the use of the Flexibility Instrument can't count on my support."
"The European Commission's proposal lacks an appropriate justification as regards the question of why this additional funding is necessary."
"Besides, I am in general very critical of the use of the Flexibility Instrument."
"It is desirable to decrease other budget lines to enable the financing of budget lines for which justified additional funding needs emerge."
"The Flexibility Instrument provides for the possibility of funding specifically identified expenditure that cannot be funded within the maximum limits available under one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework."
"Thus, its use within the 2011 budget is linked to the need for funding the ""Lifelong Learning” and ""Competitiveness and Innovation” programmes - within the framework of the EU 2020 Strategy - as well as funding financial assistance to Palestine, the peace process and United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)."
"Because of the importance of these programmes, I intend to vote in favour of the proposal."
"Parliament must undoubtedly have a positive view of the report by Mr Böge on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and Palestine."
"I agree with the need and consequent allocation of additional expenditure, beyond the ceilings of headings 1 and 4."
"Considering the current economic situation, these expenses are vital from various viewpoints, for combating the crisis and also for our international credibility."
"It is unacceptable that the financing of aid to Palestine, European education and training programmes and programmes to benefit competitiveness and free competition should be included in a single text."
"The malicious intent is clear to see."
"This combination forces me to abstain."
"I reiterate my full support to the cause of the Palestinian people."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of this report in order to guarantee the mobilisation of EU funds for a total of around EUR 70 million in commitment and payment appropriations from the European Union Solidarity Fund for the natural disasters in Portugal, which applied for funds in relation to a disaster caused by landslides and floods on the island of Madeira, and also for France, which made an application as following a disaster caused by storm Xynthia."
"I feel that we need to show our support for those Member States so that they can tackle and minimise the consequences of those natural phenomena."
"The EU Solidarity Fund was created in order to demonstrate the European Union's solidarity with the populations of regions devastated by disasters."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that it asks for funds to be mobilised for that purpose and that it therefore aims to make correct use of the mechanism available."
"in writing. - (DE) The amounts referred to in this report are totally unrealistic."
"Apart from the fact that the current financial framework would need to be sufficient to cover these objectives, if there were to be an increase, significantly smaller amounts have been planned."
"Adapting the financial framework to the proposals in the report would not increase the flexibility of the Union, but would restrict it."
"It is for this reason that I have voted against this report."
"I would like, most of all, to express my satisfaction at the fact that the European Parliament and the Council have reached agreement on financing the Lifelong Learning Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme."
"I would like to draw particular attention to the Lifelong Learning Programme."
"It consists of four sectoral programmes."
"Of particular significance, in my opinion, is the Erasmus programme, which facilitates student exchanges on a massive scale."
"This is extremely important, both in the area of acquiring new knowledge and skills as well as in making new acquaintances and encountering the cultures of the Member States."
"A similar role - in relation to young people of school age - is played by the Comenius programme."
"These programmes are not only beneficial to the European economy, but they ensure the creation of a European consciousness based on a supranational network of acquaintances."
"These programmes should have a high priority irrespective of the budgetary situation, for they are an investment which will profit the European Union in many areas - not only in the economy, but also in culture and politics."
"The decision on assistance for Palestine is significant for other reasons, but I consider it, too, to be justified."
"The European Commission has tabled a proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument as part of the new budget 'manoeuvre' for 2011, after the failure of conciliation."
"I voted in favour, above all because the increase affects two programmes, namely the Lifelong Learning and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programmes (CIP), that deserve the greatest support and the most resources from the European Union."
"The Flexibility Instrument is provided for by the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline."
"Following agreement between both arms of the Budgetary Authority (the European Parliament and the Council), it allows financing beyond the ceilings set in the financial perspectives of needs not foreseeable at the time the multiannual financial framework was set, for an annual maximum amount of EUR 200 million."
"This is an important result for the European Parliament, because it marks a success in the dialogue with Council over the budget."
"in writing. - (PT) I would like to applaud the agreement reached during the conciliation, in relation to the use of the Flexibility Instrument to fund, in particular, the Lifelong Learning Programme."
"I believe it to be vital for the European Union to invest in the development of quality education and training and the encouragement of high levels of achievement."
"Only stringency and quality teaching can make Europe more competitive."
"in writing. - The Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows for mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework."
"For the 2011 budget, additional expenditure is required above and beyond the ceilings of headings 1a and 4."
"It is therefore proposed to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument in accordance with point 27 of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"The amounts to be mobilised are as follows: EUR 18 million for the Lifelong Learning Programme under heading 1a;"
"EUR 71 million for Palestine under heading 4. The two arms of the budgetary authority are reminded that publication of the decision on the above in the Official Journal of the European Union shall not take place later than publication of the 2011 budget."
"in writing. - (PT) The community budget for 2011 represents EUR 141.8 billion on expenditure for authorisations and EUR 126.5 billion on expenditure for payments."
"Parliament's priorities for this budget may be considered to be the affirmation and strengthening of funding for education and innovation."
"Thus, under the heading 1a - Competitiveness for growth and employment, there is an increase of EUR 18 million for the Lifelong Learning Programme, and under the heading 3b - Citizenship, there are EUR 3 million more for the youth in action programme."
"I am pleased about the commitment by the next four presidencies of the EU (the governments of Hungary, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus) towards involving the European Parliament in future conversations and negotiations relating to the next multi-annual financial framework (MFF)."
"I applaud the commitment by the European Commission to present a formal proposal towards the end of June 2011, ensuring that the proposals relating to its own resources are discussed at the same time as the MFF."
"The involvement of the European Parliament in these matters is also provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon (Articles 312, No 5, 324 and 311)."
"I hope that the need for unanimity within the Council for the adoption of the next multi-annual financial framework and for the new own resources does not translate into blocking."
"An agreement has been reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the budget for 2011."
"I voted for adoption of the budget in view of its underlying political and institutional principles which propose, among other things, strengthening of the role of the European Parliament in negotiations on the new Financial Framework after 2013 and participation in the debate on new sources of income, which includes the Euro tax."
"An additional asset of the budget is its greater flexibility in unforeseen circumstances."
"We have avoided the danger of operating on the basis of a provisional budget, which would to a significant degree paralyse the working of the Union."
"Such a state of affairs would be particularly detrimental at a time when there is a need to fight intensely against the economic crisis and to put the Treaty of Lisbon into effect."
"Much credit for this is due to the position of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"Adoption of the 2011 budget testifies to the fact that it is possible to agree a compromise in the European Union."
"The draft of the financial plan for 2011 was accepted and voted through thanks to the good will of all the institutions which helped create it."
"This compromise should be particularly appreciated because the decision-making procedures following entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon are new ones, and for the first time in history the European Parliament has made a joint decision on expenditure on an equal footing with the Council of the European Union and the European Commission."
"It is not an ideal budget, but I do think that outlays have been apportioned in a sensible way and cover all the priorities of the European Union."
"In voting for adoption of the 2011 budget, I also expressed my support for further development and for the idea of European integration."
"I voted in favour of this report, as the community budget for 2011, which was presented by the parliamentary Budgets committee during the part-session, strengthens funding for the priorities defined by the European Parliament, such as education, innovation, the peace process in the Middle East and Palestine, the Lifelong Learning Programme, the ""People” research programme, and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme."
"I congratulate Parliament, the Council and the Commission for also having agreed that, if additional funds are needed to comply with EU legal obligations, there will be amending budgets throughout 2011, given that, legally, the EU budget cannot be in deficit."
"In addition to the budget, Parliament had certain political requirements relating to the implementation of the rules laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely with regard to a new system of own resources, and in relation to these it is good to know that the EC has now announced that it will present a formal initiative towards the end of June 2011, ensuring that proposals relating to the own resources are discussed at the same time as the future Financial Perspective."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution and supported the EU budget for the year 2011."
"I welcome the agreement finally reached between the Council, Commission and European Parliament and I hope it will be a sustainable budget that can be fully and predictably implemented from the beginning of the financial year."
"With the adoption of this resolution we, the European Parliament, secure financing and continuity of the budget agreed upon by the Council and the Committee on Budgets."
"I am convinced that it was necessary to allocate more funds to education, research and innovation as the EU needs to increase its efficiency and competitiveness to be able to rise from the financial and economic crisis."
"In order to reach this goal, the EU has to create a long-term strategy and this budget should be a part of it."
"The European Parliament's approval of the Community budget for 2011, just a few days after it rejected it, proves that the entire procedure is a poorly set up game of disorientation from the essence of the budget, which is to serve big business better in its effort to shift the burden of the economic crisis and increasing imperialist interventions on to the workers."
"At the same time, this well thought out game highlighted the serious competition between the imperialists and the fact that Community bodies are jostling for position as to who can best serve the interests of the plutocracy following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The decision was already taken some time ago to reduce any minimum appropriations that might have been used for poor farmers, workers and the self-employed and to increase the appropriations which are channelled directly to the monopoly groups, into the services and infrastructures of civil-military interventions and into persecution and repression of the working class and grassroots movement."
"The political spokesmen of capital will be unable to save themselves from calumny with tricks such as these."
"Their role is becoming clearer by the day."
"The working and grassroots classes are stepping up their fight against the policies of the EU and the bourgeois governments, thereby creating new prospects for a grassroots economy which will serve their needs, not those of capital."
"The preparation of the annual 2011 budget has again given rise to real political negotiation between MEPs and the governments of the Member States."
"In the current context of budgetary cuts, the Council of the European Union, which represents the governments of the Member States, wanted to make the Union take a part in the austerity measures that European countries are imposing on themselves."
"Despite the fact that the European Parliament, as well as the Commission, wanted, on the contrary, the crisis to be tackled by voluntary policies, it sided with the position of the Council, in a clear display of solidarity with the Member States."
"In exchange for this concession, Parliament wanted a debate to take place on the Union's resources, and in particular on the issue of it being able to have funds of its own, independent of contributions from the Member States."
"The Council was initially intransigent but ended up by ceding to our legitimate demands."
"That is the reason why other MEPs and I have been able to give our agreement to this budget, the ambition of which is limited to the short term, but yet one which allows future prospects for Union policies to be opened up."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of discharge of the 2011 budget."
"This budget was strengthened by new procedures provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"These lengthy and difficult negotiations to reach an agreement on the 2011 budget demonstrate that as new budgetary principles become effective, we will be forced to find rational institutional compromises on the most important areas of EU policy."
"For the first time since the new treaty came into force, the European Parliament has used the powers it was granted to participate fully in the composition of the European Union budget."
"The first unsuccessful attempt to reach an agreement and include the European Parliament's legitimate demands demonstrates a conflict that is still present among the institutions and that should not actually exist, as it is obstructing effective inter-institutional cooperation."
"The objective of all EU institutions is to ensure that agreements which are particularly important for the whole of the EU and its citizens are adopted as smoothly as possible."
"Therefore I believe that in future there must be fundamental changes in the operating principles of the institutions themselves and the inclusion of the European Parliament in all stages of negotiations, particularly budgetary, must be considered as particularly important for the implementation of the principle of representative democracy."
"The European Union must grant itself a budget equal to its ambitions."
"It must not let itself be carried along by the crisis but rise to the challenges it meets."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now plays on a level playing field with the Council and has made its mark as a proactive force."
"I voted for the 2011 budget as it is incumbent on us, as MEPs, to give Europe clear political direction."
"In 2011 Europe will keep its priorities on target."
"It will be able to revise upwards its financial needs in order to implement its new powers."
"Despite difficult economic circumstances, Parliament has managed to win a firm commitment from the Member States."
"On the proposal of Parliament, in 2011 the Commission will begin discussions on the different types of own resources, resources which Europe needs to guarantee its financial autonomy in the future."
"However, I am deeply concerned that Parliament has not found a consensus on the additional funding that the 'Iter' project will need from 2012."
"The experimental thermonuclear reactor, a flagship project of international research and European scientific dynamism, could have benefited from an unused and surplus portion of the 2011 budget."
"Parliament, after having acquitted itself well in the negotiations with the Council on the 2011 budget, on the conditions for the drawing up of the next multiannual financial framework and the question of the Union's own resources, has lost the battle."
"By adopting the 2011 budget, during the December part-session, we showed the Council was right."
"Our concerns were not about figures but rather about political demands."
"We have not forgotten our seven demands adopted during the previous part-session."
"The positive thing is that the Commission will also present a proposal in the spring of 2011 on the question of own resources."
"Parliament will be included in these discussions as it will in those needed for producing financial perspectives."
"But the terms remain to be defined, and therefore the fight for codecision to be respected in this area has only just begun."
"The adoption of the EU's 2011 budget by Parliament indicates that when dialogue is established between the Commission and the legislative, matters can be arranged for their mutual benefit."
"The Commission has realised that the European Parliament now has a greater say in the Union's finances, and has decided, albeit later on, to respect this situation."
"In practical terms, the budget remains within the limits set by the Council but, at the same time, it also includes some of the legislative's priorities."
"Before agreement was reached, we were in the odd situation of having all kinds of strategies and programmes which did not feature at all in the budget forecasts for next year."
"These strategies and programmes cannot just remain on paper because they would only serve to highlight inconsistency and a lack of confidence in the acts adopted by the European Union itself."
"It is obvious that you cannot develop programmes supporting young people, innovation and research and you cannot claim to be an active player in global foreign policy without the funds designed to finance all these plans."
"Parliament has argued successfully with the Council for the need to carry out regular evaluations of the benefits of new legislation and its funding."
"As representatives elected directly by the European Union's citizens, it is important for taxpayers to see that their money is being well spent."
"I am pleased with the budget approved today, as it retains the priority lines adopted by Parliament in October, which strengthen key areas such as education, youth, research and innovation."
"It is essential to provide the EU with a sustainable budget that may be implemented in a full and foreseeable manner from the start of the financial year, in contrast to a system of provisional twelfths that would put the implementation of its policies at risk."
"It is equally important to strive for a budget that is visionary in times of crisis and which strengthens areas that contribute to economic growth and to more and better jobs, such as science and innovation."
"Only through an ambitious budget will economic recovery be possible in Europe."
"in writing. - (FR) The 2011 budget was voted with responsibility, bitterness and conviction."
"Responsibility: the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and Parliament assumed their responsibility by voting in favour of this budget to avoid an institutional impasse and recourse to the provisional twelfths system."
"Bitterness: codecision in budgetary matters is a losing battle."
"Despite the concessions made by Parliament, some Member States who, unlike me, do not believe in the added value of the European budget, have remained inflexible."
"Conviction: the future of the Union depends on new own resources and a tax on financial transactions."
"We need the Commission and we need it to be committed to this, if we are to make this fundamental objective a reality."
"We need a Trade and Transport Facilitation (TTF), and also a 2011 budget and therefore I abstained on the amendment retabled by the Greens on this issue, which was symbolic but irresponsible."
"The TTF is a topic which is too important to be trifled with, within the political strategies of tabling amendments for which one is not the original author, with a budget line at zero."
"What was originally a socialist amendment was intended to move this debate forward during the budgetary procedure, but had it been adopted today it would have meant choosing a Union with no budget."
"I voted in favour of a budget with a near zero increase on 2010, to show that Parliament could display maturity and responsibility in the context of an economic crisis that is crippling national governments."
"It is not right to start increasing the 2011 budget at a time when most Member States are entering a period of tight budgetary control."
"I am delighted that the tough negotiations that took place between the various institutions on this matter led to a compromise and that we have avoided budgetary crisis for 2011."
"I voted in favour of the report relating to the new draft budget for 2011 because it strengthens funding in areas that have been defined as priorities by the European Parliament, such as education, innovation, competitiveness and cohesion for growth and employment, as well as the conservation and management of natural resources."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2011."
"It is a restrained budget, but it also contains important investments in research, initiatives for young people and necessary aid initiatives for Palestine, and it enables the establishment of the EU's new External Action Service and new authorities for financial supervision."
"However, we abstained from voting on both the text and the proposed budget lines relating to new own resources for the EU."
"We are in favour of a review of the EU's own resources system and an examination of a tax on financial transactions, but believe that we currently have too little information to be able to take a detailed position on this matter."
"Irrespective of the form that a new system for the EU's revenue might take, we would like to emphasise that it must be budget-neutral and respect the Member States' competence in the sphere of taxation."
"The 2011 budget will be the first Union budget to be agreed following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
