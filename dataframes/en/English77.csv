"In this respect I very much welcome the new commitments included in the IIA as regards increasing the accountability of all financial actors, including the Member States."
"The agreement is good news for an enlarged Europe, because it means that we now have a clear financial framework for the development of the Union over the next seven years, with full participation by the new Member States in key European policies."
"The agreement contains many positive elements, in particular the boost to the development of the new Member States."
"We increased funding for programmes directly related to the new Lisbon Agenda."
"There are also new elements."
"For the first time, the agreement entails a joint effort with the European Investment Bank."
"Those funds will help act as a catalyst for Lisbon-related priorities."
"Finally, one should not forget the increased flexibility achieved through different instruments, to be mobilised where necessary for unforeseen events and needs."
"This agreement also clearly recognises the role Parliament will play in the wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending and resources, which will be one of the top priorities in the coming years."
"This agreement is an essential milestone, but we will now have to move swiftly to build on the momentum created by this agreement to accelerate and complete the legislative process necessary to get all programmes up and running from next year."
"Again, let me thank all actors who participated in these negotiations, and I wish Members a very good debate with a positive outcome."
". Mr President, I wish to thank Parliament's team, who showed such respect and gave such commitment and importance to the Committee on Development's position."
"I must reflect a rather negative position from that committee: in June 2005 you will recall that this Hemicycle was encircled by a 'Make Poverty History' band."
"Unfortunately, that hope has been dissipated as today we discuss Financial Perspective proposals that reflect lower levels of growth for the Development Cooperation Instrument than is the case for all Europe's other external actions."
"How can we believe that it is possible for Europe to meet its Millennium Development Goal targets if resources are to be limited for those critical years up to 2013?"
"Europe's preoccupation with counterterrorism and with migration should not dictate that resources should be diverted away from our essential task, which is to work with the pressing needs of the world's poorest people and poorest countries."
"The Development Committee also firmly rejects the language used by the Commission, which presumes that the proposals to rationalise the instrument have the potential to enhance either the coherence or the responsiveness of the European Union as a development partner."
"Finally, our commitment is to fund human and social development in the world's poorest countries."
"As things stand, I think we tragically face the likelihood that Europe will be seen as reneging on those principles and on those priorities."
"I also feel that the strong and welcome commitment made last year by us all – the Commission, Parliament and, in particular, the Council and the Member States – is now seriously under threat and the Committee on Development has to express its deep concern about the effects of the Financial Perspectives on its work."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have considered these questions, and there are two main points I would like to put before you."
"One is that it is of the utmost importance that funds should be made available for the European Union’s peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and also in many other countries around the world."
"There is now the prospect of an operation in the Congo."
"That the funding has been topped up is something to be welcomed, but we would prefer it not to be divided up."
"The civilian component will be funded from the European Union’s budget, and the rest provided by the Member States from their current income."
"This results in shadow budgets that are ever more difficult to monitor as a consequence of their no longer being subject to the full scrutiny of the national parliaments, or, indeed of the European Parliament either."
"This must surely be counted as a deficit."
"I might add that it is also of paramount importance that we have discovered deficits in these overseas operations, specifically in connection with reconnaissance and telecommunications."
"If we are to send troops on difficult missions, it is very important that it should first be ascertained what is going on on the ground, and for that we need satellite-based reconnaissance systems."
"It is irresponsible to deploy troops with five or six different types of communications apparatus, which often work together only with difficulty or are not mutually compatible at all."
"That is why we in the European Union need a single satellite reconnaissance system and common standards for telecommunications in this sphere."
"Another reason why that is particularly important is that it is the very same deficits that are to be found among the police and in disaster prevention and management centres."
"Let us imagine Europe being struck by a tsunami."
"In that event, it will, in the first place be of the utmost importance to be able to see what is happening, but also, and secondly, that those managing the disaster, the police and the armed forces, be enabled to communicate with one another without difficulty."
"This is another important task for the budget of the European Union."
"Mr President, that I should wish to express my satisfaction with the outcome is hardly surprising, since I was on the negotiating team."
"I would also like to take this opportunity of thanking my colleagues on the negotiating team, the Commission and the Austrian Presidency."
"I take the view that we have achieved as much as we could."
"With regard to budgetary control, undoubtedly the most important thing is the fact that we have been given a clause in the agreement about better control on spending and certification."
"After all, the Court of Auditors has been issuing negative Statements of Assurance for the past 11 years, and this is something that the European public will no longer accept from us."
"Last year, we stated for the first time that national statements should be introduced."
"Before the negotiations, 23 of the 25 Member States were still opposed to the idea; after the negotiations, they were all in favour."
"I think it very important for the sake of the Commission that we should, in future, hold firm to the idea that Member States make those statements one way or another."
"I happen to know that there are a few that have objected to this."
"Fortunately, this is not officially reflected in any way in the documents we are ratifying today, but it will cause a problem for the future."
"It is important to this House that the Commission implement this agreement as it was intended."
"There are, of course, a number of drawbacks to this agreement."
"Indeed, it is impossible to please everybody all of the time."
"For me, what poses the greatest risk is the Council’s declaration in the area of voluntary modulation."
"The common market for agricultural products is one of the things we have achieved in Europe."
"If we start with 20% – or any other percentage – of voluntary modulation, then this strikes at the very root of the common agricultural policy."
"That is very dangerous and something we must avoid."
"If this House is to have any say in the matter, I will – for as long as I am still a member of it – try to prevent this from happening."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, The overwhelming majority on the Regional Affairs Committee welcomes the agreement that has been achieved on the Financial Perspective, even though regional and cohesion policy are, when compared with what Parliament proposed, losing out to the tune of EUR 40 billion, and even though it has not as yet been possible to get the Council to agree to the reuse of unused funds for cohesion policy."
"The Regional Affairs Committee, though, is well aware of its responsibility to the 360 million voters who would like to get started on the programmes with which we seek to help the European Union’s poorest regions."
"Final agreement on the Financial Perspective provides, at long last, the political, economic and financial stability for these proposals to be actually put into effect."
"It is not just the people in the new Member States who are looking to the European Union for support."
"It is because European structural and regional policies are up and running in every Member States that I ask that the proposal that Mr Böge has put forward should indeed get the backing of a majority in this House today."
"I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the House for the way in which the negotiations were conducted, and also to say ‘thank you’ for the additional EUR 300 million allocated to territorial cooperation and for the efforts made towards creating a single legal framework."
"Such matters as the crediting of VAT, the N+2 rule and the options available for public/private financing will in future be dealt with in the same way in each Member State."
"That is a triumph for this House and for its team in the negotiations, and warm thanks are therefore in order."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the renewal of the Institutional Agreement, I should like to express my dissatisfaction with the budgetary agreement concluded on 4 April."
"Indeed, in the budget negotiation, heading 2, 'Preservation and management of natural resources', obtained an extra EUR 100 million under a reserve for forthcoming measures in the fields of Life + and of Natura 2000 and nothing more, despite the efforts of the negotiating team, to whose work I pay tribute."
"Besides the fact that this does not by any means settle the Natura 2000 network's funding problems, I should like to highlight the fact that no answer has been given to all the other remarks and criticisms contained in my opinion, which was virtually unanimously adopted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I would point out that one of the main aims of the CAP reform, which was decided in September 2003, was to freeze the first pillar in order to strengthen the second pillar, namely rural development policy."
"However, it turns out that the package earmarked for rural development has been reduced by some EUR 20 billion in comparison with what the Commission had proposed, which, in the regions of the 15 old Member States, represents a 35% decrease in relation to the current 2000-2006 period."
"That is a huge decrease and comes on top of the reduction in the Structural Funds."
"This is clearly going to result in more people leaving our rural areas and, indirectly, in the problems within our towns and suburbs becoming more acute."
"The first pillar, for its part, is going to come under strong downwards pressure: compulsory and optional modulation, financial discipline, reform of the common organisations of the market and WTO negotiation."
"The 2003 agreements have therefore been completely disregarded, and the balance that was struck is being called into question before the 2008-2009 revision period is even looked at."
"Like Mr Mulder, I also want to stress that the optional modulation in these unconditional procedures resolves nothing."
"On the contrary, it is going to present some serious technical problems and create distortions of competition;"
"I regard the Interinstitutional Agreement's concluding statements on this subject as being very weak in comparison with the risks taken."
"As far as I am concerned, this is the start of a renationalisation of the CAP; I will therefore vote against this agreement."
". Mr President, I would like to point out that the European fisheries sector needs sufficient resources, both in order to continue with the commitments made with the sector and in order to carry on defending the new policy that we have established – the development of sustainable fisheries – particularly when the European fisheries policy mainly affects areas outside of the convergence objective which contain many of the regions that suffer most from the crises periodically affecting this sector and which therefore continue to need Community support."
"The final agreement on the financial perspective is not the one we would have liked for this policy, for fisheries, but I would like to put it this way: it represents the minimum necessary for us to be able to vote in favour."
"This period is going to require special work by the Fisheries Directorate-General. Furthermore, Commissioner Borg has taken on the task of implementing a new maritime policy within the European Union."
"In the case of fisheries, ladies and gentlemen, we are still awaiting the adoption of the relevant regulations, and I would therefore call upon the Council to adopt the Regulation on the European Fisheries Fund as soon as possible, so that the Member States can draw up their programmes as quickly as possible and plan their spending as efficiently as possible."
"I would ask the Commission to make every effort to keep the policy of international agreements alive and kicking and make the best possible use of these funds, in order to ensure that Europe has an efficient and competitive fisheries sector."
"I would like finally to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Böge, on his excellent work, and I also believe that the Temporary Committee has done very good work."
". – Mr President, I too, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, would like to extend warm thanks to all Members concerned, and particularly to Mr Böge, the rapporteur, for the work they have put in, which has an effect on programmes in the fields of lifelong learning, youth, culture, media and the citizens’ Europe."
"If you believe the pious utterances of politicians in every one of our 25 Member States, these programmes are part of the European Union’s most important field of action, but when it comes to making available the funding that young people need, the 25 governments keep out of sight and make swingeing cuts, particularly to important investments in our young people’s futures."
"It is for that reason that I want to tell the Commission and this house how grateful the Culture Committee is to them for not merely talking but also acting and, in their proposals, sketching out appropriate dimensions for these programmes."
"Let me give you just two examples to show why I am talking about the number of young people and not just about the financial aspects."
"The first example is Erasmus – the student exchange – and both institutions suggested that 285 000 exchange students per annum is a workable figure, only for the 25 governments – in the person of the Council – to make a drastic cut of over 50% in that number and reduce it to 140 000."
"The cut made to Leonardo – the training programme – was from 150 000 to 36 000."
"It is for that reason that I am very appreciative of all those Members who helped to ensure that what emerged at the end of deliberations at least bore Parliament's stamp and that the sums of EUR 800 million for lifelong learning and EUR 300 million for other programmes achieved some sort of credibility in this area."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like, after having thanked Mr Böge and our negotiators, to summarise the specific reasons that led our committee emphatically to endorse the draft Interinstitutional Agreement presented to us."
"From the very start of the negotiation process, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs made four precise demands."
"Firstly, we demanded that the freedom, security and justice sector be the subject of a specific and independent sub-heading in the new financial framework so as to highlight its importance in political terms."
"We obtained that sub-heading: it is sub-heading 3a."
"Secondly, we proposed appreciably to increase the appropriations with a view to anticipating the threat of terrorism and the development of organised crime and to responding to the demands for external borders to be controlled better and for migratory flows to be managed better."
"We obtained that increase in appropriations."
"During the next seven years, it will be possible to increase the appropriations allocated to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice by 167% – yes, 167%."
"That is by far the strongest potential growth of the new financial framework."
"Thirdly, we requested authorisation to finance the new agencies by means other than the financial framework, so as to preserve the resources dedicated to the operational programmes."
"If I have correctly understood the arrangement included in point D of part III, it will be necessary, in future, to obtain the agreement of the two arms of the budgetary authority that any new agency can be financed before it is created."
"This financing will therefore not be automatically covered by the financial perspective."
"We can be satisfied with this, even if we had hoped for something better."
"Finally, we, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, proposed that a kind of trialogue with Parliament and the Council be established before the Council’s first reading of the budget, and we did so with a view to harmonising the positions held by the two institutions regarding the political priorities and the distribution of resources."
"Admittedly, this arrangement does not appear as such in the text of the Interinstitutional Agreement, but rather as a unilateral declaration by the European Parliament: it is Declaration 13."
"We have not obtained everything that we asked for, but it is true that we have obtained a slight improvement and, nowadays, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a slight improvement – to quote Raymond Devos – is indeed something; it is a significant step."
"Mr President, although it is thanks to the negotiating skills of Mr Böge and the other negotiators that Parliament has managed to both add real European value to the Council’s original proposals and considerably enhance the institutional framework, the present financial perspectives for 2007-2013 remain unequal to the challenge that the European Union is facing, even though Parliament, in the Böge report, has formulated a reasonable and reasoned proposal that is more realistic than that from the Commission."
"Nevertheless, the Council’s tight-fistedness and short-sightedness, arising out of national considerations, have triumphed over Parliament’s and the Commission’s European ambition."
"We will nevertheless be voting in favour of this Interinstitutional Agreement, since it is the only compromise possible under the current circumstances."
"Indeed, the lack of financial perspectives in the next few years would plunge the Union into an even deeper crisis than the one it is already in."
"Moreover, it would not be fair on the new Member States, for they need future prospects in order to continue their cohesion policy and to be fully integrated into the common market."
"This does not alter the fact that the present level of resources is insufficient to meet Europe’s new challenges."
"That is why the review clause and flexibility scheme were an absolute necessity, because the risk that sooner or later, we will run aground, is too great."
"Parliament should be fully involved in this."
"The most important conclusion we can draw, though, is that the current system of own resources has reached capacity levels."
"There is a need for sweeping reform."
"We must move away from the system of donations from national budgets, and return to real own resources as was the case at the start of European integration in respect of customs rights."
"That is the only way of ensuring that the European general interest will prevail over the narrow-minded and short-sighted national interest."
"This House must play a role – a driving role – in this and formulate proposals, and Mr Lamassoure’s studies and notes are a good place to start."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it has to be said, with all due respect, that there is such a thing as the European Parliament and that decisions on Europe’s finances are not left to the Council alone."
"I believe that the reason why this House, through the negotiating process, achieved important improvements simply because, from the word go, we did not work on the basis of ‘Here’s the money, now work out how to manage on it’, but instead paid attention to the structures."
"We took care that we did not, as we had done in the past, fight to put plenty of money in the Budget lines – as we had done with the last, 700 billion, perspective – only to end up with the actual expenditure totalling just over 550 billion; what matters, then, is the quality of the expenditure, and that is why we insisted on making headway on the Budget Regulation front, making things less bureaucratic, less tangled."
"The money must actually be able to flow, and we must be sure that it gets to the right people; that is why it was vital that we should ensure that the Member States, too, paid attention to the quality of each item of expenditure and considered whether it was getting to the right people."
"We attached, then, great importance to the quality of the expenditure, and that also means that we want to prevent margins needed elsewhere from being eaten up by the constant creation of new agencies or extensions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy; that is why we had to set boundaries."
"We have therefore made sure that budgeting will be done in a more structured way in future and that the money can actually be made use of."
"Secondly, we have made sure of sufficient flexibility in the Budget for new things."
"Where the Council, regrettably, had left nothing over in the ‘Citizens’ Europe’, we have created a margin, in order that not everything should be used up in the multiannual programme, with no chance of doing anything more."
"We have improved and extended the pilot projects and the preparatory measures, thereby giving this House greater scope for influence, and we have added 5% for the sake of greater flexibility to the budgets of the multiannual programmes, enabling us to respond to challenges with greater flexibility and precision."
"We have also managed to achieve things of importance in the individual subject areas, such as lifelong learning, about which everyone always has great things to say, and where you, Mr President-in-Office, seem to believe that there are only 140 000 students left, whereas we have increased their number to 210 000."
"We have also achieved increases in the trans-European networks and in PROGRESS, the programme that, by combating social exclusion, sends a message to Europe that we are not merely an economic union, but also spare a thought for, and help, those who have problems to contend with."
"We have also managed to get more money for Health and Consumer Protection, for cross-frontier cooperation and in many other areas."
"If you were to ask me whether I would like to see more than what we have achieved, I would tell you, without a doubt, that, yes, I would have liked more, but that I know that there are always two, or sometimes three, sides to a compromise, and that is why we were as tough as possible in negotiating, for we were negotiating with people who drive a hard bargain."
"The result that emerged is one with which not everyone can be satisfied, and all the things we would have liked, which we described in the Böge report, will be back on the table in the next few years, and these requests will keep coming back to you, whether for own resources for funding agricultural policy or for other areas; we will be asking you how you propose to meet your commitments – by which I mean to GALILEO – and you will then come to us."
"Let me say in conclusion that this compromise may well not be the stuff of my dreams, but I wholeheartedly endorse it, and ask my fellow Members of this House to approve it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, reaching the agreement on budgetary discipline has been a long haul."
"In Parliament, we have done some thorough work, analysing what is needed and developing common political priorities."
"We have done this in the course of more than a year under the expert leadership of our rapporteur, Mr Böge, whose efforts have been exemplary."
"The EU Heads of State or Government lapsed, however, into unseemly bartering about income and expenditure, with refrains such as ‘We will not pay’, ‘Maximum of 1%’ and ‘We want our money back’."
"The compromise we are debating today really is, therefore, a compromise."
"It is not a particularly attractive one, and no one is fully satisfied with it."
"Rather, it is the art of the possible."
"The optimist in us will, however, emphasise that it is constructive that there is now a framework to facilitate the legislative work on the programmes for the Structural Funds, research and education."
"What is more, the framework provides more resources for investment in education, research and transport and for aid to the EU’s poor regions, while expenditure on agricultural aid is cut back."
"I therefore recommend voting in favour of the agreement."
"We have ensured that administration of the EU budget will become less bureaucratic."
"We have ensured that responsibility for administering EU resources has been placed squarely with the Member States."
"We have ensured that the European Investment Bank is able to provide far more ambitious funding and that more young people are able to take part in educational exchange programmes. We have also ensured that the EU budget for health and consumer protection was not subject to the swingeing cutbacks planned by the Heads of State or Government."
"The framework is tight, however; so tight that it pinches."
"Let me give an example. The Commission proposed EUR 20 billion by way of investment in cross-border transport projects."
"Parliament supported the Commission, but the result has only been EUR 7 billion."
"How are we to obtain money for the 30 cross-border projects that have been adopted?"
"I think that the Council owes us an answer regarding how the common projects can be made a reality."
". – Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the many Members who have spoken before me, I would like to explain why we think this compromise is a bad one and why it is that we cannot endorse it."
"We believe that the Financial Perspective that we will now have for the next seven years has to be judged on the basis of whether or not the budget is geared to the future, whether or not it helps us to sort out together the problems with which we are faced, and whether it really is oriented towards Europe."
"It is for that reason that my criticisms are primarily directed at the Council."
"Over the last few years, we have suffered a great deal as a result of this debate about one per cent and net contributors, which gives a voice, not to the European spirit and to concern for what benefits Europe, but to small-mindedness and narrow nationalism."
"What we are dealing with at the moment is a nationalistic deformation of Europe’s foundations that is detrimental to every plan we make for the future."
"Contrary to what previous speakers have said about there being no alternative, we do believe that one would have been possible."
"We could of course have gone back to the annual budget procedure, and we in this House would have had 30 billion more with which we would have been able to do something about our own priorities."
"Let us consider the messages that are being sent out."
"Over recent years, Parliament and the Commission have acted very responsibly, and have done so out of a sense of responsibility to Europe."
"What can we in Europe do better than the nation states on their own?"
"That is what we need to concentrate on; that is what will win the European people over, but what has happened now?"
"We have a structurally conservative budget that keeps agricultural policy as it was and makes no attempt to transfer funds to rural development."
"Just as before, agricultural export subsidies are in place, ruining, among other things, the development of African markets and contributing to the refugee problems about which we are always complaining."
"This is where the European Union’s policies are wrong, and I find it very regrettable that there has been no change in this respect and that the Council has stonewalled in this way."
"My second concern is that, following the Council’s December meeting, it was clear that most of the savings had been made in the areas to do with the knowledge-based society and education, which runs completely counter to its own modernisation rhetoric."
"They are always getting on their hind legs and saying that Europe must become the most economically successful area in the world by 2010, that we must develop the knowledge-based society, that we must do more for education and exchange in Europe, and then the budget for this gets cut by 50%."
"This House may well now, by dint of a great common effort, have been able to make some small improvements, but there are only 210 000 students on Erasmus, and we want at least 285 000."
"Even that compromise is no kind of triumph, but rather no more than a drop in the ocean."
"Let me now move on to energy policy, where Europe ought to take a joint approach and move away from oil, investing much more in renewable energies in order to arrive at a new position that will win over the people’s hearts and minds."
"We have succeeded in doing none of those things and must therefore come to the conclusion that this Budget is quite simply not forward-looking enough."
"The Council stood in the way of much of it, and that is why we cannot go along with it."
"The last thing I want to say is that I am very grateful to the negotiating team and to Mr Böge for the dedication with which they handled the proceedings."
"We will have no shortage of work to do in the coming weeks and months."
". Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Böge, for the work he has done with regard to the matter now before us."
"It is not his fault that the Council keelhauled the Commission and Parliament and bruised the political credibility of these institutions."
"The biggest miscalculation was made by the Commission in its original proposal for economic guidelines."
"It miscalculated the Council’s relative powers and created expectations that were far too great."
"The report by Parliament’s temporary committee was produced on the basis of these expectations."
"It was difficult for many Members to come to terms with Mr Böge’s sense of realism at the time."
"While the Council was editing the Commission’s proposal, the Commission continued to create expectations that were too high."
"President Barroso marketed the Commission’s view on the basis of total miscalculations."
"He has lost face in this process, as has Parliament as a whole."
"Parliament’s decision to reject the conclusions drawn by the Council in December 2005 at the time established a good basis for further talks."
"The Council, however, showed the Commission and Parliament that the EU’s money came from the Member States."
"The Commission and Parliament may in practice only be involved in decision-making relating to the EU’s expenditure: in the redistribution of cash within the framework dictated by the Council."
"Postponing resolution of the problems until the mid-term review at the end of 2009 will not increase Parliament’s power in EU budgetary matters."
"On the revenues side, we have failed to get rid of the unjustified UK special rebate."
"On the expenditure side, the fact that the Council kept to a 1% level for payment appropriations undermined a budget which could have achieved European added value, as the Community budget would have been more than just the sum of the Member States’ contributions."
"My group would have liked a more constructive budgetary framework for the period 2007–2013."
"This we have not got, and we are voting against the adoption of Mr Böge’s report."
"We have not achieved the sort of flexibility in the financial framework that would have been necessary for good financial management."
"Instead, the Member States are putting more money in the budget for the militarisation of the EU."
"The Council has cleverly exploited a situation in which the federalists in the Commission and Parliament will not be able to cope with a new EU-wide crisis."
". Mr President, as far as the new financial perspective is concerned, we are definitely faced with both bad news and good news."
"The good news is that we have overcome the 10-month impasse in talks on the issue, and that the multiannual planning of the European Union’s finances now has a solid basis."
"It is also good that this basis is EUR 4 billion higher than the Council’s proposal."
"The bad news is that the net contributors are still continuing to place restrictions on the Union’s development by means of spending cuts."
"We should still remember that during the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013 the European Union’s GNP is expected to increase by around 15%, while EU spending is set to increase by 2%."
"The good news here is that spending related to the Lisbon Strategy has been increased by EUR 2.5 billion, but there is bad news in that this spending will amount to barely EUR 74 billion compared with the EUR 371 billion earmarked for agricultural policy and natural resources, as well as the EUR 308 billion earmarked for cohesion policy."
"It seems a good thing that a review of budget implementation has been scheduled for the end of 2009, but such an early date for this review is not so good, as it may harm the new Member States, where the absorption of Union funds may not yet have reached the target level."
"This review may thus be understood to be an attempt to enforce budgetary discipline and another reason for spending cuts."
"It is therefore good that we have the new financial perspective, but bad that it demonstrates so little economic solidarity and such little will to meet external challenges."
"It would be in the interests of the European Union as a whole for the net contributors to contribute more generously."
"They would then reap the overall benefits from a higher growth rate in the beneficiary Member States."
"The competitiveness of the European Union will not increase if we continue to defend an outdated social model and expensive jobs."
"In this matter, blaming the new Member States or enlargement will not help."
"The Union’s economic problems have deeper roots, quite aside from political problems resulting from unfair and irresponsible comments directed at the governments of certain Member States."
"If a certain recent fan of Mao Tse-Tung, who is absent at present, for no apparent reason attacks the Polish Government as being fascist, his words doubtless hark back to Communist propaganda, which destroyed pluralism and democracy, and interpreted everything that was not Stalinism as fascism."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, in the agreement, we are preparing to introduce a protective mechanism known as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and to invest EUR 3.5 billion in it."
"I am fundamentally opposed to this."
"I strongly believe that in a further populist move, we are handing out fish where we should be learning how to catch fish ourselves."
"The Globalisation Fund does not have the objective of creating new jobs in sectors with long-term opportunities."
"It is seeking something entirely different."
"It is seeking to support those who lose work as a consequence of companies escaping from the tight reins of the EU."
"Instead of abolishing directives, opening up the market for services and labour and cutting taxes, we are currying favour with the citizens with a pipe dream of short-term social gain."
"Does anybody in this Chamber really think that greater support for the unemployed would lead to the creation of new jobs?"
"Furthermore, with the establishment of the Fund we are creating a completely false impression that it is possible to protect the EU from the rest of the world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, just as we do not control the wind or the rain, we do not have the power to stop capital from running away to a place where it feels better."
"We should keep that in mind."
"Mr President, the final agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 coincided with the second anniversary of the enlargement of the European Union, and thus constitutes a birthday present of sorts."
"It is also real proof that the European Union is functioning with 25 Member States."
"This is proof in a field where compromise is difficult, as differences are sharply delineated and calculable in financial terms."
"The financial agreement and the agreement on financial principles leave us here in Parliament in doubt as to whether we have sufficient funds to achieve the stated political aims of the European Union."
"This uncertainty almost verges on the certain knowledge that, in line with the agreement, some limits must be revised upwards in the course of the coming seven years, especially in order to fulfil the European Union’s ambitions on the international stage."
"It is good, however, that the flexibility and capacity of the budget to react have been increased, that we have increased access to European Investment Bank loans and that certain funds, such as the Solidarity Fund, the Globalisation Fund and the Emergency Aid Reserve, have been placed outside the scope of the financial perspective."
"The lesson we can learn from this experience is that there should not be such marked differences between the initial positions of the European Commission, Parliament and the Council, as such enormous differences, which amount to billions of euros, can mean that some figures become abstract notions, especially if spending cuts are subsequently sought where the budget was to have been modified."
"The Rural Development Fund is an example and symbol of just such a case."
"The budget needs changes, but it does not require a revolution."
"It cannot be an alternative means of reforming the European Union."
"Public spending cannot replace the far-reaching reforms needed to make the Union competitive."
"I would like to thank all those who took part in this venture, which has now been brought to a successful close."
"– Mr President, the majority of my group is going to vote in favour of the agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013, reflecting our sense of responsibility."
"We want the new Members States to be able to begin to use the Structural and Cohesion Funds fully from next year, in order to promote their growth and true economic convergence with the most prosperous regions of the Union."
"The agreement is not very generous, but we are sure that it can be a useful instrument during these first years of accession, not just in terms of the economic development of those regions, but also in order to demonstrate to the Europeans of the new Member States that one of the distinguishing marks of our Europe is solidarity."
"Neither do we want to add a budgetary crisis to the current political crisis in the Union, which has not just been created by the 'no' votes on the Constitution, but also by the negative campaigns against the integration process, which are having so much success in certain countries."
"I believe these to be the fundamental reasons for our vote in favour."
"Nevertheless, given our desire to move ahead with the construction of an increasingly strong, fair and cooperative Europe, we have serious doubts about whether it is appropriate to vote in favour."
"We do not like this financial perspective as a whole. It is not the financial perspective that Europe needs at the beginning of the 21st century."
"It is insufficient and it has been strangled by national interests."
"Our countries’ leaders appear to have forgotten that everybody benefits from European integration."
"So far everybody has gained from it."
"There are no net contributors; that hackneyed notion is merely a fallacy dreamt up by bad accountants."
"Representatives of the Council, this time we are going to give our approval, but we will be watching to see what happens next."
"As any document shows, we are talking about a review in 2009."
"If you do not propose valid solutions for the Union very soon, we will have to impose them ourselves."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Böge, for his excellent work towards establishing the financial frameworks."
"He was working under difficult circumstances, but nevertheless enjoyed Parliament’s undivided confidence throughout."
"The financial framework is a shallow one, payments only account for 1% of Gross National income, and it is visible within the content of the frameworks."
"It is unfortunate that we could not do anything about Great Britain’s annual EUR five-and-a-half billion contribution rebate."
"In my opinion every one of us should bear responsibility for financing the EU."
"Initially the emphasis in the financial frameworks was on improved competitiveness."
"The Commission set an ambitious objective to improve industrial and entrepreneurial competitiveness in the European Union by promoting research and development and endorsing training schemes."
"The funds intended for these were to be trebled within seven years."
"The purpose was to improve employment prospects in particular."
"The Council, however, cut these funds by 40%, so this ambitious objective remained unachieved, which has been the greatest failure in these negotiations on the financial framework."
"It is good in the final outcome that progress has been made with the Structural Funds."
"The new Member States are to receive approximately EUR 24 billion net every year from the old Member States for their reconstruction."
"In this way Europe can once again become united and strong."
"Now we need to hurry to make use of the time available to establish the financial programmes, otherwise unpaid commitments will reach intolerable levels in the first few years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday saw us debating the possible ways out of the constitutional and confidence crisis, and the President of the Commission and some in this House thought we should concentrate more on reforming the context rather than the text itself."
"We should try to cope with this crisis of confidence through the sort of policies, results and reforms that restore public confidence."
"It sometimes happens that the moment of truth arrives earlier than one thought it would."
"What we have to deal with today is the context of the European Union’s policies and the options available to it, and what I ask of you is how you propose, by means of this Budget, to meet people’s expectations."
"There is something spooky afoot when the President of the Council talks about a fair and balanced budget."
"This House hears what the specialist committees have had to say on the subject, about development cooperation being unsatisfactory, about education, youth and research not being up to any kind of standard, about defective communications on our security missions overseas, about the dramatic reversal in rural development."
"It is in a state of affairs such as that that you are proposing, in all seriousness, to win back the trust of Europe’s citizens."
"There have been negotiations between Europe and 25 states, whose public expenditure share of GDP ranges between 45% and 50%, and which, in return for handing over between 30% and 40% of their functions to Europe, give it 1% of their money."
"That is a recipe for disappointed public expectations; the worsening of the crisis is built in."
"You cannot leave the text and the context unchanged."
"– The agreement reached for the financial framework for 2007-2013, including the interinstitutional agreement, is a bad agreement."
"It is inadequate from a financial point of view and as regards its priorities and its instruments for addressing the challenges facing an enlarged Union."
"It is an agreement that fails to respond to the increased needs of cohesion, and to attach priority to fighting the increased imbalance, inequality, unemployment and poverty in the EU."
"It is a bad agreement for economic and social cohesion and for cohesion countries, insofar as it relegates the Community budget’s role of redistribution."
"The Structural Fund has been reduced by EUR 28 million in relation to the Commission’s proposal, and from 0.41% of Community GNI in the current financial framework to 0.37% in the future framework, and that in an EU of 27."
"It is an agreement that is EUR 100 billion down on Parliament’s original proposal."
"Parliament also negotiated a compromise of just EUR 12 billion and then went on to accept as little as EUR 4 million, which has led to inappropriate priorities and for which we are paying in cuts to other budgetary headings."
"It is also a bad agreement for countries like Portugal."
"Against a backdrop of increased competition and facing a deep crisis due to aspects such as monetary and budgetary policy restrictions that have led to increased unemployment and a divergence from the EU since 2000, the country has suffered cuts of more than EUR 1 million per day and 15% of Community transfers in relation to the current financial framework, not to mention the injustice of cuts facing the Algarve region, victim of the so-called statistical effect."
"Consequently, we have no choice but to reject this agreement."
"– Mr President, can the Union be competitive when it creates regulations that weaken it?"
"These kinds of regulations are created in almost all fields."
"They make it impossible for the new Member States to catch up with the richer Member States."
"Instead of creating a strong European Union in line with the Treaties, decisions are being made that cement its division into two parts; more to the rich and less to the poor."
"I would like to ask you to look carefully at the figures in the budgets following the last enlargement and see how hugely disproportionate they are and how they discriminate against the new Member States."
"This lack of proportion runs counter to common sense and also harms the interests of the old Member States of the Union, as is mentioned in the most recent report of the Centre for European Reform."
"It indicates that the old Member States would benefit more if the new Member States received more support."
"This would stimulate the economy and the market, and a larger market produces greater benefits."
"A narrow understanding of the interests of the old Union threatens the cohesion of the whole European Union."
"We will not achieve a better future for Europe if this policy continues."
"Mr President, in taking the floor in the debate on the reports by Mr Böge and Mr Sousa Pinto on budget procedure and the financial perspective for 2007-2013, I would like to draw your attention to the following matters."
"First of all, in spite of the feeling of satisfaction due to the fact that the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been approved, it should be stressed that the setting of the general level of payments at 1% of the European Union’s GNP merely serves to meet the expectations of the most developed countries within the Union, and does not deal with the challenges facing Europe in the 21st century."
"It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to implement the enlargement of the Union, increase growth and achieve deeper integration with smaller financial means than we have hitherto had at our disposal."
"Secondly, as a representative of a new Member State, namely Poland, I would like to express concern at the continued efforts to divide the financial resources foreseen in the financial perspective for 2007-2013 in such a way as to ensure that the stream of funding flowing into the old Member States is as generous as possible and continues for as long as possible."
"Thirdly, I am convinced that a further enlargement of the European Union, and the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in particular, which will require additional financial resources of at least a dozen billion euros per annum, will not restrict the funding for regional policy and the common agricultural policy in the 10 countries which joined the European Union in 2004."
"Finally, I hope that the work done on the draft regulations facilitating the spending of the funds foreseen in the financial perspective will be efficient enough to ensure that 2007 does not become a dead loss, especially in terms of regional development policy."
"– Mr President, Mr Grasser, there can be no meaningful financial agreements without transparency, and it is for that reason that I would like to read this out to you: ‘We must listen when some of our citizens bemoan the misuse of EU funding or the squandering of resources within some programmes."
"There are cures for these ills in the form of independent scrutiny."
"We must listen when some people call for greater transparency in European decision-making, for example the publishing of funding awards, so that people know who has actually benefited."
"Why not?"
"It is only right that such information should be published."
"This is European taxpayers’ money that we are talking about.’"
"I am sure that you, Mr Grasser, can agree with that."
"That was quoted, in any case, from your Federal Chancellor, the President of your Council, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, who said those words, in this Chamber, on the very spot where you are standing, on 18 January this year."
"Now, though, what has become of publications by the Ministry of Finance?"
"Eleven EU Member States have adopted the practice already;"
"Austria, even under your Presidency of the Council, has not, even though the President of the Council gave a binding undertaking that we would be allowed to know how much money from the EU has gone into the pockets of big farmers and Austrian television journalists, including those around the farmers’ representative in the Austrian People’s Party, Mrs Schierhuber."
"So just do it at last; pay no heed to those who whisper lies in your ear, and do not succumb to the deceitful intoxication of power."
"Do not believe the editor-in-chief of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation; do not make him out to be more important than he is by appointing him as Secretary-General of its General Board, and make everything public once and for all!"
"Mr President, the European Parliament put its full trust in Mr Böge to negotiate an acceptable financial perspective package for the European Union."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, which will be put to the vote today, provides for great advances in the field of budgetary discipline and Parliament’s budgetary rights."
"The question is whether these improvements are going to compensate for the serious deficits that exist in relation to figures."
"The European Parliament’s negotiating position expressed in the Resolution of June 2004 was the last compromise that was truly acceptable to the political groups and we therefore approved it unanimously."
"Since then, we have had nothing but bad news from the Council: a bad negotiation, a failed one, during the Luxembourg Presidency, and another negotiation during the British Presidency that ended with an agreement that everybody considers to be insufficient."
"On that basis, the European Parliament and our rapporteur embarked upon an impossible battle: to raise the figures to acceptable levels in order to maintain a positive impetus within the Union and its programmes."
"It was not possible and the final round of interinstitutional meetings has led to a final result practically identical to that indicated by the European Council, with 1% of the budget, which is what the ‘letter of six’ originally called for, and with negative consequences in terms of cohesion and rural development."
"Surprisingly, the head of the governments which will suffer most from this reduction, mine in particular, did not do much to prevent that failure."
"The final decision is in the hand of the parliamentary groups and the national delegations, which in any event will draw whichever conclusions they consider most positive for the future of the Union."
"The majority of my group is going to vote in favour of this financial perspective."
"I would like to end by reiterating what everybody is saying about our rapporteur, Mr Böge: if we had to name a rapporteur again for the negotiation, we would name Mr Böge again a thousand times over."
"Had it not been for him, the Agreement would have been much worse."
"Mr President, the Treaty provides only for an annual budgetary procedure."
"It does not provide for financial perspectives."
"But it is nonetheless quite sensible that the two arms of the budgetary authority agree on a multiannual perspective to permit more sensible long-term and forward planning."
"My one criticism of this agreement, seen from the point of view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is that it is so detailed and is broken down into so many points that it takes much of the flexibility away from the annual budgetary procedure."
"That said, in terms of overall content it is a good agreement."
"Many colleagues have pointed out that the sums agreed are less than what had initially been proposed by the Commission."
"That, of course, is true."
"At the same time, however, for most items of expenditure they represent an increase on current levels of EU spending."
"Sometimes the increases are substantial, as in the case of research and development."
"That is to be welcomed."
"The one area that will decline is agricultural spending, by about 7% over that whole period."
"It may not seem much of a decline, but not just the 10 new Member States but also Romania and Bulgaria will have to fit within that ceiling."
"That would mean a substantial decrease for the old EU-15."
"I think the reform of the CAP in this regard has often been underestimated in the debate."
"The redistribution from agriculture to other items of expenditure is something that should be welcomed."
"One of the ways the Member State Governments could stimulate the private initiative is to create an environment conducive to the growth of high quality economy."
"We must ask ourselves whether the interinstitutional agreement reached will contribute to the attainment of this objective."
"We can hardly answer this question because initially the agreement was reached when the Member States shared opinions at the dinner table and decided which programmes should be funded."
"Later the European Parliament joined the dinner table and attempted to adjust the agreement with regard to priorities defined by social programmes."
"Can we really assess the economic impact of an agreement reached in this way?"
"I do not think so."
"Therefore, I believe the procedures for developing such projects should be regulated in a more strict and clear-cut way."
"First of all we must clearly define the responsibility of the Member States in respect of the general budget, that is, reform the own resources system."
"The Commission should say clearly that it supports this proposal and should say what it proposes and what it is doing, because at the moment there is a lot of uncertainty in this matter."
"The second important task is to actually define the criteria for each programme underlying the fund’s allocation."
"At present these criteria are of a very general character, on occasions overlap, and it is utterly unclear whether the funds, seemingly considerable amounts, will actually benefit the European citizens."
"The third thing, which definitely must be defined in each programme is the responsibility – that of the Member States for the European Union budget, citizens' responsibility for the use of the funds and the Commission's responsibility for the efficient, apparent and the transparent functioning of that system."
"Mr President, it is said that a bad compromise leaves some people happy and some people sad, while a good compromise leaves everybody pretty well unsatisfied."
"It would appear, to my group at least, that according to that definition this is a very good compromise."
"The question for my group, however, is whether this interinstitutional agreement answers the big questions facing Europe at the moment."
"Our judgement is that it does not."
"It looks increasingly clear that we are in a minority, but we will be voting against this deal on the grounds that we could do so much better for our citizens."
"This interinstitutional agreement locks us into never-ending wrangling between the net contributors, the net recipients, old Europe, new Europe, the Council and Parliament, at a time when we must be one Europe or we risk being no Europe."
"We are not without ideas."
"The Sapir report contained a number of ideas that merited consideration."
"They have been put to one side in favour of continuing as we are, when Europe deserves so much better."
"On those grounds, my group will be voting against."
"– Mr President, I wish first to thank Mr Böge for his excellent effort; however the agreement achieved on the package of the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 between the three institutions of the European Union is, for us as a group, unacceptable."
"Following the compromise agreement between the European Parliament and the Council, the budget for the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 is particularly inadequate, both from the point of view of the amount and from the point of view of priorities."
"We do, of course, welcome one of the basic points of the agreement, by which I mean the facility for the European Parliament to take a stand on the review of the budget to be implemented by the European Commission and in which Parliament will participate fully."
"Nonetheless, we disagree with it in essence."
"This agreement is particularly inadequate from the point of view of financial resources."
"For example, the last enlargement increased the GDP of the European Union and hence its revenue by 5%; at the same time, however, it increased its population by 30%."
"This means that expenditure will increase more than revenue, especially if account is taken of the fact that most of the new Member States have a much lower per capita income than the rest."
"Despite all this, the budget in absolute numbers is not very different from today's levels."
"Similarly, the agreement is inadequate from the point of view of priorities for meeting the economic, social and environmental challenges of an enlarged European Union."
"It does not reflect the cohesion requirements of the current enlargement."
"It is rather a political and economic translation of the objectives incorporated in the Constitutional Treaty with an excessive focus on security, defence, the militarisation of the European Union and external action, but with little increase in the funds earmarked for the cohesion and regional development funds."
"Mr President, budgetary discipline, sound financial management – surely these words are alien to this place!"
"In fact, they are veritable oxymorons when used in relation to anything to do with the finances of the European Union."
"This agreement is designed to keep the whole crumbling edifice of the EU in place."
"It uses lots of high-sounding words that give the impression that the EU is professional, well organised and has properly-maintained financial records."
"All I can say to that is ‘phooey’."
"Words mean nothing."
"After 11 years of abject failure to produce auditable financial accounts, how can we possibly justify putting in place an agreement allowing more of the same?"
"My colleagues and I will therefore be voting against this agreement on principle, but then we do not believe in the European Union either."
"It is a morally bankrupt, institutionally wrong and dangerously undemocratic organisation, a dinosaur in the modern world."
"It is a major threat to security, freedom and, more importantly, the economic future of Europe."
"– The fact that we have reached an agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, as well as an agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 is a definite step forwards."
"However, neither the points of conflict nor the stop-gap measures used to agree the annual budget and the financial perspective of the EU have been ironed out."
"We will have to continue patiently to seek forms of regular communication, at least between the Council and Parliament."
"In other words, we will have to continue to intensify communication between MEPs and the national parliaments and governments."
"It is a far more complex and urgent matter, however to reform the individual structures of the EU as items of budgetary finance."
"We need mention only the well-known need for greater efficiency in agriculture, which is the largest recipient of European funds, or the reduction in finance from the structural funds, where the effectiveness of the programmes is often doubtful, and where funding difficult to control, and corruption and cronyism are likely."
"One way out could be a gradual move towards supporting and increasing funding for the construction of trans-European networks."
"This would create the preconditions for a growth in Europe’s global competitiveness, and the European Parliament, in guaranteeing national activities of this kind, would undoubtedly enhance its political prestige."
"Mr President, I too want personally to thank the rapporteur, Mr Böge, for his excellent work."
"It is pertinent to remark that none of us could have dealt with this matter better, in what were extremely difficult negotiations."
"He managed to improve on the original proposal in two matters especially."
"The first of these is the Flexibility Instrument."
"This is an important tool, because responding in humanitarian situations is precisely what the public expects of the EU."
"The other important matter is the review clause in the Financial Perspectives, which is an absolutely essential instrument from the point of view of Parliament’s competence."
"I must express my disappointment with the Council’s original agreement and, in particular, with Christmas bonuses."
"They will not bring any kind of added value to the EU, and the emphasis should have been on training and innovation."
"The Galileo and Erasmus programmes should have warranted better treatment and additional funding."
"It is nevertheless important that consensus has been reached and that we can show our citizens that in the new EU of 25 countries decisions can be made even in difficult circumstances."
"Accordingly, it is extremely important for us all to vote in favour of Mr Böge’s report."
"Once again I say thank you to Mr Böge for the excellent job he has done."
"Mr President, firstly, on my own behalf and, I believe, on behalf of the MEPs of all new Member States, I would like to thank the negotiating delegation of the European Parliament, and in particular, rapporteur Mr Böge, Chairman Janusz Lewandowski and our colleagues Mr Walter and Mr Mulder."
"They deserve to have their names mentioned, for the difficult work requiring a high level of expertise, patience, international experience and true sense of diplomacy, with which they managed to reach the compromise regarding the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"A year and a half ago we, too, joined with great enthusiasm in the preparatory work that had started in the European Parliament, because it was clear to us that this was not only a political issue that would define the future of Europe as a whole, but also a practical issue serving the catching-up of new Member States."
"As new European citizens with full rights, we understood that the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective has to serve a better, globally more competitive Europe."
"Also, another decisive factor for us was the need to receive, for the time following the adjustment period ending in 2006, a structural and cohesion framework easy to calculate and plan, to enable us to catch up rapidly and successfully."
"We agree with our colleagues who do not find the current solution ideal, but we believe that even this solution is a good basis for the development of Europe as a whole, and especially for cohesion in new Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to take my turn in thanking Mr Böge and all of our fellow Members - Mr Mulder and the others - for their contribution. Just when we are on the subject of a crisis of confidence in the European institutions, their contribution has demonstrated the extent to which our institutions, and especially our Parliament – that goes without saying – have played their part to the full."
"The institutions have played their part to the full because, over and above the exemplary nature of those meetings, we are going to use this interinstitutional agreement to provide our fellow citizens with the practical resources needed to give full effect to Europe and to the powers it has in terms of development and solidarity."
"As a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to emphasise one point."
"Throughout previous years, we have been able to observe, and we continue to observe, how much the Structural Funds have done for countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, and how much these Funds have changed people's everyday lives within regions that were previously lagging behind and that, now, have aligned themselves with the average of our European regions."
"With the Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period, we can achieve this same result insofar as the new Member States, in particular, will be able to use the Funds made available to them."
"Nevertheless, we know that there will be a delay, in spite of rules n+2 and n+3;"
"I therefore urge the Council, together with the Committee on Regional Development and the European Commission, to declare, forthwith, that the resources that are not used in the context of the Structural Funds will not be redistributed in the Member States, but reallocated as part of a new agreement that will be concluded in the next few years, thanks to which the Funds will be used to achieve the objectives of our proactive policy on this matter."
"Mr President, the European Parliament is now entering into a compromise with the Council of Ministers concerning the half-witted budget for the next seven years."
"More than a third of EU money goes officially to agriculture, but it does not reach the farmers."
"Danish farmers’ total net income for agriculture is only a quarter of the direct subsidy."
"That is madness."
"Farmers could obtain four times more by way of total net income if the various arrangements were circumvented and the money sent to farmers directly."
"Another third goes officially to regional development and the Structural Funds."
"The reality is that poor people in distant regions are direct net contributors to the EU budget."
"In Latvia, 80% of EU aid goes to Riga."
"Poor people living in the countryside pay a large contribution to the EU via their daily purchases, but the money is not returned by the EU to those who pay."
"It is Robin Hood in reverse, with the EU taking from the poor and giving to the rich."
"Instead, allow the new countries not to have to pay contributions."
"Focus Structural Fund aid on the poorest areas in the poorest countries and begin by putting a cap on agricultural aid so that no one can receive more than, for example, EUR 30 000."
"Begin rearranging the budget now by voting against the compromise on funding."
"Mr President, Parliament has come out of its trial of strength with the Council having succeeded in salvaging EUR 4 billion, from a total of EUR 864 billion over the period 2007 to 2013."
"The Council has also – to all intents and purposes – allocated more powers to Parliament by making it possible for the latter to assess the budget’s structure in 2008-2009."
"We are still in what is termed the period of reflection about the EU’s future."
"A period of reflection can, and indeed should, also offer the opportunity of calling a few things into question."
"For example, we seem to be moving towards a European tax in the form of a tax on energy and transport."
"On behalf of the general interest of the European taxpayers, we must oppose this new tax – any new tax for that matter – that, whichever way you look at it, will be added to the fiscal pressure, which is already too high in most Member States."
"Mr President, we accept this agreement not because it is good, nor because it is the least worst option, but because it is the only option, given that 90% of the European budget is now financed by the national budgets."
"The fact is, half of the Member States are in serious deficit and the other half do not see why they should pay on behalf of mismanaged countries."
"The time has therefore come to reform the system of resources that sustain the European budget."
"Our Parliament is working on practical proposals, and we have been doing so with the help of the national parliaments for nearly a year."
"Last week’s interparliamentary conference made it possible to hold an initial, encouraging debate on the diagnosis, schedule and scope of the reform."
"The diagnosis is virtually unanimous."
"The current system is regarded everywhere as anti-EU, unjust and totally incomprehensible to Europeans."
"As regards the schedule, the consensus is that the 2008-2009 meeting must be used as an opportunity to reach a political agreement on the practical arrangements for a reform."
"As regards the scope, opinion remains very divided."
"There are the masochists who suffer as a result of the system, but who like to suffer."
"There are the moderates, who want to retain the principles of the current system. There are the ambitious ones, who are more open to more radical changes."
"There are, however, two common recommendations: on the one hand, not to bring the Member States’ fiscal sovereignty into question and, on the other hand, to protect taxpayers against further tax increases: the principles of sovereignty and of cost neutrality."
"A further meeting is scheduled with the national parliaments’ committees on budgets for 21 June."
"Our aim is to succeed at least in bringing the points of view close enough together so that the Commission might take its inspiration from the proposals put to it for 2008."
"– Mr President, I would like to follow Mr Lamassoure in concentrating on the reform of the financing system."
"The one we have at present is unworkable, unfair, lacking in transparency and is no longer sustainable."
"One of the things we regard as essential is that this House should be involved in the 2008/2009 reform process."
"I am grateful to those who have negotiated on our behalf."
"We need a new system, one that the public can understand and that is also fair, an objective system to replace the net payers, net recipients and rebates that we have at present; it will probably be a proportion of a tax levied in all the Member States."
"Secondly, there is the period for which the Financial Perspective will apply, which we want to see brought into line with the period for which Parliament is elected; five years, in other words, instead of seven."
"There would be a closer connection between policies and the means by which they are funded, and so better democratic control and greater transparency would be possible."
"My third point is that I think it is a good thing that we have transitional rules for the advent of the Constitution, which I do of course see as desirable, since it will strengthen Parliament’s prerogatives."
"It is good that item 4 makes preparatory arrangements for that event."
"I also think it is worth mentioning that financial control of the EU’s external policies has been improved; that is normally a prerogative of the executive, so that parliaments have no part in it, but this budget has enabled us to get a foot in the door, and things that usually escape our grasp – such as the decentralised agencies and the European Schools – are included in this agreement."
"Thank you, Mr Böge; thank you, Mr Sousa Pinto."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take my turn in thanking Mr Lewandowski and the rapporteur, Mr Böge, together with Mr Mulder and Mr Walter, who, for more than a year, have conducted the very difficult negotiations with the Member States, in order to define our Union’s budgetary resources."
"Europe needs more than ever to devote significant resources to structural cohesion policies, as well as to policies focused on innovation, research and SMEs – in short, to policies that will support the emergence of a People's Europe and the spread of Europe’s influence in the world."
"The proposals presented by our Parliament in June 2005 enabled this ambitious policy to materialise."
"I must confess to you my disappointment, as the compromise that we have just obtained following long-term efforts is still singularly lacking in ambition and inspiration and, although our Parliament succeeded in forcing the Council to review the unacceptable amounts it was proposing last December, the progress made by the Member States falls far short of Europe's real needs, which we all hoped to see fulfilled."
"While the budget compromise is acceptable in its form because it complies with the Council’s policy choice, the fact remains that, in terms of content, the Member States’ ambitions are half-hearted, they are timid and, above all, they fall very far short of meeting the challenges of our society."
"That is why, albeit with a slightly heavy heart, I will be voting in favour of this compromise because, no matter what happens, I want Europe to continue to make progress."
"When the path is narrow and steep, it is better to move forward in small steps than not to move forward at all."
"Moreover, it is with great determination that I now await this meeting, which will enable us to renegotiate a real proactive policy in 2008, with renewed government teams and with our aspiration for Europe firmly instilled in us, and which will enable us to exercise …"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote at the European Parliament will adopt the interinstitutional agreement reached on the Financial Framework for the 2007-2013 period."
"This will be one of the most significant and far-reaching votes in this part-session."
"The interinstitutional agreement reached provides for a sum of EUR 864 billion for the next Financial Framework, or 1.05% of the European Union’s total national revenue."
"This is significantly less than the amount originally supported by the European Parliament, and as a result it will be necessary to reduce the amount of funding available for strengthening EU competitiveness, for science and trans-European networks and for EU regional policy, as well as for other areas."
"Unfortunately, at Council the tone of the debate was set by six countries whose only goal was to reduce the amount of expenditure in the EU Financial Framework to 1% of the European Union’s GNI."
"The compromise reached, however, has various positive features."
"Firstly, there is the flexible approach to setting a ceiling on amounts to be received from EU funds, as advocated by the European Parliament in its resolution."
"As a result, Latvia and Estonia have been allocated additional resources from EU funds over and above the ceilings laid down, and Lithuania has been allocated additional resources in order to deal with programmes connected with the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant."
"Secondly, there is the calculation of the ceilings, using each Member State’s individual economic growth forecast."
"Thirdly, there is the agreement to allow the use of Structural Funds resources for accommodation projects."
"The limit of 2% of total Structural Funds resources, which is identical for all the new Member States, is, however, difficult to understand."
"For example, it is obvious that heating homes is a much more urgent issue in countries with a harsher climate, such as Estonia and Latvia, than in southern countries such as Cyprus and Malta."
"Therefore, this unified approach is unjustified."
"Fourthly, there is the gradual replacement of the n + 2 rule with the n + 3 rule."
"Of course, the application of such a rule to the Cohesion Fund is still open to doubt."
"This agreement, however, is extremely necessary, first and foremost for the new Member States, and for that reason the European Parliament displayed a flexible attitude to the total amount of EU funds."
"– Mr President, I keep on hearing today that we are supposed to be approving a compromise."
"The usual practice when a compromise has been reached is to talk about whether the glass is half full or half empty, but that is not the case today, and that is why this so-called compromise will get no support from the Austrian Social Democrats."
"As the previous speaker mentioned, we are facing a backward movement in policies at national level."
"What was inherently wrong with these negotiations on finances was that six Heads of State or Government had said we could have more Europe, and achieve more European objectives, with less money, but that does not work – it does not work back home, and it does not work in Europe."
"All you need to do is flick through the newspapers."
"Yesterday morning’s headline in the Austrian was ‘EU fails to meet its own education targets’."
"There are six million young people leaving school without qualifications, and, on top of that, the figures for lifelong learning are 42% down on what Parliament proposed."
"It is quite clear from this that things are out of joint."
"Assuming we get a majority this lunchtime, we will be assuming joint responsibility for a budget on which we have not made our mark."
"Much as I respect our negotiators – who are outstanding and I really do want to congratulate them – the difference that they have managed to make over the last few months amounts, in terms of the total amount of this seven-year budget, to something like 0.2%."
"That is what the directly-elected European Parliament has managed to do with a budget like this one."
"It is not enough; the glass is not half full – it is empty."
"That is why I hope that many Members of this House will refuse to give their endorsement to this Financial Perspective."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would just like to start by saying what a joy it is to see that these negotiations have managed to turn the decision by 25 Heads of State or Government – which was more an expression of the intergovernmental Europe – into a European resolution, and to say how very grateful I am to them for that."
"I also believe that it has, slowly and surely, become evident to the Member States that Europe cannot function on the basis of nobody paying in and everyone drawing out, and that, on the contrary, a rational balance must be found between the Member States’ demands for the funding they think Europe should provide, and what they themselves are willing to make available in terms of resources."
"Negotiations with this House’s delegation made it quite clear what is at stake here, and what we have achieved together is a great triumph."
"That having been said, though, I would like to say in plain terms that the Interinstitutional Agreement that we will – I hope – adopt today, provides us ourselves with an array of possibilities in terms of how we can help to ensure that European taxpayers’ money is handled carefully and properly."
"There is just one issue I want to highlight and that is the great European disease of ‘agencyolism’ – the compulsion to keep on creating new agencies."
"We have now taken that function out of the Council’s hands; under the Interinstitutional Agreement, Parliament’s consent is always required."
"We are now the doctors who can grapple with this sickness within the Council, and we should take the use of these instruments very seriously."
"I believe that by doing so, we will add more European value than if we were to leave it in the hands of the Council and its secretive meetings."
"Mr President, may I add my congratulations to Mr Berger and the Parliament team, particularly Mr Walter."
"They all worked very hard through difficult and drawn-out negotiations to achieve this agreement."
"I firmly believe that, given the circumstances, the best and most sensible deal was brokered."
"Parliament was right to push Member States to put more resources behind the ambitious programmes that all the governments and political leaders have signed up to."
"But, more importantly, the negotiations have had key outcomes, non-financial gains that add value and will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future budgets."
"Let me highlight just three: the reinforcement of Member States' responsibility to improve expenditure control in order to achieve a positive Court of Auditor's statement, an improvement in the execution of EU programmes and an effective input from Parliament into the budgetary review in 2008."
"The best course of action for now is to focus on this 2008 budgetary review."
"In it we must reform the structure of the budget from head to toe – deconstruct it to build a new improved framework that reflects the needs and expectations of the EU of 2014."
"One reason we had so many problems in getting agreement on future financing was that the Commission missed an opportunity to address the root problem of the current financial framework, namely the lack of flexibility."
"I therefore urge the Commission not to miss the boat again."
"Now we must build an EU financial framework that demonstrates transparency, one that is rigorous and displays solidarity."
"It has to be free from the legacies of the past; a framework that must combine the visions of over 27 Member States and is flexible enough to face future challenges."
"Mr President, Mr Grasser, Mrs Grybauskaitė, I should like to begin by addressing my colleague, Mr Böge, and sincerely thanking him for his outstanding work."
"Unfortunately, we are faced with a minimum Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Mr Böge, you were no longer able to do anything when, before you at the Council, there stood up the champions of a policy that I would describe as a deceptive policy, which pretends to propose a budget to Europeans that is in keeping with the declarations trumpeted by the Heads of State or Government in front of the media."
"Young people must benefit from more Erasmus scholarships, but we note that there is not an adequate budget for this."
"The Council declares that we need more Europe if we are to sustain regional funding, but does not want to commit itself on the matter."
"This deceptive policy makes people believe in the Union having its own sources of finance, but any notion of a European tax would mean Europe being severely criticised."
"Nevertheless, this budget does focus somewhat on research and on the European transport networks, such as the Lyon-Turin project."
"Yet, what have become of the ambitions for Galileo as a result?"
"Where are the funds that were supposed to encourage our SMEs to set up in international markets?"
"What have you done with the rural development fund?"
"With this agreement, a revision of which is already planned for 2008 - it is really most regrettable that we should be obliged, today, to put our hopes in this future revision – a coat of paint is being given to the front door of Europe House, but everything else is being neglected."
"This is the budget of hypocrisy."
"Under these circumstances, I will vote in favour of this minimum agreement because I am genuinely obliged to do so, but it will be with a heavy heart that I give you my vote."
"Mr President, the Interinstitutional Agreement contains a proposal to review the financial framework in 2008/2009."
"This is a step in the right direction, but only if the European Parliament is involved in this task, and under the best possible conditions."
"A further issue is that the future financial framework must be established for a five-year period."
"Each successive Parliament and each Commission must have the right to vote on the financial priorities of their term."
"It is particularly important to us, or in other words Parliament, because it is Parliament’s Members who, on behalf of the citizens of the European Union, make financial decisions and are later held to account for them."
"It is, therefore, a positive sign that the European Constitution wants to change that."
"In Article 402 it proposes that the multiannual financial framework should be established for a period of – and I quote – ‘at least five years’."
"To conclude, I would like to say that we all want a financial system which will be fair to both the old and the new members of the European Union."
"We want a system that will be transparent and that will give the EU an opportunity to fulfil its aims by using its own resources rather than by using the financial contributions of the Member States."
"Finally, I would like to say that those who do not like this budget should consider the following well-known saying: ‘If you do not get what you like, you have to like what you get.’"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the speeches made by my fellow Members highlight the great difficulties we are having in moving away from the ‘glass-half-empty or half-full’ attitude."
"Many Members have seen the glass as ‘half-full'; many others have seen it as half-empty."
"Yet, what is the one significant political action, aside from the partial results on each budget chapter, that makes us realise that this is a good result?"
"I believe that it is a political result, in the sense that Parliament has shown itself to be active and capable of relaunching an intergovernmental decision and of turning it into a decision with a European outlook."
"We owe our gratitude for this both to Mr Böge and the negotiating team and to all those who have demonstrated that they are constructively concerned about the future of a generation."
"Allow me, in that connection, to highlight the fact that the positive outcome of this political initiative can also be seen in the set of rules that accompany the budget outturn and that will allow for access to Community programmes in such a way as to ensure sound financial management."
"In my capacity as rapporteur for the trans-European networks, moreover, I must stress that these networks represent one of the key factors in achieving the European Union’s targets for economic growth and employment, as identified in the Lisbon Agenda."
"I would therefore emphasise the need for Community resources to be used primarily on cross-border sections with high European added value, and subsequently call upon the Member States to make a commitment regarding the national sections of the networks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, voting in favour of this financial perspective would mean going back on one’s decision and not providing Europe with the resources for its ambitions."
"In June 2005, virtually the whole of Parliament voted in favour of a budget of EUR 974 billion."
"This, in order to make a success of enlargement and of a policy of active growth and of support for research, thereby preparing for the future."
"Today, the same people are preparing to vote in favour of the financial perspective, which has been slashed by EUR 110 billion."
"Would you believe it? I challenge anyone to understand that."
"To vote in favour of that would be tantamount to believing that a two-speed form of enlargement exists: that of the past, which, in the South, enabled Greece, Portugal and Spain fully to develop; and that of the present, which, in the East, inspires a debate that is all the more grandiloquent because it conceals the fact that there is insufficient financing."
"On every side of this House, I will make a bet with you that, month after month, year after year, report after report, we will have to suffer the long litany of regrets at having an insufficient budget, but it will be too late."
"It is now that the European Parliament must confirm that it is the driving force behind European life."
"To quote the words of the Bolivian President, Mr Evo Morales Ayma, who visited us here the day before yesterday: ‘let us not lie, let us not be weak, let us be strong, let us not accept a financial perspective that is a cut-price financial perspective'."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Grasser, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are those among us who voted against the December summit decision with greater passion than they are able to summon up today for what has emerged from these tough negotiations."
"We would probably have enjoyed greater short-term popularity in the eyes of very many observers if we had said ‘no’."
"The lead stories in some of the media on 5 or 6 April would probably have been along the lines of ‘Parliament shows teeth: Council rebuffed’, but would we then really have achieved more in terms of European goals, more for Europe’s people, more for a better Budget, or more for an effective European Union?"
"Those are the questions that we – every one of us – must ask ourselves today."
"If we do not effectively discharge our responsibilities; if the institutions are unwilling to work together; if there is no agreement with Parliament; and if we do not give our assent today, then there will be no security to plan ahead for a period of years, no interinstitutional agreement, no greater scope for manoeuvre for us to use in the annual budget negotiations, no review clause and no improved consultation on the programmes and the monitoring of them."
"Every one of us must consider whether there really would, without our consent, be an extra EUR 800 million for education, EUR 400 more for the CIP programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, an extra EUR 100 million for social policy, EUR 300 million more for the cohesion fund, EUR 200 million more for Natura 2000, and so on and so forth."
"It is precisely because our agreement has mobilised an additional EUR 7.9 billion that it needs, in the interests of the European Union, to be supported."
"– Mr President, the compromise by the European Council on the financial perspectives was inconsistent with the needs of the peoples of Europe and the objectives of the European Union."
"It has, unfortunately, retained the 1% doctrine which pins the budget of the enlarged Europe of the 25 at the level of the budget of the Union of the 15 Member States."
"With Parliament's negotiation, a marginal improvement was achieved which, despite the fact that it is a far cry from the real financial needs of the Union, safeguards a minimal level of continuity in the financing of Community policies."
"It is clear, however, that – within the framework set from the beginning by the governments – the mindset which prevails in the Council is a short-term, restrictive, accounting and administrative mindset."
"The question therefore raised today goes beyond the debate on the future budget."
"It relates to the very credibility of Europe in the eyes of the citizens."
"In other words, if the European Union continues to set objectives, without safeguarding in practical terms the means and political will to implement them, then the lack of confidence on the part of the citizens will increase constantly."
"Today a different European strategy is needed which will effectively promote development, employment, solidarity and social cohesion without discrimination but with prospects."
"– Mr President, Mr Böge deserves warm congratulations on his contribution."
"With him as coordinator, we were able to achieve continuation in the financial resources for programmes that expired this year and we gave guarantees for more comfortable margins for manoeuvre in what was until today a completely inflexible budget, so that the launching of new initiatives and the immediate response to emergencies are compatible with the perspectives."
"The Böge report also helps to improve the quality of the implementation of the budget: internal control, the facility to transfer appropriations using the flexibility instrument and legislative flexibility."
"Mainly, however, we secured the 2009 review with our full involvement in the review process."
"In 2009 the question of the need for there to be a new own resources system will also be raised again intensely, in order to find the new financial 'fuel' to speed up the development of the Union's policies."
"I refer in particular to the need to implement the Lisbon Strategy, especially the aspect of the Lisbon Strategy for which, at the level of research and innovation, much was promised by the prime ministers, but little was delivered to the citizens of Europe."
"Where possible, Mr Böge reconciled our political priorities with the Union's financial requirements."
"However, all together, with our systematic work in the Committee on Budgets, we basically achieved something else."
"We managed, in the overriding 1% problem and with the help of all our colleagues, to overcome the Commission's set trend, which the Council has always favoured, thereby giving the European Union albeit one part of the original financial strength that it deserves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement that has been reached is not the one that we would have hoped for, despite the fact that Parliament fought with dignity for a more satisfactory budget."
"If progress has been made – and it has – it is only thanks to Parliament, its negotiating team and the rapporteur."
"The Council must assume full responsibility before Europeans for a short-sighted and miserly outlook, which is concerned only with balancing the books of the national budgets and not with making Europe great and powerful."
"We are satisfied, however, because the agreement provides a number of positive solutions and confirms that the programmes will start on 1 January 2007."
"The thorny issue of reforming the financing of the budget remains unresolved."
"We need a thorough reform of the structure and procedures, which is divorced from the mercantile ‘give and take’ approach and inspired by genuine pro-European ideas."
"No public institution has lasted for long without having a direct link with its citizens through taxation."
"Mr President, recently the European Union has experienced a number of significant defeats, the greatest being the rejection by certain countries of the Constitutional Treaty."
"The consequences of this are being felt ever more painfully."
"Have we learnt nothing?"
"Should the period of reflection not spur us on to take a more critical view of our Union?"
"Judging by the financial perspective being discussed today, this has not happened."
"In spite of the interinstitutional agreement which has been concluded, and which we know is the best possible solution, the European Council does not understand the needs of the Union."
"We are supposedly the citizens of the same countries, but we have such a different view of our needs."
"Could it be that the statesmen who represent our countries want to create political capital through financial limitations?"
"Have they achieved this?"
"Judging by some of them, perhaps not, but it does give us food for thought."
"We should think about whether the effects of this financial perspective, which is not satisfactory for either side, will be as keenly felt in two years as the lack of the Constitutional Treaty."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rejoice in this brief opportunity to reflect once more on the debate, and there are just two points that I would like to consider."
"Certain Members of your House who negotiated with us – Mr Mulder and Mr Walter among them – have said that your House believes it has succeeded in getting the most out that it could."
"The negotiations were tough, and what could be achieved was achieved;"
"I can do no other than confirm that your House, quite rightly, gave us, the Presidency, a difficult time during the negotiations in terms of the pressure it piled on in order, quite understandably, to achieve the best possible outcomes."
"To those who have now described this compromise as not good enough and stated their intention of voting against it on the grounds that they believe it does nothing to make European goals achievable, I would like to put a question. What, then, would be the consequence of our failing to agree on a compromise in this matter, if we had not, together, managed to resolve the issue of the Inter-Institutional Agreement and of the Financial Perspective?"
"Would that – as someone said – have been something that would win us back the confidence of the public?"
"What would have been the result of that?"
"We know perfectly well that failure to complete in good time would have meant that the new Member States would have been unable to claim sufficient money from the Structural and Cohesion Funds, that we would have been unable to put in place the necessary legal bases, and that we would have been unable to run the programmes in the various Member States."
"It follows, then, that failure on our part, failure to achieve this compromise, would have sent the worst imaginable message about Europe’s capacity to act effectively, and would also have given the public the wrong idea about us."
"It is clear, then, that, when we are dealing with something as complex as a seven-year financial perspective or an interinstitutional agreement that has to be negotiated by the three institutions that are vital to Europe – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – no one party’s position must be allowed to prevail, but we can all send out a message."
"Together, we have found the best possible solution for Europe, and that was what we were tasked to do."
"To all those who said that we should improve control, and that there was not enough transparency, I can give the assurance that I really do regard it as vital that we should, over the coming months and years, do everything possible to improve monitoring for the sake of greater transparency."
"It is vital that our taxpayers, Europe’s citizens, should be able to see that we are careful with money, that we conceal nothing and that we are trying to prevent abuses."
"This is our unconditional commitment to them that the Council, too, wants to improve monitoring."
"So let me once again extend the warmest of thanks to your House's negotiating team and to the Commissioner and her own team, while also asking you to give your approval to this compromise."
". Mr President, we all listened and debated today."
"We can say that we reached the point where historic events can happen."
"Today is a historic day for the Chamber, a historic day for the enlarged Europe."
"It is also a historic day for the Presidency, which can say: 'If you support this agreement, the Presidency has been very successful'."
"I would like to invite you to vote positively today, to send a message to Europeans that Europe can be safe, can be financed and can start to work."
"Today, this decision is in your hands."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, the new financial perspective is a compromise."
"Is it a good compromise?"
"Some earlier proposals would doubtless have been better for Europe and its future."
"Financially speaking, the European Union is not as strong as it could have been if we had managed to reach a consensus on a larger budget."
"In Polish there is a saying that ‘if you do not get what you like, you have to like what you get’."
"Today it seems that this compromise is a success."
"However, we will only find out after 2013 whether it will be viewed as equally successful in the future."
"At that point we will have to look at the level of cohesion in the European Union, the extent to which the European economy is competitive, the level of unemployment and the state of the education system and of scientific research."
"It is difficult to reach a universal consensus with regard to basic budget priorities."
"I am convinced that an important dimension of European solidarity is practical solidarity in the form of cohesion policy."
"The quality of the implementation of this financial perspective will determine whether the European Union’s biggest enlargement to date, in 2004, will be fully exploited and completed."
"I hope that this will indeed happen and that no one will have any doubts that the return of 10 countries to the European family was right and beneficial not only to those countries, but also to all Europeans."
"Europe will be greater and more powerful at a relatively low price."
"The financial perspective, totalling EUR 864 316 billion in commitment appropriations, is the disappointing outcome of a compromise between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, which have undermined the European spirit and threatened to render the Union powerless."
"The Union of 27 will have a smaller relative budget for 2007-2013 than that of the Europe of 15."
"Even though the financing of the CAP is being safeguarded and the budget devoted to SMEs seems to be enhanced, the Galileo project, the trans-European transport networks, research, regional policy, education and training and culture will be sacrificed."
"The rigour imposed on the national budgets did not permit an increase in national contributions, which explains why MEPs gave their approval to this compromise."
"This budget, which is unjust and complex and which no longer makes it possible to finance future policies, must be reformed."
"A form of financing based on own resources must be adopted, with the latter being fixed so as to provide the EU with full budgetary autonomy."
"These resources would be equitable, transparent, controlled by democratic procedures and in compliance with the principle of cost neutrality."
"The revision of the Community budget, which is scheduled for 2008, must enable us to carry out this reform – which can be done without amending the basic treaties – by means of an agreement between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, acting on the basis of unanimity."
"Today’s vote is particularly important for the European Union as a whole, because it spells the end of two years of complex negotiations that have seen MEPs committed to defending a future budget based on an overall vision and on a European, rather than national, outlook, with a great sense of political responsibility and perspective."
"We are concerned here with negotiations that I have had the opportunity to follow closely as a member of the first temporary committee, which was set up on an ad hoc basis in order to draft the European Parliament's proposal aimed at strengthening the cohesion policy and guaranteeing an optimal level of financing so as to enable the necessary reforms to fulfil the ambitions of the European Union and its citizens, whom we represent."
"The European Parliament has succeeded in adopting a budget that reconciles political priorities with financial constraints, and in updating its structure and improving the way in which it is executed."
"The result of today’s vote is a financial perspective that presents some new and highly desirable elements, such as the increase in spending options, greater flexibility in terms of management, and the priorities relating to the trans-European networks and to the programmes focused on strengthening youth exchanges, on the common foreign and security policy and on the neighbourhood policy."
"The next item is the vote."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as President of the Council, I would like to thank you warmly for this overwhelming vote."
"If you think back, it was a year ago that the great crisis occurred, with the failure of a financial proposal from the Luxembourg Presidency – a proposal, I might add, that was not all that far removed from the one we have adopted today, and so I would like to take this opportunity to say a very big thank you to Jean-Claude Juncker, who deserved to see this day in his presidency."
"It is as partners that we have resolved this crisis."
"Parliament has not merely bared its teeth, but has put forward simple and practical ideas and suggestions."
"All in all, we now, with the new Financial Perspective, have, for the period of seven years, some 70% more money for the competition goals as per the Lisbon agenda, but we also, and in particular, have 60% more for small and medium-sized enterprises, while, moreover, hundreds of thousands more students than over the past seven years can avail themselves of the Erasmus programme."
"I am particularly glad that we have made provision for the costs of enlargement."
"Over the next seven years, we will, in total, be making EUR 160 billion available, and that includes to Bulgaria and Romania; in terms of monetary value, that is twice as much as the post-war Marshall Plan for the whole of Europe."
"Proud though your House can be of this resolution, it might well be that the accession costs of the ten Member States ought to have been included at the same time, and then we would have had an easier time of it with this Financial Perspective."
"This should be a lesson to us to do this better in future."
"Our original intention was to sort out practical projects in order to restore public confidence in us."
"This Financial Perspective is the same sort of practical project as the infrastructure costs directive, the European driving licence and the joint resolution to desist from using the Structural Funds to promote the relocation of workplaces or jobs to new Member States."
"This, too, is a most significant step forward."
"We will continue down this road in the remaining weeks that are left to the Austrian Presidency."
"I hope that you will be cooperative and rely on your being so."
"We will meet again in June, when we will be discussing the future of Europe."
"I wish you all the best, and thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"The Commission does not wish to speak, but I believe that it is essential for Parliament, via its President, to supplement the words of the other Budgetary Authority."
"This Agreement fully demonstrates Parliament's role as budgetary authority and makes it clear that an agreement within the Council is not sufficient to provide the Union with a financial perspective, but that this Parliament also needs to be present."
"Parliament has been present following a long and difficult process, which has led to an agreement which many Members consider to be a minimal agreement, and this is reflected in the vote."
"This is certainly a minimal agreement, but it allows the Union to function and does not add any further problems to the ones we already have."
"Parliament would like to thank you, Mr Böge — you and all of your negotiating team — for the work you have done on its behalf."
"I would therefore like to express our thanks to Mr Lewandowski, Mr Böge, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder, but I would also like to say that, for many Members I would insist it is the maximum we could have achieved."
"Nevertheless, this maximum represents a minimum in terms of many of the Union's expressed ambitions."
"In accordance with the financial perspective, the European Union costs EUR 0.72 per day for each European."
"Surely that is not excessive, given what the Union achieves."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that Parliament takes a positive view of your initiative of talking about the Union's own resources and that, at the inter-parliamentary meeting on 8 and 9 May, all of the Parliaments of the Union took the same view."
"There is no question that we will not be able to negotiate the next financial perspective in the way we have negotiated this one, that the system has been stretched to its limits, and that, by then, we will have to find new methods so that we can continue to move forward."
"I would also like to address my thanks to Mr Lewandowski and all of the members of the Committee on Budgets and I would urge all of you to take an active part in the work of revising this perspective in 2008 and 2009."
"President Papoulias, our Parliament welcomes you today as a man of peace and a person committed to European integration."
"It is an honour to have you here. You are the third President of the Hellenic Republic to visit us, but the last one was here 18 years ago."
"I would like to highlight certain aspects of your personality, firstly pointing out that the two great political families in Greece have been united in elevating you to the top office of State."
"It is rare for all political parties to support one great personality."
"The fact that you have the support of the whole political spectrum demonstrates that you are recognised as a man of moderation, of ethical responsibility and of prudence."
"In fact, in Greece you are thought of as the ‘personification of prudence’."
"It is also a recognition of your early fight for freedom, your early fight against Nazism, which, given your age, must have been at a time when your rifle was taller than you, and then, subsequently, your fight to restore democracy to your country during the era of the military dictatorship."
"It is also a recognition of your ceaseless quest for peace along the borders of your country with your most immediate neighbours, in the Balkans and also in the Middle East."
"The President of the Palestinian Authority was with us yesterday and I believe that we should remember today that, thanks to your intervention in 1983, many Palestinians were able to leave Lebanon at a dramatic time, entirely safely, aboard Greek ships which you made available in your capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"I must also point to your constant concern for dialogue with the Muslim world, which is undoubtedly the most important challenge facing Europe, and your will to bring the two flanks of the Mediterranean closer together, an aim that this Parliament fully shares."
"Mr President, you were born in Ioannina, the capital of a beautiful region, as anybody who has been lucky enough to visit it will confirm."
"Ioannina has a place in Europe’s living history, since it was there, before the enlargement to fifteen Member States, that, under your direction, the Union’s Ministers for Foreign Affairs reached a memorable agreement that facilitates decision-making."
"It would be a good thing if we could continue to achieve commitments such as the one achieved in Ioannina in order to carry on making the difficult process of decision-making easier, no longer amongst fifteen Members, but now amongst twenty-five, and soon amongst even more."
"There are now twenty-five of us, we will soon be twenty-seven, the Balkans are knocking at our door, and you have always pointed out that there will be no definitive peace in Europe and Europe will not have been fully reconstructed until the Balkans have been legally, politically and economically integrated into the Union."
"All international observers who have analysed your diplomatic missions have praised your qualities, and in particular, you are a man who stands by your word, who does as he speaks and who says what he thinks."
"This must also be a source of inspiration at this difficult time for Europe."
"Something that I am sure nobody knows, or few people know, is that the President of the Hellenic Republic visiting us today was a pole-vaulting champion in his youth."
"There is no question that Europe needs good pole-vaulters."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak about the future of Europe from this tribunal, which represents the most democratic institution of the European Union."
"Because its Members are elected directly, the European Parliament has the best possible credentials from the citizens of Europe and the clearest instructions to express their concerns and problems."
"I believe that its institutional role will be strengthened as the process of European integration progresses and I am convinced that this development is the natural way forward for our political culture, especially in times when the citizens of Europe feel insecure about their future and, often, remote from the decision-making centres."
"I should like to start with a personal comment: coming from the generation that suffered under Nazism, I experienced the Second World War first hand."
"This experience determined the start of the European way, an historic process with the attributes of a peace plan."
"Out of the ruins of war there was born the hope and the vision of a brotherhood of the peoples of Europe."
"This is an historic achievement which constitutes a model of stability in the global system."
"The path opened up by Jean Monnet in establishing specific forms of cooperation and avoiding ambitious theoretical schemes resulted in the creation of a union, the democratic, social and development model of which, despite its shortcomings, has rightly earned global admiration."
"The implementation of the European vision, which is still under way, is inevitably affected by international political and economic events."
"Globalisation, a monopole world, emergent economies, mass migration, the influence of non-institutional centres and the formulation of political decisions, the asymmetrical threat of international terrorism, environmental problems – combined with an insecure energy supply – are creating a complicated and fast-changing international environment which is creating both challenges and opportunities for the European Union."
"It is a state of affairs on which the citizens of Europe need to take an honest stand."
"While preparing the speech I am giving today, I browsed through the electronic dialogue with the citizens of Europe on the European Union's website."
"I read interesting views, mainly from people living in different countries, but who have the same concerns."
"The conclusion which I drew from this exercise is that the European Union is being called upon today to return to the principles of European enlightenment that inspired its beginnings."
"Freedom, equality and humanity are the high ideals which determine the content of the European idea and which need to be given meaning again today."
"Freedom is now a concept which is examined in conjunction with that of security."
"The citizens of Europe and everyone living in Europe do not want to feel threatened in a world suffering under international terrorism."
"At the same time, however, they reject compromises on the protection of individual rights and personal freedoms."
"We defend the doctrine of 'security and freedom', but not of 'security instead of freedom'."
"Equality is defined differently depending on the point of view from which you view the world."
"Immigrants are demanding equal treatment with the citizens of their host countries and, sometimes, their demand takes on dramatic proportions."
"The unemployed are demanding equal opportunities as regards the potential for a dignified life and people living in poverty are claiming the same access to health and education as high earners."
"Humanity is therefore the principle of European enlightenment which is nowadays proving to be the major demand of European societies and the major risk for the leaders of Europe."
"How can humanity be given meaning?"
"Some lessons from the long process of European unification already harbour historic truths."
"Development without social justice is meaningless."
"Prosperity without wellbeing is simply a contradiction."
"The European Union is currently going through a period of reflection, as the interval starting after the referenda on the European Constitution has been called."
"I would say that this period should mainly be a process of collective self-knowledge, a path which, if followed consistently and honestly, will bring us to a deeper definition and to the essence of the European Union itself, because the real question that needs to concern us is not technocratic; it is philosophical: what sort of Europe do we want?"
"What sort of world are we fighting for?"
"What is the vision we are trying to implement?"
"Is that vision utopian or a realistic ambition?"
"We have good reason to be optimistic."
"The European Union has proven its historic resistance and its attachment to its objectives."
"Frequently there are delays, other times there are retractions, sometimes there is lassitude, but still the road leads on."
"It leads on and does not stop and, most importantly of all, the citizens of Europe, despite any disappointments, continue to invest their hopes for a better life and a better world in the European idea."
"We consider a constituent element of the global process to be dialogue between cultures and, as we saw recently, a lack of understanding, trust and dialogue can have serious consequences, especially when there is cumulative indignation and a feeling of injustice."
"The recent enlargement of the European Union, with the accession of ten new Member States, caused a real shockwave to resound through Europe."
"The view prevailed then – and rightly so – that the cost of not enlarging would be greater than the cost of enlargement."
"Enlargement had an historic and a moral dimension."
"The accession of the states of central and Eastern Europe brought the division of the old continent to an end."
"The historic unity of all its peoples was restored in the face of a common destiny."
"Enlargement was certainly a very important development in the Union from the point of view of foreign relations too."
"Its geopolitical – and hence its strategic size – shifted significantly, giving weight to central Europe and making it a direct neighbour of the crucial area of the Middle East."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will be especially important, as will the prospects of the completion of Union in the Western Balkans at the next stage, once the conditions have been met."
"We welcome this strategic enlargement towards southeast Europe."
"My country and I personally, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, have played a leading part in its processing and adoption."
"As far as the accession procedure of Turkey is concerned, I should like to emphasise that my country is in favour of its integration."
"However it must be clear that entry to the Union depends on the full adoption of its principles and rules and that this is a non-negotiable rule of European civilisation which cannot be bent for the sake of any broader geopolitical expediencies."
"It is certain – and this affected the result of the referenda on the European Constitution – that geographical extension preceded political integration, and this has resulted in acute concerns, justified unease and, at times, disappointment."
"The answer to this disappointment cannot but be to speed up the rate of the political enlargement process."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union was built on the ruins of the Second World War."
"It was built as a force for peace and stability, prosperity and progress."
"At the end of the cold war, the final wall within Europe fell, apart from the Green Line, which continues to divide Cyprus in two, defining ..."
"... a major European problem which still awaits resolution."
"A Union of 25 Member States today, and more tomorrow, cannot exist and prosper except as an independent, strong and unified presence in the international system, with all that this implies."
"The war against Iraq revealed the split in the European Union in a dramatic fashion."
"There was not one voice, one decision or one direction; there was sterile confrontation and clear, dividing lines that injured the peoples of Europe."
"The cohesive fabric between the Member States cannot be just a common currency and a common flag; it must be a system of principles and values, a common political and social culture."
"The challenges are before us."
"The crisis of Iran's nuclear programme, the parallel energy crisis which is imminent and which may be worse than expected, terrorism, developments in the Balkans in the face of the finalisation of the status of Kosovo, conditions in Africa and the problem of AIDS are situations which require the European Union to articulate its own unified word and formulate its own strategy."
"We hope there will soon be stability in Iraq; the long-suffering Iraqi people are in real need of it."
"The resolution of the Palestinian problem, with a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine, in conjunction with stability in Iraq, will also restore the political geography of what is – from the energy point of view – a very crucial area, with which Europe has preferential, historic, political, cultural and commercial relations. I also consider it important that the European Union has decided to continue sending aid to the Palestinians, given that depriving them of it will only exacerbate the problems."
"As far as relations with Iran are concerned, we are categorically opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and, at the same time, we believe that full use must be made of the possibilities of diplomacy which, in my estimation, have not been exhausted, in order to reach agreement."
"This agreement is being sought by European and by all communities, which constantly send messages in favour of peace and dialogue between cultures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Lisbon Strategy is precisely to provide an answer to the concerns of Europeans relating to development, unemployment and social cohesion with financial prudence and respect for the social state."
"The objectives of this strategy have not been achieved through its implementation."
"To put it plainly, the Lisbon equation, which was correct in conception, continues to have elements of academic rhetoric as regards its implementation plan, a rhetoric which is attractive for the connoisseurs, but incomprehensible or contradictory to the average citizen."
"Often, the average citizen feels that he is living in Wittgenstein's nightmare."
"The words are used to hide the meaning."
"Let us not delude ourselves; it is clear that today, in the Union, there are two basic schools of thought as far as the implementation of the Lisbon objectives is concerned: the group that maintains that the development and the survival of the social state under conditions of globalisation can only be achieved with radical reforms of employment relations, and the group that considers that the Lisbon Strategy can be implemented under conditions of globalisation without abolishing the social state."
"I consider that differences of opinion are the basic privilege of democracy and hence the foundation stone of our Union."
"However, in order for there to be a synthesis of opinion, open dialectic is needed in European society, because it is the citizens who will give the ultimate answer while we, the politicians, will be responsible for conducting this necessary dialogue."
"Life is hard in much of Europe today."
"Despite the fight against unemployment, the minor successes achieved are not enough to combat this major problem."
"Instead of the numbers of jobs increasing, the unemployment and underemployment indicators are rising in several countries."
"Instead of the vulnerable groups of the population acquiring greater social protection, there are increasing masses of excluded persons."
"Instead of the quality of life improving for everyone, the dividing lines of the society of the two-thirds are deepening."
"Farmers worry about the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Young people agonise over jobs; and then worry about being sacked and having to find another job and, at the end, about their pensions and insurance."
"Workers worry about their jobs being moved outside Europe."
"The worst thing is that society has developed a deep distrust of the decision-making centres."
"The reason is obvious: there is a serious crisis of confidence between politicians and employment relation theoreticians."
"There is acute social insecurity."
"The fact is that no development strategy will bring about results unless it is people-orientated, unless it starts from the principle of protection for the weak and steers clear of international realities, as an area in which the operation of the market will not be the only regulatory factor,"
"unless it invests in the quality of education, research and the challenges of new technologies."
"This is not political romanticism."
"It is respect for the principles on which the European construct was founded: the principles of equality and solidarity."
"It is also political realism, because we have already seen not once, but several times, that when collective insecurity intensifies, when inequalities and exclusion worsen, social tensions manifest in extreme ways and have unforeseen consequences."
"As history has taught us, this can cause dangerous dynamics outside the political system."
"Human societies have passed through various stages of dominant economic theories."
"However, whenever the voice of the people was ignored, tensions and reversals swept away both theories and theoreticians."
"The future of Europe will be shaped by the citizens of Europe and will depend on their participation in public affairs, which is both necessary and desirable in a democracy."
"As Thucydides says in : 'Only those who take no part are regarded not as unambitious but as useless', describing with timeless accuracy the importance of active citizens to democracy."
"That was centuries ago and yet active citizens are still the alpha and the omega of how we define our course towards a Europe with a global mission, a Europe which will be not only a bastion of democracy and human rights, but also a standard for the right to work, development and social cohesion, a European Union which will be a superpower of humanity and the place in which I stand today, the European Parliament, has the supreme responsibility of making the voice of the citizen heard as clearly and as loudly as possible."
"Thank you very much for your words, Mr President."
"I am sure that they will serve the same purpose as the pole you used to vault with in your youth and will help us to overcome the obstacles facing European integration."
"You have referred to many of the problems that we have to resolve and to the role that the European Parliament must play in that regard."
"You may rest assured, Mr President, that this Parliament will honour your invitation and will be up to the task of resolving the difficulties facing us, through its democratic strength."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
". Mr President, I should like to add the following to the existing text of Amendment 10: ‘while fully respecting the Stability and Growth Pact’."
"In other words, the new text of Amendment 10 would read: ‘Encourages the use of the cyclically adjusted deficit concept in national budgetary procedures in order to reduce cyclicality, while fully respecting the Stability and Growth Pact;’."
"That concludes the vote."
". What clearly emerges from the answers given by the applicant Mr Stark to the questions put by the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is his acceptance of the monetary policy pursued by the European Central Bank, not least the ECB’s primary objective of price stability."
"This means that there will be no change of objectives, such as the inclusion of objectives relating to economic growth and employment."
"He also offered qualified support for the 1997 version of the Stability and Growth Pact, and has stated that the 2005 reform weakened the Pact."
"This monetarist, neoliberal blinkeredness, which panders to the profits of the large multinational companies operating in the EU and which places the workers – and their jobs, their rights and their salaries – as an adjustment variable during crises, is in keeping with its role in creating the single currency and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In addition, it should once again be noted that the new faces on the ECB Executive Board are exclusively from the large countries (one German replacing another). If one adds the rotation of votes on the Council, the small countries are being pushed to the margins when it comes to monetary decisions in the Economic and Monetary Union."
"Hence our vote against."
".The illegal copying of designs is one of the causes of counterfeiting."
"It constitutes a theft of the intellectual property of businesses, which distorts international trade rules and is responsible for the loss of around 100 000 jobs each year in the EU."
"It also constitutes a danger for consumers when counterfeit products may harm their health or compromise their safety."
"Lastly, it constitutes a source of fiscal and social fraud that places a strain on the Member States’ accounts."
"All the resources used to fight against this scourge must therefore be continually strengthened."
"Design protection – which characterises the creativity and innovation of businesses – is a crucial element of the battery of powers used to combat counterfeiting."
"Yet, the international registration of these designs is an often complicated and costly process, especially for SMEs."
"All the measures aimed at simplifying these procedures and at making savings will therefore encourage businesses to comply with them and will have a positive effect on research and innovation."
"Mr Rocard’s report on accession to the Geneva Act concerning the international registration of industrial designs is along these lines, and I therefore supported this report."
"– We have today voted in favour of Mr Sousa Pinto’s report on the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"The report states that the Interinstitutional Agreement that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have managed to reach is compatible with primary European law and the Treaties."
"It is a positive thing that we have finally reached a settlement on the EU’s long-term budget."
"At the same time, it is disappointing that no further progress was made in respect of the reform of the budget."
"We should have liked to have seen a thorough overhaul of the agreement on agricultural funding and a methodical reform of regional aid."
"More of the EU’s resources should be spent in areas such as research and fighting crime, poverty and climate change, as well as on work to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world."
"The reform of the budget must be kept to the fore when the agreed overhaul is due to take place in 2008/2009."
"There are also sections of the report that we would rather have done without."
"Amongst these we might mention what is known as the Globalisation Fund and the text relating to ‘own resources’."
"It is our opinion that it must continue to be the Member States that decide what resources the EU has at its disposal."
". We endorse the rejection of the interinstitutional agreement tabled by our parliamentary group and voted for by 120 Members of Parliament because, among other reasons, we oppose:"
"- a mindset that gradually turns every defeat into a mystifying ‘victory’ on the grounds that things could always be worse."
"- the blackmail perpetrated by the economically most highly developed EU Member States, the so-called ‘wealthy’ countries, which have imposed a relative reduction of the Community budget; this at a time when the EU has grown to include a further ten countries with an average level of economic development that is below the Community average and when preparations are under way for two more countries to join."
"- this is a process that increasingly favours supranational level decision-making on monetary, budgetary, economic and social policy – pandering to the interests of the economically most highly developed countries and the large economic and financial groups, which are concerned less and less with the rights, needs and aspirations of the workers and of the people of the various EU Member States – and that, at the same time, entirely predictably, reduces the financial resources that could help minimise the consequences of (unacceptable) capitalist competition between countries with very different levels of economic development."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot not support the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and on sound financial management, in particular."
"We must be aware, however, that supporting the European Council's decision on the review of the budget means starting to reduce spending, particularly if we aim to use the Union’s own resources rather than the Member States’ contributions."
"It will then be easier to do away with that percentage that Parliament overpays on the lease of its seat in Strasbourg, precisely because it appears to be an undue and unwarranted cost."
"We must also recognise that the review will include a reduction in workplaces and in the various trips that are sometimes made merely to boost the self-esteem of a specific individual."
"Although not exciting, the interinstitutional agreement must also be approved, and we approve of the fact that the negotiations have resulted in the political priorities and the financial requirements being combined."
"I wonder, however, whether the clear separation between an own resources budget and the provision of the Member States' contributions might not cause some technical problems in the financing of particular programmes, unless this separation is also applied to the programmes themselves and the political objectives to be achieved."
"We therefore hope for a great deal of clarity and transparency and for a clear and inflexible approach to separating expenditure and objectives."
"– Mr President, one particular reason why I gave my support to the Böge report was that it represents a landmark success on the part of this House in establishing that the European Union is social and educational in character."
"Whatever else may be said about it, we have succeeded, by negotiation, in getting EUR 800 million more for our young people, money that will make it possible for many young people within the European Union – we estimate that there will be hundreds of thousands more of them than last time – to get better education in another Member State and thereby protect themselves against unemployment."
".Europe is undergoing two kinds of crisis: an institutional one and a political one."
"It is imperative that a strong relationship of confidence be built up again between Europeans and their institutions."
"The first signal that political leaders have a duty to send out to their fellow citizens in order to restore that confidence is one of equipping themselves with a budget that lives up to their much touted ambitions."
"At a time when the EU is opening up to new countries and when we more than ever need a social and competitive Europe and one that is strong in the world, the budget now proposed to us is unacceptable."
"The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, progress in terms of research and development, education and training, external aid in the fields of development and cooperation, transnational infrastructure projects, and sufficient Structural Funds and a sufficient Cohesion Fund to demonstrate the necessary solidarity with the new countries: all of that will only be achieved to a minimal extent."
"Moreover, any new policy is out of the question and any recovery unthinkable – this budget symbolises inflexibility and a desire to give in."
"That is why I cannot vote in favour of the financial perspective. It overlooks the European interest to the advantage of national self-interests and disappoints our nations with regard to Europe’s future."
". The British Conservative group acknowledge the benefits of the interinstitutional agreement and in particular applaud the provision for the parliament to take a more influential role in the 2008-2009 review."
"We also warmly welcome the requirement for the national authorities to accept greater accountability for the money they spend."
"We would point out; however, that the compromise deal struck between the parties fails to adequately address the problems that confront the European Union today."
"In particular it has missed a rare opportunity to alter the political priorities and instead has continued to fund the traditional spending programmes."
"I voted in favour of the European Union’s financial perspective for the years 2007 to 2013 on the basis of the Böge report, and I did so having borne in mind the long, painful and arduous negotiations that have taken place since the first half of 2005."
"I did so not because I believe that this is the best or the least worst budget but because it is the only budget possible and so as not to side with those who would not have hesitated to exacerbate the crisis that the European Union is undergoing by creating a budgetary crisis that neither our fellow citizens nor the new Member States that joined in 2004 would have understood."
"I must point out that it is not the European Union that is in financial crisis but the Member States, some of which are on the verge of bankruptcy as a result of having spectacularly mismanaged their national public finances."
"We really need to get over this issue of the UK rebate, which has been poisoning European relations for too long."
"Lastly, I am delighted that this agreement, together with the 2008/2009 review clause, paves the way for the crucial reform of the European Union’s finances, which is becoming a crucial and urgent stage in European integration."
". In the negotiations about the financial perspectives covering the period between 2007-2013, Parliament has managed to add another EUR 4 billion to the EU budget."
"This additional amount is unjustified, because those extra resources will benefit forms of policy that cannot be regarded as part of the EU’s core tasks."
"Just as I stated earlier, this House pays no more than lip service to the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement contains valid points in terms of improving the management of the EU budget and the more effective combating of irregularities and fraud – areas in which the Member States have their own responsibility to shoulder."
"I am expressly opposed to resources being set aside for the globalisation fund, the flexibility instrument, the solidarity fund and perhaps also for European schools."
".I abstained from voting because I cannot accept the fact that the budget for research over the next three years has not increased in real terms, even though the Lisbon process and the declarations of the Heads of State or Government rightly consider research to be a key priority for Europe."
"We have today voted in favour of Mr Böge’s report on the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline."
"It is important that a settlement has finally been reached on the EU’s long-term budget."
"We are, however, critical of the support in the report for what is known as the Globalisation Fund."
"Globalisation entails great opportunities for the Member States of the European Union and, insofar as it poses any challenges, these are best dealt with by the Member States themselves."
"Furthermore, we reject the proposal in the report that the EU should have its own resources instead of relying on the contributions of the Member States."
"It must be for the Member States to decide what resources the Union has at its disposal."
"Any form of EU taxation would be a departure from this principle."
".I voted in favour of the Böge report because the absence of an agreement on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 could undermine the European Union’s work as from next year."
"I should like to pay tribute to Parliament’s negotiators led by Mr Böge, who obtained an extra EUR 4 billion for important initiatives in the fields of competitiveness, education, research and youth exchanges."
"I deeply regret the fact that the Council did not agree to grant more resources to European farmers, particularly in the field of rural development, in which a sum amounting to EUR 20 billion less than that proposed by the Commission will be made available."
"I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to remind the Council of its obligations to ensure that the principles of the 2003 CAP reform are respected."
"I am completely opposed to the Council proposal on voluntary modulation, which transfers 20% of direct aid to rural development without the obligation of cofinancing."
"A system of that kind is unacceptable, given that it could create an imbalance in the market and could constitute a first step towards the renationalisation of the CAP."
". It is with but little enthusiasm that I have voted to approve the financial perspectives and the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Whilst the budget lacks ambition, we would, without this agreement, be unable to offer the new Member States any prospects at all."
"Moreover, the many programmes would be at risk of grinding to a halt."
"A new crisis resulting from rejecting the financial perspectives would represent a huge blow to the European Union."
".Like the French Socialists, I voted against the Böge report, which ratifies the interinstitutional agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspective."
"In January, our Parliament rejected a budget that it regarded back then as mediocre, believing that it was not enough to provide employment, growth, research and the major trans-European networks with the financial levers they require."
"On 6 March, the Committee on Budgets, for its part, unanimously adopted a resolution denouncing this financial perspective, in the hope that the negotiations between the Commission, the Council and Parliament would result in a budget that was more in keeping with Parliament’s wishes."
"The budget is still not large enough now, and the budgetary wrangling needed to satisfy the justifiable and ever-increasing demands aimed at financing all of the EU policies will be very difficult over the next few years."
"We shall have to explain to Europeans that this tight budget is down to the intransigence of the Heads of State or Government, who did not want to grant the Union the resources for its ambitions."
". We have today voted in favour of Mr Böge’s report on the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline."
"The report approves the budgetary and financial consequences of the agreement which the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have managed to reach."
"It is a positive thing that we have finally reached a settlement on the EU’s long-term budget."
"At the same time, it is disappointing that no further progress was made in respect of the reform of the budget."
"We should have liked to have seen a thorough overhaul of the agreement on agricultural funding and a methodical reform of regional aid."
"More of the EU’s resources should be spent in areas such as research and fighting crime, poverty and climate change, as well as on work to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world."
"The reform of the budget must be kept to the fore when the agreed overhaul is due to take place in 2008/2009."
"There are also sections of the report that we would rather have done without."
"Amongst these we might mention what is known as the Globalisation Fund and the text relating to ‘own resources’."
"It is our opinion that it must continue to be the Member States that decide what resources the EU is to have at its disposal."
". Parliament’s negotiating position on the financial perspective 2007-2013, as expressed in its resolution of 8 June 2005, enhanced the financial perspective with quantitative, structural and qualitative elements that were considered ‘non-negotiable points’."
"These were elements that Parliament claimed it was 'determined to defend', saying it was 'ready to start constructive negotiations with the Council’, in the Resolution of 18 January 2006, which rejected the agreement of the December 2005 European Council."
"That was worthwhile."
"Although I acknowledge that the final outcome of the negotiations, especially regarding the quantitative elements, fell short of the position adopted in June, this has, broadly speaking, been a success."
"Given the urgent need to obtain an agreement, ‘this was the only possible compromise’."
"In the negotiations, Parliament secured an increase for itself of EUR 4 billion of the total amount earmarked for priority policies, which goes directly to programmes, in accordance with the approach it put forward."
"Most of the qualitative elements were reflected in the new interinstitutional agreement."
"Of these I should like to highlight Parliament’s participation on an equal footing in the 2009 review, because this will enable it to find solutions to existing deficits and to improve the forthcoming financial perspective, thus helping us to meet the objective of the abovementioned negotiating position, which remains in place."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
".I was unable to resign myself to voting in favour of the amended financial perspective."
"Even though Parliament’s negotiators succeeded in obtaining an extra EUR 2 billion over seven years, the difference between Europe’s ambition and the sad reality of the budget is striking."
"Even though the needs identified for the trans-European networks come to EUR 18 billion, we allocate EUR 7.2 billion."
"The needs identified for Galileo total EUR 2.5 billion, while the appropriations provided for total EUR 900 million."
"The intelligent part of the CAP, rural development, has seen its appropriations halved."
"Research, the Lisbon Strategy, social policy - in short, all of the key policies – have been curbed."
"Europe will not make progress with an annual budget that represents scarcely a third of what the US allocates to its military budget alone."
"Although this compromise, like every other of its kind, has its weak points, it is nevertheless a step forward and one worth supporting."
"Accession negotiations, new initiatives in research, and so on, demand more in the way of resources, and Europe would be sending the wrong message to the new Member States and to those with legitimate expectations of solidarity between Europe's regions if the countries had not agreed to this compromise."
"It needs to be acknowledged, though, that negotiations of this kind need to be more open and more transparent."
"It is not acceptable that certain countries should demand solidarity in one area – agriculture, perhaps – while denying it to others in other areas, such as the structural funds, for example."
"It is in everyone’s interest that a Europe characterised by such ‘egoisms’ should steadily be done away with."
". The proposals for the financial perspective 2007-2013 that we have been putting forward since the outset of negotiations are as follows:"
"- ensure a Community budget that, on the basis of national contributions commensurate with the relative wealth of each country (based on GNI), will have a redistributive role. Its priorities will be to bring the levels of economic development of the different countries closer together and to improve the living conditions of their workers and citizens."
"- a root and branch overhaul of the common agricultural policy, with the aim of safeguarding each country’s right to food sovereignty and safety, by means of introducing modulation and a ceiling for agricultural aid, and delivering fair redistribution of agricultural aid among farmers, types of production and countries."
"- an end to the conditionality of the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact and the non-application of the N+2 (or 3) rule to this Fund or to the Structural Fund."
"- Complete compensation for regions that will suffer from the so-called statistical effect, such as the Algarve."
"- Portugal not losing Community funding and the creation of a specific programme for modernising the Portuguese economy in the context of enlargement."
"The Community framework that has been adopted runs counter to these objectives and needs."
"Hence our rejection."
".I voted against the European budget planned for the period 2007-2013 because, in my opinion, it represents a tragic lack of European ambition and the return to intergovernmental practices of which I disapprove and which will paralyse all European public action, and this at the expense of Europeans."
"With a sum of EUR 864 billion, or 1.05% of the gross domestic product of the 25 Member States, the financial perspective is not equal to Europe's historic enlargement to incorporate ten new Member States, or the challenges awaiting it for the future."
"I believe that we are very far removed from the much-hyped demands made at the start of the negotiations (indeed, in June 2005, the European Parliament voted in favour of a budget totalling EUR 974 billion, or 1.18% of GDP); this budget, I am afraid to say, goes hand in hand with a reduction in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and with a fall in competitiveness, growth and employment, and will rule out any modernisation."
"As an MEP, it was therefore my responsibility to reject an agreement such as this, which runs counter to the idea I have of a great Europe."
". I voted in favour of the Böge report on the interinstitutional agreement because I feel that it represents the highest common denominator, following lengthy negotiations in trialogue."
"I must register my deep concern, however, about the apparent discrepancy between what is stipulated in the agreement reached in December and its practical application."
"It would appear that a discrepancy has now emerged in the funds earmarked for the Algarve region in the context of exceptional measures adopted for statistical effect regions."
"If the information is to be believed, the Algarve region will be seriously harmed by the Commission’s interpretation of the December Agreement, which could lead to the Algarve receiving far worse treatment than any other Objective 2 region, as it will no longer be eligible for phasing out."
"In the name of transparency and good interinstitutional cooperation, I feel that it is extremely important that the bases of the interpretation of the content of the 2007-2013 financial package be clarified."
". My group has the following reasons for rejecting Mr Böge’s report."
"Since it rightly states that Parliament is disappointed in the existing financial framework, it is incomprehensible that this so-called compromise should meet with approval."
"Even though the concluding negotiations produced improvements in quality, the underlying problem has not gone away."
"This paltry budget will do nothing to help the EU achieve its high targets in terms of cohesion and development."
"Today has also seen discussion of the report on the budget for 2007, according to the first paragraph of which Parliament ‘expresses concern about the visible discrepancy between the challenges that the European Union faces and the means capable of being made available under the relevant headings of a backward-looking Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 in order for these challenges to be effectively addressed, especially in relation to competitiveness, research and innovation, which the Council and the Commission have categorised as priorities’."
"It is to 2007 that the new Financial Perspective will first be applicable."
"The adoption of a far too tight framework plan, involving a reduction of 15% in the funds available for the period between 2007 and 2013 over against those originally considered necessary, followed immediately by complaints about the lack of financial resources, does not testify to political farsightedness."
". I voted in favour of ratifying the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council of Ministers, for the following reasons:"
"1."
"The excellent negotiations by Portugal and Madeira achieved their goals."
"2."
"Following pressure from Parliament, EUR 4 billion has been added to the spending limit."
"3."
"Rules have been established with a view to the Member States taking greater responsibility for the management of European funds."
"4."
"Parliament has been given a more prominent role in the review of the Community budget, which is to take place by 2009."
"I wish to point out that I was one of those who, by voting, contributed towards Parliament’s decision to reject the budgetary agreement reached by the Heads of State or Government in mid-December 2005. This obliged the Council of Ministers to sit around the negotiating table with Parliament with a view to reaching a position that would express the common will of both institutions."
"I should like to conclude by pointing out that this agreement falls well short of being completely satisfactory."
"It is, however, the agreement that was possible under the current circumstances."
". I welcome the Interinstitutional Agreement as providing financial stability for the 2007 to 2013 period."
"I also welcome the fact that Parliament has been able to add around EUR 4 billion to the original settlement reached by the European Council."
"This demonstrates Parliament's ability to negotiate effectively with other institutions."
". I voted in favour of the Böge report but would like to record my concern about certain elements of the budget agreement which may have a negative impact on the single market."
"In particular, the possibility of using 20% modulation in the CAP to fund rural development without having to meet the agreed rules on co-financing and spending guidelines is regrettable and could lead to a distortion of competition between Member States."
"It is an attack on the CAP and is effectively a move to renationalise agriculture policy."
". If politics is the art of the possible, the search for an agreement on the EU’s financial framework for 2007-2013 has proved to be the art of the minimum possible, which is not a cause for satisfaction."
"The EU has over the last few years undergone a major enlargement process to include new countries and political integration. This needs to be matched by increased funding."
"For the prosperity and security project that the EU represents for its citizens to be a reality, it requires a financial framework to match that ambition and its new size."
"Furthermore, the notion of solidarity, which has always been an integral part of the make-up of the EU's financial institutions, is justified on the grounds that it is fair and that it seeks to promote a balanced and effective internal market."
"In light of these considerations, and in particular the impossibility of going beyond the limited budgetary outcome, my vote in favour is coloured by this regret. It also comes, however, with the hope that the entire budgetary structure will in due course be rethought with a view to promoting a more development-friendly economy, via the review of the expenditure heading."
"The final stage has been reached on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 with the vote in favour of an overall package of EUR 866.4 billion."
"I should like to quote a figure to you: Europe costs each European 26 cents a day."
"After the standstills on the part of certain Member States – I am referring to the ‘Club of the six skinflints’ – which were hoping for a cut-price agreement, we can be satisfied with the compromise adopted, despite its being far below Parliament’s initial proposal of June 2005, namely EUR 975 billion."
"Parliament nonetheless managed to extract EUR 4 billion more than what the Council had decided, EUR 4 billion that has been granted mainly to policies regarding education (an extra 40 000 Erasmus scholarships!), research, competitiveness and innovation."
"On the other hand, other areas have been sacrificed, such as ‘Life +’, a far-reaching environmental programme that will only receive 16% of the total funds initially provided for."
"To conclude, we have an unsatisfactory agreement and a subsistence budget, which will make it possible to ensure some continuity, but which are nowhere near providing Europe with the resources needed for its ambitions."
". I voted in favour of the proposed financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"I still feel, however, that the proposal originally adopted by Parliament was far more beneficial to the EU, not only from the quantitative point of view but also, especially, on account of the methodology used."
"Whilst the proposal adopted by Parliament is the consequence of defining policies and priorities and as such is the true expression of a policy, the Council’s decision, being more of a summary of claims made by the Member States, does not have the same quality."
"In spite of this, I voted in favour of the proposal because it would be highly damaging if the European institutions did not have a medium-term financial framework in which to prepare development-related projects."
"A further significant reason for voting in favour of the proposal concerns the commitment to review both revenue and spending."
"I consider this point to be of major importance, given that I have on a number of occasions expressed the view that the current method of funding the EU has run its course."
"For the first time, it has become clear that this reform will take on crucial importance and will require Parliament’s involvement."
". I have voted against the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"For the period between 2007 and 2013, Parliament has asked EUR 112 billion more than the Council."
"During Mr Blair’s debriefing in December 2005, the group chairmen of the large groups screamed blue murder, claiming that they would not under any circumstances agree to this result."
"Five months down the line, it is evident that pressure from the capitals, and particularly from Berlin, has worked very well: all the big promises were taken back."
"Parliament has contented itself with an increase of a mere EUR 4 billion."
"This agreement will be unable to adequately meet the major challenges that the EU is facing."
"Cutbacks are now being made on the second pillar of agricultural policy which is supposed to fund rural development and which puts quality, animal welfare and environmental care first."
"By the same token, not enough funds are being set aside for trans-European networks, programmes such as Erasmus (a mere 140 000 students will be placed from now on, compared to 170 000 in 2006) and Leonardo (36 000 placements compared to 50 000), the seventh Research and Development Policy programme, the social agenda, the structural funds, Life+ and Natura, cultural activities, external policy and our dealings with our neighbours."
"The people have their expectations of Europe, and it is extremely regrettable that we will be unable to meet them."
"Between Parliament’s vote in June 2005 (EUR 974 billion) and the agreement reached under the UK Presidency in December 2005 (EUR 862 billion), there was a shortfall of EUR 112 billion."
"Following many meetings, the agreement reached by the trialogue has made it possible to secure an extra EUR 2 billion, which is far from satisfactory."
"Yet, at a time when Euroscepticism is gaining ground within the old and the new Member States, mainly because of the uncertainties linked to the enlargements and to the institutional deadlock, it seems helpful to me to reassure people by adopting the financial perspective for seven years."
"Solidarity mechanisms are being preserved, although we will not see them increase in importance, as I would have wished."
"It is for these reasons that I will vote in favour of this financial perspective, but I will obviously be unenthusiastic about doing so."
"I have voted in favour of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and good financial management, not because these were the financial perspectives of my dreams, but because I welcome the qualitative improvements in financial management and because, since the prospective budgets just about make the grade, we should not throw out the baby with the bath water."
"Parliament has, I believe, done a good job – better than ever before and, above all, better than the two other institutions."
"It is thanks to our preparatory work and negotiators that we, despite the Commission’s half-hearted commitment and governments’ tight-fistedness, have firm prospects."
"In the current circumstances, this agreement is better than the absolute uncertainty surrounding the entire financial policy."
"There is one thing that still sticks in my throat, and that is the treatment meted out to rural development, along with the possible moves towards the renationalisation of agricultural policy."
"Since we have no guarantees, though, of being able to get agricultural policy on the right track without either the Constitution or financial perspectives, this was not a good enough reason to reject the whole initiative."
". I voted in favour of the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, because I believe that the outcome of the negotiations on the 2007-2013 financial perspective is a good one for the 450 million citizens of Europe."
"There is no such thing as a perfect budget."
"In the current economic and political climate in the EU, this is a good agreement for Europe and for Portugal, which is set to receive EUR 22.5 billion over the course of this seven-year period."
"In addition to the quantitative gains in relation to the Council’s previous proposal, there are also qualitative benefits that Portugal will enjoy."
"What is more, any postponement of the decision would lead to delays in the use of Community funds to resolve people's problems."
"Europe’s citizens – the Portuguese in particular – would not appreciate any further delays."
"I voted against the Sousa Pinto and Böge reports, which reflect the way in which Europe has taken a back seat to acts of national self-interest, destroy any far-reaching political project and seriously threaten existing public policies, not least the CAP and the Structural Funds, both of which are tools for showing solidarity with the most vulnerable regions."
"As regards agriculture, there will thus be a shortfall of EUR 30 billion until 2013 to honour the CAP reform, the negotiators having failed to account for the fact that two new Member States will be joining the Union in 2009."
"Having been presented as a way forward for the European agricultural sector, rural development is, for its part, showing a 21% decrease in the appropriations that were allocated to it in comparison with the previous period and is paving the way for the abuse of our rural territories."
"The Union’s Cohesion Policy is undergoing the same drastic cuts, recording a 10% decrease in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, despite the fact that many European regions are lagging behind in terms of development, and thus instead required a substantial effort to be made regarding Community solidarity."
"Directly affected, as they are, by this climb-down on the budget, the outermost regions will, moreover, be unable to rely on the development of new regional synergies, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument having lost an extra EUR 6 billion."
"We have chosen to vote against both of these reports as we consider that the total payment appropriations should be below 1% of the total GNI of the EU Member States in accordance with the proposal from the G6 countries."
"Nor do we see any reason to celebrate the fact that the EU’s budget has been increased by EUR 4 billion by means of yet another round of negotiations initiated by the federalist majority in the European Parliament."
"This money would have been better spent on the political priorities of the Member States in respect of expenditure."
"We therefore reject the agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"We also emphatically take exception to the debates in the European Parliament in relation to there being a need to reform the system for own resources and to the EU needing its own source of income, for example by means of a tax being levied on mobile phones across the entire Union."
"The EU budget must depend on membership fees from the Member States, and the size of these membership fees must be decided by the Council of Ministers."
".In June 2005, Parliament estimated that the Union required a budget of EUR 974 billion in order to face up to the challenges of the future."
"The agreement on the financial perspective, which was reached on 4 April at the end of the trialogue between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, is EUR 112 billion below our position in June 2005."
"We have recorded a 35% decrease in the budgetary resources allocated to growth and competitiveness (heading 1a), a 10% decrease for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund (heading 1b) and so on. With such a tight budget, it is very hard to imagine the Union’s being able to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"This is a minimalist agreement that does not provide the Union with sufficient leeway to conduct new policies for the future."
"The only thing going for this financial perspective is the fact that it exists."
"We can no longer postpone our vote for fear of not being able to start the new programming period in time."
"The Member States and the regions must, in particular, be able to develop and launch their projects in good time so that the latter can be cofinanced as from 2007."
"It would, in fact, be tragic if the poorest regions in Europe were unable to have access to structural aid as from 2007."
"Those are the reasons justifying my abstention."
".I am not going to get into a dispute over figures in order to explain to you why I voted against the reports by Mr Böge and Mrs Sousa Pinto, both of which relate to the financial perspective."
"The advocates of this compromise, which they themselves describe as 'tolerable', will not hold it against me, I hope, if I harbour a different ambition for Europe and its citizens to theirs."
"I do not want a Europe that is reduced to being a mere free-trade area copied from the Anglo-Saxon model, but rather a Europe founded on the values of solidarity and of sharing among nations, something that has always been the vehicle for European progress."
"This financial perspective is tragically lacking in ambition for the future of the European project and merely helps to promote intergovernmentalism."
"With a 37% reduction under the heading of growth and competitiveness, and a 10% reduction in the Cohesion Fund, the financial perspective destroys any notion of a revival of Europe and precludes any new policy for seven years."
"It is regrettable that the European Parliament has not heeded the 1% target of the G6 countries but has instead worked for a budget framework far in excess of this amount."
"The agreement also lacks ambition in respect of the necessary reforms of both agricultural policy and regional policy."
"Within the framework of a long-term budget of 1% of GNI, there must also be room to invest in scientific research and to support enlargement."
"The overhaul of the EU’s system of financing must not under any circumstances cause the EU to be granted its own right to levy taxes, and it is therefore unfortunate that there are wordings that implicitly suggest that this is necessary."
"I have therefore chosen to reject the financial consequences that would be associated with the Interinstitutional Agreement and have voted against the reports in their entirety."
"– Mr President, I voted in favour of the Rack report even though I believe that traffic’s considerable impact on human beings and their environment makes it essential that more freight be carried by rail."
"This is an area in which there is ever-increasing, and ever-tougher, competition in the private sector, and, although the Austrian railways, among others, were able to increase the amount of freight they carry, it became evident at the same time that margins were becoming tighter."
"A study has shown that an increase in the toll levied on HGVs would result in the transfer of scarcely any traffic onto rails, instead doing no more than speeding up the large-scale closure of small haulage firms at the same time as imposing burdens on the economy and businesses."
"The only thing that would promote the transfer of goods to rail would, it appeared, be qualitative and structural improvements."
"I believe that the only rational approach to resolving this problem would be a radical reshaping of our transport system, which has, to date, favoured transport criss-crossing the EU from one end to the other."
"If, though, this crazy approach to transport is to be maintained, then support should from now on go only to what are termed ‘roll-on roll-off’ trains."
"This programme is of great value as a means towards more 'environmentally friendly' mobility, but, if we want to take the pressure off the roads, other means of transport, ranging from waterways to railways, will have to be highly efficient."
"Even so, multimodal transport is as strong as every link in the chain, although railways in particular are still the weaker partner and a more recent inventory of the multimodal platforms clearly shows where the weak points are to be found."
"The Commission and Parliament would therefore be well advised to concern themselves with this issue over and above these programmes, failing which even the best support programmes will be pulled up short by a lack of efficiency in rail transport and elsewhere, and transport businesses will see no advantage in using railways."
". The compromise adopted today introduces various amendments that improve upon the text of the Commission’s original proposal."
"For example, it includes in the scope of application of this regulation more environmentally friendly means of transport, such as rail and inland waterways, and it takes account of the needs of the SMEs and the more remote and vulnerable regions, with a view to delivering better economic and social cohesion."
"Bearing in mind these important changes, and bearing in mind the fact that, as the text states, ‘the present regulation establishes a financing instrument … should reduce congestion, improve the environmental performance of the transport system and enhance intermodal transport, thereby contributing to an efficient and sustainable transport system’, we cannot accept the drastic reduction in the budgetary envelope laid down for the programme."
"Let us not forget that the initial budget came to EUR 740 million and the amount adopted today only comes to EUR 400 million, which means a 46% reduction."
"We hear about the fight against climate change, honouring the Kyoto Protocol and developing more environmentally friendly means of transport, yet we note that insufficient support is given to implementing those objectives."
". Europe's transport system is expected to see an increase of road freight by 2013 of more than 60%."
"The results will be greater congestion and environmental degradation, more accidents and a loss of competitiveness of European industry, which must rely, for the management of its supply chains, on cost-efficient transportation."
"In this situation, a greater reliance on intermodality is necessary."
"In my own constituency of Munster, I have just learned that the port of Limerick is to lose substantial facilities through sale of important land."
"This will cause an increase of heavy road traffic in the Limerick city area."
"I see my vote today as a support for not only maintaining existing water-borne freight traffic, but also for moving it from road to water."
"I know that there are no Marco Polo projects in Ireland, but I intend to urge the interested parties in Munster and Ireland to look for projects that are acceptable under Marco Polo."
"– The group of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas in the European Parliament would point out that the drastic cut of 50% in the financial framework, from 740 to 400 million euros, and the criteria for the selection of projects for the implementation of the second Marco Polo programme for the period from 2007 to 2013 are designed to increase the profits of big business and will not mitigate – let alone resolve – the serious problems relating to the major traffic congestion which exists and is worsening in internal and international freight transport, resulting both in an increase in accidents and destructive consequences for the environment."
"This choice forms part of the more general anti-grass roots policy of the ΕU, as applied to maritime cabotage in Regulation (EC) No 3577/92 on the responsibility of the Nea Dimokratia and Panellinio Socialistiko Kinima governments in our country, in collusion with shipowners, with painful consequences for workers in maritime and shore transport, professional artisans and small and medium-sized farm owners."
"That is why the group of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas in the European Parliament did not vote in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation establishing the second Marco Polo programme."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have voted to support the compromise amendments to Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s report on TSEs that have been jointly tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"We think it important that Parliament be able to demonstrate a broad majority in favour of measures to fight and eradicate TSEs."
"Our view is that ruminants should not be fed animal protein."
"Experts in the field believe that this may, however, be justified in one exceptional case, namely fish bone meal as a protein replacement for calves."
"Our view is that, in such a case, this process must be preceded by careful monitoring in order to ensure that the feedstuff in question is fish bone meal rather than any other animal protein."
". This report follows the Commission’s original proposal of December 2004, which had two objectives: to prolong the validity period of transitional measures and to establish rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, one of the key issues of which is the ban on feeding livestock on processed animal proteins."
"The compromise adopted today establishes a series of rules regarding breeding programmes to select for resistance to TSEs or to export and import animal feed."
"Nevertheless, despite the food and veterinary crises that have struck in recent years, and their impact on public and animal health, the interests of animal ration companies have taken precedence insofar as they have been granted derogations to the existing general ban; for example, such companies are allowed to use fish flour, and the Commission is allowed to grant partial derogation for certain types of animal such as young ruminants."
"We oppose this position, which, apart from the problems already mentioned, raise issues as regards the intensive, verticalised production development model so prevalent nowadays in agriculture and fisheries."
"Hence our decision to abstain."
"– The prevention, combating and elimination of the transmission of spongiform encephalopathy is needed in order to protect public health and livestock."
"This is the way to safeguard consumer confidence in the food chain."
"Outbreaks of BSE are declining; nonetheless, we must aim to put the crisis well and truly behind us by adapting to the new circumstances and taking preventive measures which make use of scientific studies and findings."
"Today's report has several positive proposals in this direction."
"However, it does not avoid contradictions with certain amendments that leave the way open for the adoption of the use of animal proteins in ruminants, thereby negating the positive points of the report."
"Double standards are also applied, allowing the exportation to third countries of certain processed animal proteins from non-ruminants, in order to save the costs of destruction, thereby using third countries for EU rubbish."
"This way of thinking disregards and puts public health in third place, setting profits above all."
"This is also the main element of the capitalist system, which is why it is barbaric and inhumane."
"It is also dangerous for the food chain and the public health of the peoples."
"We have every reason to fight to overturn it."
". I voted in favour of this report which seeks to amend the EU’s current rules on controlling transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in order to bring the EU into line with international agreements reducing BSE risks categories from 5 to 3."
"TSEs are brain disorders in animals and include sub-categories such as BSE and other diseases."
"The aim is to streamline the risk categories while improving EU animal health controls and maintaining consumer protection."
". The People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) voted in favour of the Roth-Behrendt report today, even though it is not entirely satisfied with the compromise between Parliament and the Council."
"In the compromise, steps are being taken to relax the ban on feeding non-ruminants animal meal, provided that animals are not fed animal meal originating from their own species. In this respect, we would refer to the by-products regulation (1774/2002/EC) which lays down the ban on feeding animal by-products to animals of the same species for reasons of possible food safety risks."
"While the VVD welcomes this development, we are dissatisfied with the fact that in the compromise, nothing is being said about imposing the same requirements on imported products."
"Indeed, non-ruminant products from third countries need not meet any conditions in terms of feeding animal meal."
"The VVD believes that third-country products should meet the same requirements, certainly where food safety is at stake."
"Despite this, the VVD has voted in favour, because the compromise, in many ways, represents an improvement on the current situation."
"Approval of the compromise means agreement at first reading, which means that these improvements can actually be carried out in the short term."
"The extension of the prohibition on feeding animal-based feedingstuffs to animals other than ruminants is a positive development, but it is most unfortunate that an exception has been included to allow the feeding of fishmeal to calves."
"I am therefore voting against this part of the proposal, although otherwise this is a good compromise."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mrs Plestinska, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing of European standardisation."
"The text proposed by the European Commission and adopted at first reading makes it possible to give a crucial legal basis to the financing of European standardisation."
"Standardisation is one of the tools needed for applying Community policies, especially those concerned with the internal market and with increasing the competitiveness of businesses."
"I am delighted that access to this financing has been extended beyond the traditional beneficiaries that are usually referred to as 'European standards organisations’ and will include more activities."
"This is a significant show of support, particularly for those European standards that are in competition with other standards worldwide."
"Technical measures implementing standardisation are a precondition for the satisfactory functioning of the internal market."
"It is thus necessary to grant funding to those institutions that are to develop such common standards."
"The financing of the institutions and organisations in question should nonetheless be debated and established within the framework of the regular budget negotiations."
"It is irresponsible to lay down at this stage the indicative amounts that the institutions in question are to be granted."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"This legislation is based on the fundamental misconception that the aim of standardisation is to increase the competitiveness of businesses rather than to make life easier for consumers."
"What is more, it is only logical that industry should pay for standardisation itself if, indeed, it is only businesses that are to benefit."
"I therefore oppose the EU granting funding to this work, which should be self-financed through charges."
"I am thus voting against the proposal."
". The proposal is constituted by a series of technical and procedural regulations that aim at improving competition."
"It creates a framework for financing standardisation activities for the implementation of Community policies."
"One more proposal, which, if seen as what it is, introduces a better financing framework and facilitates the adoption of European standards, particularly for very small enterprises and manufacturers."
"The Commission must be subject to censure, not only for what it does but equally for what it does not do."
"Obviously, for the Commission, the prosperity of citizens and the harmonisation of social models and systems of social protection – upwards not downwards – is not a priority."
"This Commission continues to ignore the voice of the people calling for harmonisation of social systems before any such internal market is put in place, resulting in social dumping."
"Instead it presents a new Lisbon strategy and a directive on liberalisation of services (Bolkestein) as the panacea to all our problems."
"Abstention would be the best choice, as a protest vote against the general policy of the Commission and especially the fact that European citizens are at the bottom of its list of priorities."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow Member, Mr Rosati, on public finances in economic and monetary Union."
"It was crucial to declare that the public finance situation is very worrying to say the least, with some Member States going bankrupt."
"Furthermore, it must be noted that Community procedures, whether we are talking about the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) or the excessive deficit procedures (EDP), only partially resolve this tragic situation and are, indeed, ineffective in a context in which weak economic growth and social demands are compromising the European Union’s capacity to reform itself."
"The absence of political will to bring some sense back to the crucial budgetary adjustments is reflected in a tragic increase in debt."
"How long is this irresponsibility going to last?"
"It has become impossible to comprehend how the leaders of the executives in the Member States concerned cannot understand, by using their common sense and by looking at the world's success stories, such as Canada and Demark, that healthy public finances are crucial to achieving higher growth and employment."
"– Recent developments in public finances in the ΕU show an increase in deficit and debt, and yet no mention is made of the increase in the profits of the plutocracy and of who wins from this policy."
"Similarly, there is no mention of the elements of poverty and unemployment for the peoples, who are called upon every time to pick up the bill, so that big business can maintain its profitability and exploitation."
"The slow rate of the structural reforms ordered by the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy is presented as the cause of the debt and deficit."
"That is why the measures proposed are a higher retirement age, flexible forms of work, lifelong learning and the strengthening of companies, in other words measures and objectives that want slave workers to work without rights to employment, a pension and the basic human necessities, so that euro-unifying capital can increase its competitiveness and profits."
"That is why deficits and debts are used as a pretext for new waves of austerity programmes and for the removal of vested rights, which will bring more poverty, unemployment and uncertainty to the workers."
"These are the results of the capitalist barbarity from the policy of the ΕU and the governments."
"This policy is inhumane and must be overturned."
"The message from the grass-roots fight is the need for grass-roots prosperity."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Rosati on his important and timely report on public finances in the economic and monetary union, to which I give my full support. I especially welcome the reference to the need to channel efforts into increasing the effectiveness of the preventative and corrective political measures for strengthening and consolidating the EU's public finances."
"The fact that the necessary reforms were not carried out reduced growth and jobs and put pressure on public finances."
"This question will only be resolved when a question of common interest to the EU is addressed by all Member States."
". Europe’s public finances remain in a precarious state."
"European growth remains worryingly slow."
"The drop in deficits that we have seen is more an indication of the economic adjustments following expectations of greater growth in the economy, rather than the necessary structural reforms that are so vital to the future of the European economy."
"Against this backdrop, this report highlights the effects on growth, employment and macroeconomic stability of public finances and calls on the Commission and the Member States to work together to take measures to reverse the slow growth of the European economy and to pave the way for the smooth functioning of the single currency."
"These measures are crucial for the European economy to grow strongly on sound foundations, in such a way that it can provide fresh business and job opportunities for its citizens."
"We cannot, however, overlook the difficulties that some Member States have had in recent years in keeping public deficits within the levels of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"A further reason for us to follow this issue with concern and to call on the Commission and the Member States to take structural measures and be prepared for genuine coordination of economic policies."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Rosati report."
"The next item is the report (A6-0158/2006) by Mr Howitt, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2005 and the EU’s Policy on the matter (2005/2203(INI)"
". Mr President, the job of the European Parliament is to scrutinise and hold to account the institutions of the European Union, yet every year since 1988 in this Parliament’s annual human rights report, we have scrutinised the record of governments across the world, but never asked the hard questions about what impact the EU itself has had in promoting compliance with international human rights law abroad."
"This year we are doing so."
"I would like to thank colleagues from the Austrian Presidency who have agreed with us an enhanced role for Parliament, as the Council prepares its annual human rights report on behalf of the Union as a whole."
"This is not so much a question of institutional sensitivities: it is more that a unified and strengthened EU human rights report can provide a stronger voice for Europe and our commitment to human rights in the world."
"I hope our proposal for an annual EU list of countries of concern will be considered in that context."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner, too, for her support for this approach and for listening and responding to Parliament by agreeing to a separate legal instrument for human rights."
"This will allow us to continue funding human rights projects, despite opposition from governments responsible for oppression and abuse."
"It is the right choice."
"Of course Parliament will, this year and every year, offer constructive criticism."
"Why does the Council support UN reform which puts human rights onto an equal footing, yet itself have a part-time working group, compared to other foreign policy working groups which are staffed by permanent Brussels-based officials?"
"Human rights are not a part-time occupation."
"When UN troops in Liberia stand accused of rape and torture, how can Europe launch its own ESDP mission in Aceh, Indonesia, without any human rights monitoring?"
"Why do the EU’s human rights consultations allow Russia to exclude human rights NGOs and why does our human rights dialogue with China not even benefit from simultaneous language interpretation?"
"And does Europe really apply human rights consistently when it fails to support criticisms of the abuse in both China and Russia, but is prepared to do so for less strategically important countries like Nepal or North Korea?"
"Explain to the families of 99 trade unionists murdered last year in Colombia, which has the worst record in the world, why Europe actually offers trade preferences to that country for its supposed protection of internationally agreed workers’ rights."
"Why have nine Member States, including Germany, Ireland, and Portugal, failed to sign the UN optional protocol against torture? Eleven EU countries refuse to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, including Britain, France and Spain."
"Why have seven of our members considered signing so-called immunity agreements in opposition to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court?"
"When human rights defenders face death threats for upholding their rights, how can evidence show that in Zimbabwe – scene of political imprisonment, mass evictions and the persecution of journalists – the European Commission delegation itself said that it was not aware of the EU’s guidelines for human rights defenders?"
"We can do better."
"We must stop the navel-gazing by EU representatives in international forums and, for the first time, genuinely link multilateral and bilateral negotiations in the EU so that abusive countries know they will face adverse consequences in the EU’s diplomatic trade and development policies."
"We must use a more sophisticated sliding scale of sanctions and make it easier to find political agreement in the EU to apply them."
"We should ensure that one staff member in every Commission delegation, in 118 countries worldwide, is responsible for reporting and promoting human rights obligations."
"We must make the UN and its international human rights conventions a contractual obligation of the stabilisation, association and accession process, starting with ourselves."
"Finally, as far as we ourselves are concerned, let me refer to the debate raging this week in my own country, the United Kingdom, on how human rights can be reconciled, given the changed threats of terrorism, people trafficking and organised crime."
"It is time to say that the threats might change, but that human rights are inviolable."
"When the last generation saw Nelson Mandela labelled a terrorist, when former East Germans smuggled themselves across the Berlin Wall, when the Holocaust represented one of the worst ethnic genocides in world history, the threats of terrorism, trafficking and racial hatred were a cue to agree human rights, not to tear them down."
"So if our generation is sincere in seeking the freedom of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi, tackling the despicable trade in women and children for sexual exploitation and bringing the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Darfur and in the Balkans to justice, we have to defend the concept of human rights at home as well as abroad."
"Europe must practice what it preaches."
"."
"Mr President, let me begin on a personal note: this is my third opportunity to speak in this House about the broad issues of human rights."
"As far as the Austrian Presidency is concerned, this issue is very dear to our hearts and we want to deal with it in a way that corresponds to what the rapporteur has just said."
"We want the European Union as a whole to be perceived by our partners and by the outside world as speaking with one voice and conveying the values of the European Union."
"As Mr Howitt said, we have to practise what we preach."
"This is very much what the Presidency is trying to do."
"I should like to begin by thanking the European Parliament for its cooperation and we should also like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission for their contributions."
"We are grateful this year that, for the first time, Parliament has adopted a comprehensive approach."
"It has not just listed one human rights violation after another in a given country but has adopted a comprehensive approach and policy, which the Council very much appreciates."
"To those – be they women or men – who are threatened and tortured for standing up for human rights, it is irrelevant whether the European Union now speaks through Parliament, the Council or the Commission."
"The important thing is that we in the European Union should speak at all."
"People who rely on help from the European Union do so irrespective of the institution, and that is why cooperation between the institutions is so very important."
"I would like, at this point, to make reference to something that is very important to me personally, even though it may well not be directly connected with the report."
"The Austrian Presidency is endeavouring, if at all possible, to set up the Fundamental Rights Agency, and to bring about a final agreement on it, before our presidency comes to an end."
"We had, this morning, a highly constructive sitting with Parliament and the Commission, in the course of which we agreed on the basis outlines of what this Fundamental Rights Agency is going to be like."
"I would ask you all to play your parts in this, in order that this important institution, which is to represent the European Union as a whole to the outside world, may take concrete form as soon as possible."
"The Presidency will be working very hard to that end."
"We have closely examined the report, and we are appreciative of the efforts of the rapporteur and of all the Members of your House who worked on it."
"I would just like to give particular attention to a few points."
"The first has to do with the human rights guidelines, which the report quite rightly emphasises, and which is of great significance in terms of the more effective implementation of EU policy."
"At the heart of all that we do is the worldwide abolition of the death penalty and of torture, along with the protection of human rights activists and of children caught up in armed conflict, and I would like to mention the fact that Austrian foreign policy over recent years, not least under the aegis of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner – who is now a Commissioner – focused particularly on these issues."
"We welcome your House’s work, in particular that of the Human Rights Sub-Committee, towards the better implementation of the anti-torture guidelines and also your time-honoured commitment to the prevention of human rights violations."
"The present Austrian President of the Foreign Affairs Council, Mrs Plassnik, takes these matters extremely seriously; in the run-up to the summit between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean, she received human rights campaigners from that region and assured them of the European Union’s support."
"Passing on to the subject of the anti-torture guidelines, we repeatedly hear it said that the European Union does not do enough in individual cases."
"We are of course well aware of the fact that whether or not people detained in police custody are treated humanely is often something that is determined within hours, and, true though this is, we must also be honest with ourselves and admit the regrettable fact that our options are often limited."
"Within the scope afforded by those options, the European Union does speak out very strongly in cases where people face the threat of torture and inhumane treatment, but we regret our inability to prevent them in every case."
"The implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture, and cooperation with the UN’s human rights apparatus generally, was, during our presidency, an essential part of our human rights policy; in this respect we were doing no more than continuing the European Union’s traditional policy, and initiated démarches on the subject in over twenty-five countries."
"The subject of torture and inhumane treatment is of course an important one, and it is one that we keep on raising in our human rights dialogues with third countries."
"Having visited Kazakhstan, where we engaged in political dialogues with the countries of Central Asia, and more recently, the region of the Southern Caucasus, I myself can say that the European Union has always been very forthright in addressing the issue of torture and inhumane treatment, as well as human rights matters in general."
"Elections to the UN Human Rights Council were held a matter of a few days ago, and I am sure that we can generally be satisfied with them, since it turned out that certain states who are notorious violators of human rights were not elected after all, and the European Union had in fact given an undertaking not to vote for countries known to have a poor record on human rights."
"The Human Rights Council will meet for the first time on 19 June, in other words, before the end of our presidency."
"Our desire is that this new United Nation body should, in future, make a constructive and essential contribution to working for human rights around the world."
"In conclusion, I would like once more to emphasise the great importance of exchange between the institutions in terms of our work for human rights."
"Only an even-handed and universal human rights policy on the part of the European Union will get a hearing and, eventually, bear fruit."
"The presentation of the European Union’s annual report on human rights to your House in December, an occasion on which you traditionally highlight human rights priorities by presenting the Sakharov Prize, and your House’s response to that report, makes an important contribution towards that end."
"Our common goal is an effective and visible human rights policy for the European Union, which will see us standing up for our values."
"The European Parliament is making a significant contribution in this respect, to which tribute was paid in the European Union’s annual report for 2005."
"The European Parliament’s achievements should and will receive due recognition in the forthcoming annual report, which will be prepared under the Finnish Presidency."
"I would like, once again to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this outstanding report."
". Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity for a human rights debate."
"I thank Mr Howitt for his excellent report."
"I also welcome the comprehensive analysis of action."
"As the President said, both the Commission and the Council have to work very closely together in order to have a comprehensive human rights policy."
"Let me make a few comments and raise a few issues."
"First, I acknowledge the strong support of Parliament for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and its continued interest."
"I assure you that all the elements that contribute to the success of this initiative will be maintained for the period 2007 to 2013, for instance independence from government approval and support for civil society organisations."
"I share the concern to make our actions in the area more flexible and in tune with the needs of the grassroots organisations."
"This year we are already trying out concrete improvements in our procedures, notably in the calls for proposals."
"We also need to better adapt the programme to the sensitive situations and restrictions often faced by civil society organisations."
"I will certainly continue to rely on your support to carry through those changes."
"Secondly, I am grateful for the recognition of the effectiveness of the EU election-monitoring activities."
"They clearly demonstrate the commitment of the European Union to the democratic process and the sustainable resolution of conflicts."
"That is clearly reflected in the significant increase in the number of observation missions over the last two years, particularly in post-conflict and transition situations."
"The professional and independent approach of EU electoral observers is highly regarded and enjoys credibility and leverage."
"I am sensitive to the need to ensure that any further increase in that area does not squeeze resources from other priorities and I can assure you that I will do my best in that regard."
"Thirdly, I welcome your positive comments on the human rights work of the EU in multilateral fora."
"Great efforts go into consolidating EU positions in such fora, which are often instrumental in achieving progress."
"As the President has already said, that leadership role of the European Union was clearly visible in the negotiations establishing the Human Rights Council."
"I should like to pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency, which capably steered through somewhat difficult waters."
"Now that elections to the Council have taken place, the real work of this new body at the helm of the international and human rights system begins."
"I am confident that it will prove more efficient than the old Commission on Human Rights."
"Fourthly, I should like to pay tribute to the work leading to the report on gender equality and women’s rights."
"The mainstreaming of women’s as well as children’s rights remains a priority for this Commission and for me personally."
"The ongoing work on a comprehensive communication on children’s rights encompassing the internal, as well as the external, affairs of EU action is testimony to that."
"I welcome the recommendations made by the rapporteur on the format of this and future reports."
"I hope that it will be possible to make the 2006 EU Human Rights Report a truly interinstitutional report."
"In that respect, my services have already suggested to the Member States that, as suggested by Parliament, the 2006 report should include a section on human rights guidelines, more emphasis on the use and impact of human rights clauses, and it should also aim to cover the activities of all three institutions – the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"That should not in any way be interpreted as impinging on the prerogatives of Parliament to scrutinise the work of the Council and Commission."
"But there will be space and need for a separate report by Parliament on the European Union’s human rights policy."
"I agree with Mr Howitt that a reinforced effort should be made by the European Union as a whole to address human rights concerns more systematically and to mainstream human rights considerations in EU policies."
"In that task, cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is crucial."
"You can be sure that we are a partner in it."
". Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I am happy to welcome the content of Mr Howitt’s report, particularly the sensitivity he has shown in terms of dealing with the gender perspective in a transversal manner."
"As we pointed out in our opinion attached to the report, we believe that the international legislation supporting and protecting women's rights should systematically become the cornerstone of all bilateral relations, particularly in the case of third countries with which the European Union has signed association and cooperation agreements."
"Furthermore, since the Summit between the European Union and Latin America has just taken place, we wanted the report to condemn the dramatic phenomenon of feminicide, which consists of torturing and killing women merely because they are women, and to highlight the need to put an end to the impunity relating to it."
"Finally, I would also like to point out that we have noted once again that women are the main victims of armed conflicts and, at the same time, from a positive point of view, we must stress the crucial role they play in terms of building peace."
". Mr President, firstly, I welcome the change in the scheduling of debates to allow the human rights report to be debated this afternoon in the primetime slot."
"I want to thank the chairmen of the various groups for that."
"It is recognition of the importance of this report."
"This year, we have a very different report, in style and in content."
"We are essentially undertaking an experiment."
"Parliament has agreed to change the format of its human rights report to have a much tighter focus on issues where the EU has a direct impact or influence and to focus on EU human rights policy, in particular on guidelines that have been set out and the performance of the three institutions in implementing those guidelines."
"We are doing this on the understanding that the Council will work closely with us to produce a common and unified human rights report for the EU."
"That report will provide the general assessment of human rights across the globe and of many of the broader questions and challenges, as well as the more local challenges."
"In the past, as you know, Parliament and the Council have both essentially duplicated each other’s work to a certain extent by producing similar reports."
"Certainly, as rapporteur last year, I saw a huge amount of duplication between the report produced by Parliament and the one the Council produced."
"However, if the Council does not significantly consult and include Parliament when putting its report together in the coming year, we will have to revert to our previous approach."
"I appeal to the Council, therefore, to make the new formula work so that we can have a common, strong, unified human rights report, representing a European view on human rights, that we can send to all corners of the world."
"Parliament can then focus on the job that it was elected to do: assessing the performance of the Council and the Commission on behalf of the people."
"Finally, I want to congratulate Mr Howitt on doing an excellent job this year under new and different circumstances."
"The fact that we only have 14 amendments to the report tomorrow is a reflection on the work he has done."
"I can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report."
". Mr President, everybody should read and study the excellent report by my friend Mr Howitt very carefully, because in it they will find challenges and responses."
"At a time when the great debate is security – and there is no question that security is a great issue – our fears must not lead us to question our basic principles in terms of human rights."
"There can be no European political project without making human rights a priority."
"Lowering our guard in terms of human rights – and that may be what we are doing – means surrendering democratic standards and the European Union’s greatest values."
"We cannot permit this kind of double standard for the sake of . Such double standards are unsustainable since they greatly harm the credibility of our democracy."
"People suffering from persecution, torture, discrimination fear and death expect us to take decisive and coherent action to defend their rights."
"Furthermore, speaking with one voice within international bodies – as the Commissioner and the representative of the Council have said – defending human rights with the voices of twenty-five countries behind us, with the energy that the Union must apply at this time, will strengthen all of us and will at last make it possible for us not to have to go back to thinking, as we are at the moment, about what we call torture, what we call murder, what we call security and what we call the crucial defence of human rights."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this human rights report is clear, comprehensive and ambitious."
"It is an appeal in favour of more coordination and more coherence in the human rights policy of the EU and of the Member States."
"We all know that the rapporteur dreams of a single human rights report reflecting the viewpoints of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and that dream can, and will, become reality one day, provided that, in the short term, the Council takes Parliament’s advice seriously and in the longer term, places economic and commercial considerations second to the principle that human rights are universal and indivisible."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s point of view that the European initiative for democracy and human rights is an extremely important instrument in the EU’s human rights strategy."
"I also share Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s view that more funds need to be set aside for election observation missions, which, certainly in post-conflict situations, are crucial in strengthening democracy and human rights."
"I also have high expectations of the inclusion of human rights clauses in all EU agreements."
"Setting up sound instruments is one thing, but applying them consistently and courageously is quite another, and so it is baffling that the Commission should continue to dither about applying Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement in certain cases of blatant human rights violation in ACP countries, of the sort that are, for example, currently going on in Ethiopia."
"A policy of double standards threatens to make the EU’s human rights policy less credible and should be avoided at all costs."
"What is so good about the Howitt report is that, in moving away from situation ethics, it finally offers a prospect of a more systematic and integrated approach."
"That is something I can support with a great deal of enthusiasm."
". Mr President, the subcommittee decided this year to change the structure of the annual report on human rights."
"Thus, we will no longer have an assessment of the situation in countries, but a report on the Commission's, the Council's and Parliament's implementation of the EU instruments regarding the promotion of human rights and democracy."
"We achieved this result despite the difficulties involved."
"We can congratulate the rapporteur and the political groups."
"Parliament’s role consists in guiding, monitoring and assessing the policy of the Council and of the Commission."
"That is why it is crucial that Parliament continues to draft its own report."
"If we had to draft a report with the input of three different parties for example, we could not criticise a Member State's action – which we can take the liberty of doing with the current report – because all that that Member State would have to do is to veto it."
"The amendment to Article 8 that we have tabled is along these lines."
"Mr Howitt’s report presents a number of interesting and innovative proposals concerning the mechanisms for promoting human rights."
"The report specifically calls for qualified majority voting within the Council and for possible restrictive measures against a third country."
"It logically follows on from the report adopted by Parliament: the Agnoletto report."
"The report also proposes to ensure that the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, which has recently been set up, is not chaired by a State that is responsible for human rights violations."
"Furthermore, it proposes to implement a system aimed at keeping MEPs regularly informed of the actions carried out by the Council and the Commission."
"The report also stresses the need for cross-cutting human rights policies to be drafted within Parliament."
"It is in this spirit that the subcommittee proposed to allow the delegations to put forward candidates for the Sakharov Prize."
"The report refers to the violations of rights, or forms of intolerance, that are practised in certain Member States, to the use of torture, to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or to the banishment of people to countries that use torture, to the use of diplomatic assurances and to extraordinary rendition."
"That is why we must establish a close link between the European Union's internal and external policies and perhaps contemplate having just one European Parliament report on human rights, drafted together with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as the issues related to asylum and immigration require."
"As such, I reject paragraph 97, which in some ways supports the implementation of the pilot Regional Protection Programmes."
"The Commission plans to implement one of these initial programmes in Belarus, a country responsible for numerous human rights violations, which maintains no diplomatic relationship with the Union and which offers no guarantee regarding the protection of migrants."
"These programmes do not seem appropriate to me."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Howitt report represents a significant advance on the past insofar as it tries to analyse the effects of the European Union's human rights policies and, above all, their effectiveness with regard to third countries."
"The first, significant difference of this report comes in the shape of a request for subsequent annual reports to include an assessment of whether the democracy clause, which was adopted on 14 February, is actually being complied with."
"I must point out, however, that neither the Council nor the Commission has given any precise indication of the way in which it intends to incorporate that human rights and democracy clause in the commercial dealings between Europe and third countries."
"As regards the fledgling UN Commission for Human Rights, the document to be voted on calls on the European Union to support the activities of that body and, at the same time, promotes the universal ratification of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court, especially on the part of the United States, for which no legal exception can be made."
"The document in question also specifically condemns the bilateral agreements that a number of EU countries have drawn up with the United States for the purposes of guaranteeing impunity to US soldiers."
"Lastly, it calls on the European Union to take a consistent approach to human rights, in the specific cases of China, with regard to the Tibetan people, and of Guantánamo, on the subject of which it calls for the immediate closure of all of the detention centres."
"Nevertheless, I cannot fail to mention some shortcomings of the report too. It does not in fact make any reference to the European Union’s failure to commit itself to supporting human rights on the occasion of the sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong."
"On the subject of Iraq, moreover, Article 38 is too vague: it does not criticise the human rights violations carried out by the occupying forces, or the use of illegal weapons such as, for instance, the white phosphorous used in Falluja."
"Finally, on the subject of Colombia, Article 41 is not as explicit as the situation of the Latin American country's citizens would, on the contrary, require, such as in the case of the residents of peace communities who have been affected by countless massacres where the perpetrators have gone unpunished."
"The report fails, in fact, to firmly condemn the climate of violence in the country and to acknowledge a correlation between this situation and the recent legislative measures, such as the ‘Peace and justice’ law, which actually allow paramilitary forces to become part of the Colombian army."
"I have one final observation to make: although I support the request for the European Union's annual report on human rights to provide for the involvement of the European Parliament, I do, however, think it just as necessary that Parliament continues to draft its own specific report, with the aim of ensuring that Parliament monitors the European Commission's practical commitment towards human rights and of assessing that monitoring effort."
"– Mr President, I wonder what human rights we are talking about, when our economic policy creates an eminently class-ridden society."
"If we really want to consider human rights, we will not do so in this House; let us go to the rest rooms so you can see the women working there."
"No relation of ours is working there; poor, respectable women from North Africa are working there."
"So who is talking about human rights?"
"Those who exterminated, who eliminated an entire race from the face of the earth? The Red Indians."
"Who is talking about human rights?"
"Those who based their wealth on the natives in their colonies for centuries on end?"
"Who is talking about human rights?"
"Those who, with a beer in the evening, enjoy the charms of some beautiful, poor, weak girl from the former eastern bloc?"
"Who is talking about human rights?"
"Those who support and coexist with dictators who torture their people in order to invade another country?"
"Or is that not what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq?"
"Who is talking?"
"Those who turn a blind eye to what has been happening for three years now in Iraq?"
"Who is talking?"
"Those who accept Turkey in Europe, when a month ago they murdered a Catholic priest there, burned the effigy of the ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Christians and set light to the synagogues?"
"I therefore am not prepared to talk about human rights."
"My conscience forbids me with everything it sees happening around it, with everything that we all allow to happen."
". I would like to thank Mr Howitt for the enormous amount of work he has done in preparing this excellent report, which reflects the European Parliament’s role in the European Union’s human rights policy strategy."
"For a successful human rights policy it is essential for the EU Member States to implement a joint, consistent and visible policy in bilateral relations with countries that do not respect human rights."
"Our relations with Russia, as a strategic partner, are very important."
"It is therefore essential that in the report the Commission and the Council are requested to discuss violations of human rights in Chechnya during talks with Russia."
"In the report, hopes are expressed concerning the newly-created UN Human Rights Council."
"The election of Cuba, Nigeria and other similar countries, however, prompts concerns regarding the election mechanism and whether the Council’s work will be more successful than that of the Commission on Human Rights."
"The European Union must therefore systematically object to the allocation of the presidency to such countries and the Council must express the common EU stance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the report overplays the role that the EU carries out on the world stage regarding human rights, so much so that it highlights the inconsistency of the measures taken against third countries."
"The request for the Council to identify those countries that give particular cause for concern in terms of human rights violations would have counted for something if, at the same time, it had produced measures against those countries; above all, if it had the courage to implement those measures against large countries too, such as China and the United States."
"We must certainly make respect for human rights obligations a priority in the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, and the same goes for the stabilisation and association negotiations with countries from the former Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The Commission must therefore demonstrate that no grey areas exist in that regard."
"I acknowledge the fact that the fight against trafficking in human beings, which underpins illegal immigration, particularly from eastern Europe, Africa and China, is now regarded as a priority that is widely shared by the Community institutions."
"As for the concerns expressed by Mr Howitt on Iran – with reference to the first few months of President Ahmadinejad’s term of office – I frankly regard such concerns as simplistic and demagogic, in the same way that I regard the EU's supportive stance towards US policy in Iraq and the violations in Guantánamo as servile and counter-productive."
"To conclude, I believe that a progressive scale of measures and sanctions to be applied in the event of a human rights violation should be defined as a matter of priority."
"Arrests on political grounds, the persecution of minorities, acts of torture and the repression of a person’s freedom of religion, speech and expression are acts that, wherever they take place in the world, require practical action from the Union."
"Mr President, this annual event clearly demonstrates this Parliament’s total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights in the world, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature."
"We must welcome the constructively critical approach that Mr Howitt takes in his report. We should accept that, on many occasions, we should take a good look at our own house before throwing ourselves into putting the world right."
"This Parliament puts its commitment to human rights into practice by means of its resolutions, by means of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought and by means of the strong positions it has expressed with regard to the International Criminal Court and the death penalty."
"I believe that we must support the European Commission and the Council’s efforts to introduce the human rights dimension into the European Union's external actions with regard to the candidate countries, Mr President; with regard to the neighbouring countries, within the context of the neighbourhood policy, Commissioner; by means of the democratic clause that we have with third countries; by means of the instrument for the defence of democracy and human rights; and, in particular, by means of the initiative that the Commission has implemented in the form of electoral observer missions in third countries, which are a privileged instrument which enhance the image and the respect for human rights that the European Union must try to communicate throughout the world."
"Mr President, the Union's three institutions – the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – must work together and make every possible effort to ensure that this 21st century is the century of human rights and that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms become the norm in every region of the planet."
"– Mr President, the European Union’s policy in the field of human rights should shape the European Neighbourhood Policy and also become an effective instrument in today’s global civilisation for the protection of people threatened by genocide and war crimes, people fighting for democracy and fundamental freedoms and all those who experience discrimination due to ethnic origin, religious beliefs, gender, disability or sexual orientation."
"Human rights policy cannot apply double standards – one approach for small countries and a different one for large countries that are of strategic importance to the European Union."
"The policy should be effective."
"In view of this, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights takes on particular importance, as does increasing the budget of this institution."
"The European Parliament must take on the responsibility for raising the importance of human rights protection in the European Union."
"It must become a place where new initiatives in this field will emerge, and the institution which coordinates the human rights actions of the different Union institutions."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work on this report."
"I am pleased that we have moved away from just a list of countries where human rights abuses are a problem and I welcome the new measures we are taking in this report."
"I hope we continue in this way."
"Having said that, I am pleased that the situation in Kashmir has been included. I hope we will eventually find a just solution involving the Kashmiri people that will end human rights abuses from all sides."
"I am also glad that we call in this report for the Americans to close down Guantanamo Bay."
"I think it is very important that we do this and that detainees have a fair trial."
"Again, that is included in this report."
"I am sorry, however, that my amendment on CIA flights was not accepted by the committee, but I note Amendment 5, which seeks to rectify this situation."
"It is very important that we include CIA flights in this report."
"I would have liked a stronger statement on people with mental health problems, as the rapporteur knows, but I am pleased that they have been included. I am equally pleased that disabled people have been included generally, with a particular emphasis on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities."
"As many of you know, I was Parliament’s rapporteur on that issue."
"I am glad that there is a strong mention of trafficking in human beings."
"I, along with Mr Coveney and various other Members, have been campaigning on this subject for quite some time."
"I am sorry, however, that we are told repeatedly in our committee that we cannot mention human rights abuses within the European Union."
"That, I believe, takes away from the strength of our argument when we are talking about human rights abuses in other parts of the world."
"– Mr President, the report on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2005 and the EU's human rights policy is one that I welcome, agree with, and endorse, in that it sheds a self-critical light on the EU’s human rights dialogues and gives a balanced evaluation of them."
"Despite the progress that has been achieved, through, for example, the initiatives taken by the human rights sub-committee and the appointment of a personal representative for human rights, deficits are still apparent, particularly in the EU’s dialogues on human rights with third countries."
"I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the pre-eminent importance of human rights, which are universal, and it is vital that greater account be taken of them in every area of policy and that they become a permanent component of them."
"Among this House’s essential functions are the global prosecution of violations of human rights and the promotion and defence of those rights."
"What I would like to see in future would be closer attention given to the human rights situation in the countries that are applying for accession to the EU."
"Mr President, another year, another report, but what real change?"
"Still we trumpet human rights and democracy clauses in partnership agreements with third countries, but non-compliance largely seems to go unmarked."
"Apart from a single suspension in the case of relatively insignificant Uzbekistan, these clauses might as well not exist, especially with regard to major economic forces like China."
"There it seems to some of us that the value of trade persuades the EU to do less than it could about flagrant breaches of human rights and instances of religious persecution."
"Indeed, one is tempted to say that such is the EU’s apparent awe of China that it avoided an opportunity during the year to sponsor a critical motion in the United Nations."
"Likewise, when it came to an opportunity there to join in condemning Zimbabwe for its mass forced evictions, the EU countries also avoided that issue."
"It is true that we talk the talk of human rights, but too often, it seems to me, we hold back when there are economic interests which we seem to hold dearer."
"Today we are discussing a truly important report on the human rights situation in the world in 2005 and European Union policy in regard to this matter."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, for his cooperation."
"Mr President, the European Union continues to be leading in the world in the area of human rights, and of all the European Union's institutions, the European Parliament is the fiercest defender of human rights."
"The bad news is however, that Europe is much better at making declarations than it is at adhering to them."
"The Union is able to take up some sterling work on human rights, but in some strange way is unable to integrate decisions on human rights into its policies and programmes."
"If we sincerely cherish our values and want to defend them, this situation must change."
"I believe it is high time to identify the countries raising the greatest concern in each annual report, and thus develop an initiative facilitating the establishment of priorities."
"In order to provide short and concise information about countries which are prone to crisis and to trigger joint actions by the Council of Ministers and foreign ministers of Member States, the Council already has drafted the monitoring lists which are revised every six months."
"Such information could be used to draw up the lists of countries causing particular concern with the aim of drawing special attention to them."
"It is also clear that significant improvements are needed in respect of the visibility and dissemination of the reports, especially amongst journalists and the national parliaments."
"To conclude, I would like to draw your attention, Mr President, to a provision in the report which I feel is very important."
"I quote, ‘the European Parliament welcomes the choice of freedom of expression as a major human rights theme during the UK Presidency; is concerned at the high number of journalists worldwide being convicted for alleged defamation of public officials or politicians; asks the Council to advocate a worldwide moratorium on such imprisonment of journalists as a first step’."
"I am firmly convinced that in this context we, the European Parliament, must mention countries where the situation is particularly bad, that is, Cuba, Belarus, North Korea and the People's Republic of China."
"And this must be included in our resolution."
"I am truly satisfied with Mr Howitt's report which I believe is exceptional in the way it does not distinguish between large and small States and treat them under equal standards."
"However, in my opinion the paragraph on China lacks some highlighting of the Tibet problems."
"Tibet, as we know, was occupied by China, but for some reason we have recognised it as an inseparable part of China."
"China is committing genocide against the Tibetan people, but nowhere have we even mentioned that."
"The fact alone that each year around 3 000 children, and I stress children, escape to India via the Himalayas and Nepal just so that they can learn their own language, is worthy of notice."
"The Tibetan nation and its culture are being extinguished right in front of our eyes."
"For Tibetans even cultural autonomy is an unattainable dream, and negotiations about this between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and China are fictitious, as being conducted on the expert not on the principle level."
"I believe that we must change our position in respect of Tibet, if we really do not want to see the Tibetan people and their culture destroyed."
"Mr President, we find ourselves once again debating the situation of human rights in the world."
"I thank the rapporteur for his evident hard work in compiling this comprehensive report, for the cooperative attitude he has demonstrated throughout and his support for the inclusion of Kashmir."
"For this, I personally thank him."
"Colleagues, we often speak of human rights in the abstract, in terms of well-rehearsed subjects and themes, but in this instance I should like to ask colleagues to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday abroad."
"You take a taxi journey to visit your friends and family that ends in tragedy."
"There are no witnesses, for the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first policeman you can find."
"You say he pulled a gun on you and what you did was in self-defence."
"This leads to a legal process which finds you innocent, then finds you guilty, then starts over again until every appeal is exhausted and you are ultimately condemned to death, with due legal process having been thrown out of the equation."
"All this takes 18 years; half your life on death row: a cruel life sentence in itself."
"This is not an abstraction."
"This is the tale of the rough justice of a British and EU citizen, Mirza Tahir Hussain, condemned to death on 1 June – his 36th birthday – a matter of days away."
"Today, we reaffirm this House’s role as a defender of human rights with a long history of opposition to the death penalty."
"I implore you all to live up to the responsibility this position carries and make representations to the President of Pakistan, appealing for clemency for Mirza Tahir Hussain."
"Mr President, during the recent UK Presidency, the European Union intervened diplomatically in 26 separate matters related to human rights, and published 49 statements on the issue."
"It is laudable that we are spending so much time here at the European Parliament on issues related to human rights in the broadest sense."
"During each Strasbourg session we hold debates on infringements of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law."
"However, while we debate the situation in African or Asian countries, we cannot forget about the Member States."
"Such problems affect a large number of them, and especially some of the new Member States."
"Let us therefore protect and fight for human rights throughout the world, but let us keep our eyes and ears open and remember that just next door, in a neighbouring state, they are not always respected."
"I say this with the utmost conviction as a practising lawyer who sees clear evidence of this happening."
"– The Howitt report contains a fresh approach to the manner in which Europe views its fight for a global human rights culture, an approach that abandons the purely descriptive method and challenges the European institutions as regards the effectiveness of their actions."
"Greater institutional integration for the Union, political, not just technical, relations with the Council of Europe and a binding charter of rights: this is the basis of a European front that takes rights seriously."
"Parliament is today calling for all European political institutions to play their part in this master plan of spreading the sacred principles of humanity and the rule of law around the world."
"Europe cannot be an end in itself."
"The enlightened ideal at its core implies that it must take its crusade of rights around the world, and that it must have the courage to resist the temptation of , because the politics of interested parties leads to uneven demands on the Member States in the area of rights."
"I wish to stress the importance of concerted action on the part of the Union and all Member States on human rights, because on this issue there remain a great many contradictions that diminish the moral authority of the Union's political system in negotiations and weaken the impact of European policy."
"The Union presidencies have a great responsibility to ensure that the human rights policies of the Union and its Member States are consistent across the board."
"A strong, concerted European rights policy would address the litany of horrors that, unfortunately, is not exclusive to underdeveloped countries."
"The death penalty, and even the exploitation of work that leads to company relocations, to give two very different examples, can only be combated with a tough concerted rights policy."
"Furthermore, an increasingly ambitious Europe in terms of military presence can only be an increasingly ambitious Europe if it has a culture of rights, a political Europe that has people at its core, because that is the nature of Europe."
"– It is clear that Europe is becoming more visible and more active when it comes to addressing the issue of human rights."
"However, the amount of human rights breaches taking place around us which are being addressed, and whether Europe is showing its teeth, is debatable."
"It is also very clear that many of the different institutions are giving the impression that they are acting alone."
"I am not referring to the Council, the Commission and Parliament, but, for example, to the banking institution."
"I think that Europe should use the power that it has."
"There is compatibility, and I believe that there should be collaboration between tackling the problems of human rights on the one hand, and economic power or the power of the assistance that Europe should provide on the other."
"I am aware that this is difficult."
"Nevertheless, I would like to conclude by referring to paragraph 14 of number 90, which states: 'welcomes the choice of freedom of expression as a major human rights theme'."
"I would like to mention this because in my country, Malta, two journalists, Daphne Caruana Galizia and Saviour Balzan, have just been the victims of arson attacks."
"I would like to express my solidarity with Maltese journalists against these attacks, which are a direct attack on their fundamental human rights."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, emphasis on the importance of human rights has been a special feature of pan-European organisations during the entire period since the Second World War."
"The importance of human rights has not waned as the years have gone by; on the contrary, it has grown."
"At a time when trade between the EU and third countries has increased and the EU is involved in counter-terrorist activity, it is important to remember that human rights are not of subordinate importance or completely insignificant."
"Human rights are not subordinate to terrorism or active commerce."
"The EU can have a huge influence on human rights if it speaks with one voice."
"The EU has not always managed to do that, although of course it has sometimes."
"At present one would hope that the EU could concentrate more than it does now on eradicating hunger and poverty."
"Hunger and real poverty are among the worst violations of human rights right now in the world."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, for the excellent cooperation that he has shown, and for taking into consideration the many amendments we have tabled."
"Furthermore, I was delighted to see that the rapporteur expressly emphasised the importance of the fact that the report resulted from cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Only in this way will NGOs representing different political groups and their views come to the fore."
"Mr President, in my speech I would like to point out three issues related to the Howitt report."
"First of all, the European Union should have an effective financial instrument along the lines of the American foundations that support those who fight for human rights across the world."
"The organisations and societies which often work illegally and which build and defend democracy, freedom of speech and respect for basic rights deserve our support."
"Meanwhile, over the last 12 months, debates within the European Union institutions have centred solely on the creation of a new agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, which is supposed to deal with respect for these rights, but only in the Member States of the European Union."
"In view of this, I would like to quote paragraph 56 of the report, which ‘calls on the Commission to take seriously into consideration the position of the European Parliament seeking a specific human rights instrument for 2007-2013; looks forward to receiving the Commission's communication in this matter’."
"The second issue is the deplorable fact that the European Union refused to support the resolution on Chechnya at the 61st session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"Atrocities are carried out by the Russian army in Chechnya and between 3 000 and 5 000 Chechens have disappeared without trace."
"These were unarmed civilians who were detained by the Russians."
"The rapporteur is quite right when he states in his report that the attitude adopted by the European Union suggests that the Union is applying one set of rules in the case of small countries and a different set of rules in the case of larger ones."
"The third issue I wanted to mention is the critical situation of Christians living in Muslim countries."
"This situation has deteriorated in the last few months."
"The war in Iraq and the outrage sparked by the publication of the caricatures in European newspapers have created a state of constant danger for Christian minorities in the Muslim world."
"Mr President, we must regard the process of globalisation as an opportunity for freedom and social progress."
"Globalisation is associated with a higher demand for fundamental human freedoms, but only if the opportunities it provides are utilised appropriately."
"I have been thinking about the thoughts expressed by the President of the Republic of Greece today."
"Europe is the strongest bastion of humanism."
"It is important that we can continue to say the same in the future, to make this clear to the rest of the world, and to make it into an example to be followed."
"The European Union is an international player with a crucial mission to protect human rights, strengthen democracy and ensure that globalisation actually means the achievement of social cohesion."
"I believe that it is important for the European Union to insist on the enforcement of fundamental human rights in its relations with third countries."
"It must employ pragmatically the opportunities for political dialogue provided by foreign trade."
"The strength of the report is that it warns us not to monitor compliance with human rights only outside of the borders of the European Union, because there is enough to be done in this respect within our own borders, too."
"The report can serve as a firm foundation to ensure that in the future we will not just accept statements regarding human rights, but we will also excel in complying with them and in ensuring their enforcement."
"My thanks to the rapporteur."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion it is perfectly natural for Parliament to make greater demands of the other institutions and, of course, I listened to your speeches with close attention."
"I think that criticism is necessary if we are going to make progress, but I have also noted, both in Mr Howitt's report and in this debate, some positive comments regarding our policies, for which I would thank you once again."
"In a field such as the promotion and protection of human rights, the assessment is inevitably mixed."
"I should like to tell you how I see the situation."
"First, is the EU an important player in this field, which counts and is counted on?"
"My response to that, without doubt, is yes."
"We have continually seen this demonstrated."
"Our state and non-state partners, both States and international organisations, are continuing to turn to us and to see us as a major player, and sometimes as indispensable, owing to our political credibility, our influence, our expertise and the instruments we have at our disposal."
"Secondly, does the EU have the right tools to perform its activities?"
"My response to that too is yes."
"We have access to international instruments as part of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, to name but two."
"We have the framework of our widely quoted bilateral agreements, including human rights clauses, and common political guidelines in many sectors, political dialogues and approaches of all kinds. We also have the financial, geographical and thematic instruments."
"Thirdly, are we contributing and doing enough?"
"To that, I would tend to say no, particularly if our actions are examined in general terms."
"If we look at specific situations, however, such as the adoption of the resolution establishing the new Human Rights Council or cases relating very specifically to countries and individuals, there are many instances where we made a difference."
"In any event, the EU, including the Member States, has certainly been the player that has made the most important contributions at global level and really has had a very strong presence, even though we are not always as visible as you or we would wish."
"Finally, is the human rights policy we are pursuing effective?"
"Are we having an impact?"
"For my part, I, like Parliament, should like us to increase our effectiveness and impact."
"To do so, we need to take a big step forward in quality terms, particularly in terms of consistency: consistency between the policy pursued at EU level and those pursued by the various Member States, and consistency between the EU's political will and the national interests that come to light at certain key moments in bilateral relations."
"And we need, in some cases, to create a better balance between our multilateral agenda and the bilateral agenda."
"We also need to mobilise all the institutions of the Union, including, of course, the European Parliament."
"As I have already said, we are very much in favour of a report drawn up jointly by the three institutions."
"Let us work towards this!"
"Parliament can certainly count on me."
"Neither I nor my services will spare any efforts."
"You can count on us for the assessment and also the implementation of the human rights policy, even if we too are often faced with a political reality that is not easy to control."
"However, if we want to increase the impact of our policy, particularly by improving the consistency of our actions at European and national levels and between the various institutions, Parliament's annual report, like Mr Howitt's, must in my opinion be the inspiration for our actions."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in saying, at the end of this debate, what a joy it is that we are all agreed on the need for the three institutions of the European Union to speak to the outside world with one voice if they are to be effective."
"A very large number of issues have been addressed in this debate, but, whether our concern is with human rights or with development cooperation, the fundamental question every time is whether we are doing enough, and the answer to that question is always ‘no’; there is always more that we could be doing."
"All of us – Parliament, Commission and Council – must be at all times capable of that sort of self-criticism, for whenever human rights are at stake, when people are tortured, when their rights are trodden underfoot – as they are in many countries – then what that means is that we, who are tasked with the defence of human rights, are not doing enough."
"That is why we need to give constant thought to how we could improve our performance, and what this debate has done is to help us to do just that."
"A range of issues have been addressed, and I would just like to touch very briefly on one or two of them."
"It was said, and quite rightly too, how important civil society is in terms of human rights."
"Institutions of state and governments are particularly dependent on the cooperation of civil society and non-governmental organisations."
"Thinking back, for example, to our recent experience with the EU/Latin America/Caribbean summit, there was much evidence at it of civil society involvement in human rights matters, and both governments and parliaments had to take this very seriously."
"Human rights and good governance have an increasing role to play in development cooperation."
"I am sure we are all agreed – and this has become evident to me from my conversations with the Committee on Development Cooperation – that the deliberate promotion of good governance and human rights is a vitally important part of development cooperation."
"Mr Romeva i Rueda was quite right to mention, in this debate, the issue of violence against women, but I would like to point out that my colleague Mrs Plassnik will be devoting particular attention to this issue."
"Mr Coveney said that the Council and Parliament should not duplicate each other’s work."
"I fully agree with that."
"Of course we must respect each institution’s individual role."
"That is what the three institutions must do."
"However, at the same time, we must cooperate where necessary in order to be more efficient."
"Mr Agnoletto and others discussed the human rights clauses and raised the issue of whether the European Union, the Council and the Commission, should actually apply these clauses – which are to be found in a range of treaties – or whether we should do no more than apply ourselves to a sort of"
"To that, I would like to say that I regard the human rights clauses as very important, in that they do not only provide for sanctions or for the suspension of treaties."
"Above all – and this is what strikes me as of the essence – they constitute a reason for engaging in dialogue with states, and this right to engage in dialogue, which we enjoy by virtue of the human rights clauses in the various treaties, is one of which we make use, and we do so irrespective of whether the states in question are large or small."
"I can do no other than concur with Mr Vaidere, and say that we all hope that the Human Rights Council will be more efficient than the Human Rights Commission, for that was, after all, the reason why the European Union was so committed to it being set up."
"I would ask, though, that you should not, at this early juncture, even before the Human Rights Council has met for the first time, throw in the towel in the belief that the people elected to it make further improvement impossible."
"This is where a certain realism is called for, without losing a firm hold on the relevant principles."
"I do believe that the chances of the Human Rights Council becoming an effective instrument will turn out to be unaffected."
"Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and others stressed the European Union’s role in the World at large, not least in connection with the accession negotiations and the relationship with the Balkan states."
"I would like to point out that the Copenhagen criteria continue to be the most important factor in determining whether or not states can begin negotiations towards accession, that respect for human rights is a quite essential criterion even before such negotiations commence, and that it must – self-evidently – also be one while they are in progress."
"Mrs Lynne talked about trafficking in human beings."
"I fully agree that this issue is very important."
"I should just like to mention that the European Union cooperates closely in this respect with the OSCE, which is very active in this field."
"We should continue this cooperation and, again, there should be no duplication but rather a synergy effect."
"Mrs Lynne and others talked about the question of human rights in the European Union."
"Of course there are human rights violations in all European Union countries, including my own."
"However, what makes the European Union different from other regions in the world is that we have effective instruments to deal with human rights violations."
"All European Union Member States are also members of the Council of Europe and signatories to the Convention on Human Rights."
"There is the unique instrument of the Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, and within the European Union we also have the necessary mechanisms and instruments to take care of any violations."
"We should not confuse the situation within the European Union with that in other states where such instruments do not exist."
"I fully agree with Mrs Esteves and others that there should be no double standards and that the credibility of the European Union is the most important thing."
"That is why I reject all allegations that we distinguish between small and large countries."
"I do not think we treat one country differently from another, which is important."
"So, assuming I have understood the report correctly, I thank you all very much for the support the Council’s policy has received."
"Let us continue to defend human rights everywhere in the world and let us do so together."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The EU is the world's standard-bearer where the protection of human rights is concerned."
"On countless occasions, this Parliament has come out in favour of improving living conditions and human dignity with regard to various situations that sadly continue to be under the gaze of international public opinion on a daily basis."
"Much still remains to be done, however, if we are to turn our intentions into practical actions aimed at creating effective strategies to improve the international human rights situation."
"The EU itself must first of all ensure that European policies on external relations, international trade and development make this commitment one of their priorities and incorporate a human rights perspective in every activity that they give rise to."
"Consistency is also duly required between the Community’s actions and those carried out by each individual Member State."
"Special attention must be paid to countries with which the EU has closer links: candidate countries – especially Turkey – and partner countries in the Neighbourhood Policy, and I am specifically referring to the Caucasus republics which, despite the significant progress they have made, still have many unresolved issues with regard to ethnic and religious tolerance and to freedom of expression."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt on his report."
"Our twin reports in Parliament on human rights in the world and human rights in the Union demonstrate the importance we place on this issue."
"Our consistent campaign against the death penalty, whether in the United States or China, Iran or Japan, is to be welcomed."
"My own Government in Britain was influential in pushing this forward during its Presidency last year."
"My only criticism on this Foreign Affairs Committee report would be its unevenness in places and its over-reliance on third-hand reports."
"For example, Saudi Arabia barely gets a mention."
"The situation is that the majority of the population – its women – face vicious discrimination."
"Followers of all faiths, save its own peculiar form of Islam, face persecution and where torture and mutilation are rife."
"Equally, it reports persecution of journalists in North Korea."
"Yet as someone who follows the country closely, it is a complaint I have never heard."
"There is much rightly to raise with the Government of North Korea regarding human rights in the prisons and camps, plus the humanitarian situation in the countryside, rather than these blanket and unsupported catch-all allegations that do no credit to our work."
"When we talk about the European Community and common European values, the first issue we must mention is the protection of human rights."
"The European Constitution will represent a further, considerable step forward, by giving constitutional status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and by creating an independent European human rights protection system."
"The increasingly intensive involvement of Europe in foreign affairs means that it can exercise an important influence on human rights when it speaks up as a unified body, and it can be a particularly influential player on international fora."
"The report, too, shows that the current situation is mixed and contradictory."
"Although the European Union continues to be one of the main protectors of human rights in the world, it excels much more in issuing statements than in following them up, and in many cases it does not integrate or enforce human rights considerations in its other policies and programmes."
"However, we must welcome the fact that last year the European Union supported, as a priority, the abolition of the death penalty throughout the world, and it addressed intensively, among other things, the situation in China, Chechnya and Zimbabwe, as well as the consolidation of union rights in Iran and Cambodia."
"I believe it is important that during the negotiation of both stabilisation and association agreements, human rights are given primary emphasis, in the spirit of Copenhagen."
"I, too, advocate that compliance with United Nations and Council of Europe treaties – among the latter, for instance, the treaties on minority rights – are also given priority in contractual relations with candidate states and states participating in the Stabilisation and Association process."
"I am convinced that as the only directly elected body of the European Union, Parliament must play a leading role in the development of human rights, and it must ensure that the other European Union institutions also bear in mind human rights, at all times."
"I welcome this report by my colleague Richard Howitt on Human Rights in the World 2005."
"He is right to draw to our attention to the fact that while the EU is vigorous in promoting human rights, its efforts are largely confined to specialist and one-off representations."
"There is, sadly, a general failure by the EU to address human rights concerns systematically and continuously with respect to third countries and to mainstream human rights policy with respect to the Union’s trade, development, and other external policies with such countries."
"We need a common, consistent and transparent policy for dealing with abuses of human rights in third countries."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- the second report A6-0109/2006 by Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a financing instrument for development and economic cooperation [COM(2004)0629 C6-0128/2004 2004/0220(COD)];"
"- A6-0164/2006 by Mr Szymański, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument [COM(2004)0628 – C6-0129/2004 – 2004/0219(COD)];"
"- A6-0157/2006 by Mrs Beer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Instrument for Stability [COM(2004)0630 – C6-0251/2004 – 2004/0223(COD)];"
"- A6-0155/2006 by Mr Szent-Iványi, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) [COM(2004)0627 – C6-0047/2005 – 2004/0222(CNS)]."
". Mr President, I greatly appreciate that Parliament has decided to discuss together the package of instruments for the delivery of external assistance for the future period spanning 2007 to 2013."
"It is over a year and a half since the Commission tabled its proposals."
"I wish to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by Parliament and successive Council Presidencies to find imaginative and constructive solutions to the challenges that we have encountered on these innovative proposals."
"The new simplified architecture was the first attempt to streamline all the instruments for external spending."
"The simplification proposed was welcomed by both Parliament and the Council."
"And soon after Parliament began its work, a certain number of important questions were raised."
"These matters were set out in a letter in April last year from the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Brok, and the rapporteur for the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, Mr Mitchell."
"There were six issues in total and on these I believe Parliament has obtained full satisfaction."
"Your first concern was to ensure that the instruments were adopted under codecision whenever the Treaty made that possible."
"In response, the Council and the Commission agreed that the Stability Instrument should pass from consultation of Parliament to codecision."
"Three of the four instruments are codecided."
"This gives Parliament a fully legitimate but unprecedented degree of legislative power over the framework covering external spending."
"Parliament also wished to ensure that the instruments would be subject to a mid-term review and to expiry dates."
"These points were accepted."
"We have also agreed that before undertaking the review, Parliament should examine the operation of this instrument to identify any dysfunctional situations that may have arisen, and Parliament’s report would be considered by the Commission in carrying out the review of the instrument."
"Should the review identify problems that require an adaptation of the relevant instruments and regulations, the Commission will submit the necessary legislative proposals."
"That review should be carried out in 2009, as requested by Parliament."
"Parliament also wanted separate financial envelopes for different geographic regions and thematic sectors."
"The Commission has provided a breakdown of the envelopes for the codecided instruments and agrees to the inclusion of a breakdown in the regulations."
"One of the most challenging points has been the involvement of Parliament in priority-setting and strategy documents."
"So far as priority-setting is concerned, the necessary policy elements will be included in the draft regulations."
"This has been done both for the Stability Instrument and for the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"Unfortunately, the progress achieved on these instruments has not yet been mirrored in the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument."
"Parliament’s future involvement in strategy documents is now covered by two declarations annexed to the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"I have written to Mr Brok on how these could be put into practice."
"We envisage a mechanism for a dialogue with Parliament, which should allow us then to present the selected strategy documents, explain our choices and receive Parliament’s view on the choices and how the strategy should be implemented."
"Finally, for the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, Parliament wished to have a clear distinction between policy towards developing countries and towards industrialised countries."
"We have no difficulty in accepting that."
"There has been a strong demand from Parliament for a separate instrument to support democracy and human rights."
"In January 2006, the Commission set out its vision for the thematic programme on democracy and human rights."
"I recognise that Parliament is not convinced on this."
"I have listened to Parliament and I understand its reasons."
"I am committed, therefore, to resolving this point to the satisfaction of Parliament as part of an overall agreement on the instruments."
"This is a clear commitment on behalf of the Commission to a separate human rights instrument."
"This position is shared by the Council."
"I should now like to say a few words on each of the instruments that are before this House today."
"The Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance – the IPA – has been welcomed by Parliament for its policy-driven approach."
"There has been a fruitful dialogue on the proposed regulation with Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Szent-Iványi."
"Indeed, a compromise text for IPA, addressing a number of issues of concern to Parliament, was agreed by COREPER on 3 May."
"The Commission fully supports this compromise, which reflects to a large extent the amendments proposed by Mr Szent-Iványi in his report."
"I am pleased to make a formal declaration today, which I hope will also solve the major outstanding issue of Parliament’s involvement in the suspension of assistance:"
"‘The Commission will take due account of any request made by the European Parliament to the Commission to submit a proposal to suspend or restore Community assistance, and will provide a prompt and sufficiently detailed reply thereto’."
"For the Stability Instrument, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Beer, for the central and positive role she has played in the negotiations to date, which have touched on sensitive institutional issues."
"The report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs has had a very positive impact on the political compromise reached in COREPER, for which I thank you."
"That compromise is very finely balanced."
"I believe it will form the basis of a deal between the institutions."
"Reflecting concerns of Parliament, we have also agreed more policy content under the Stability Instrument."
"There are strengthened references to respect for human rights in relation to the fight against terrorism."
"The Commission is ready to make a political declaration further underlining this and confirming its commitment to informing Parliament of exceptional assistance measures as they are adopted."
"I shall be writing to you shortly setting out some ideas on the establishment of a Peace-Building Partnership to improve practical implementation of civilian peace-building projects."
"For the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, we have worked intensively with Mr Szymánski, Parliament’s rapporteur, and the Presidency."
"As a result, we now have a text which addresses the concerns of Parliament."
"An agreement on this text was reached in COREPER last week and we are very hopeful that, on this basis, an agreement is now within reach."
"For the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, work is not as advanced as for the other instruments."
"I am convinced that the main building blocks of a compromise are, however, within reach."
"Thanks to the cogent arguments of the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, it is agreed that the new legislative set-up must preserve Parliament’s codecision rights."
"It is now a question of the best way to do it."
"The Commission is calling for pragmatism, given our shared objective of achieving genuine simplification of external assistance."
"In more concrete terms, let me come to the main amendments proposed in Mr Mitchell’s report."
"Given their total number, I will concentrate on those that relate to the architecture of the instrument."
"First of all, a series of amendments – Amendments 48, 50, 51, 54, 55, 56, 65, 66 and 67 – propose to establish separate policy-setting regulations and a multiannual financial framework to be adopted by codecision in addition to the DCECI."
"This alternative to the incorporation of policy content and financial provisions into the regulation goes against the objective of simplification."
"The Commission is more than willing to expand the geographic and thematic policy content of the DCECI to preserve Parliament’s rights."
"We have said so on several occasions."
"However, we consider that the best way to achieve this is to follow the Council Presidency’s proposal and to do it in a single regulation."
"Secondly, three amendments – Amendments 4, 23 and 114 – reflect one of the general points made by Parliament which I referred to earlier: the continuation of an instrument in favour of human rights and democracy."
"Thirdly, five amendments – Amendments 1, 5, 6, 23 and 115 – build on the initial request to establish a clear distinction between cooperation with industrialised countries and cooperation with developing countries."
"They actually go further and propose the splitting of cooperation with industrialised countries from the DCECI."
"The Commission understands the underlying concern behind these amendments."
"The Commission could consider, for instance – if this is a condition for a final compromise on a clear and logical structure – the splitting of cooperation with industrialised countries into a separate instrument."
"Fourthly, three amendments – Amendments 2, 25 and 26 – call for a change in the legal basis, that is, a single legal basis, Article 179, without Article 181a of the Treaty."
"I know legal advice differs on this."
"For the Commission, the issue is one of legal security."
"The Commission also understands Parliament’s argument that a wide understanding of development cooperation should offer the necessary comfort."
"I would be ready to re-consider our position if a wide definition of development cooperation based on Article 179 is ensured."
"Fifth, one amendment – Amendment 51 on sectoral spending targets – is of particular concern."
"This is the establishment of sectoral spending targets."
"This would run contrary to the principles of partnership and ownership with beneficiary countries and it would introduce rigidity in programme implementation."
"There are also a number of other amendments that would need to be discussed in more depth."
"A document has been submitted to Parliament setting out the Commission’s position on each of the amendments(1)."
"I do not want to give the impression that our positions are far apart on all these issues."
"Out of 117 amendments, the Commission can accept 26 in full and 40 in part or in principle."
"This means that half of the amendments are totally uncontroversial."
"Finally, I should like to say a few words on nuclear safety."
"This has been an important part of our past work and will remain so."
"Originally included within the Stability Instrument, the change in the legal basis made it necessary to create a separate Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation."
"I understand that the draft text has now been sent by the Council to Parliament to allow you to begin preparing your opinion."
"I should like to finish by saying a few words on the way forward."
"There are grounds for optimism that agreement could be found on the text of two of the codecided instruments: the Stability Instrument and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"Similarly, I hope that the declaration I made concerning the Pre-Accession Instrument is sufficient to allow Parliament to give its opinion."
"What now of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument?"
"This is a key element in the architecture."
"This instrument covers assistance to Asia, Latin America and South Africa, as well as key thematic programmes."
"It is central to the package and too important to be left behind."
"I am convinced that we can do what needs to be done to ensure that the complete legislative framework is in place before the end of the year."
"The Presidency has already done considerable work on the policy content of the DCECI."
"There will be a window of opportunity following Parliament’s first reading to reach a consensus on the key issues of substance before the adoption of the Council’s common position."
"This could cover some limited changes in the architecture, which would not undermine the principle of simplification and the essential policy provisions."
"The consensus reached would be reflected in the Council’s common position, which the Council Presidency hopes to adopt in June."
"This would greatly facilitate a timely agreement on second reading."
"Finally, the provision of effective assistance to our partners from 1 June 2007 onwards is a shared responsibility."
"With the agreement on the financial perspective and the advances made on this legislative package, I am convinced we are within striking distance of achieving that goal."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have today, as far as the Financial Perspective and the various instruments are concerned, grounds for a certain optimism, and this morning afforded us the opportunity to sign an important document."
"You have, by a very clear majority, adopted an important compromise, and I believe that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s speech just now gives us reason to take a fundamentally optimistic view of things."
"I hope, in my capacity as a representative of the Council, to be able to contribute to the generally optimistic mood."
"Much of what the Commissioner has said reflects the Council’s way of thinking."
"Here, too, we are singing from the same hymn sheet and hoping that we will succeed in very soon putting the finishing touches to the instruments we are discussing today."
"Working together over the past few weeks has not been an easy matter, but it has, at the end of the day, proved to be constructive, and has shown just how much, in the final analysis, the institutions’ interests coincide with each other."
"On behalf of the Council, I would like to express gratitude for this cooperation, which was tough but constructive."
"It has already enabled us, as early as first reading stage in this House, to achieve agreement on the substance of three of the four instruments – the pre-accession instrument, the neighbourhood instrument, and the stability instrument."
"Given the complexity of the subject matter, this could certainly not have been taken for granted, and it amounts in itself to a gigantic leap forward."
"I would also like to do as the Commissioner has just done and remind your House that the Council has adopted a number of amendments – and not the least significant ones – to every single one of these instruments and not just to those legal acts that are subject to the codecision procedure but also to the pre-accession instrument, which is subject to the consultation procedure."
"Nor do I wish to gloss over the fact that the package now before you was the cause of a great deal of contention in the Council, and that it took some effort – and a great deal of effort on the part of the President of the Council in COREPER – to get some of the delegations to accept it."
"I would now like to say something in brief about each of the instruments in turn."
"As is well known, each of these instruments has its own history of negotiation behind it, and I would like to begin with the two that are subject to the codecision procedure, those being the Neighbourhood Instrument and the Stability Instrument."
"We are glad to be able to say that, where the Neighbourhood Instrument is concerned, we have largely achieved agreement, and I would like to thank Mr Szymański for his very constructive cooperation in this respect."
"I believe that I can say – speaking as the Council’s representative – that we have accommodated virtually all your House’s demands, in that we have made the instrument more flexible, done away with the restriction on the eligible priorities, have imposed further conditions on cooperation, and have made it clear that international conventions, particularly in relation to human rights issues, have to be adhered to."
"I would remind you of the debate that we had on this subject earlier on."
"We have also come to a firm agreement on the importance we attach to the role of civil society and our desire to support and promote it."
"As for cross-border cooperation, we have not only laid down the partnership principle but have gone further and stressed – as your House demanded – that the regions have to be involved."
"As you will be aware, the stability instrument – and this is where it is only right that I should thank Mrs Beer – is a particularly sensitive instrument, and it needs to be handled with a great deal of care, for it occupies a grey area between the first and second pillars, and I, speaking as a representative of the Council, will readily concede that this raises serious institutional issues."
"We have, though, made a good deal of progress, and the Council has endeavoured to meet your House halfway on a number of issues in this respect."
"We have accommodated Parliament’s desire that it should not merely be consulted but also enjoy the power of codecision."
"We have managed, albeit as a result of difficult negotiations, to accede to Parliament’s request for a broad scope."
"The Commission has already made reference to this."
"The present constitution specifies what is to be done in the areas of disarmament, improved crisis prevention instruments, crisis management, mediation and measures to take account of the position of women and children in crisis situations."
"All these things are requirements on which we have insisted, or which we have supported, in the previous debate on the coherence of European human rights policy."
"We eventually succeeded, in the 10 May trilogue, in finding solutions that took account of Parliament’s demands for a conditionality clause for measures to combat terrorism by means of statements on the subject from the Commission."
"I am sure that I can say, on behalf of the Council, that this made it possible for us to come up with a good result."
"I have to thank Mr Szent-Iványi now that I come to speak to the pre-accession instrument, which is, by its very nature, particularly important."
"Nor do I need to explain just how important it is for the Austrian Presidency of the Council and its priorities in this very area, quite simply because it is inseparable from the future development of the European Union."
"The Council therefore saw it as important that it should negotiate with your House in the substance of the act and, in the same way as with the other instruments I have mentioned, to take on board Parliament’s concerns, even though this instrument is not subject to codecision."
"We have, for example, laid greater emphasis on the gender aspect and on social cohesion and made programmes for potential candidates more widely accessible."
"We have also agreed to Parliament’s demand that it should be consulted on strategic issues such as the suspension of IPA funds."
"Our common objective is that the European Union should be capable of acting in every sphere of foreign policy, and it is regrettable that this – despite some encouraging progress – has not been achieved."
"What matters now is that we do something of some practical usefulness in moving the process forward as swiftly as possible and adopting the draft acts and regulations in short order."
"That must now be the common goal of the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and it is one that we must take seriously."
"I would like to take this opportunity to once more explain in detail why this process needs to be completed, and these draft regulations adopted, as soon as possible."
"The existing regulations on the neighbourhood and stability instruments are due to lapse at the end of this year."
"If we do not ensure that they are replaced, we risk being unable to fund cooperation with the neighbourhood policy countries – which should be a particular matter of concern to all of us – with effect from next year, with it not even being possible to intervene in crisis and disaster situations if these instruments are not wrapped up in good time."
"A substantial implementing regulation for the pre-accession instrument still needs to be worked out and adopted if the financial resources – in respect of which negotiations were so long drawn-out and laborious – are to be put to work."
"It is for that reason that your House needs to vote on this by June at the latest."
"We do not want a financial black hole here."
"I therefore want to appeal to you all on behalf of the Council not to jeopardise the timely adoption of the instruments."
"That brings me to the next – and perhaps the most difficult – heading, which is the instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation, which, it has to be conceded, is our problem child and on which I would like to touch briefly."
"Here, the Council has shown itself willing to take your House’s main concerns on board, and I hope that this is a matter of common knowledge."
"We are certainly willing, then, to divide up DCECI into two instruments, one for development and another for economic cooperation, and I am sure this will meet one of your House’s fundamental concerns; as the Commissioner has already mentioned, the Council also looks with favour on the idea of creating an additional instrument in the field of human rights, something that your House has also called for."
"In order to fully respect your House’s rights of codecision, the Council has for some considerable time been willing to have in-depth negotiations with your House on all the essential elements of the geographical and thematic programmes and to formulate them together in the same way that was done in respect of the other instruments."
"As you can see, the Council is prepared to meet your House more than halfway on the things that matter to you."
"The only thing I have to say – and I have to spell this out – is that the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument must not be broken down any further."
"To reduce it to still more component parts would quite simply make an absurdity of our aim of simplifying the overall structure of the European Union’s overseas aid."
"To do so would be the very opposite of what we are endeavouring to do under the heading of ‘better regulation’."
"The Commissioner has already said the same thing, and I – speaking on behalf of the Council – would like to back her up in the strongest terms."
"The Council therefore finds it regrettable that, despite the willingness to negotiate and to make a variety of concessions, it has still not yet proved possible to find a solution to the problem of this instrument any more than it has to the other three."
"We do not doubt that the European Parliament attaches every bit as much importance as does the Council to this deficit being made good as soon as possible."
"The poorest countries on this planet of ours would find it beyond their comprehension if they were, so to speak, to be presented with the bill for a controversy between one institution and another."
"I would therefore hope that we will succeed in finding a solution that would prevent us from ending up in a legal vacuum after 1 January 2007."
"This is a task that we cannot put off to the crack of doom, and I would like, by way of conclusion, to repeat what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has already said, namely that the Council needs this agreement in order to put the final finishing touches to the other three instruments."
"As we see it, the concessions we have made in respect of the pre-accession instrument, the neighbourhood instrument and the stability instrument, and our willingness to consider a separate human rights instrument, are absolutely conditional on agreement being reached to the development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument."
"That much is essential, and it is something on which both the Commission and the Council agree completely."
"What is needed, then, is a package solution, and, in order to obtain one, we are relying on your House’s goodwill and willingness to compromise."
"That is something we owe not only to our partners, but also, in the final analysis, to the European public, which expects us to come up with solutions and has no interest in, or sympathy with, interinstitutional squabbles, and would certainly be disappointed if we were unable, from January 2007 onwards, to give overseas aid to the extent that we have all, together, undertaken to do."
". Mr President, before going into the substance I would like to welcome the presence of the Commission and the Council."
"I particularly appreciate the efforts of successive presidencies to find a solution to the outstanding problems linked to the original Commission proposal on the DCECI."
"When debating this instrument, our overriding concern must be the interests of the developing countries, and in particular the poorest sections of their populations."
"The remit of the Committee on Development is to represent their interests at European Union level and to ensure that they are kept on the EU’s political agenda."
"That is why we argue in favour of a specific instrument for the needs of the developing countries, namely poverty alleviation with true economic cooperation and sustainable development, and not just a default instrument for all countries not covered by any other instrument."
"I believe that this view is now widely accepted and I hope that the Commission now accepts it also."
"This Parliament obviously shares the Commission’s desire for greater efficiency, simplification and flexibility in the legislative domain, but cannot allow this to happen at the expense of its own competences and of democracy itself."
"Parliament essentially exercises its competences in the policy domain at three levels: determination of political priorities – which means codecision at policy-setting level, monitoring implementation, and budgetary powers."
"Those three levels are complementary and Parliament, being the only institution directly elected by the European citizens, should strive to have a greater say in all three of them."
"We should not, however, accept an increase in parliamentary powers at one level at the expense of our existing powers at another level."
"Codecision is not negotiable."
"Parliament fought for many years to get it and it is now enshrined in the Treaty."
"I am pleased to hear the Commissioner’s assurances on codecision here today."
"May I say to the Presidency that the difference with the DCECI is that it seeks to replace 16 codecided regulations with one regulation."
"I am absolutely amazed that the Commission and Council can so easily agree on taking away the role of Parliament."
"We should also not permit the human rights instrument, which Parliament has consistently been calling for, to be used to make us relinquish our policy-setting powers."
"Human rights are too important to be used as a bargaining chip in interinstitutional negotiations."
"The ball is now in the Commission’s court."
"My proposal to make the Development Cooperation Instrument the single administrative and procedural regulation for development cooperation not only gives the Commission the administrative simplification and flexibility it seeks, but also ensures that policy implementation is kept apart from the unpredictability of political life."
"Priorities may change rapidly, according to our political agendas and those of our partners, but a procedural regulation will ensure that implementation can go on unhindered."
"As rapporteur on the DCECI, I am fully determined to continue the intensive work that has gone into it and to ensure that it is in place as a procedural regulation well before the end of the year."
"Now that the Commission has recognised that the policy content for development cooperation must be established by codecision, it is time for it to submit formal legislative proposals on geographical and thematic priorities, so that Parliament and Council can finally start the process of legislating."
"Both the geographical and the thematic content are close to the heart of the European Parliament and require a thorough debate."
"We are talking about priorities for our cooperation with Latin America, the Middle East, Central Asia, the Far East and South Africa; our priorities in the fields of human and social development; sustainable management of natural resources such as water and energy; the environment and the role of non-State actors."
"These require a full and proper debate in Parliament."
"Since we know that the debate on such vast and sensitive issues will be difficult and the time is now running out, I want to inform the Council and the Commission that the Committee on Development is setting up a working group to discuss the policy content."
"This will speed up negotiations within Parliament and with the other institutions once we have received formal proposals."
"As I said at the beginning, we are talking about cooperation with hundreds of millions of poor people in the world."
"They need our continued support."
"For that, we need a legal base."
"It is up to the Commission to propose it in time."
"I welcome the tone and content of the Commissioner’s contribution here today, but there is a lot of work to be done and I hope we will soon get down to doing it."
". Mr President, if someone in Parliament wanted to adopt a good cop, bad cop approach towards the Commission and the Council, it would be difficult to find a better way of doing this than to schedule speeches by Mr Mitchell and myself one after the other."
"When the European Commission presented its package in 2004, one thing was uncontroversial and universally praised, and that was simplification."
"Simplification is a great virtue of the whole package presented in 2004, as it makes it easier for parties from outside the EU to use our legal bases for external aid."
"However, Parliament clearly believes that this simplification cannot be implemented at the cost of restricting the political aims of our external aid, and neither can it be implemented at the cost of Parliament’s monitoring powers."
"This is why 124 amendments appeared in my report for the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I would like to thank the people responsible in the political groups for their work and dedication."
"They include Mr Tannock, Mrs Morgantini, Mrs Napoletano, Mr Belder and Mr Väyrynen."
"Without the involvement of the secretariat of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and also of the political group to which I belong, it would not have been possible for us to have such a clear negotiating position today."
"Furthermore, without the enormous commitment and dedication of the Austrian Presidency headed by Ambassador Woschnagg, without the involvement of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and without the involvement of Mr Brok, who leads our negotiating team as the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we would not realistically be able today to think about accepting this instrument at first reading, something that is extremely important."
"We must remember that at the end of the year our current legal basis, in the form of MEDA and TACIS, the main instruments of neighbourhood and partnership aid, will expire."
"We should give our external partners as much time as possible to prepare for this enormous and important change with regard to the legal basis for the provision of external aid."
"In the course of 18 months of parliamentary work, we have made significant progress."
"First of all, we have broadened the palette of political aims for the funding instruments of the Neighbourhood and Partnership Policy and we have introduced clauses making the provision of aid dependent on respect for human rights and democratic standards."
"We have introduced changes which will allow the Neighbourhood Policy to be applied to countries such as Belarus which avoid cooperation with the European Union."
"We have safeguarded the role of the EEA and of Switzerland in the performance of tasks associated with the Neighbourhood Policy, and made it possible for these countries to participate in the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy in the European Union."
"In spite of what I would call the governmental character of the Neighbourhood Policy, we have increased the role of non-governmental organisations."
"Having heard Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Winkler’s speeches, we could say today that, thanks to the interinstitutional agreements, we have a guarantee that a new, separate human rights and democracy instrument will be introduced."
"This instrument will be flexible enough to achieve our aims in a legally and politically hostile environment."
"As we all know, we face such hostile situations fairly frequently."
"Today everything points towards our ability to achieve a compromise on this most important matter, namely the European Parliament’s monitoring role, in terms of both planning and implementing the Neighbourhood Policy."
"Of course, I am aware that any compromise is uneasy, as this one is for Parliament."
"However, I will recommend that it be accepted, as everyone who takes part in a compromise has to bear in mind that it will give us the satisfaction of having brought a great process to a close, but that it will also be a slightly uneasy compromise."
"I am sure that this compromise does not sit easily with any of us, but I am certain that the most important feeling here is that of satisfaction at having been able to reach an understanding."
"I hope that this agreement will be reached before the summer break and, more importantly, before the end of the Austrian Presidency."
"The Austrian Presidency has put a lot of hard work into this matter, and they deserve credit for their work."
"I hardly need to add that our southern and eastern neighbours are eagerly awaiting the completion of our work."
"Once again, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the completion of this work."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Winkler, as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the stability instrument, I would like, once more, to briefly look back and emphasise just what a good idea on the part of the Commission the so-called Prodi package was, in that, whatever else may be said about it, forty instruments have been whittled down to six in order to speed up foreign policymaking and make it more effective."
"We were happy to go down this road hand in hand with the Commission, even though this was not always characterised by complete harmony."
"The profound reform of the Community’s foreign policy that we are debating today cannot be considered in isolation from the upgrading of Parliament’s role, which is long overdue, for we, considering the extent of the European Union’s activities as a global player, are no longer prepared to stand looking over the fence while the governments take the decisions; on the contrary, we want to get actively involved in taking them."
"It is for that reason that I have included in this report on the stability instrument a proposal for the introduction of a call-back procedure, which is intended to allow us in this House to bring politically irresponsible measures to a halt at the planning stage."
"As I see it, there is a correlation between our increased activity in the sphere of foreign policy and the need for Parliament to have a greater say."
"I want to emphasise once more that Europe’s 450 million citizens expect this democratic legitimacy, and expect it to be monitored."
"That is what we are here to do, and so, once this stability instrument enters into force, the Committee on Foreign Affairs will have new tasks to perform, in that we will have things to scrutinise and will need to be informed in advance."
"We are now being given the chance to do these things, and we will certainly make use of it."
"Negotiations with the Council and the Commission to this end were, admittedly, tough and slow-moving at first – we spent eighteen months waiting for the Council to come up with concrete proposals – but we have now reached the final stage, and that is encouraging."
"It is at this point that I would like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and all the other participants in the trilogue, especially Ambassador Woschnak, but also, of course, Mr Brok, the chairman of our own committee, and all those – too many to name – who have made our work easier."
"I just want to briefly review the points that were of particular concern to us, and on which we have now reached agreement."
"The call-back procedure that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner proposed to us is one in line with our way of thinking, and she has now – and this is my second point – assured us that the Commission will take into consideration Parliament's wishes as regards the review clause."
"Thirdly, we have come to an agreement on matters of content."
"We saw this as vitally important, and it will also be vitally important in terms of practical external policy, for example, our demand as regards the peacebuilding commission."
"We have been able to reach agreement on landmines, on issues relating to women and children, on the conditionality of anti-terrorism measures, and on the revision clause."
"In order to give you a better picture of what that means, let me say that, in the aftermath of the tsunami, we had a very cooperative dialogue in which we gave consideration to how the instruments that were now all working at once could be brought together, and how aid from the European Union could be got more quickly to the people who needed it."
"I am very grateful to you for the completion of the Commission’s feasibility study on the civilian peace corps, the coordination of which will, I think, involve us politicians in being responsible for bringing together and simplifying the right approaches."
"Following the last two trilogues, there was evidence of compromise in the statement we got yesterday from the Commission, which stated that these measures were being taken on the basis of human rights and of international law."
"We regard that as an important and fundamental precondition if the war on terror is to be steered in the right direction."
"Turning, if I may, to the coordination of peacebuilding, I will be discussing the proposal you made yesterday evening with the Members who have up to now been actively working alongside me on this."
"On this point, too, I think it should be possible for us to come to an agreement, which will make it clear to us how the Commission is contemplating bringing the Council and other actors in on its activities in this area."
"It may be unusual to do so at this hour of the day, but the debate we are having today is a debate on fundamental principles."
"We are going for a final spurt in order to be able to vote on the stability instrument in June, at first reading."
"Let me conclude, though, by reiterating, and very clearly, that, if we really are to take seriously our commitment to human rights, then we would ask you to ensure that the proposal for a democracy and human rights instrument is brought before this House as quickly as possible, for we do not regard human rights and democracy as a bargaining counter, and nor should they be used as a means of putting pressure on the Development Committee."
". Mr President, Mr Szent-Iványi is the rapporteur on the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, but he is not here, because the Commissioner has sent him far away to oversee the elections in Fiji."
"Mr Szent-Iványi sends his greetings and asks us on his behalf to thank the Commissioner for her speech, which is in complete harmony with the agreement which has been reached on this issue."
"A major reorganisation in the financing of external relations is to be introduced through the regulations now being discussed."
"Previous financial instruments are being combined and the decision-making process reformed."
"The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is to replace the current TACIS and MEDA systems."
"Cross-border cooperation is to feature a new arrangement, which will permit the flexible combination of the financing of external relations via the Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, on the one hand, with funding for the territory of the Member States out of the European Regional Development Fund, on the other."
"Hitherto, cross-border cooperation has been very unwieldy, as the decision-making systems for funding under TACIS in external relations and regional development financing within the Union have been very different."
"It will be a massive challenge to harmonise the administrative procedures and interlink them."
"The pending implementing regulation must be drafted carefully and take Parliament’s views on the matter into account."
"For all the financial instruments we need a decision-making system that safeguards Parliament’s influence even after the regulations are adopted."
"The negotiations on this matter have gone very well indeed."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is pleased that the other institutions have at last approved Parliament’s call for establishing an instrument for human rights and democracy."
"The external relations instruments form a whole, and consensus must be reached on all of its components between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"This will require flexibility on all sides, including the European Parliament."
"The changes to the financing mechanisms are so significant that problems can be expected in their practical application."
"All the institutions must be ready to make changes, if necessary, to the regulations now being decided upon within the current Financing Period."
"I was shadow rapporteur on behalf of the ALDE Group when the ENPI Regulation was being discussed and I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Szymański, for his cooperation."
"I am especially glad that the Northern Dimension and cooperation with our northern neighbours were also covered by the regulation."
"– I would like to call upon my colleagues to consider their positions regarding the legal basis of the proposed regulation."
"It is necessary to retain a dual legal system and thereby to ensure that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will in future play a role in the processes of development and economic cooperation."
"If Article 179 provided the sole legal basis, this process would be exclusively in the hands of the Committee for Development, and our committee would lose its authority."
"You have already spoken of human rights here, although these are in the AFET portfolio."
"I would also like to draw attention to the fact that I have been informed that a dual legal basis would undermine the authority of the European Parliament."
"This information is untrue, insofar as Article 25 of the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of Parliament clearly states that if there is a dual system, then Articles 179 and 181a will implement a codecision process, thereby giving Parliament greater authority."
"If we have a single legal basis relying on Article 179 alone there is a danger that programmes such as Erasmus Mondus or other educational programmes and student grants will disappear."
"Article 179 is not able to cover the broad spectrum of development and economic cooperation."
"For example, it would not cover sectoral cooperation in areas such as transport and energy."
"Not all types of cooperation can be subsumed under the term ‘development cooperation’."
"Furthermore, Article 179 applies only to developing countries, and the EU does not have its own definition of developing countries, which it has borrowed from the OECD."
"Article 181a, on the other hand, speaks of third countries, which means its definition is less restrictive."
"If Article 181 were dropped, some countries would be automatically excluded."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we pass this directive with a single legal basis, it means that Article 181 will no longer have a basis in the agreements and we will thereby be giving carte blanche to the Commission."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of my speech is the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, which I have followed as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development."
"This new policy, which became necessary after the last major enlargement, covers a vast geographical area."
"The primary objective of this policy is, as you know, the creation of a common area of prosperity and security for developing economic integration and political cooperation between the Union and its partner countries."
"This is a challenge and, at the same time, a chance to take advantage of the opportunities that derive from this policy, including in terms of development, since most of the countries benefiting from the Neighbourhood Policy are indeed developing countries."
"The Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument establishes a close relationship between internal and external cohesion: from that perspective, security is therefore linked to development."
"I would therefore draw the Commission's and the Council's attention to the fact that development policy must have greater scope as an instrument of the Union’s external relations."
". Mr President, I welcome this neighbourhood instrument that we will soon approve and which we are debating today and, in particular, I am pleased with all of the amendments that have increased the role played by civil society in the neighbourhood policy."
"The spokesmen who have spoken before me have said that we are still awaiting a genuine instrument, which the Commission has said it will present, for strengthening human rights and support for democracy."
"It is clear, however, that this neighbourhood instrument that we are debating now, following its passage through Parliament, has been filled with numerous references to that protection of human rights and the relationship with civil society and non-State actors."
"I would call upon the Commission to bear this in mind and, when it comes to implementing this agreement with neighbouring countries, to remember that many of them are not democracies."
"It must therefore bear very much in mind that this instrument cannot be allowed to strengthen non-democratic regimes and that it must therefore take very good account of these non-governmental actors."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur on the Neighbourhood Instrument, Mr Szymański, for having taken on board so many of our committee’s suggestions, which has added value to the Commission proposal."
"I can do no other than stress – and in this I am expressing the Employment Committee’s view – how important it is that the social dimension be given greater emphasis in promoting the Neighbourhood Instrument."
"It is particularly at the outermost border of the European Union that an enormous economic disparity is to be found, and tensions can be reduced only if the social dimension is given an equal priority as the country draws nearer to the EU."
"I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate how important is the role played by the social partners in the Neighbourhood Instrument."
"If there is to be partnership with these countries, then it is absolutely essential that their role be strengthened and promoted."
"This House can count the implementation of educational measures and their social role as accompaniments to the action plans among its successes."
"Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was pleased to address the financial aspects of these issues."
"We were glad that in the future our foreign policy and neighbourhood policy activities would be conducted within a more transparent and more simplified structure."
"We have a saying: a bad neighbourhood is a Turkish curse."
"It originated in the times when a large part of Hungary was under the occupation of the Ottoman Empire."
"We are interested in a good neighbourhood, and I believe that this instrument will help prevent the European Union from building walls or erecting a Chinese Wall around itself, and will encourage it to efficiently help its neighbours to prosper, instead."
"This will also be in the interest of our safety."
"We supported the idea that in some cases we could, for instance, waive the cofinancing contribution, because in many of our neighbouring countries the organisations involved would be unable to support such a programme from their own resources."
"I ask the House to support the proposal, and I would like to thank everybody for their work."
"Mr President, relations between the old and newer neighbours play an important role in European Union foreign policy."
"In recent times, however, we have found out from the media that the financing of projects is in some cases quite unclear."
"While I would like to commend the work done by the rapporteur, as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Trade, Research and Energy I do have two critical observations concerning the vagueness of the European Union’s expenditures."
"The first concerns the role of the European Parliament in the preparation, management and auditing of projects, which was included in the amendments proposed by the , but is not in the final text."
"The status of legal entity submitted concerning partners is also missing."
"The second observation concerns the introduction of the Northern Dimension into the draft from the same position."
"The Northern Dimension is undoubtedly a most successful step by Finland in relations between the European Union and Russia."
"Its extent has, however, not been defined."
"From time to time it is presented as an immediate neighbourhood policy of the Member States – that is, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland."
"The third and best possibility is good-neighbourly relations between the eight Member States from the Baltic Sea region and Russia, which naturally does not rule out the involvement of other countries."
"Thank you, Mr President."
". Mr President, it was entirely natural that the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should take an interest in standardising and simplifying the procedure for integrated border management and in migration, asylum policy, crime prevention and the prevention of human trafficking on the one hand, at the same time as in promoting the rule of law, the independence of courts and good administrative practices as laid out in the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"We cannot jointly fight crime or build border infrastructure if the funds allocated for this purpose sink in a mire of corruption or incompetence."
"That is why I wish to stress that the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are counting on the fact that practical support in the fight against crime and human trafficking will go hand in hand with support for an independent legal system, good administration and civil liberties."
"This is necessary in order to achieve a balance between costs and benefits, and so that the demands and the profits are balanced in such a way as to ensure that our neighbours will not only be aware of the weight of their obligations but also perceive values that, to them, seem independently and convincingly necessary for a better, safer life."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Winkler, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument simplifies the European Union's external aid and strengthens cooperation with our neighbours, and that is a good thing."
"Nevertheless, we must be prudent with regard to the funding we grant to the neighbourhood policy."
"We need to bear in mind the differences between our neighbours to the East and those to the South, and the fact that reforms are being implemented at variable speeds."
"Let us ensure that European financial aid remains stable and, in particular, that it continues to be divided as at present."
"I am thinking here of our neighbours in the Mediterranean, who, as part of the Barcelona process, have a particular relationship with the European Union."
"We need to show and prove that our partnership continues to be a high priority, by increasing our political, economic and cultural cooperation."
". Mr President, Commissioner, members of the Council, what we in the Committee on Regional Development, and I as co-rapporteur (Article 47) in particular, have committed ourselves to is concrete support for citizens on both sides of the EU’s external borders in the coming years."
"As Mr Szymański has already said, agreement on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument at first reading is now within reach."
"The European border regions are offered the opportunity, in the coming years, partly with some EUR 700 million per annum in funds from the European Regional Development Fund, of carrying out concrete programmes that cover a wide spectrum, including public health, education, the economy and the environment at Europe’s external borders."
"It is vitally important that we, in consultation with the Council, have reached agreement on how we go about this."
"Specifically, we have managed to maintain the INTERREG method under regional policy."
"In that connection, we have consulted the association of the European border regions and the newly formed network of external eastern border regions, called NEIGHBOUR, who claim they know how to use this method, for they have received and adopted workable suggestions."
"Finally, we have also reached agreement on the transitional regulation, which means that preparatory measures can now be funded."
"Should we fail to reach agreement on the external border with the regions and the nation state, we will take concrete action after 1 June 2010 to ensure that the funds can be spent in our own Member States on this side of the border and are not wasted."
"A readily implementable Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Initiative (EMPI) will be before us from 2007 onwards."
"In that connection, I would like to thank Mr Szymański and the Council for their unyielding commitment to reach agreement."
". Mr President, I am very pleased that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner views the economic cooperation instrument as important, and I do not see anything wrong with it becoming a matter to which the codecision procedure is applied at some point, even if that is not yet the case today."
"As the rapporteur of the Committee on International Trade on the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, I would like to say that we want to help candidate countries in cross-border activities related to establishing a market economy, non-governmental organisations, implementing WTO principles and all academic exchanges."
"At the same time, we strongly demand that the Commission present annual reports to Parliament so that we may see what the funds have been earmarked for, and so that, in a few years’ time, we can avoid feeling disappointed that they have disappeared somewhere and we do not know if the aid really reached European Union candidate countries or not."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Szent-Iványi, for our positive cooperation on the drafting of the Regional Development Committee opinion on the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance."
"My opinion is that this report is an opportunity to provide at all stages for the involvement of the European Parliament in the control and management of the new IPA."
"In that respect, consultation is not sufficient."
"In fact, due to the budgetary and political character of the issues at stake, provision should be made for codecision procedures."
"I believe that the lack of visibility in the level of funding per country, objectives and components should be clearly addressed and that the new instrument should ensure clarity and predictability of the Union’s commitments to its partner countries."
"Moreover, proper account should be taken of the specific situations and potential difficulties of the beneficiary countries."
"Alternative implementing arrangements should therefore be in force in order to avoid any shared management problems."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I am very pleased at the change to the legal basis of the stability instrument, and am grateful to the Commission and the Council for having accepted this change."
"I am also pleased that the negotiations with the Council made it possible to restrict the scope of the stability instrument by limiting cooperation in the fields of peacekeeping and anti-terrorist activities."
"Nevertheless, the Commission's proposal aiming to establish a non-compulsory call-back mechanism does not make up for the deficiencies in Parliament's power of codecision on the political content."
"With regard to the Mitchell report, I am delighted that Parliament has not yielded to the Commission or the Council."
"Tomorrow, we are going to vote on a text that maintains Parliament's powers and allows it to retain its role as colegislator regarding the political direction to be taken by the new cooperation and development instrument."
"There is no reason to yield because this power is an established right."
"Indeed, the political guidelines on which we want to secure codecision will replace 16 regulations that underwent the codecision procedure."
"Now that the initial battle has been fought, we expect the Commission to propose a policy soon so that we can complete the second reading before the end of this year."
"Nevertheless, I am concerned about the neighbourhood instrument."
"It raises the same problems as the development instrument, but the response provided is considerably different."
"As in the case of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation instrument (DCECI), this instrument is subject to the codecision procedure but has no political content."
"As in the case of the DCECI, the political content to be defined will, for 15 of the 17 countries covered by the neighbourhood instrument, replace around a dozen subject-related regulations subject to the codecision procedure."
"In an effort to retain its competences, Parliament itself proposed the call-back mechanism to express its opinion on the political content of the neighbourhood instrument within the framework of the codecision procedure in the case of differences with the Commission."
"We are an elected assembly and our work is, by definition, political."
"We have chosen, though, to legislate on the most technical aspect of the partnership – the procedural framework – but to keep our peace on the political strategy."
"Today, we are prepared to give up the call-back mechanism and to yield to the Commission and the Council in order to adopt this text at first reading."
"Why should we go back on an established right?"
"Why should our legislative power be curtailed at a time when Parliament is achieving significant legislative victories in other areas, such as port services, the Services Directive and, tomorrow, the DCECI?"
"I understand that we need to reach a speedy compromise on this instrument with the Council and the Commission, but how can any elected representative vote to lose his prerogatives?"
"Mr President, the facility to respond to threats against human rights and democracy is a self-evident and necessary objective."
"On the essence of the proposal, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to say, as regards the instrument for stability, that the codecision procedure – which is now accepted by all sides – is certainly, legally speaking, the right procedure."
"On the question of transparency and flexibility, transparency safeguards the avoidance of overlaps in the various activities, mainly with the CFSP, while flexibility affords the facility for timely intervention and improved efficacy."
"I close by saying that certainly I have no objection to the proposed indicative financial framework and I would like to say that, through the annual budget procedure, we shall fight in the Committee on Budgets for maximum efficiency of the instrument for stability."
". Mr President, I fully support the objectives of the ‘Prodi package’ of simplifying the structure of our external actions."
"As the largest provider of overseas development assistance, a key trading partner for the LDCs and an important provider of technical and financial assistance, the EU has an obligation to ensure that our actions add value, are properly coordinated and are coherent."
"The Committee on International Trade has three main concerns about the packages in general and the DCECI Instrument in particular."
"Firstly, in relation to the legal base, we took the view that Article 179 was an insufficient base and that we needed a legal base that included cooperation with both developing and industrialised countries: in other words the inclusion of Article 181a."
"Nevertheless, we respect the view of the Committee on Development that having this in a single instrument involved the risk of vulnerability between development objectives and industrial objectives."
"Our second concern is the apparent downplaying of the importance of trade in the package as a whole."
"We want trade-related assistance to be given a clearer focus and wonder, in the absence of a thematic programme, how trade will be handled in the proposed structures for the new instruments."
"Finally, we share the other committees’ concerns about the erosion of parliamentary control and believe that Parliament was right to reject the original 2004 proposals."
"The breakthrough we have achieved with the Council and the Commission on review and expiry clauses should lead to a positive vote tomorrow, but Parliament must now be fully engaged in setting policy priorities throughout the package."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Szymánski, on the ENPI."
"The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument – which will replace the existing Tacis and Meda programmes in 2007 – is, in my view, essential to budgetary discipline and procedure."
"It will cover the Euromed countries of the Barcelona Process and the Western NIS countries, as well as the three Caucasus republics, which currently constitute the European Neighbourhood Policy countries on which I am Parliament’s rapporteur."
"Like Russia, which is not part of the ENP but enjoys the four Common Spaces, these are all key neighbouring countries whose geopolitical stability and economic prosperity is vital to EU interests."
"We need to be surrounded by a ring of friends who enjoy free markets, security within their borders and shared values with the European Union, particularly on human rights and democracy-building."
"Although generous, the aid provided in these dedicated instruments – in the case of the ENPI it is of the order of EUR 12 billion for the next financial perspective – is less per capita than that granted in the pre-accession process to EU candidate countries."
"Nevertheless, it is an important contribution in technical assistance and investment in key infrastructure projects, which can complement the work of the EIB and the EBRD."
"I also believe that aid and trade privileges must be the carrot that can be coupled to the stick of conditionality as part of the ENP, to ensure that the closer these countries move towards the European Union’s values, the more they can be rewarded in future."
"The ENPI must remain part of the codecision procedure under Article 179, with suitable monitoring and oversight by our Parliament."
"I also welcome the concession by the Commission – and I gather the Council will also fall into line on this – to set up a dedicated instrument for human rights and democracy that will facilitate the EU’s priority support for building greater values of human rights, democracy and freedom in the rest of the world."
". – Mr President, there is disquiet within the Committee on Development at the difficulties that have arisen with the European Commission and the Council with regard to the negotiation of the instrument for development cooperation."
"We approved the first Mitchell report more than a year ago in the Committee on Development and, since then, it has been at a standstill while we waited for the Commission and the Council to stand by their promise to take account of our arguments and criticisms of the Commission’s initial proposal."
"Nevertheless, those promises have not been fulfilled, despite some effort and progress, and they have not been reflected in any text presented to Parliament by the Commission."
"There were three main problems with what has been proposed to us."
"Firstly, it did not appear reasonable to have a single instrument for development cooperation and cooperation with the developed world."
"We were concerned that resources intended for the development of the countries of the South could be transferred to cooperation with the countries of the North."
"With regard to this point, the Council and the Commission appeared to sympathise with our position."
"The second point was more serious."
"We could not accept the idea of Parliament losing competences that it had had with regard to the seventeen instruments which were now intended to be compacted into one or two."
"The entire process of European integration has been characterised by a constant effort to consolidate the democratic progress made within the interinstitutional relationship, which has essentially taken the form of greater competences for Parliament in decision-making."
"We are surprised, and somewhat indignant, at the approach advocated by the Commission, which sets efficiency against democracy."
"The intention has been to reduce Parliament’s competences, on the grounds that they complicate the process and make it less efficient."
"It is not the hierarchy of the Committee on Development that is at stake, but rather the competence of Parliament, and in that regard we cannot take a single step backwards."
"In this respect, there has not been the least progress that can be objectively measured."
"The third area of conflict relates to the fact that, perhaps more on the part of the Council than of the Commission, the intention has been to include actions relating to security, terrorism and immigration within development cooperation."
"Some of them may appear appropriate; what is unacceptable is that they should be funded with resources earmarked for development cooperation."
"For example, funding the repatriation of illegal immigrants from the instrument for development cooperation is not acceptable to us."
"These programmes require a differentiated instrument funded from other sources."
"In this area as well, there has been some progress in our debate with the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, we are going to vote for the text proposed to us, in the hope that, at second reading, the Commission will understand and accept our arguments, hopefully with the understanding and support of the Council."
". – Mr President, there is indeed consensus in this House on the need for reform of the development cooperation instruments, and that it needs to happen without delay."
"In this field, there are already 16 different regulations, with differing priorities and running for different periods of time."
"The existing procedure is complex, incomprehensible and opaque."
"The Commission’s draft, though, is a model of how not to tackle this state of affairs."
"Simplification and efficiency are not the same things as the voiding of Parliament’s right of codecision, the systematic blurring of the lines between development cooperation and foreign economic policy in our dealings with industrialised countries, or an obscure legal basis for the use of funds earmarked for development policy."
"What I have heard from you today, Commissioner, amounts – putting it cautiously – to contradictory statements on these three core issues."
"Perhaps we can take that as a reason to hope that the Commission might stir itself into life, which, in view of the fact that time is now running out, is precisely what it needs to do; many regulations will lapse at the end of the year, and, if we fail to reach agreement, our legal position will be a precarious one."
"We want Parliament to vote right now, so that there can be no speculation about it being Parliament that delayed the agreement."
"It is on that basis that we need to negotiate."
"The Austrian Presidency of the Council has circulated some good ideas as to what a compromise might look like, and now the Commission really must abandon its tactic of sitting on the sidelines when these points are being discussed and meet us halfway and negotiate a compromise in which simplification and Parliament’s full right of codecision are not seen as antithetical."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the dissatisfaction expressed, I feel I must sincerely thank the Commission and the Presidency, as well as Mr Mitchell, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and all the members of the parliamentary committees and the relevant secretaries for the hard work they lavished on reaching an agreement on four instruments for external action."
"Interinstitutional cooperation and dialogue constitute a testing ground that will enable us to achieve a positive and effective outcome in the interest of all the actors involved, particularly those from developing countries."
"As regards the development cooperation instrument, significant progress has been made on the expiry date, on the revision clause and on other topics too."
"The negotiation process has succeeded in overcoming the differences."
"With this first reading, we are concluding this initial phase so as to move on as quickly as possible to the creation of a task force of the Committee on Development, this being a decision that the committee itself has already made."
"This task force will enable us, once we have received some formal proposals from the Commission, to discuss structures and contents with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible, since responsibility for any potential ‘gaps’ would lie with everyone and not just with one party."
"A solution, which we consider positive, has been found on one of the decisive points of the Mitchell report, namely that of keeping cooperation with developing countries and with industrial countries separate."
"I sincerely hope that we will succeed in finding a solution, too, regarding Parliament's powers to define thematic and geographical priorities, priorities that cannot be abandoned, not least in view of the fact that the document in question replaces 16 codecided regulations."
"Mr President, I should like, if you will allow me, to extend this debate, because we must remember that all of our discussions and our speeches today assume that we have a common policy on external relations."
"However, it seems to have escaped the notice of some that, when the French and then the Dutch rejected the European Constitution a year ago, it was precisely because they did not want to let go of what they hold most dear, namely their world view as expressed in their foreign policy."
"They have no intention of creating, as the Constitution proposes, a minister for foreign affairs, not even if it is Mr Solana, and they have even less intention of giving him services and funding."
"No, they do not intend to have the same foreign policy as, for example, the United Kingdom or Italy, or of others, when they invade Iraq, a member of the United Nations, without the consent of the Security Council, thus disregarding international law and even the existence of international law."
"They do not want a superpower that kidnaps, deports and tortures like the United States does, as we saw with the infamous affair of the CIA's supposedly secret flights, carried out with the tacit approval of our authorities, particularly of Mr Solana, who certainly does not let you forget that he was Secretary General of NATO."
"If Mr Solana wants to defend human rights, then let him condemn Washington and their European accomplices, which, by remaining silent, have made themselves accessories to kidnapping and torture, rather than starting arguments with the southern countries that are insufficiently aligned for his taste, or perhaps too close to France."
"We will certainly vote against these funds and this financial perspective, which is a fatal perspective for Europe and its dignity."
". Madam President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Mitchell, for the work that he has done on this report."
"There are a number of points that I wish to make today."
"I believe that it is imperative for Parliament to retain the power of codecision on strategic priorities, geographical and thematic aid programmes."
"It must also apply for the multiannual financial framework."
"It is essential that we do not allow the European Commission to introduce a single instrument in such matters."
"I believe that, in keeping with the Millennium Development Goals, the scope of EU development aid should be restricted to the developing countries only."
"On the question of aid funding, I believe that the budget support must be approved by the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country."
"Any suspension of aid must be decided by the Council of Ministers by qualified majority after the European Parliament, but we must ensure that any financial aid and debt relief is organised in such a way as to ensure that some corrupt African leaders, without mentioning names, cannot rearm themselves to bolster highly questionable regimes."
"The EU is the world’s biggest aid donor and is responsible for 55% of all development aid."
"Unfortunately, much of that aid is of very little use to developing countries unless we also make trade work for them."
"I propose a significant boost in aid for trade, which would be aimed at helping developing countries help themselves by enabling them to turn market opportunities into reality."
"I believe it is vital that the European Parliament does not lose its joint legislative power with the Council on the issue of development policy."
"Mrs Commissioner, Mr Winkler, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats’ faction, I support Parliament’s efforts to find a role for itself as an active joint partner in areas involving strategic foreign policy choices."
"I was pleasantly surprised by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner’s statement today that the commission would agree with both the implementation of the auditing clause and the European Parliament’s right of participation in the case of the stabilisation instrument."
"What is important is that these documents create a direct link between crisis aid, European Union development cooperation and the implementation of human rights policy."
"The objective of establishing mutual additionality between the aid channelled through the stabilisation instrument and the aid provided in the framework of the three remaining foreign instruments is also worthy of recognition."
"Thus we have an opportunity to create an integrated European Union strategic programme connecting the main policy instruments with the elements of the new stabilisation instrument."
"I am pleased that the council and now the commission have supported the Committee on Foreign Affairs’ request for a separate ‘human rights and democracy instrument’."
"With the perspective of implementing this instrument, there arises an opportunity for agreements to be concluded concerning the remaining three foreign policy instruments."
"Today’s message is that the European Parliament has established the objective of considerably increasing its right of participation in the issues mentioned."
"We also now expect the commission to offer legislative initiatives for realising the foreign aid instruments in question."
"The implementation of these instruments concerning all third countries, and on the same criteria is, however, a much more difficult question."
"To that end, it is of the utmost necessity that the European Union’s integral foreign and security policy should be implemented in practice, not only in theory."
"This policy must be coordinated more firmly and effectively in order for it to create the necessary generally established framework for reacting to crisis situations."
"Thank you very much."
"Madam President, it was one and a half years ago that the Commission tabled new proposals for the financial foreign policy instruments, including development cooperation, in an attempt at simplification and rationalisation, and that is something of which I am entirely in favour."
"The way in which the Commission wanted to achieve this, however, would mean that, while Parliament now – thanks to 16 regulations – has codecision powers, it would soon only have an advisory role in the area of development cooperation."
"What Parliament wants is a say in how policy is fleshed out in terms of topics and geography and in the distribution of funds across the priorities."
"Also – and that is a different matter in this instrument – the Commission would like to lump together economic cooperation with non-Development Cooperation countries and development cooperation by using a dual legal basis."
"That is something that remains unacceptable to this House."
"Although we feel we have now, for lack of new proposals from the Commission, wasted 18 months, all is not lost."
"The Committee on Development is prepared, on the basis of the Mitchell report, to set up a task force, and we are prepared to get our skates on, on one condition though, namely that the Commission tables its proposals within the next few weeks."
"Firstly, we want a rationalised instrument, intended for development aid alone, with only Article 179 as its basis, and thus restricted to official development spending."
"Secondly, we would like to see separate proposals for programmes arranged according to topic and geography."
"We are prepared to restrict the number of regulations. We want the right of codecision on the broad outlines of policy."
"Thirdly, we want financial priorities either on the basis of a multi-annual financial framework or by including a very low percentage in the geographical and thematic proposals."
"What we propose is that 50% of all EU Official Development Assistance spending should be spent on Millennium goals and within this context, present spending levels for basic education and basic health care should be doubled."
"It is now up to the Commission to decide whether it wants to do business, or remain at loggerheads with us, in which case we will obstruct its simplification and rationalisation initiatives and will revert back to those 16 instruments and all the unworkable micro-management that they entail."
"I would urge the Council and the Commission, in order that poverty may be reduced in a credible and effective way, to accept our offer."
"I would thank the Austrian Presidency for the commitment it has shown to date in this respect."
"Madam President, with its various financial instruments, is the EU providing itself with the means to pursue its external policies sincerely and in full?"
"If Europe disappoints, euroscepticism will increase."
"If we disappoint our partners, we are taking the risk that they will turn away from us."
"I hope that the neighbourhood instrument will be effective and will bring the regional stability for which we hope."
"In bringing the countries of the southern Caucasus into the neighbourhood policy, for example, has the Union taken account of the expectations of the people concerned?"
"I am talking about a sub-region that I know well."
"Bordered by Russia, Turkey and Iran, it is now at the centre of European and international debate."
"By guaranteeing their security, we are also guaranteeing our own."
"For this to work, our neighbours need considerable resources to implement the action plans they are currently drawing up, and it is regrettable that the European Union and Parliament are not involved in the negotiations."
"However, the important thing is that this instrument, the neighbourhood policy, must assist these countries on the path to democracy, that the Union must be a real player in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, namely, in the case of the southern Caucasus, the 'frozen' conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia, and in the peace plans for South Ossetia."
"These countries have voluntarily turned towards our European values, and they must be supported in their action plans."
"Because we now need to do more and better with the available resources – which seems to be the theme for today – I therefore call on the Commission to get the allocation of the scarce resources right and to invest in projects based on the fundamental principles of lasting peace and regional stability, respect for human rights and democracy, and sustainable development."
"– Madam President, very interesting though this stability instrument is as an approach, there is a quite fundamental problem with it, for it amounts to something like an attempt to disregard what is stated in the Treaty of Nice – namely, that there is no free-standing military budget – and introduce something of the sort by a circuitous route, and that I do regard as highly problematic."
"This draft, however, states quite openly that the intention is that the new financial instruments should play a crucial role in ‘developing the Union as a global player’."
"It is fairly plain to see that what it is talking about here is military expenditure."
"According to the Treaty of Nice, there can be no freestanding military budget, and we should actually leave it at that."
"What is happening instead is a piecemeal approach to exploring alternative means of funding and developing them."
"Another problem is the vagueness of this financial instrument, for it is capable of being used to fund not only civilian but also military projects."
"I would urge you to be quite open in saying that you want to fund military operations, and be quite open about doing it, for that is something that can be handled politically."
"That is why this is so very problematic."
"Madam President, we are constantly told to listen to the people, not least by the Greek President this very morning."
"Let us do that and recognise that the people, when asked directly, say ‘no’ to the Constitution, not least because they view with dismay the allocation of more and more of their money to pre-accession and even pre-candidate countries, some of which are undeveloped."
"Here it is essential that developed and undeveloped countries be separated and that these funds are not for European countries alone."
"So the EU should remember Third World countries outside the EU where its funds would be put to better use."
"In fact, its activities often lead to poverty in the Third World, which is why my party wishes to put this aid back in the hands of Member States alone."
"Only yesterday, this House voted to allow EU fleets the rights to fish the waters of São Tomé, Príncipe and Angola."
"We all know what happens then: the EU fleets rape the waters, putting locals out of business and destroying fish stocks for years to come."
"What price external relations then?"
"Yesterday, we gave rights to EU fleets to fish Moroccan waters and specifically rejected proposals that Member States could prohibit their fleets from fishing the waters of Western Sahara."
"Half the people of that unhappy country live in Algerian refugee camps because of Morocco’s military takeover."
"Now there is political, uncivil insecurity for you!"
"Thus is Western Sahara impoverished when it could be helped."
"But there are only 300 000 people there; they have renounced violence, unlike some other countries in receipt of EU funds, so the world forgets them."
"Madam President, while I would like to express my admiration for the rapporteur, Mr Szymański, as well as for the other rapporteurs, I would also just like to highlight a few matters related to the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"We are talking today about an instrument that constitutes one of the tools for creating partnerships and neighbourly relations between the Union and third countries."
"Yet are the funds which, as far as I know, amount to only 1.5% of Union spending, sufficient?"
"Are we really going to be able, with this money, to promote the spread of democracy, respect for human rights and civil society building?"
"With this kind of approach, specific attention needs to be paid to ensuring that objective criteria are used to determine how the funds are distributed."
"Implementing provisions will also be important."
"We do not have a lot of time."
"It is good that Russia is mentioned in paragraph nine of the explanatory statement."
"It is a shame, however, that the same emphasis was not placed on Ukraine."
"Finally, I would like to say that this financial instrument constitutes an opportunity for the European Union, which is home to barely 7% of the world’s population, to contribute to global stability and security and to poverty reduction."
"It will be beneficial to us all and will constitute European added value."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to start by emphasising the importance of our debate today, both as regards the subject and as regards the fact that it is a debate based on broad agreement."
"We are all aware of the fact that the message that we send today, by debating this subject in the European Parliament, to third countries, irrespective of the relationship which these countries have with the European Union, is important."
"I wish, of course, to congratulate all the rapporteurs, especially Mr Szent-Iványi, to whose report I devoted most time, both for the fact that he was extremely cooperative throughout the procedure in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and for the proposals which he formulated. The very fact that for Mr Iványi's report we have an agreement between us in the European Parliament and also with the European Commission and the European Council is something that I consider very important."
"It is also important that pre-accession assistance is being given, of course, to the two candidate countries, Croatia and Turkey, and to countries with European prospects, such as the countries of the Western Balkans."
"Finally, I am delighted that we have resolved with the agreement what I consider to be the serious matter of the legal basis of Article 181."
"In other words, I consider that the agreement made – take heed – is important and I trust that it will be applied in the best possible way."
"Madam President, the idea that six regulations that are not subject to codecision and concern a range of detailed topics could be integrated into a single regulation and be labelled part of the better regulation effort is unacceptable to my group."
"Do the Commission and the Council really believe that better regulation is achieved by cutting the European Parliament out of the procedure altogether?"
"How can you bring the EU closer to its citizens whilst attempting to take powers from the only directly elected EU institution, whose Members have the closest contact with the European citizens?"
"This Parliament cannot give up its competence and scrutinising role."
"We need to maintain democratic oversight and, indeed, build on our responsibilities in development and external actions."
"Seven months are left before the external actions regulations should come into force."
"Let us see the Commission put its money where its mouth is and allow Parliament adequate time to legislate on the proposals which, let us remember, the Commission is desperate to have but has not yet formally put forward."
"The Commission and the Council should pay attention: this Parliament will not be blackmailed on the Human Rights and Democracy Instrument."
"Furthermore, giving up codecision would mark a dangerous step backwards for the development of the European Union as a whole."
"This Parliament will not allow that to happen."
"– Madam President, I am glad that the new pre-accession assistance programmes are to be given an unequivocally political slant, and conclusions have been drawn from our experience with them, so that funds will from now on be spent in a more targeted, efficient and flexible way."
"We know that progressive European integration is the driving force behind the processes of change in the countries of the western Balkans, and in Turkey as well."
"This House has an interest in being consulted in good time when the framework rules are drawn up, when results are assessed and when conclusions are drawn, and we will consider very seriously the Commission’s undertakings in this regard and also in respect of the Neighbourhood Policy."
"If our solidarity is to be taken as read, then we must insist on unambiguous compliance with international law and conventions being expected in the same way."
"By so doing, we will not only be reinforcing sound economic development, but also, and in particular, helping to underpin civil society as the seedbed of European integration."
"Madam President, last year we saw millions of young people marching to make poverty history."
"Poverty matters to them; it matters to us."
"Also last year, we saw the people of Europe – France and the Netherlands – reject the Constitution, because to them the EU was too remote from their concerns."
"We now have a chance to bring their concerns about poverty and our concerns about connecting with the people of Europe together."
"This Parliament is the point of connection, the point of transparency and accountability."
"That is why codecision is so important."
"That is why transparency is so important."
"That is why accountability is so important."
"That is why replacing 16 codecision instruments with one will not work: replacing instruments on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, replacing policies on sexual and reproductive health, on measures to promote the full integration of environmental dimensions, on measures to promote the consolidation of sustainable management of forests – including those in developing counties, policies on consolidating democracy and the rule of law, on respecting human rights, on promoting gender equality in developing countries, on decentralised cooperation, on cofinancing with other NGOs, on food aid and food management, on development cooperation with South Africa, with Latin America, with Asia – it must be dotty!"
"Whoever in the Commission thought this up?"
"I do not think that the Commissioner has anything to do with it."
"We have to be accountable; we have to report back to our people."
"Our people expect us to tell them what we are doing with their money, and we cannot do that if there is only one development cooperation instrument that will cover this whole gamut of policy."
"We have to set policy."
"Parliaments are there to set policy, to implement and oversee the implementation of policy and to account for money."
"That is what parliaments are for and we cannot avoid our responsibilities."
"I do not think that anybody in the Commission should think that the MEPs in this Parliament are going to abrogate their duties."
"I congratulate Mr Mitchell on a very good report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our representatives’ amendments to the neighbourhood policy instrument justifiably emphasise European values."
"It is good that the instrument provides for the possibility of bypassing governments."
"Unfortunately, however, we are sidestepping the definition of geopolitical priorities."
"The final objective the European Union wishes to achieve with these not at all insignificant amounts is not specified."
"There are lots of hints."
"It is clear that in addition to the neighbourhood policy instrument, Russia has a separate framework and a Northern Dimension."
"In other words, the European Union by default recognises the existence of a Russian sphere of influence."
"At present, Moldova is a plaything in the hands of the Russian bear."
"The Kremlin closes off the gas pipelines and dries up the country’s largest source of export revenue – the wine industry."
"In so doing, Moscow is not only testing the resilience of Moldova, Georgia and the Ukraine, but also whether the European Union has any foreign policy backbone at all."
"Therefore, we must use our taxpayers’ money as a tool with which to sweep away the last traces of the Cold War in this united Europe."
"In the interests of stability, more financial resources must be focused on democratising the areas of the former Soviet Union."
"Thank you."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the success of the negotiations that we have held on a range of instruments for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible, and also the three rapporteurs, two of whom had to deal with matters subject to codecision, for having conducted proceedings in a manner worthy of codecision, the result of which is that we can be quite certain, if the human rights instrument is added, of bringing matters to a conclusion at first reading in June."
"What I would like to say is that it is not the number of regulations that determines Parliament’s prerogatives, but rather their content."
"I think we have achieved a great deal in the three areas for which my committee is responsible, with the codecision on the stability instrument, with the options made available to us by financial regulation, with the breakdown of appropriations and enhanced political substance. The review clause, which the present Commission has yet to guarantee within the life of this Parliament, the commitment to establish a legislative process on the basis of it, the possibility of this House having codecision on a mid-term review of the substance – these are just a few of the things that offer us more possibilities in comparison with what we had in the past."
"It is important that there are few rules, and that they are readily comprehensible, for that is what transparency is all about."
"Scarcely anybody – least of all we ourselves – knew how to find their way through the thirty rules that we had before, and that is why I think this is a better way for us to go down – which, I hope, we will."
"We can take pride in having made a good job of this."
"The European Union gives four times as much overseas aid as does the United States of America, and it is for that reason that we should make the effort to do it better and negotiate regulations for its speedy implementation, for implementation is what this is all about."
"We need to take a closer look at European policy on the way the instruments are used, and it is particularly with this in mind that we in this House will attach great importance to checking up on the Commission."
"Madam President, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is important to the new EU Member States, including Lithuania."
"Our border with our neighbouring countries is almost 1 000 kilometres long."
"We are very keen that behind this border, in Russia and Belarus, democracy, human rights, economic prosperity and greater public welfare should take root."
"Paraphrasing the former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, we could say that European Union citizens will never be safe and happy if, beyond the borders of the Union, people live in economic deprivation and in the absence of rights and fundamental freedoms."
"I would like to stress that the document also offers the possibility of using financial resources for those countries that are inclined to freeze cooperation with the EU."
"We need to coordinate these possibilities with a project to create a European democratic fund in support of civil society, as suggested by the Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, German Social Democrats and Members of the European Parliament."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is in the interests of the European Union to encourage our neighbours, particularly the countries in south-eastern Europe, to adopt our standards."
"It will bring stability not only to that region, but also to the European Union as a whole."
"The programmes we have had in the past have, for the most part, been implemented extremely effectively: we could list a whole host of examples, particularly with regard to the Balkans."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has started, in cooperation with Parliament, to develop new programmes for the period post-2007."
"We need to do this, because it is in the interests of both sides."
"However, it is also in the interests of Parliament and of everyone to ensure that the funds for these programmes are used optimally."
"I can tell you from my own experience that there are too many projects in which there is too much discussion and not enough concrete action and aid."
"There are too many projects that run in parallel and overlap with one another, and sometimes our projects compete with those from the USA and other states."
"At any rate, there is no coordination."
"My request to the Commission therefore comprises three points."
"First, we need to draw up a specific overview of the projects in progress, and then keep this overview up to date and ensure that the resources and projects are coordinated."
"Secondly, projects should only be approved if they actually provide practical aid ensuring that standards are raised."
"Thirdly, the provision of funding must be linked with appropriate success."
"I was pleased to hear the Commissioner state that we will undertake an initial review in 2009, which will show where we are making good progress and where we have problems."
"In general, it comes down to being able to guarantee that the European Union's money is used optimally in the interests of security and stability in the region as a whole."
"Madam President, in order to extend the numerous benefits of the economic and political cooperation to the neighbouring countries, the European Union has created the so-called European Neighbouring Policy."
"Using the new and often more flexible European neighbourhood and partnership instruments proposed by the European Commission, the European Union will have a direct or indirect effect on approximately 400 million citizens in 17 external countries."
"The new financial instrument is very important, and it will have a significant added value in the development and facilitation of cross-border and regional cooperation, and in strengthening the rule of law and developing good governance."
"We have come through a long negotiation process, and although the Commission has invested a lot of work in this issue, I can still not consider its approach regarding Parliament as being altogether cooperative as far as the four instruments are concerned."
"The Commission and Council are aware of the fact that Parliament welcomes the simplification of procedures, but it does not accept that, for the sake of simplification, the controlling role of Parliament should decrease, whether in respect of the external representation of the European Union or its budget."
"– Madam President, today's commitment by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that the Commission is prepared to submit a proposal for a separate financing instrument in favour of democracy and human rights is already a positive development."
"We await the proposal from the European Commission, which will have its own legal basis."
"However, this proposal by the European Commission must not be at the expense of the legislative competences of the European Parliament, especially its competences in the field of the budget, especially when we refer to matters connected with the foreign policy of the European Union."
"European citizens, as we all know, are calling for the competences of the European Parliament to be strengthened, not weakened."
"I wish to say and to point out to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner that the new financing programme for democracy and human rights which she submits – and this is a particularly important and sensitive point – will need to include financing for the rehabilitation centres for the victims of torture inside or outside the European Union."
"So far the European Commission has been the main source of funding for these centres and, consequently, their continuing operation is a fundamental humanitarian responsibility."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, today is an important day for Europe."
"We have finally adopted the financial perspective for 2007-2013, which is also good news for the candidate countries and for countries of the Western Balkans."
"Those countries will now have a clearer idea of the resources available under the instrument for pre accession assistance (IPA)."
"I warmly welcome the establishment of the IPA."
"I strongly believe that it will facilitate higher quality and more flexible individual policies during the pre-accession period, and will also make possible more cross-border and regional cooperation between countries that are preparing for accession and those already in the Union, something I consider very important."
"In common with previous speakers, however, I would have welcomed a greater involvement by Parliament in the formulation and creation of individual strategies and in areas such as decision-making on suspending assistance."
"Madam President, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is actually very welcome."
"The European Parliament has been calling for cooperation between the EU and its neighbours to be made easier for a long time now."
"In practice it has been very problematic that the EU’s own Interreg programmes and the programmes being implemented in the neighbouring regions have been completely separate, and that it has been impossible to realise joint projects on both sides of the borders."
"Although we are now introducing the one-stop shop principle we have wanted for so long into neighbourhood and partnership policy, it will be challenging to put the programme into effect."
"We have to remember that the external border regions are different."
"Not just the population base but also political needs must be taken into consideration when channelling resources regionally."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief, since time is getting on."
"This debate has convinced me that there is a joint effort here, a common interest, to conclude the negotiations on all the instruments as soon as possible."
"The Presidency of the Council has already stated, in a letter to the rapporteurs Mr Mitchell and Mr van den Berg, that it is prepared to start talks next week, and I was grateful to hear Mrs Morgantini discuss the necessity for these talks in her speech."
"We want to do that in all good faith."
"At this point, I should particularly like to thank Mr Brok, who said what I, as President-in-Office of the Council, tried to say in the Committee on Development, namely that it is of course not the Council's intention to curtail Parliament's rights."
"We have absolutely no intention – in the interests of credibility in the eyes of our partners – of curtailing Parliament's rights or opportunities for participation."
"Quite the contrary: we are committed to credibility and greater efficiency."
"It is therefore not necessary to count the instruments and to use that to measure how efficient we are; it is much more important for us to make progress in terms of content."
"I am grateful to all of you for your willingness to cooperate with the Presidency, and I should like to end by quoting from the letter to which I referred earlier:"
"‘I can assure you that the Presidency and the Council are fully committed to finalising a compromise on the DCECI before the summer break and will not spare any efforts as far as working time and personnel capacities are concerned.’"
". Madam President, President-in-Office, first of all I would like to say that this was a very intense debate on very important instruments."
"I think you have seen that we have been very open."
"However, I must also correct a misunderstanding by saying that we are clearly not opposed to codecision."
"The DCECI instrument is fully subject to codecision."
"Let me state clearly that we do not want to abolish codecision."
"This is a complete misunderstanding and an incorrect interpretation."
"We think that it is possible to work on the basis we have."
"The Commission has accepted that the addition of additional policy content to the DCECI should follow very closely the policy provisions of the 16 existing regulations as far as they still reflect current realities and policy priorities."
"However, let us not keep the current structure as the sole reference."
"It is unnecessarily complicated."
"We are saying that the policy provisions of these regulations can be perfectly imported, and adapted as necessary, into the main DCECI regulation."
"I remember that you all always want quick, swift, efficient delivery."
"How can we do that if we make things even more complicated?"
"I could not agree more with Mr Brok."
"It is not the number of regulations but the content of the regulations that makes codecision possible."
"A second minor point regarding the request for new Commission proposals: at this stage of the discussion, and given the urgent need to come to a prompt agreement, the Commission considers it necessary to use the President’s proposal as a basis."
"All the elements are already on the table."
"I think they are a very fair reflection of what the Commission itself would have proposed, as we were closely involved in their development."
"Moreover, the Council itself is now preparing its position on the basis of these proposals, so it is also in Parliament’s interest to work on this basis, provide input and consequently establish the basis for a negotiated common position."
"Let me also reiterate our wish to move forward, but now we really have to start negotiating."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote on the Mitchell report will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The vote on the other reports will take place in June."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments:"
"7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 76, 77, 78, 80, 82, 88, 92, 99, 102, 113, 117"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments subject to drafting modifications:"
"17, 30, 31, 33, 36, 37, 38, 40, 62, 64, 86, 90, 100, 101, 105"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments in principle:"
"16, 18, 27, 28, 61, 87, 104"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments in part:"
"3, 10, 22, 25, 26, 32, 39, 43, 53, 56, 57, 60, 63, 70, 71, 73, 79, 93"
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments:"
"1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 12, 15, 20, 21, 23, 35, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 72, 74, 75, 81, 83, 84, 85, 89, 91, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 103, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0207/2006)."
"We will be dealing with the following questions to the Council."
"According to the Council Presidency, how likely is a Croatian accession to the EU in this decade and what are the next steps in the accession negotiations?"
". Madam President, I am delighted to have another opportunity to take questions under your presidency, and we will start with the first question from Mr Posselt on the progress made in the accession negotiations with Croatia."
"Let me make it clear from the start that, in the accession negotiations with Croatia just as in all other accession negotiations, the principle is that each country is assessed on its own achievements."
"In the interests of transparency, this principle must continually be emphasised, and the speed of the negotiations depends solely on the extent to which the candidate country – in this case Croatia – meets the conditions for accession."
"It goes without saying in this regard that, as is stated in the relevant decisions, the EU's assimilation capacity must be taken into account."
"The Council cannot and should not specify a date for the conclusion of the negotiations, which started on 3 October."
"With regard to the next step, the Council launched the accession partnership with Croatia on 20 February; this partnership will set out the priorities that need to be met en route to accession."
"The Commission's screening reports on the negotiation chapters 'science and research', 'education and culture', 'public procurement' and 'competition' are now available."
"The Council has examined the screening reports on the first two chapters, 'science and research' and 'education and culture', and invited Croatia to set out its negotiation positions."
"I am now in possession of these positions, and the Council now needs to draw up a Common Position."
"The plan is that the specific negotiations on this chapter will commence on 13 June as part of an accession conference at foreign minister level."
"I would reiterate that how fast and how far these negotiations can be taken ultimately depends on the progress made by the candidate countries themselves."
"Last week, I was in Split with the leadership of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"There, in Croatia, there is considerable concern that each chapter will only be concluded, which requires unanimity, when the negotiations with Turkey on the same chapter have been concluded."
"Can the Council once again make it clear that this is not the case?"
"You have indeed said that each country would be assessed on its merits, but there is still the risk that, as before, there will be a matching of speeds that is completely inappropriate in view of the subject and of the size of the countries."
". From a legal point of view, there is no connection between different accession negotiations."
"There may, of course, be a connection, if – as in the case of Turkey and Croatia – screening reports on a number of candidates are presented at the same time, and this can result in a certain amount of correspondence."
"This does not, however, constitute a connection."
"Therefore, the negotiations continue to be based on the principle that each candidate country is treated according to its own progress, and that there is no connection with the negotiations with other candidate countries."
"When does the Council anticipate that the negotiations will address the institutional chapter?"
"When it does so, what offer will the current Member States give to Croatia as regards the number of votes Croatia will have in the Council?"
"Will it be an offer based on the current voting system, which all Member States have agreed to change in the Constitutional Treaty, or will it be based on an offer made on the basis of the Constitutional Treaty?"
"In which case, will that be possible without reopening all the linked issues, which we thought were solved in the Constitutional Treaty?"
"Will it therefore not be necessary to re-examine the whole constitutional package?"
". In reply to Mr Corbett’s question, the normal procedure is for institutional questions to be dealt with last."
"Of course, the regime that will eventually apply to the representation of new Member States in the bodies and institutions of the European Union very much depends on the debate on the future of the European Union and on the future of the Constitution."
"However, that is still in the future and I cannot predict what will happen."
"I would like to ask a question similar to that put by Mr Posselt, who pointed to the potential for a dangerous parallel course with Turkey."
"I see a different, more fundamental, problem."
"We are currently having major difficulties in arranging the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria in such a way that we can stick to the deadline set, frankly very prematurely, by the Council and still ensure that the candidate countries have in fact achieved what we expect of them."
"In the case of Croatia, the situation is slightly different: much has been achieved, much progress made, but it seems to have been put on the shelf."
". I disagree, Mr Rack."
"Nothing has been shelved."
"We all recognise that Croatia has made considerable progress, and we have rewarded this progress accordingly."
"There is absolutely no reason to doubt that the negotiations will progress rapidly, and that the progress achieved will be honoured accordingly."
"I also see no connection here with other past or future negotiations."
". On this question I must point out that, as you will all be aware, consular matters – of which this is one – are the responsibility of the national authorities."
"As far as the Council is aware, negotiations between Portugal and Canada on this matter have reached an advanced stage."
"I can therefore only say that the Council does not really have any competence on this issue, and I would add that, at the request of the country concerned, the issue is also not being discussed any further in the Council working group on consular affairs."
"– I must say I am astonished to hear that answer."
"May I point out that four or five years ago, when I put a similar question, on the United States, to the Commission, I was told that the Council was working on the issue via a group that specialised in consular matters."
"Yet we are now witnessing a concept in retreat, a European citizenship that used to exist and that used to be taken into account four or five years ago, which is no longer the case."
"I should like to understand how this is possible."
". I would point out that this is, and must be, ultimately a question of what the country involved actually wants."
"If a Member State of the European Union wants to deal with a national issue nationally and bilaterally, and to discuss it with the third country, then the European Union should not interfere."
"Were Portugal to say that it wanted something else, the Council would of course look into it accordingly."
". In general, the EU and the Council are monitoring the human rights situation in Iran very carefully and with growing concern."
"At the 60th session of the United Nations General Assembly, it was the European Union that tabled a resolution on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, thereby publicly expressing to the world its concerns regarding the situation in Iran."
"I can assure the honourable Members that the European Union is using all the means at its disposal – publicly and confidentially, in declarations and démarches – to express these concerns regarding abuses of human rights in Iran, and it will continue to do so."
"Regarding the case of Masouma Kaabi and her son, it has been reported that they were released on bail a few weeks ago."
"The European Union is monitoring the situation and will take every available opportunity to discuss and express these very justifiable worries and concerns."
"I simply wished to point out to the Council that this is not a general reference to human rights in Iran, but rather we are talking about specific cases."
"You have referred to the specific case of the person who has been released and not to the cases in which people have not been released."
"I am referring to a very specific case, not to a general defence of human rights in Iran, since we are in fact doing that fairly effectively."
"The same cannot be said about direct intervention in specific cases that we are aware of."
". Concern for the fates of individuals is, in fact, and quite naturally, particularly close to the hearts of the European Union and the Council."
"Particularly in individual cases, it is important to proceed in a way that is efficient and does not have the opposite effect to that intended."
"That is difficult."
"I myself have worked in this field for long enough to know that it is often difficult to find the right path, and to avoid giving the impression that we are not interested in these cases whilst at the same time not running the risk, by proceeding too officially, of the result being the opposite of what we actually wanted."
"You can be assured that the European Union and the Council are working very hard to find the right path in each individual case – and it goes without saying that we care very much about the fates of these people."
"However, I must tell you, quite openly and frankly, that the European Union's options are sometimes very limited and that we do not always achieve the level of success we would hope for – and this is, admittedly, sometimes very frustrating."
"However, we will not be put off by that, and we will continue down this path."
"President-in-Office, you said that the scope of the EU’s powers is limited, which I accept."
"However, the one thing the EU could do is to lift the label of outlaws and terrorists from the People’s Mujahedin."
"I raised this matter a few months ago and asked you to consider bringing it before the Council."
"You said, to my delight, that you would not just consider it but positively do it."
"Could you share with us the progress you have made or expect to make, or the timing thereof?"
". Indeed that question has been brought to the attention of the Council, which is still considering it."
"I hope that I will soon be able to give you a concrete answer, but I cannot do that today."
"I beg your indulgence and a little more patience."
"– As you are aware, the EU-Iran human rights dialogue has been suspended."
"We are also aware that Iran is certainly interested in resuming this dialogue, but we know what the problems are."
"What is your view of the situation?"
"Will the dialogue be resumed shortly, and what could this dialogue actually achieve in the cases specifically mentioned?"
". In this connection I should like to start by saying, as before, that it is a matter of balance."
"Iran is certainly very interested in resuming this human rights dialogue, and of course the Council is also, in principle, interested in holding such a dialogue with Iran, because it offers an opportunity to raise many issues in this connection, including individual cases."
"However, we cannot allow the European Union to get involved in a dialogue that will be abused by the other side as, so to speak, an alibi or as a whitewash."
"The European Union therefore has a very specific view on the conditions under which this dialogue could take place."
"One of the preconditions for the European Union entering such a dialogue is that certain specific concessions must be made in advance."
"The European Union's expectations in this regard include, in particular, the release of political prisoners."
"As I said, though, we are prepared to enter into dialogue, and if Iran is seriously interested in such a dialogue, the European Union will willingly take part, under the specified conditions."
". I shall be happy to deal with this issue in somewhat more detail although, if I have been correctly informed, I shall be able to adopt a more thorough position on it at 9 p.m. today, the Council having said that it is prepared still to be in this House at that time and to take part in this debate."
"The Council attaches the very greatest importance to the issue, addressed by Mrs Andrikiene, of a common and coordinated energy policy for the European Union."
"I should point out that, in the conclusions to the informal Council meeting in March on the subject of ‘A New Energy Policy for Europe’, the Council referred to these problems and made relevant decisions on this issue under the heading ‘Energy policy for Europe’."
"It was stated, in this context, that Europe has many challenges to meet in the energy sphere, notably the increasing dependence on imports and what has so far still been limited diversification."
"In the conclusions, the Council therefore calls quite clearly for an energy policy for Europe that is focused on an efficient Community policy and on coherence between the Member States and between the measures taken in the various policy areas and that, in a balanced way, adequately fulfils the objectives of security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability."
"I should like to mention in this context that, precisely where the energy issue is concerned, a careful examination needs to be made of what comes under the powers of the state and what can be done in this area at European level."
"Synergy effects must be obtained in this sphere."
"The European Council has also stated that the security of energy supply should be increased, partly by developing a common external concept and by promoting energy dialogues between the European Union and its most important partners and stronger diversification in terms of suppliers, transport routes and external energy sources."
"The European Union and the Council too will, in the next few weeks, be devoting particular attention to precisely this aspect of external policy."
"Using the existing structures as a basis, the Council will join the European Commission in working towards a more effective form of dialogue between the European Union and Russia."
"It will not be long before the summit offers the opportunity to explore this issue, which will also be one of the important topics at this summit."
"With a view to ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty, the Council is also calling for the negotiations concerning the Transit Protocol to be completed."
"The legal framework offered by these instruments would increase the transparency and competitiveness of the energy markets and, at the same time, help create more favourable investment conditions in those countries that are parties to the Treaty."
"In the framework of this common energy concept, a genuine energy partnership with Russia too should be possible, and security and predictability guaranteed for everyone."
"It should be pointed out that this topic has not just come out of the blue. Rather, the Council has for a long time already been developing an interest in this type of efficient and coordinated energy policy."
"This issue has only now become particularly topical, specifically at 8 a.m. on 1 January 2006 – eight hours after the Austrian Presidency had begun – when, as is well known, developments took place in which Russia interrupted the energy supply."
"The gradual construction of a legal framework for energy, be it through the promotion of renewable energy sources or through the successive liberalisation packages, which by the summer of next year will guarantee a complete opening-up of the common energy market, is already contributing to a coordinated and common energy policy, rightly called for by Mrs Andrikiene."
"When it comes to the diversification of energy sources and transport routes, the very recent acceptance of the decision on trans-European energy networks is an important step in this direction."
"The conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty with the South-East European countries, on which I shall be able to explain my position in detail in the next debate at 9 p.m., also contributes to achieving this objective, as the internal concept of the energy market is extended to include neighbouring countries."
"In this connection, the Council looks forward with interest to the evaluation of the energy strategy which the Commission wishes to submit to the Council and Parliament in the course of next year and which deals in particular with the targets and measures required for an external energy policy in the medium and long term."
"Where, finally, the issue of the G8 Summit is concerned, I should like to point out that the Council does not of course belong to the group of G8 countries and does not therefore take part, as the Council, in the meetings, either."
"It is, however, prepared to deal with the issues of mutuality and transparency in other relevant forums such as the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue."
"These important issues were also brought up for discussion very recently in a letter from the Energy Commissioner, Mr Piebalgs, and the President of the Energy Council, Mr Bartenstein, to the Russian energy minister, Mr Christenko."
"Madam President, I do not have a supplementary question."
"I just wanted to thank the President-in-Office for his very detailed answer."
"I should firstly like to congratulate the Council on its success in having the 2007 internal market for the end user included in the final documents."
"It will involve a lot more work now, but I think that it will be of corresponding benefit in terms of the Lisbon Strategy."
"My question is: What actually is the situation where the Energy Community is concerned?"
"May it be extended to further states, and which states are the main candidates?"
". Good progress is being made in establishing the Energy Community."
"The Treaty has now been signed by four states."
"I see no basic reason why, if such a development is helpful, this Treaty might not be extended to other states too."
"To my knowledge, there is not, however, at present any definite intention to extend it in this way."
"The negotiations with Turkey, which has not signed the agreement, are also being continued with."
"As a country of transit and a connecting link, Turkey is, logically enough, of great interest."
"I could imagine some future development too entailing an extension to the number of states that are signatories to the Treaty."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission has produced a fine paper on the security of energy supply in the EU."
"We know, however, that powers in this area are very fragmented."
"What can the Presidency of the Council do in order to enable Europe to present a united front, particularly to Russia, and what can be done to enable our partner, Russia, to maintain in the field of energy production those standards of sustainability that we have achieved in the Community?"
"If further standardisation is required of what you rightly call this fragmented state of affairs where powers are concerned, the Commission will have to propose legal regulations."
"When it comes to having a credible common external policy on energy, the Council is endeavouring to devise a common concept as a follow-up to the March decisions."
"The High Representative has also been asked for proposals in connection with this common concept."
"Mr Solana will also produce something in this context because this is a very important issue in the framework of the European Union’s overall external policy."
"Has the Presidency of the Council of Ministers approached other EU Member States about its proposal to introduce some form of direct taxation to fund the EU's budget?"
"If so, could the Presidency outline what steps have been taken so far and furthermore, does the Presidency expect the Council of Ministers to make much progress on this issue in the coming months?"
"In the January 2006 part-session of the European Parliament, the Austrian Federal Chancellor expressed his opinion on the possibility of introducing a direct source of funding for the European Union."
"At that time, there was discussion of the financial perspective, which is funded mainly from contributions by the individual Member States, and the discussion therefore turned again to the subject of the European Union having its own direct source of funding for the budget."
"When, in December 2005, the European Council reached an agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 – with the Treaty now signed, the Interinstitutional Agreement has therefore now been successfully concluded – the Commission was given the task of undertaking a comprehensive examination of all aspects of EU expenditure, including expenditure under the common agricultural policy and system of own resources and taking account too of the United Kingdom’s rebate, the intention being that the Commission should produce a report on the subject in 2008 or 2009."
"In a joint declaration by all three institutions on the new Interinstitutional Agreement, this method of proceeding was confirmed in April 2006."
"I should like, however, to emphasise in this context that, on this issue too, we must proceed on the basis of the principle of unanimity, and this is of course a very difficult issue to resolve because not all Member States are in agreement, especially on the subject of what particular direct source of funding should be opted for."
"I believe that, here in the European Parliament too, there are still very different views on this issue."
". I would like to thank the Presidency for that reply."
"I noted recently that a colleague in this House suggested that there should be a tax on texts and emails."
"If we really want to get people’s backs up and alienate young people from the European Union, that would be the way to go!"
"I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to his response."
"He said that the issue of a direct tax was on the table."
"Can he confirm to the House that this is no longer on the table?"
"Or is it still on the table for discussion and can it arise again for discussion in the near future?"
"The issue is not only being debated, but it is also being looked into more closely. Moreover, it will remain an ongoing subject for discussion in Ecofin, because an evaluation has, above all, to be carried out."
"The fact is that this has been agreed within the framework of the Financial Perspective."
"We therefore hope that a process has now been begun here that can ultimately be brought to a successful conclusion."
"In the view, no doubt, of probably the large majority of European Union citizens, it is high time that, instead of constantly looking for new sources of funding, for example in the form of direct EU taxes, and instead of constantly increasing the level of expenditure, we finally got to grips with combating fraud and waste."
"What is the Council’s position on this?"
"– As a representative of the Austrian Ministry of Finance, I wholeheartedly agree with you that there are two sides to every budget – an expenditure and a revenue side."
"There are two ways of handling budgets."
"Our aim is to achieve a balanced budget in all the Member States at least through counterbalancing cyclical trends: by increasing revenue, on the one hand, which – of course – is unpopular with the public and the business community."
"On the other hand, we are striving towards more efficient spending – we need to cut back expenditure, but we need to do so efficiently; and, on the revenue side, we need to ensure that governments do in fact receive all the fiscal charges provided for by law instead of introducing new fiscal charges."
"This is an important discussion, and I recently travelled to some of the new Member States to discuss issues such as this, for example turnover-tax fraud, which is a major problem throughout Europe and is estimated to cost the economy EUR 70 billion."
"The same goes for the fight against customs fraud."
"Under Austria’s Council Presidency, we held discussions with tax experts in Vienna in February on ways of bringing turnover-tax fraud under control, such as introducing different tax systems and improving the existing system."
"– These questions concern a uniform assessment basis for company taxation."
"The Commission is currently working on the technical preparations for a proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base."
"These preparations are entrusted to a working group under the auspices of the Commission itself that was set up following the informal Ecofin Council in September 2004."
"On 5 April of this year, the Commission presented the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee with a communication entitled ‘Progress to date and next steps towards a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB)’."
"This firstly reports on the progress made to date, as the title indicates, and secondly identifies the fields in which the Commission requires political support and direction for further technical work."
"At the informal Ecofin Council held at the Presidency’s invitation in Vienna on 7 April, Ministers were presented with the Commission’s initial report on the state of technical preparations."
"At the end of this informal Council, the Council President, Karl-Heinz Grasser, stated that the discussions had shown there to be clear majority in favour of this assessment basis."
"In the Ministers’ estimation, this basis would result in cost savings for enterprises and a simplification of the national tax systems."
"In addition, the Commissioner responsible for taxation, Commissioner Kovács, stated that, although it was no easy task to speak up for a harmonised corporate tax base, the Ministers had engaged in an informative exchange of views over lunch."
"In future, the Commission will report regularly to the Council on the progress of the work."
"The Presidency has put an initial exchange of views between Ministers concerning the Commission communication on the agenda for the Council to be held on 7 June of this year."
"His expectation is that the contributions that the working group I have already mentioned receives from the Commission and the Member States will make it possible for rapid progress to be made with technical preparations."
"As Commissioner Kovács, the Commissioner responsible, stated at the last informal Council, the issue should appear on the agenda of the following Council Presidency, too – as envisaged in the annual programme."
"This is an issue that cannot be resolved in the near future, therefore, but needs lengthy preparation."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, has a study been or will a study be carried out into the repercussions of the adoption of a uniform basis for assessment?"
"– There are not yet any cost estimates available."
"We need to await this study, which will take some time."
"It is not possible to give a date for its completion."
"This issue of course demonstrates that unanimity is a stumbling block not only on taxation in general, but also within taxation issues."
"After all, as the President-in-Office has said, there is majority support for this uniform assessment basis, but an open door to agreement is not yet in sight."
"My question to the President-in-Office is: to his knowledge of the counter-arguments, how many countries firmly oppose this, and does he envisage any possibility of overcoming the barrier of unanimity?"
"In addition, should we not abolish unanimity altogether in the case of taxation relevant to the internal market?"
"– The problem of unanimity now that there are 25 Member States is particularly acute in matters of taxation."
"Member States who have only recently introduced a completely different tax system, for example a flat-tax system – that is, a single rate for company taxation, income tax and such like – have difficulty supporting a uniform assessment basis."
"It is natural for these countries to object, as they are currently benefiting from tax competition."
"In specific terms, there are four countries that object to introducing it too quickly or to making any changes at all."
"In my view, the only remedy is to be found in the form of a constitution, which Europe needs – and the more countries that join the EU, the more imperative this becomes – so that we are able to take majority decisions in this field, too."
"As we have also seen in the matter of the reduction in turnover tax, which was very difficult to resolve, unanimity in matters as difficult as taxation causes problems when it comes to taking decisions necessary for the economy and to creating growth and jobs – something that can also be seen in connection with the Lisbon process."
"To do so requires a flexible decision-making process and a Council that is capable of action."
"Can the European Council produce any economic data which proves that the introduction of harmonised corporate taxes will help to improve the competitive position of all the Member States within the European Union?"
"– This relates to the same subject."
"The issue of finding a uniform tax base is a matter of tax harmonisation, and the question has also been asked as to what documents there are relating to this."
"Unfortunately, there are no data available as yet on the amount that could be saved by this means; that is to say, on the costs that the economy could be spared."
"Nevertheless, the Commission recently published the European Tax Survey, which establishes that enterprises doing business across borders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, incur substantial costs on account of the differing tax systems in the EU, and that this is by no means beneficial to competition."
"In this connection, I should like to draw the House’s attention also to the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards an internal market without tax obstacles’, which was addressed to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee and whose most important objective is to relieve the burden on economic activity in the EU."
"In addition, at the informal Council held in Vienna on 7 and 8 April, the President of the Commission requested the presentation of detailed calculations with regard to the economic benefits of a consolidated tax base."
"In general terms, I should like to point out, however, that the issue of transfer pricing represents an enormous administrative burden for enterprises operating in the internal market, one that would hardly arise at all if a common consolidated tax base were to be implemented."
"In the past, the Council has adopted several measures to make it easier to carry out cross-border economic activities in the Community, including the Parent-Subsidiary Directive, the Merger Directive and the Interest and Royalties Directive."
"In addition, the Commission has presented the Council with a proposal to amend the Interest and Royalties Directive, which is currently still under discussion in the Council."
"Do I gather then, that the reason we are doing it is because it is good for civil servants?"
"Do you not think it strange that the countries that do not want to harmonise tax are the countries that have the highest growth rate, the lowest unemployment, the highest investment in infrastructure and the lowest personal tax?"
"Does it not strike you as strange that they are the countries that do not want to harmonise tax and, in fact, do not want to interfere in other peoples’ taxation systems?"
"The countries that have high tax, high unemployment and low growth are the ones that want to harmonise tax."
"It seems extraordinary to me that we do not want to follow the countries that are economically successful at the moment, but want to bring in a tax system that is unsuccessful in other parts of Europe."
". – We are concerned here with the issue of fair tax competition."
"The EU envisages fair tax competition as a fundamental principle in all matters and interests; it is just that all participants should be on an equal footing."
"The tax competition should ensue from different tax rates."
"What we are concerned with here is the issue of the flat tax Some of the new Member States have recently introduced a new tax system in which the tax rates for enterprises are far lower than those of the old Member States."
"Relatively unfairly – because these are all net recipients – this results in tax competition that prompts the question as to whether, in view of the severe reduction in taxes, these countries are really still able to discharge the social transfer responsibilities they share with all Member States: pension and health-insurance systems."
"I completely agree that there are differences in different countries, but you are talking mostly about new Member States that have implemented new taxation systems, and about unfair competition."
"When the new Member States entered the European Union they did not know about the European Union’s plans to harmonise taxes."
"I disagree, therefore, with the view that we are not competing fairly with all the European Union Member States."
". – Harmonisation of company taxation is, on the one hand, a matter of simplifying the system for the business community so that tax bases are not different in every country – with country A having different write-off facilities from country B or country C – but instead the facilities are always the same; as this is a great problem for enterprises."
"Companies operating internationally have enumerated the variety of legislation that has to be observed in the motor vehicles sector – car manufacturing – alone, and the extent of the resulting administrative burden."
"On the other hand, this harmonisation is about fair, transparent competition."
"Transparent competition means that business profit – the base – is taxed according to uniform principles, and competition then arises from different tax rates."
"We do not want to eliminate competition."
"It should always be carried out within the meaning of the Lisbon process."
"The second point is that we are an internal market, and an internal market requires common rules."
"How does the Council justify the continuing existence of tax havens like Liechtenstein, Andorra and the Channel Islands?"
"What action would the Presidency like to see to address these anomalies, which adversely affect all EU citizens?"
". – In connection with this question, I should like to point out that, on 3 June 2003, the Ecofin Council adopted the Directive on the taxation of savings."
"This Directive aims to ensure that cross-border savings income received by persons resident in the EU in the form of interest payments is either taxed in the Member State in which they are resident, or subject to a withholding tax in the Member State that is considered the source State."
"In order to preclude distortions of competition with important financial centres outside the EU, the Directive also provides that the same or equivalent measures be applied by a series of territories and third countries."
"These include 10 dependent and associated territories, such as the Isle of Man, and five European countries, namely Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland."
"The measures laid down in the Directive and the agreements concluded with the third countries and territories have been applied by all 40 contracting parties concerned since 1 July 2005."
"Extending the territorial scope of the Directive to other relevant financial centres is possible in principle."
"On 1 December 1997, the Council adopted a Resolution on a code of conduct for business taxation, which deals with potentially harmful tax measures that affect, or may affect, in a significant way the location of business activity in the Community."
"Sixty-six tax measures in the old Member States and thirty in the new Member States have been classified as harmful by the Code of Conduct Group and largely phased out."
"The Code of Conduct Group is now focusing on its future work, on which the Council expects to receive a report in June."
"I thank the Council for that very comprehensive response."
"I am still amazed that the situation is allowed to continue."
"Liechtenstein must be a drain on Austria in the way it flouts the system so close by."
"I am amazed that the larger EU states allow these anomalies to continue outside the EU but within the wider area."
"These states are extremely dependent on our benevolence."
"Andorra uses the euro, the Channel Islands use the pound sterling, but they pick and choose which laws they want to follow."
"They exploit loopholes that the EU allows, and we continue to allow that and enable a few rich people to exploit the system, making a mockery of our EU regulations."
"Despite everything the President-in-Office has said, I still think it is amazing that we allow these anomalies to continue."
"I would have thought there is a need for even more action than he has just spoken about."
". – I agree with the honourable Member in that ideally, of course, an internal market covering almost the whole of Europe should have tax rules in place; but these also need to be effective, and neighbouring countries and, if possible, countries outside the continent need to apply the same rules, otherwise we hand the EU public the possibility of investing its money abroad, where such rules do not apply."
"That is why it was important to overcome any opposition – and I visited some of these countries myself when the agreements were being negotiated."
"In any case, Liechtenstein, San Marino and the countries I named earlier have signed this agreement and, in this way, we at least guarantee that these territories follow uniform tax rules."
"Naturally, we should like other countries, too, to follow this example."
"Switzerland in particular, situated as it is in the middle of Europe, should make efforts to apply the European rules, and should also be bound to them by an agreement."
"The President-in-Office of the Council must himself be aware of the criticism that tax havens are increasingly being used for the purposes of money laundering."
"These countries’ provisions on money laundering do not meet the usual high standards or are not being applied correctly."
"Is the Council Presidency, and the EU in general, considering working with these countries to tackle and solve this problem?"
"– I shall return to this question later."
"One question relates to money laundering."
"Naturally, it is important that uniform guidelines on money laundering be applied in all of the countries of an extended economic area – the FATF is an important body in this regard."
"The Commission is also holding talks on this subject."
"Will the Council provide an update on the implementation of the future economic and fiscal framework that was set out in the 2005 Spring Council?"
". – We are now shifting from taxation to the budget issue."
"What we are concerned with here is Member States’ adherence to their budgets."
"Following the debate at the 2005 Spring European Council, the Commission made proposals for amending Regulations 1466/97 and 1467/97, which form the legislative components of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The relevant amending Regulations were adopted on 27 June 2005 following a lengthy discussion process – in the course of which it was asserted that the old Stability and Growth Pact was dead."
"Both regulations were adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 252 of the Treaty, and Regulation 1056/2005 was adopted following an opinion from the European Parliament."
"In addition, on 11 October 2005, the Ecofin Council established a revised Code of Conduct relating to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and Guidelines on the content and format of the Stability and Convergence programmes."
"All of these rules are publicly available, as is the information on the steps taken to date by the Council in connection with the revised Stability and Growth Pact."
"The latter comprise the following legal acts: decisions in accordance with Article 104(6) EC on the existence of excessive deficit in Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom; recommendations on measures to correct these deficits under Article 104(7) EC; a decision establishing, in accordance with Article 104(8) EC, that the action taken by Hungary in response to the Council recommendations regarding the correction of its excessive deficit had proved to be inadequate; and also a Council Decision giving notice to Germany, in accordance with Article 104(9) EC, to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary in order to remedy the situation of excessive deficit."
"In addition, the Council has delivered opinions on the updated stability and convergence programmes of all Member States, which had been drawn up for the first time in the context of the new regulatory framework for the amended Stability and Growth Pact."
"In a nutshell, I can say that, in spite of the criticism that the Stability and Growth Pact was practically dead, the new Stability and Growth Pact has proved to be functional and alive."
"This can also be seen in the significant fall in deficits in 2005 compared to 2004."
"I thank the Presidency for that reply."
"I understand that economic growth is projected to be 2.3% in the European Union and 2.1% in the euro area in 2006, up from 1.6% and 1.3% respectively in 2005."
"But would the President-in-Office share my concerns that growth rates do not appear to be converting into forecasted increases in employment rates?"
"Whereas I understand that one million jobs are expected to be created over the next 12 months, the unemployment rate would still remain stubbornly high, at about 8.4%."
"Do you share my concerns that economic growth is not converting to jobs?"
"What steps are being taken to deal with that issue?"
"– It was for this very reason that we made the Lisbon Strategy such a high priority at the last European Council."
"This Council discussed growth, as growth is a means of increasing employment and thus reducing unemployment."
"Specific objectives were given, including the gradual creation of one million jobs; and achieving these objectives in practice is a very important starting point."
"Unemployment is the main problem facing Europe at the moment."
"This Council Presidency, in particular, has taken very specific, targeted measures on this."
"One factor currently endangering growth is the development of oil prices."
"This potential risk must be clearly recognised."
"We hope to see stability restored in this regard – particularly in global politics."
"Indeed, for the most part, the issue of oil prices at the present time is less a problem of supply and more a psychological phenomenon."
"The issue of Iran has already been mentioned."
"We must do our utmost to ensure that, on the one hand, we really achieve growth rates – a very tangible presence before us – in international competition with the USA and the Asian economic area, and that, on the other hand, by means of political stability, all the risks that emerge time and again, and naturally have the potential to affect economic growth, play a less prominent role."
"If we are to reduce unemployment effectively, however, we need to aim for even better growth rates."
"A growth rate of around 3% would reduce unemployment perceptibly."
"That is why the growth rate of 2.6 – even if it is a good rate in comparison with previous years – is still too low."
"What measures is the Council proposing in order to induce those countries that repeatedly endanger the Stability and Growth Pact with their excessive deficits to be more disciplined?"
". – I refer once again to my previous answer."
"I have named all the countries concerned – Italy’s deficit being a prime example."
"It must always be borne in mind in this connection, of course, that these countries – Italy in particular – have had elections this year, which naturally hinders an excessive deficit procedure such as this, because it means that political decisions are postponed for a while."
"Italy has given assurances that it will now, with its new Government, take all the measures stipulated by the Council."
"I have named all the countries giving cause for concern: Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom and, among the new Member States, Hungary in particular, with its 6% deficit."
"Each Council meeting consistently works towards reducing the deficit, and this has borne fruit."
"To reiterate, the 2005 financial year saw a general reduction in the deficit compared with the previous year."
"Questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the recommendation by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy Community Treaty [13886/1/2005 – C6-0435/2005 – 2005/0178(AVC)] (Rapporteur: Giles Chichester)(A6-0134/2006),"
"- the oral question to the Council on the Treaty establishing the Energy Community for South-East Europe, by Giles Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (O-0024/2006 – B6-0020/2006) and"
"- the oral question to the Commission on the Treaty establishing the Energy Community for South-East Europe, by Giles Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (O-0025/2006 – B6-0206/2006)."
". Mr President, I am not sure I have ever enjoyed such largesse of time before in this House, but I am glad it is in the company of a select club!"
"I wish to begin by expanding on the objects of our two questions to the Council and to the Commission."
"I should emphasise that they are questions – although it is gratifying to see my name on them, the questions are on behalf of my committee."
"I am very pleased to see that the Presidency is able to be present after all."
"I appreciate that this may have caused inconvenience, but holding this debate at this time presents some inconvenience to me as well: I could be elsewhere consuming asparagus."
"Because the Council has changed the original Commission proposal with regard to the role of the European Parliament from the consultation procedure to simply informing Parliament of any decision of the Council, I am bound to ask why the Council appears to be trying to bypass or circumvent Parliament."
"What could the Council have to hide?"
"In the context of the apparent reluctance to be present here tonight, the substance of our question has added relevance."
"Therefore, allow me to remind the Council representative, Mr Winkler, of our two specific questions."
"The first is: what mechanism would the Council envisage for informing of Parliament prior to the adoption of a position by the Council with regard to the Energy Community Treaty institutions?"
"Secondly, by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the representatives of the European Community in the organs of the Energy Community Treaty, such as the Permanent High Level Group?"
"Before the House is invited to vote on the recommendation on the Energy Community Treaty tomorrow, we need some answers and assurances from the Council on these points, and I and others will be listening carefully."
"Because this is a very important matter, the proposed Treaty creates an interesting precedent in extending the in a limited and very specific field to third countries, albeit that two of them should be joining the European Union very shortly or others are in various stages of negotiating accession."
"It is also important because energy is currently perceived as a very important issue, largely as a result of events at the beginning of this year."
"Those events were rather like throwing a large stone into a pond, creating ripples."
"Energy is vital to our way of life, vital to our quality of life and vital to our standard of living, so how we organise markets and safeguard security of supply is equally important."
"Turning to the question to the Commission, I should like to acknowledge from the outset the high level of cooperation and the positive response to our concerns that we have received from Commissioner Piebalgs."
"Indeed, I welcome his open and constructive approach in meetings and in the recent letter with regard to the issues of informing Parliament about the activities of the Energy Community and addressing some of the concerns of my committee over social and human rights issues."
"I trust that the Council will endorse his offer to inform Parliament in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues."
"I welcome his letter’s assertion that he considers it of the utmost importance that Parliament is fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community."
"Now I come to the specific points contained in our questions to the Commission, which I feel still require a response."
"The Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty lays down in its Article 4(3) the provisions for providing ‘mutual assistance in the event of disruption’ – see the Treaty’s Title IV, Chapter IV."
"Yet the same article of the decision stipulates that: ‘in the event of special circumstances’ the position of the European Community ‘may go beyond the ’."
"So the first question is: what might these special circumstances be?"
"The second question is: what is meant by the phrase, it ‘may go beyond the ’?"
"I ask the Commissioner to put some flesh on those two issues for us."
"The final point – by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the Commission within the various organs of the Energy Community Treaty – has been answered in general terms in the Commissioner’s letter."
"However, I invite him to share any further thoughts he may have with Parliament on detailed implementation of these undertakings."
"Finally, I come to the crux of the matter: whether Parliament should vote for the recommendation."
"Let me say that I recognise the good intention of the Commission in offering to brief my committee about the work undertaken in the preparation and negotiation of this Treaty, although our reaction might have been more welcoming and less suspicious of what was being proposed had it not come out of the blue without any prior knowledge on our part."
"I also recognise and appreciate the Commission’s efforts to persuade the Council to take this Treaty down the assent procedure route instead of, as it were, slipping it through on the nod."
"However, I am bound to observe that this was after we began raising questions about possible empire-building by the Commission."
"This Treaty could provide an important message to the countries of south-east Europe, and even beyond, that the EU is capable of being outward-looking and wants to embrace them in the family of European nations."
"I am not entirely sure how much comfort Bulgaria will derive from this, given the earlier decision to force early closure of Kozloduy – a decision which no longer has any technical justification in my view, but maybe this Treaty could help offset that negative message."
"I close by expressing the hope that the Council in particular will be able to give us sufficient comfort this evening so that we can proceed to a favourable vote tomorrow."
". Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to say that it is indeed a pleasure for me to participate in this debate on a question that I consider very important, because in the eyes of the Council the subject matter is very important."
"I was not invited to feast on asparagus tonight, so my destiny is an easier one than yours; but as a Permanent Representative of Austria to the Council of Europe I had the pleasure for five years to be invited to those feasts."
"With your permission, Mr President, and with my apologies to Mr Chichester, I shall continue in German; but I hope that I will be able to give comprehensive answers to the questions that were put to the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council does indeed consider the Treaty establishing the Energy Community between the European Community and the countries of South-East Europe to be an important instrument, for obvious reasons: security of the electricity and gas supply to the European Community and also to the contracting parties in the region."
"This subject came to the attention of the Austrian Presidency somewhat dramatically only a few hours after, at 8 a.m. on 1 January, gas supplies were cut not only to Ukraine and Moldova, but also to Central Europe."
"That made us all acutely aware of how desperate the situation had become."
"As the Committee quite rightly notes, one of the objectives of this Treaty is the extension of the EC energy market to the countries of the region through their implementation of the on energy, environment, competition and renewables."
"This strikes me as particularly important in the interests of the homogeneity and coherence of a pan-European strategy."
"Hence, the Energy Community Treaty is characterised by the fact that one of the most important aspects of the work of the bodies it envisages is the implementation of the relevant provisions of Community law."
"In addition, Article 25 of this Treaty provides that measures may be taken to implement amendments to the , in line with the evolution of European Community law."
"This dynamic reference also strikes me as very important."
"The Council would like to emphasise that this means, of course, that Parliament is directly involved from the outset in the preparation of Community rules and the adoption of these rules by both of our institutions under the codecision procedure."
"Therefore, these are rules that are then to be incorporated into the framework of the Energy Community Treaty."
"The importance of Parliament’s role in the adoption of the Energy Community Treaty is also reflected in the choice of legal basis, that is to say, in the fact that Parliament has a right of assent, as stated in Article 300(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"We are not just talking about a right of consultation, therefore."
"The Council’s amendment to the Commission proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty to which the honourable Member Mr Chichester’s question relates concerns the role of the European Parliament in decision-making."
"The Council has indeed deleted Article 5(3) of the proposal, which had provided for the consultation procedure."
"It should be pointed out, however, that the Commission proposal had envisaged consultation of the European Parliament only in a single specific case, namely that of the establishment of positions of the European Communities on decisions to be taken by the Energy Community pursuant to Article 100(iii) of the Energy Community Treaty; that is to say, decisions on the extension of this Treaty to other energy products and carriers or other essential network infrastructures."
"In other words, under the Commission proposal, the Commission would present the Council with a draft relating to the establishment of a Community position on this kind of amendment of the Energy Community Treaty, and the Council would then have to consult Parliament on this position."
"Such a procedure is not provided for in the EC Treaty, however, and so would be in addition to its procedures and thus alter its institutional balance."
"Instead, the EC Treaty, more specifically Article 300(2)(3), provides that the European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed."
"However, even though the EC Treaty does not provide for informing of Parliament in the event of a scenario such as the one I have just described: for example, the extension of the Energy Community Treaty – where the deletion is relevant – the Presidency of Parliament will provide regular information on all the important aspects of the proposed Council position."
"I should like to say in this connection that, as the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will remember, the last Council Presidencies that dealt with this issue informed Parliament, within the framework of their speeches to this Committee, on the state of affairs with regard to the Energy Community Treaty."
"I should also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in certain cases, particularly when this is necessary for reasons of political importance, there is nothing to prevent the Council from consulting Parliament on its own initiative."
"I would also point out that the Energy Community Treaty chiefly extends the in whose adoption Parliament is fully involved."
"Let me now turn to the decision-making process in the bodies of the Energy Community and to the positions to be adopted by the European Community in these bodies."
"As the House is aware, the institutional framework of the Energy Community consists of the Ministerial Council, the Permanent High Level Group and the Regulatory Board."
"Parliament is not directly involved in the decision-making process agreed with the parties to the Energy Community Treaty."
"However, Article 52 of this Treaty provides that the Ministerial Council must present Parliament, and also the national parliaments of the contracting parties, with an annual report on the work of the Energy Community."
"Regarding the position to be adopted by the European Community in these bodies, this is laid down in Article 4 of the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty and is adopted by the Council pursuant to the relevant provisions of the EC Treaty."
"One important aspect of this decision-making process is the requirement for Community positions on Energy Community decisions falling under Titles III and IV of the Energy Community Treaty to be in line with the , with the exception of measures falling under Chapter IV of Title IV of the said Treaty, which concerns mutual assistance in the event of disruption of energy supplies."
"Moving on to Parliament’s involvement, Article 4(5) of the proposal for a Council decision stipulates – as proposed by the Commission – that Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed of any decision of the Council on the establishment of Community positions to be taken in the three bodies of the Energy Community Treaty."
"There is no formal requirement for informing of Parliament, but it is the Presidency’s firm intention to inform Parliament regularly."
"The Commission will also be required to do so."
"In addition – and the Council will take this into account – the position taken by Parliament once it has been informed will certainly influence the future decisions of the European Community."
"I hope that this speech not only answers the honourable Member’s questions, but also allays any fears that Parliament is not duly involved."
"At all events, I can emphasise once more on behalf of the Council that it is important to us that Parliament is regularly informed and involved regarding not only all the issues in which its involvement is a constitutional right, of course, but also all the issues concerning the functioning of this Treaty."
". Mr President, before answering the questions put to me, I would like to start by explaining the global approach towards the Energy Community."
"We know, and there is some consensus, that the two main routes for enhancing energy security in the European Union are diversification and the strengthening of market forces."
"Extensions of the EU’s own market to include our neighbours would gradually create around the EU a shared regulatory area with common trade, transit and environmental rules."
"In this context, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to present a successful initiative in the region of south-east Europe."
"It is not only because of its needs that the European Union acted in this area."
"The disintegration of the former Yugoslav energy system has brought havoc to the regional market, by breaking electricity connections, disrupting trade routes and forcing the system to work – on a chronic basis – far beyond its capacity."
"On the other hand, industrial decline and population shifts have made demand much more capricious and more varied, so the technical challenges of keeping the system alive were preventing development and a fresh start."
"Indeed, some European Union aid was being used to buy electricity and fuel oil for immediate consumption."
"Such a situation could not go on."
"Apart from these immediate needs, the Commission made a strategic decision to look at the long-term needs, to gather international consensus for a way forward and create a real basis for post-war cooperation in the region."
"Today, I can present to the European Parliament the results of our joint work."
"It is valuable to the stabilisation and economic development of these countries."
"Within ten years we have gone from war to cooperative management of the most essential sector of the economy: energy."
"Along the way we have faced difficulties and sometimes scepticism. And I have to thank Parliament for assisting us in overcoming these difficulties."
"I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, and the shadow rapporteurs."
"The issues we have been discussing are not only related to investments."
"We have also addressed environmental and social issues in our debate."
"So the creation of the Energy Community for south-east Europe clearly responds to the needs of the region and of the whole EU."
"Let me now turn to the question."
"Firstly, the Energy Community Treaty provides for a procedure ensuring cooperation and mutual assistance of the parties in the event of disruption of gas or electricity supply affecting a party."
"This is quite an important clause."
"One example is the recent gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine, but also, for instance, the blackout in Italy in 2003, which demonstrated the need for solidarity among European countries, and the importance and the benefits that such a solidarity clause could have in the energy sector."
"I would also recall that this winter Serbia’s gas supplies were cut off for quite a considerable time."
"Pursuant to the draft conclusion decision, the positions that can be taken by the European Community under Title IV of the Energy Community Treaty, providing for the creation of a single energy market between the European Community and the countries of south-east Europe and containing the mutual assistance clause, have to be inspired by the existing ."
"As mutual assistance may not be fully covered by the existing – and in some cases our is perhaps not ambitious enough – it was important to introduce some flexibility to this limitation as regards the mutual assistance clause."
"The reference to specific circumstances allows for this flexibility."
"It will, ultimately, be up to the Council to decide by qualified majority, whether or not the specific circumstances are met on a case-by-case basis."
"In my view, this concerns situations of extreme gravity and extreme disruption."
"Of course any measure concerning the mutual assistance clause will have to remain within the external competence of the European Community."
"Let me highlight, in that regard, that decisions of the Energy Community on mutual assistance have to be taken by unanimity so that the European Community will have a veto on all decisions to be adopted."
"Secondly, let me stress that, through its proposal to the Council, the Commission has steadily acted in favour of an increased role of Parliament as regards the ratification of the Energy Community Treaty."
"In this regard, once the Treaty has entered into force, I consider it of utmost importance that Parliament be fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community."
"To this effect, Parliament will be informed in advance of each semi-annual Ministerial Council of the European Energy Community."
"I have also instructed my services to ensure that Parliament is informed in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues and that it has full access to the Energy Community’s documents."
"There are no restrictions on official documents of the Energy Community and all policy documents are placed on the Energy Community website."
"These documents are accessible to all those who have an interest in them."
"In addition, as provided for in the Treaty, the Energy Community’s Ministerial Council will, on an annual basis, submit a report on the activities of the Energy Community to the European Parliament and all other national parliaments involved, as the President-in-Office mentioned."
"In line with the proposed Conclusion Decisions, the Commission will further submit to Parliament, every three years, a report on the Energy Community."
"I hope that my answers to the questions are satisfactory."
"I would also like to mention the issues referred to by the honourable Member with regard to Kozloduy, because I would like to separate this issue from the Energy Community Treaty."
"The energy chapter with Bulgaria was closed in 2002 and both sides have agreed to close that chapter on the basis that units 3 and 4 of Kozloduy will be closed on the grounds of safety requirements."
"That means we have provided aid for Bulgaria to deal with this situation."
"So I would not make a connection between these two issues, because the decisions have been taken by mutual understanding and we have done quite substantial work to help Bulgaria deal with the consequences of the closure of units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy power station."
". Mr President, thank you for providing what I consider to be comprehensive answers, but we now have to analyse them in order to be completely aware of the current situation."
"An exchange of information is obviously vital."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his particularly active cooperation with Parliament."
"Today, after the conflict in January, we know that energy security is not simply a problem affecting individual Member States, and not simply a challenge for the European Union as a whole."
"We need a pan-European approach to this issue."
"The Energy Community Treaty is a step in the right direction."
"It foresees an integrated gas and energy market in part of Europe, facilitates investment and increases the security of gas supplies to the European Union."
"However, the Treaty also stipulates that investment decisions will be transferred from a national to a centralised level, as this method is more productive, both in terms of costs and administration."
"Thus the Treaty is a good solution."
"It demonstrates that energy security requires a new approach, also in terms of European Union foreign policy."
"It is also a good legal instrument with which to manage energy relations with Ukraine, which intends to sign the Treaty."
"The European Parliament has, on numerous occasions, emphasised the importance of securing energy supplies on the basis of harmonious cooperation between the European Union Member States, which requires the legislative solutions announced by the Commission at the start of this year."
"It is vital for this cooperation to exist within as well as outside the European Union, namely with third countries, in such a way as to avoid interfering with the interests of individual countries and not to exclude any Member State from the proposed solutions."
". Mr President, I wish to thank both the Council and the Commissioner for allowing Parliament to continue to participate in these matters in the future."
"The Energy Community Treaty, signed in October, integrates nine countries in south-east Europe with our energy market."
"That is a historic event in at least two senses."
"Firstly, it is a precedent, as for the first time it will extend legislation on the single market for the electricity and gas sector to nine countries outside the Union."
"Secondly, it is the first multilateral agreement that applies to the whole of south-east Europe since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia."
"It will take much cooperation, but will thus stabilise the region."
"Establishing the Energy Community is in many ways a rational and justifiable project."
"The energy sector in the Balkan region is undeveloped and continues to suffer the consequences of a war that took place a decade ago."
"There are frequent power cuts and there is no secure source of energy available."
"Furthermore, the environment is suffering on account of old power stations and their emissions and, in addition, the lack of investment and lack of competition both pose serious problems."
"The purpose of the Energy Community Treaty is to develop the energy infrastructure with the help of loans granted by financial institutions."
"It is estimated that around EUR 25-30 billion will be needed for investment in the electricity sector over the next 10 years."
"The fact is that a viable and reliable energy system will also tempt investors, which will result in the region’s economic situation developing, improved general stability and a reduction in emigration."
"Moreover, it is important for the Union to improve reliability of the energy supply (we are also speaking from our own point of view) and reduce dependence on single suppliers."
"The Balkan region is also an important route to the Middle East energy in the Caspian region."
"There are also causes for concern."
"In spite of the energy in south-east Europe being at present underpriced, much of the population cannot afford to purchase electricity."
"When the energy sector becomes market-based, it will be capitalised, so prices will inevitably rise."
"The parties to the Treaty should therefore ensure that public service obligations are fulfilled and that prices are reasonable, so that the poor too can afford electricity and gas."
"Parliament insists that the parties should sign a legally binding protocol."
"This kind of binding commitment is important."
"The single market must apply standards, in the areas of working conditions and social equality, for example, especially as we are talking about an energy sector that will be making massive profits."
"Mr President, we know setting up an internal energy market between the EU and the countries of south-east Europe has advantages for both sides: for the Balkan states it helps establish the reliable energy supply necessary for economic growth, and for us on the EU side it facilitates access to gas resources in the Middle East and around the Caspian Sea, enhancing diversity and security of supply – especially important since the ripples in the pool that were alluded to by Mr Chichester."
"However, there have been concerns, and the helpful letter from Commissioner Piebalgs does not entirely answer these."
"It is not clear whether the ECT states will be signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is not clear whether the internal market will be underpinned by health, safety and employment standards, as it is in the EU."
"It is not clear whether there will be any control of the demand side of energy, as there is through EU energy efficiency legislation, or whether environmental considerations, such as the control of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, have been given adequate attention."
"There will be no level playing field if these standards are absent."
"There is also the question of corruption in the energy sector."
"To give just one example, in 2005 the British Serious Fraud Office investigated the involvement of a British company in the Serb state power company following allegations that corrupt money was being used to protect war criminals."
"Because of all these concerns, it is understandable that the European Parliament should wish to be both informed and consulted in advance of decisions."
"I regret that Parliament does not yet have codecision in this area and I wish that there was a Constitution in place so that it would have; but it is an outrage that the consultation mechanism could be downgraded."
"We welcome the reassurances from Commissioner Piebalgs that he will keep Parliament informed in advance, but we need similar cast-iron reassurances from the Council too."
"Nevertheless, being informed is not the same as being consulted."
"Given the serious nature of the questions hanging over the Energy Community Treaty, it would be deeply regrettable if Parliament were sidelined."
"There could effectively be no democratic oversight of this Treaty, because it is clear – not least from what the Council has said tonight – that the real decisions will be taken by the unelected Permanent High Level Group rather than by ministers themselves."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the present Treaty, but we should like to emphasise a number of points that have already been raised, in order to qualify our assent with some reservations."
"In our view, all the signatories to the Treaty should actually make an unqualified declaration of belief in European fundamental rights or, in other words, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"We believe that it is absolutely necessary, including to prevent disruption in the energy market towards which we are striving, that the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding – impact in the fields of employment, social standards, working conditions, health and the environment – be given a binding legal basis."
"The Commission and the Council need to take very seriously the call for these to be made binding."
"In our opinion, it is very important that this Treaty not enable or pursue energy strategies that would have been appropriate 20 years ago at best."
"We believe that energy efficiency must be a very important concern in this new Treaty and that the market that we are intending to create should not be geared towards demand alone."
"In accordance with the discussion on greater autonomy in Europe’s energy supply, consideration for renewable energy must be central in all regions under this Treaty."
"We greatly fear that privatising the sector too quickly and without proper consideration could be harmful."
"We have had experience with privatisation of state monopolies that was carried out too quickly, and believe that the Commission must bear in mind that the public interest in privatisation and the strategies to carry this out needs to be taken into account."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to acknowledge the work of all those who took part in drawing up these documents, especially our rapporteur."
"I agree with his introductory analysis and speech, including the questions he posed."
"As regards the Treaty itself, in my opinion we have succeeded in establishing an acceptable platform for bringing together countries that are not yet EU Member States in a given region, on the grounds of solving energy issues, with a view to their achieving EU compatibility."
"Given that I am not an uncritical advocate of the all-powerful liberalisation of the market, I welcome the fact that the Commission has expressed the intention of dealing with related social aspects in a separate memorandum, which I take to be a good sign, and not only for the citizens of the region concerned."
"Interconnection of energy markets undoubtedly translates into greater security of energy supplies both in south-eastern Europe and in the whole of the Union."
"I do not, however, share the great optimism that the process of interconnecting the markets will lead to cheaper energy; at least this has not happened in the Czech Republic."
"I should like to make one final remark."
"I believe that the time has come to address the issue of setting up an independent European control centre for transmission networks, with a view to solving operational problems, in particular relating to the supply of electricity in EU Member States and their immediate neighbours."
"Mr President, I will outline here a few brief views."
"The internal market is the most important source of prosperity that the EU provides us with."
"It is also, without doubt, important for the internal market that we link up gas and electricity networks, including in south-east Europe."
"As we have heard from a large number of speakers in the Chamber, this would reduce the risk of disruptions in one production unit knocking out large areas."
"There would be stability."
"It is truly excellent that we can also look forward to having regulatory authorities of an international nature."
"Perhaps people in the region will also learn to cooperate with each other and thus minimise the risks of violent conflicts of the type seen in the past."
"So far so good – but then comes the poison arrow."
"All of a sudden, one reads in the report that if we have a common market then this naturally leads to a common external policy."
"This is not at all the case, but it is possible misleadingly to make use of such an inference."
"What we have here is precisely such an abuse in the grand tradition of Jean Monnet."
"Instead of having an open debate about the pros and cons of a common external policy, such a policy is sneaked in in a completely different context."
"This is a very common technique."
"In reality, we know that the people of Europe do not want more supranationalism."
"This fact is revealed the minute the will of the people is allowed to show itself through popular referendums instead of being filtered through the political establishment."
"I contend that the text concerning a common external policy should be expunged."
"Solutions to energy problems in south-east Europe should not be used as a means to promote such a policy."
"Mr President, the Energy Community Treaty is a success story."
"It is worth stating this, because success stories of this nature are particularly rare; today, the combination of politics and energy is more likely to generate conflicts rather than diffuse them."
"We could illustrate this with countless examples, from the manoeuvres of Russia, potentially endangering the gas supply of the European Union, to the Bolivian nationalisations, so enthusiastically celebrated the other day by the leftist Members of this House."
"The Energy Community Treaty is a refreshing exception, and a true European success story that the European Union can be proud of."
"As the result of three years of consistent and persevering efforts, our goal can finally materialise: we can cooperate in the modernisation and rebuilding of the energy supply of the war-torn Balkan region which is of such crucial importance to the safety of Europe."
"I, too, naturally agree with this goal, just like I also support and require that the controlling role of Parliament in respect of the Treaty is ensured."
"One of my reasons for this is that I am convinced that the stabilisation of the energy sector in the Balkans will facilitate the diversification of EU energy supplies."
"I trust that the Treaty will give a fresh impetus to the implementation of the Nabucco gas pipeline project, which is meant to serve this purpose, and may be decisive in relieving the unilateral dependence of Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, on gas imports from Russia."
"I trust that all these things can be achieved, and that the creation of the Energy Community will be a tangible argument for the single European energy policy, also supported by the Green Paper."
"If this is achieved, the European Union can produce further energy success stories, and will continue to set an example of an attractive political community to its neighbouring countries and regions wishing to bridge the gap."
"Mr President, when we extend the single market to neighbouring countries we should not only promote the economic dimension of the European Union but, as when we promoted the single market within the Union itself, we should also include the social dimension."
"The balance between the two parts is lost when it concerns the Energy Community Treaty."
"For instance, does the Treaty not include participation of the social partners?"
"On other occasions Parliament, the Council and the Commission underline the importance of social dialogue."
"Early participation of the social partners in the relevant sectoral dialogue committees, like those in the electricity and mining sectors, has been positive for the social partners in the new Member States."
"We know that liberalisation of the internal market for electricity and gas will necessitate many structural changes and new challenges for the companies and the workforce, as also for the citizens, with regard to affordable prices and security of supply."
"We demand a commitment on the part of the participating countries to respect and implement the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will work towards a good memorandum, with legally binding statutes that also secure democratic control over the sector."
"They should, furthermore, guarantee to oversee the work of the regulatory authorities and the resources and consultation processes of the relevant stakeholders."
"Mr President, buying energy from another country is one thing."
"The political ramifications in this case are quite another, and here it is a written document that matters."
"The EU employs the as one of the founding principles to which all its Member States have solemnly signed."
"How can this be extended to countries which are not even candidates yet?"
"The EU suggests going beyond the and overriding due process in the event of special circumstances."
"What are these circumstances?"
"How short are your memories?"
"We heard this excuse before."
"It led to a conflagration from which we are suffering still and to evils which we still do not comprehend."
"You may know that I do not wish my country to be part of the EU, but currently it is and I am a democrat."
"This House of properly-elected deputies should be consulted and should be the final arbiter, deleting the provision requiring the Council to consult Parliament before adoption of the Commission’s position excludes this House from any meaningful debate."
"This is all about enlargement by the back door."
"Page 6 of the recommendation draws a parallel with the Coal and Steel Community and how it started the EEC as it then was."
"That being the case, why not say so?"
"Why keep it secret?"
"Excluding Parliament, special circumstances decided by an unelected body, secretive motives: all are the beginnings of totalitarianism."
"No, please do not scoff, because that kind of attitude is exactly how all the demagogues and dictators down the ages got away with it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my congratulations on this Treaty."
"I believe that the EU is developing in the right direction here: in the direction of cooperation, and of approaching the global energy market with our eyes open."
"My questions are as follows."
"Which countries are continuing negotiations?"
"What priorities are we setting?"
"Then there is my chief question: have the effects of the Kyoto Protocol been analysed with respect to these Treaties?"
"What will be the impact on energy generation?"
"What mix of energy sources will arise, and what kind of investment behaviour will develop in this field?"
"After all, I believe that these Treaties present us with an opportunity to sketch out certain structures and thus to realise the Lisbon agenda."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been expressed in the course of this debate that the Treaty establishing the Energy Community has historic significance and, from the point of view of its benefits, is not a one-way street."
"It is not the case that we are handing these countries something on a plate, as it were – as the EU, too, benefits."
"As Mr Buzek and others have also said, an important point is that this is a pan-European issue rather than one that concerns only the countries of South-East Europe or only the EU – an integrated energy market certainly could not function like this."
"This Treaty contributes not only to energy security and energy supply but, generally, to increased stability in Europe."
"As you know, the Austrian Presidency, in particular, has attempted in recent months to step up cooperation with the countries of South-East Europe and of the Western Balkans, to make some progress in the interests of stability and peace in Europe."
"It is potentially very interesting to recall that the Energy Community Treaty was consciously modelled on the European Coal and Steel Community – which, as you know, was the genesis for the European Union."
"Members such as Mr Paasilinna have also mentioned here that the Energy Community Treaty enables the very local and specific energy and environmental concerns of South-East Europe to be addressed."
"A number of speakers have raised environmental concerns, such as increased mortality rates from winter cold, environmental degradation as a result of emissions from old power stations, the use of wood for domestic heating that results in deforestation, and the unsustainable use of wetlands and watercourses for hydroelectric power."
"As has also been mentioned in the course of the debate, it is in Europe’s interests to think beyond the South-East European region – an example given here was the Caspian Sea."
"I should like to mention in this connection that the Presidency sent a Troika mission to Kazakhstan to meet representatives of all the Central Asian countries, and also sent a mission to the Southern Caucasus."
"Naturally, the energy issue – both the producer and the transit-country aspects – is particularly important in both of these regions."
"Other points raised here have concerned Nabucco, for example: this is another important project that will benefit the security of Europe’s energy supply."
"Doubts have been expressed, too, and that is reasonable, of course – but I believe that the issue of this Treaty must be seen in conjunction with the overall endeavours of the EU as regards this region of South-East Europe."
"I should like to remind the House that all the countries who are party to this Treaty are involved in the stabilisation and association process, which, of course, also comprises respect for human rights, fundamental rights and other EU provisions."
"Indeed, the purpose of the network of agreements we have made with South-East Europe is to introduce these countries to EU values, too, which naturally includes the values enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That is why I believe that the Energy Community is a unique achievement, a successful project, one that we wish to remain successful."
"I have also sensed that in most of your speeches."
"Furthermore, there is no doubt that Europe must speak with one voice to third countries on energy policy, and that the process of integrating our neighbouring countries into the European single market should be continued."
"As I said in my introductory speech, I wish to make it crystal clear that Parliament naturally has a central, an important role to play in this, and that there can be no question of the Council’s attempting to curtail Parliament’s rights – which we could not do anyway, owing to the interinstitutional structure; on the contrary, we have an active interest in due involvement by, and joint action with, Parliament."
"That is why we shall be involving Parliament in all the important issues regarding the Energy Community: in accordance with the EC Treaty, but also, as I have said, taking a very broad interpretation of its provisions."
"In addition, Parliament will always be fully informed of developments."
". Mr President, I shall try to address some of the issues touched upon during the debate about the new countries that could join the Community in the years to come."
"I really believe that Turkey is close to joining the Community."
"It has been working towards this since the creation of the Community."
"It has not signed up to it, but we shall continue to work with it. It is quite important for Turkey as a candidate country – we have started negotiations with it and it is also a very important transit country – that it could and should sign this Treaty."
"Two countries – Ukraine and Moldova – have also expressed interest in joining."
"The issue of affordability is very important because energy prices should be accessible to the citizens of these countries."
"Article 33 of Chapter IV addresses this issue as far as the Community can address it."
"In the process of creating the Community we have devoted attention to social issues."
"I agree that the social approach in Europe should definitely be directed more closely at countries that aspire to a vision that may one day come much closer to that of the European Union. A memorandum of understanding is a good first step in that direction."
"We have looked carefully at renewables and energy efficiency: Chapter VI addresses this issue."
"On Kyoto, Article 13 in Chapter III – even if it does not say very much – covers this and the provisions on renewables and energy efficiency in the Treaty will definitely help to achieve the Kyoto goals."
"Concerning privatisation, the Community does not impose any type of action in this area: any decision on privatisation will be taken by these countries’ governments."
"Concerning prices, I think these countries are already paying extremely high prices for energy."
"An Energy Community could bring down prices because of the new investments it will bring in."
"It will also help with regard to collecting payments, because there is a lot of money owed."
"There is also diversification: these regions pay some of the highest gas prices to the supplier."
"The supplier in these regions does not worry too much about price affordability."
"This means that the Energy Community could bring much more stability – at least to prices – and could even reduce prices for consumers."
"In addition, an brings public service obligations, which means addressing issues for the more vulnerable people in society."
"Investments from the World Bank – the EIB is also very active in this region – and other investors will come as soon as the Treaty is approved and ratified."
"I think there has been some misunderstanding about foreign policy."
"This Treaty does not address that issue at all."
"The Treaty states that in some cases when energy is bought from third countries, the Energy Community could apply some restrictions if these countries neglect the environment or social issues."
"This provides an opportunity."
"This Treaty in no way restricts the powers of the countries that participate in the Treaty to take independent foreign policy decisions."
"It is very fair to look at these issues, because we cannot afford, if we want to promote sustainability, to buy energy from a third country where environmental standards are neglected and, as a result, the price of energy resources is perhaps cheaper."
"So I think there has been some misunderstanding."
"I really believe that this Treaty serves the interests of the region and of the European Community and I really hope that the countries that participate in this Community will benefit greatly from it."
"To end the debate, one motion for a resolution(1) has been presented, pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"The next item is the report by James Elles, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2007 budget: the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy report (APS) [2006/2020(BUD)] (A6-0154/2006)."
"First on my list of speakers is Mrs Grybauskaitė, on behalf of the Commission, but, as I understand it, she would prefer the rapporteur to begin."
"Are you prepared to begin, Mr Elles?"
". Mr President, normally it is ‘ladies first’, but I am delighted to start the process, otherwise we are going to go round in circles."
"With today’s decision on the shape of the new financial perspective now behind us, we must now look ahead and formulate the broad strategy for implementation in the coming years, whatever its imperfections in terms of balance or level of expenditure allocated."
"From the outset it is noticeable that the annual policy strategy treats the budget year of 2007 as one of a continuing series in the life of the Commission to implement the well-established priorities of prosperity, solidarity, security and Europe as a global partner."
"We take a different view."
"We do not believe that it is business as usual."
"On the contrary, we see the 2007 budget as being a real opportunity to set a new strategic tone to the way in which the European Union delivers its policy agenda."
"When reading the document, there is a strong sense of complacency, Madam Commissioner, a real lack of urgency about how to tackle the global economic political challenges facing the European Union."
"Not least, there is no specific mention of the rapid rise of China and India in the global economy."
"This will undoubtedly affect substantially both internal as well as external policies in the year ahead."
"If, after all, strategies formulated at regional and local level, such as in the Thames Valley, include this factor as an urgent priority, why does the Commission choose to leave it out?"
"In sum, it reads rather like a routine bureaucratic document without serious political leadership or guidance."
"Running through the report are three interlinked strands."
"The first is the combined impact of reduced resources under the new financial perspective, and the emergence of new challenges leaves us no option but to set clear priorities in the next budget."
"These priorities must be focused to reflect the new challenges lying ahead."
"This is more a process during the life of the financial perspectives than simply in the 2007 budget."
"In setting policy priorities for external relations, the 2007 budget must lay the groundwork for an increasingly outward-looking European Union."
"Our citizens’ security and prosperity will depend on how effectively the Union can respond to global challenges in a world very different from that only a decade ago."
"We should aim in fact to lead, rather than harness, the globalisation process."
"In these circumstances it is essential for the Union to develop a coherent, over-arching strategy which will better define its strategic priorities in the 21st century for the world outside, and that must begin with this budget."
"Secondly, interlinked with the first priority, is that of ensuring security for European citizens in areas such as freedom and security and justice, as well as the specific sector of energy supply that we have just been discussing."
"No less important for us is the third priority, dealing with internal policies."
"Here we must focus on those areas that are key to Europe’s competitiveness and our future prosperity."
"These include research and innovation, innovative measures for SMEs, support for lifelong learning for renewing skills and key infrastructure projects."
"In the light of limitations on the Union’s financial resources, we must examine more closely the quality of European Union expenditure."
"The beginning of a new financial perspective offers a significant opportunity for starting a rolling programme for assessing the performance of EU activities."
"Through cost-benefit analyses we will take steps to assess whether specific actions achieve their objectives, what their impact was compared to the quantity of expenditure allocated, and what European added value they contributed."
"We are convinced that such a focus on quality is essential in order to compensate for a lack of quantity in budgetary means."
"This would mean deleting programmes if they no longer produce value for money and creating programmes that are more relevant to a changing global environment."
"It should also mean avoiding the use of public funds, for example in information policy, where EU-financed actions could replace viable, ongoing private initiatives."
"We believe that Parliament must take the initiative to begin preparations for the mid-term review of the next multiannual financial framework planned for 2008."
"This will allow us to drive forward the comprehensive reassessment of the EU’s revenue and expenditure and shake up the system in order to create momentum for adapting our political priorities."
"In conclusion, the 2007 budget procedure, as the first budget of the new financial perspective, represents a real opportunity for a broad mobilisation to adjust to the new policy challenges of a fast-changing world."
"This fits in, Madam Commissioner, with the Commission’s focus on policy by results, but a broader global vision is needed."
"Let us be open to new ideas and provide a strong focus on policy priorities, while improving the EU’s accountability."
"Finally, I will warmly welcome contributions from the outset from all parliamentary committees to establish the sectoral priorities for this budget."
"I believe we have a great opportunity to shape our future policies together and respond effectively to the demands of European citizens."
"Under Rule 142(5) Mr Elles did indeed have the right to speak first, so let me congratulate you, Commissioner, on your accurate knowledge of the Rules of this House."
". Mr President, it is not only a case of knowledge but of respect."
"I wish to thank Mr Elles for a very good start to the process in which we are engaging in the first year of the new financial perspective, after the successful signature and vote today in Parliament."
"Today we are starting a process in which we will be engaged seriously in preparation for the first year of this financial perspective, a symbolically important year."
"In the report on the APS, policy priorities have been set and we think that the core goals and priorities of the Commission’s five-year strategic objectives are reflected in the 2007 budget proposal."
"On prosperity, growth and employment, about 43% of our preliminary draft budget is to be devoted to the Lisbon Strategy through Headings 1a and 1b."
"The Commission is also committed towards close cooperation with the EIB on new financial instruments to increase the leverage effect of the EU budget for Lisbon-related priorities, including trans-European networks and support to SMEs."
"On solidarity, security and freedom, which are important priorities mentioned in the APS, we have already included EUR 291 million for solidarity and management of migration, including the External Borders Fund and the Fund for Integration of Third Country Nationals."
"The Commission proposes a 17% increase for environmental policies, including the extension of the Emissions Trading Scheme to the new Member States."
"On external relations, we agree that Europe, as a world partner, needs to support this area financially."
"The key action for 2007 is the start-up of new programmes, such as the Instrument for Pre-Accession and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"We must also continue to strengthen relations with our partners in the developed world."
"On EU governance and human and financial resources for 2007, I should like to point out that we have already requested 610 new posts in relation to the last enlargement, and 230 to prepare for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"The Commission proposes the redeployment of about 600 staff between its DGs to serve priorities other than enlargement-related needs."
"On value for money, I am fully in favour of a wider, more macroeconomic approach towards the assessment of how European financial resources are used."
"I am satisfied that the new part III of the IIA on sound financial management is, and will be, effectively and fully implemented."
"I have proposed the introduction of an early warning system to ensure more accurate forecasts and close monitoring of budget implementation."
"We will listen very carefully and take into account all your opinions expressed today and in the future."
"We are always ready to cooperate with you and the Council in an open-minded manner, and we hope to have a very good result: a favourable budget by the end of this year."
". Mr President, let me make some remarks from the point of view of development cooperation."
"In my view, the Commission is seeking to amalgamate various budget lines."
"If it succeeds, it will no longer be possible for this Parliament to take decisions on how much is allocated to important sectors such as combating HIV/AIDS."
"Parliament should not allow its powers to be curtailed in this way."
"Secondly, the Commission’s APS document does not refer at all to the Millennium Development Goals or sectors important for poverty reduction, particularly education and poverty diseases."
"What is more, I have to insist that the ‘simplification’ of the legislative context for external action for the period from 2007 to 2013 must not result in a loss of transparency in the use of development policy resources and that the breakdown between budget lines for geographical regions and thematic sectors for the 2007 budget must allow for at least the same level of visibility as the 2006 budget."
"In addition, let me mention the importance of the Commission monitoring the Member States and their official development assistance levels, because of the problem of some Member States overstating ODA levels by taking into account funds that are not actually part of ODA."
"Linked to the ODA level is aid effectiveness and quality."
"The Commission must continue to implement the Paris Agenda on aid effectiveness and show the public that EU development aid makes a difference."
"Finally, I want to underline the need always to put the fight against poverty at the top of the EU agenda and, therefore, the need to strive for a substantial share of aid to go to the LDCs."
". Mr President, the global challenges facing the European Union have never been greater, yet we will have to face these challenges with limited resources."
"It is therefore vital, as the Commission rightly says, that these resources are clearly targeted at our priorities."
"The Committee on International Trade fully supports the Commission’s efforts to improve policy coherence between the Community’s external and internal policies."
"In our opinion, all new policy initiatives regarding the internal market should be carefully assessed in the light of their external impact."
"The International Trade Committee supports the rapporteur in calling for the Commission to target resources at the new global challenges we face, particularly the rise of India and China."
"It wishes to emphasise the contribution that a successful Doha Round could make to freeing up resources."
"Firstly, the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidy by 2013 would bring significant budgetary savings."
"Secondly, a successful round would lead to growth of the European Union economy as a whole and therefore help the EU budget grow."
"A key component in making a success of the Doha Round is to persuade the developing countries to sign up for Doha."
"In this respect, the EU has recognised that for them to get something out of Doha, they need to be linked into the world trading system."
"At the G8 Summit last July, President Barroso promised EUR 1 billion a year in trade-related assistance."
"If this is not delivered, the cynicism displayed by the developing countries at WTO talks will simply grow."
"The International Trade Committee believes that this cannot just be a cosmetic re-labelling of existing aid."
"It has to be genuinely new money."
"We would like to suggest both to the rapporteur, in terms of the conclusions the committee draws from this report, and to the Commission, that the latter should report to us annually on how it is spending the EUR 1 billion that Mr Barroso promised on trade-related assistance, so that we can see that being delivered on a transparent basis."
". Mr President, at noon today we finished the preparations for the new financial perspective, while this evening we return to the routine of annual budgets."
"However, the experience of this parliamentary term tells us that while procedures may be repeated, there is no such thing as a budget that may be repeated in its entirety, so there is no budgetary routine, as each of the budgets we have had up until now has had its specific characteristics."
"2005 was the first year in an enlarged Europe, the 2006 budget was a bridge between the old and the new financial perspective, while 2007 and the 2007 budget will be the launch of a new generation of multiannual programmes, and that is the real characteristic of the 2007 budget."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Elles, presented the priorities and gained the support of the majority of the Committee on Budgets for these priorities."
"Knowing his powers of persuasion, he will obtain a parliamentary majority."
"However, the real context for the debate on budget strategy for 2007 is no longer the Commission guidelines on strategy, but the figures presented for 2007 by the Commission, as they are clearly influenced by this new generation of programmes – as can very easily be seen in chapter 1a, in chapter 3a and in the chapter on foreign policy."
"I also believe that an effective launch for the new generation of multiannual programmes is one of the basic ways of measuring the success of the 2007 budget, while respecting the priorities presented to us by Mr Elles."
"If we can launch the programmes well, we can return to the annual routine, which will once again turn out to be not so routine after all."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as President Lewandowski said, we have been aware since this morning of the definitive framework for the European budgets for the next seven years."
"Since this morning, we have, then, been aware of Parliament’s need to remain modest, and even humble, with regard to the proposals it may allow itself to put forward."
"Even if this framework is in itself new, there will also, I hope, be another new feature, namely that this will be a budget for 27 Member States."
"As coordinator for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am keen to champion respect for the commitments we have made to Europeans."
"With regard to our priorities, these will remain, in the first place, the internal policies that are to support the Lisbon Objectives, not forgetting the environment and rural development. Only in this way will a balanced approach to territorial planning be guaranteed."
"The promotion of sustainable growth and job creation in the EU implies not only that the Member States will properly implement legislation, both that in force and that proposed, but also that we will propose more ambitious objectives in these areas."
"2007 will also have to be the year in which our policy for communicating with our citizens is overhauled."
"In the same way, I would urge a balanced approach to administering the EU’s external borders, as we cannot be content with a unilateral, security-based approach."
"Policies linked to immigration must be counterbalanced by the integration of third-country nationals and by solidarity in administering borders."
"Let us not forget that security is also about protecting individual freedoms."
"We therefore need to develop policies in favour of refugees."
"Where external policy is concerned, our watchwords are not only development, democratisation and human rights but also respect for the Millennium Goals, which constitute an absolute priority."
"The EU must provide itself with the appropriate tools to enable it to make its presence felt on the international stage."
"Finally, I would take the liberty of coming out in favour of co-funding by the European Investment Bank of programmes crucial to giving practical expression to the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies."
"These would be constructive arrangements."
"I wish, however, to point out the need to guarantee public funding on a scale large enough to create the leverage conditions expected by the EIB."
"Loan guarantees and other such measures are in no position to replace the new money that only the EU can guarantee."
"I should like to tell you, Commissioner, that I read with great interest that the Commission was banking on an acceleration of European growth in 2006."
"This means high growth, since a 2.6% increase is anticipated."
"Your communiqués state that Europe would be in a position to create 3.6 million jobs."
"Apart from the fact that these forecasts remain less than completely reliable, particularly in view of the fluctuation that is a predominant feature of the oil markets, do you think that this growth is sufficient to provide Europe with the financial resources necessary to its development?"
"To conclude, I wish Mr Elles good luck."
"He must, in turn, try to inject some ambition into this budget. I think, however, that, with such a rigid and narrow budgetary framework, it will be difficult for him to find the resources for the ambitious policy expected by Europeans."
". Mr President, first I want to thank the rappporteur, Mr Elles, for a very constructive report concerning the Commission’s annual policy strategy."
"It clearly sets out those priorities that Parliament has identified and advocated in the negotiations on the financial framework."
"My group wishes to stress in particular the importance of unhindered traffic in the workings of the internal market, and for that reason it has tabled two amendments."
"The EU’s greatest challenge is reducing unemployment."
"That is why programmes which promote growth and employment are very important."
"These are, in particular, the Seventh Framework Programme, which concerns research and development, and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"They should be quickly brought to completion."
"Structural and cohesion policy will be among the major challenges facing the EU in the forthcoming programming period."
"Considerable sums have been set aside for these in the financial framework, especially for the new Member States."
"It is important that these funds are used."
"That is why the programmes must be made ready quickly and efficiently."
"Ideally, they should be adopted some time this year, but in any case no later than next year, otherwise the funds that have been granted will remain unspent, as they were in the first few years of the Agenda 2000 programming period. That delayed the implementation of projects and at the same time caused a considerable backlog of outstanding commitments, which has still not been cleared."
"Parliament needs to prepare for the mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework and the agricultural reform in good time."
"In this connection, the subject of compulsory cofinancing of direct agricultural aid must be clearly raised."
"That would reduce the EU’s budgetary expenditure, even out the differences in the Member States’ net contributions, increase Member States’ responsibility for spending funds and do more to safeguard the livelihood of farmers within the context of the current ceiling for expenditure."
"Our group supports this."
"With these observations we are prepared to give the report our support."
". Mr President, our rapporteur has done a very careful and very thorough job."
"It is no criticism of him to say that the value of the exercise to which we are devoting ourselves this evening is, however, fairly limited, indeed very limited, particularly by the outcome of the vote taken by our Parliament this morning."
"Since Parliament had stated that the amount of the financial perspective had to be increased considerably and since its idea was to obtain a three-figure extension, I, for my part, was hoping for at least a two-figure extension."
"Instead, we voted this morning in favour of a small, one-figure, extension: EUR 2 billion plus EUR 2 billion."
"All future policy initiatives will therefore see their margins for manoeuvre severely limited, to the point of being almost non-existent."
"Thus, our rapporteur states, in his first paragraph, that the 2007-2013 financial perspective is backward-looking and therefore poorly placed to respond effectively to the challenges concerned."
"He also points out, in paragraph 2, that the Annual Policy Strategy does not reflect the urgency with which such challenges should be addressed."
"I rest my case."
"In these circumstances, my group is obviously trying to define a few priorities."
"The first, which is along the lines of the rapporteur’s own thinking, is about achieving maximum impact."
"When you do not have much money, you have to make good use of such money as you do have."
"Some serious studies therefore need to be carried out on the cost-efficiency ratio, particularly in relation to the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies."
"There is a tendency to forget that these strategies are not only about competitiveness but also about the social and employment dimensions."
"In the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is a good thing to invest in sustainable development."
"The second priority concerns the rendezvous clause."
"Mrs Grybauskaitė, we believe - or, rather, we still try to believe - in the rendezvous clause, which we also voted in favour of this morning."
"Thanks to this clause, we shall be able perhaps finally to show new margins, particularly where agriculture is concerned."
"All the same, I am sorry that our friends from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have decided to delete the passage on aid that might be given to agriculture, possibly at national level."
"This morning, we left a few doors open with the help of the rendezvous clause."
"This evening, we see that these doors are very narrow, in spite of the high-quality work done by our fellow Member."
"Please, let us leave them as they are."
". Mr President, Commissioner, our group has demonstrated its dissatisfaction with the financial frameworks for the period 2007-2013 by voting against the adoption of Mr Böge’s report on today’s plenary."
"The main reason was that the low level of appropriations did not reflect the needs that our group saw as vital to developing positive European programmes."
"The new financial frameworks are thought to be backward-looking in Mr Elles’ report too."
"We want to see more cohesion, more science and research, more concern for the environment, and more social welfare."
"Our group, however, does not feel any need to militarise the EU’s Foreign and Security Policy."
"Militarisation was one of the Council’s main areas of focus in the new financial frameworks and the Council also secured financing for it in the new Interinstitutional Agreement with Parliament."
"Although the EU Constitutional Treaty was rejected, the Commission and the Council may start to develop a common foreign affairs administration for the Union."
"That would mean an increase in the powers of the Union at the expense of the Member States."
"Sovereignty in foreign policy is one of the main hallmarks of an independent state."
"Regarding the Lisbon Objectives, our group has condemned their limited scope regarding social welfare."
"They only address the needs of companies, and not the needs of their employees."
"The Commission’s proposal for a special Globalisation Fund is a disappointment, in that a condition of Community aid is mass lay-offs, where at least 1 000 workers lose their jobs."
"Neither does our group support the Commission’s approach known as the information policy."
"The Union’s institutions are using money for the dissemination of information for propaganda, instead of looking in the mirror and trying to find out what the problem is when the public criticises the Union. There will be nothing wrong with the mirror, either."
"We must set about preparing to draft and implement the multiannual programmes fast; otherwise the year 2007 will see a dramatic underutilisation of many appropriations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on Budgets provides an elegant overview of its subject, highlights a large number of important issues for developing countries, discusses the importance of being economical with EU funds and stresses the importance of strict prioritisation."
"Is anyone against any of this?"
"No."
"Yet the problem with the report is this – it fails to take a view on the question of at what level these important questions ought to be dealt with."
"Should this be at EU level or at national level?"
"It fails to take a view on how the regulatory system should be changed in order to push forward this improved economy and it fails to take a view on what it is that is to be done away with or cut back in order to make it possible to prioritise other things."
"Let me put forward some suggestions."
"A very large part of what is proposed for the stimulation of growth in order to meet the requirements of globalisation in terms of adaptation and the like consists of matters that are best tackled by the Member States themselves, in worthy competition with each other to find solutions that work."
"This applies to almost the entire Lisbon Agenda, the small businesses policy and research activity."
"It is difficult to come up with any reasons to regulate these matters at EU level."
"Things that do constitute important tasks to be performed at EU level are, for example, regulating the trading of emissions rights for carbon dioxide."
"The EU leads the world in this area, and it would be a disaster if this system, into which Russia and Japan are due to enter in a couple of years’ time, were to collapse over time."
"The trading of emissions rights must now be restructured."
"One important step could be for the governments of the Member States to be able to sell emissions right to companies at auction."
"What is more, emissions rights must be extended to cover greater areas of the economy and more and more countries."
"This is an essential task for the European Union, and one of a global character."
"We speak all the time of the principle of subsidiarity, but when things get serious this principle is nowhere to be seen."
"According to the report, nearly every problem is something for the EU to get to grips with."
"Regulatory systems in need of amendment are, amongst others, those relating to agricultural policy."
"In this area we need to steer development in the direction of renationalising the costs of gradually creating political opportunities to carry out a liberalisation of the whole system."
"Finally, we must discuss in detail what needs to be done away with or cut back so that other things may be prioritised."
"We must earnestly begin to analyse and discuss which of the EU institutions should be abolished."
"We should, for example, put an end to the European Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions."
"These two institutions have outlived their purpose."
"We must at last reach the point where we make Brussels the seat of the European Parliament and allow the building in which we now find ourselves to become the seat of an EU University, for example."
"This would be extremely advantageous not only for Parliament but also for the city of Strasbourg."
"It would mean that the city’s service providers – hotels, restaurants, taxis and the like – could be steadily busy over time and through the year rather than being overloaded for a few days a month and facing underoccupancy the rest of the time."
". It has been said that if you cannot change matters on the basis of principle, then at least take a principled attitude towards them."
"It appears that many principled approaches were taken in the approval process for the 2007 budget proposal."
"On 3 May the European Commission adopted a provisional Budget for 2007. In doing so it took the first step towards establishing a budget for the first year of a seven-year period, but I hope that it will not be as painful each time over the years 2007 to 2013."
"If the Commissioner regards the proposed budget as a minimalist budget, I will have to agree with her."
"On the other hand, it is hard to see that this budget will make a fundamental contribution to supporting European competitiveness."
"It is rather a conventional budget."
"It is true, however, that the compromise we have achieved on the budgetary ceiling for the 2007-2013 financial framework will not leave the Commission much room for manoeuvre."
"This can be seen by the data on the overall increase in payments compared with 2006."
"The overall 3.9% growth in payments actually seems quite moderate."
"If we take into account anticipated inflation of 2% in 2007, this leaves a mere 1.9% more in the real funding for the needs of European policy in that year. And this at a time when 30 million Bulgarians and Romanians will be joining the European Union in January 2007."
"There have been changes in the structure of the budget that I regard as positive."
"Expenditure on natural resources and agriculture will only increase by 1.2%, while funds earmarked for competitiveness and the cohesion policy for growth and employment will grow by more than 12%."
"However, the effective use of this funding will be a key issue."
"Knowledge transfer within the economy should be supported with further cash earmarked for programmes on competitiveness and innovation, the development of trans-European networks and lifelong learning."
"A new element is the globalisation fund of EUR 500 million to help workers made redundant as a result of industrial restructuring."
"However, the effective use of this funding will again be an issue."
"We can continue to debate questions to do with adding a little bit here and taking away a little bit there."
"With its proposal the Commission has set a fairly strict, but not unrealistic level."
"It will be difficult for the European Council to lower this budgetary hurdle, and for the European Parliament to raise it."
"The budgetary compromise for 2007 should therefore remain very close to these levels."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that the first thing we should talk about is the actual function of this debate on annual strategic priorities, since in principle the intention was to establish a proper communication with the European Commission in terms of setting its budgetary priorities."
"Nevertheless, once again we have the preliminary draft budget a few days before Mr Jensen presents his report on the annual strategic priorities in plenary."
"In any event, we are getting quicker and possibly, before this term in office comes to an end, we will manage to hold this debate on the annual strategic priorities at the same time that the Commission is drawing up its preliminary draft budget."
"Furthermore, I would like to say that we fully support the rapporteur, Mr Elles, both now and during the complicated times ahead when we really have to squeeze the financial perspective that we have approved as far as possible – this very backward looking financial perspective, as the rapporteur himself has said, and I agree with him – because much remains to be seen."
"The Council must demonstrate that it believes in its own commitments: firstly, it should be attending this debate – though I see that it has not had time to remain; secondly, the Commission must be capable of convincing a very wary Parliament that it is going to be able to maintain an acceptable level of spending in order to maintain and fund the Community’s programmes; and thirdly, it is also going to be necessary for Parliament to be very vigilant in terms of the quality of spending and the Council’s attitude to the size of the budget."
"Let us hope that this budget, in relation to which the rapporteur proposes some very interesting things and which is the first of the seven budgets of this financial perspective, is modified and that some progress can be made on issues of budgetary procedure, for example, at the first conciliation and, in particular, Mr President, on the prioritisation of Community programmes by parliamentary committees."
"There are fewer resources and each committee is therefore going to have to face its own responsibilities."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Elles for the Annual Policy Strategy report."
"I would like to highlight three areas."
"Speaking as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, firstly, I would like to say that I support the rapporteur in urging the Commission and Member States to focus on areas that are the bases of healthy and thriving modern economies: research and development, innovation, knowledge, skills, telecommunications and energy."
"Effective investment in those areas pays excellent dividends in the long run."
"The EU cannot be short-sighted and still compete globally and reverse the brain-drain leading to slower economic growth than might otherwise be the case."
"Secondly, I also back the rapporteur when he calls for Member States to implement existing and proposed legislation to help complete the single market."
"The Lisbon Strategy has not been sufficiently prioritised, despite the fact that it seeks improvement in areas where citizens want progress, like creating growth in jobs."
"As President Barroso told this House in his first address in July 2004, we must show our citizens that Europe can deliver what it promises."
"Thirdly, speaking as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I have to say that I disagree with the emphasis the rapporteur has placed on our strategic partnership with the United States."
"I believe the EU must build solid and constructive relations with all global players to an equal extent, especially since a very disappointing cut in funding in Heading 4 has been proposed by the Commissioner in the PDB."
"That means that our traditional priorities and commitments are being reduced."
"As well as that, there will be no extra money for new agreements that we have entered into, including an increasingly important strategic partnership with India."
"Since resources are scarce, I ask the Commission to make sure that no money is wasted."
"So can the Commission guarantee that the appropriate measures and mechanisms are being put in place, as Mr Virrankoski highlighted, to ensure effective implementation and full take-up?"
"We do not want to return millions of euros to the Member States at the end of the year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Elles, for his visionary proposal regarding the work on the 2007 budget."
"It is visionary because he thinks several years ahead, because importance is attached to complying with the new framework for external policy and because focus is placed on that part of the budget designed to secure economic growth and strengthen the EU’s global competitiveness."
"I would particularly draw attention to the new cost-benefit thinking in the budget whereby, year by year, we are to assess the value of the individual programmes in relation to their costs."
"The information we gather in that way will, of course, form part of an evaluation and mid-term review of the multi-annual budgetary framework for 2008-2009."
"Now is the time for us to prepare the ground for reconfiguring the budgetary framework so that its focus is on new needs and no longer on things that do not work properly."
"Efficiency and a certain ‘quid pro quo’ must be the watchwords for the EU budget."
"All of this work must take place in close cooperation with the specialist committees."
"We shall thus be further developing the ever closer cooperation of recent years with the specialist committees in developing the annual budget."
"In the foreign policy area we must now comply with the new sets of rules whereby Parliament is involved in developing strategic frameworks and thus obtains a basis for monitoring the policy conducted."
"We shall thus be able to see whether we are achieving the goals laid down by means of the budget."
"The method of working to be used in this connection must, of course, be developed, and it is important that the work get off to a good start."
"The new budgetary framework means that there will be respectable growth in that part of the budget that goes on research, innovation, education and transport."
"I should like, however, to emphasise that the appropriations for investment in transport are not at all in keeping with the Member States’ own ambitions for the trans-European networks."
"The Commission has pulled out all the stops to ensure far better implementation of the projects, and now the Council must show that it intends to comply with its own decisions."
"It is the Member States that are responsible for coming up with the funding if they do not wish to pay via the budget."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have considerable risks to contend with for the 2007 financial year: in terms of both the figures and the procedures for implementing the multi-annual programmes based on the Financial Regulation."
"The new programmes have a potential that can only be properly harnessed by improving procedures."
"It is important to everyone concerned, particularly programme users, that the legislative process relating to the Financial Regulation, its implementing regulation and the multi-annual programmes now be concluded as quickly as possible, to enable prompt handling by the Commissioner’s staff."
"We are eagerly awaiting the transmission of the revised Commission proposal on the reform of the Financial Regulation."
"When our draft was adopted, the Commission promised to incorporate a large number of our amendments."
"At that time, in a roll-call vote resulting in a majority hardly ever achieved in this House, Parliament placed particular emphasis on important points."
"Faster, leaner, more efficient – those were the points we made with regard to the procedures, to enable profitable, value-added investment of European funds."
"It is also particularly important to us that Parliament’s rights be guaranteed."
"We shall examine the revised Commission draft, which is on our agenda for tomorrow, accordingly; but in order to carry out a thorough analysis we need to see the full picture – not just the outline, but also the shading."
"Parliament needs to know what points the Commission and the Council want to see incorporated into the implementing regulations if we are to see the extent to which our opinion has been implemented – in both documents, that is."
"I should like to assure the Commissioner that the best efforts from all our quarters will go into ensuring that the proposal is adopted promptly in this House."
"I would ask the Commission to now present the complete works, comprising Financial Regulation and implementing regulation, as quickly as possible, to enable us to start the new programmes with the new procedures in time for the new programming period."
"I would also appeal to the Council to maintain its constructive cooperation, so that Europe, and its citizens, Member States and institutions, are able to achieve better and, above all, cheaper administration."
"– Commissioner, Mr Elles, I too should like to congratulate you on your excellent proposal."
"I was especially pleased to see reference made to transatlantic relations, a major priority that is often overlooked but that was happily highlighted by our rapporteur."
"I feel, in any event, that the major issue here is that the proposal before us falls short of what was put forward last year and of the limit imposed on us by the financial perspective."
"I believe that in the new framework about to get under way, we must not, under any circumstances, allow the practices of the past, whereby we did not use all of the financial framework, to prevail today."
"I feel it is crucial that, given a financial framework that we all know is extremely limited in terms of European ambitions, we have to be able to use it to the full. In this regard, I feel that the Commission has a key role to play, and should like to call on the Commission not to go back to submitting projects that fall short of the ceilings of the financial frameworks."
"Mr President, for me, the most important piece of news this evening is that Barça have won."
"Congratulations!"
"Mr President, as a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the 2007 budget, I should like, at the very outset, to say how delighted I am to see that the dimension of security, both internal and external, for the European Union features prominently among the limited number of political priorities retained by our general rapporteur, Mr Elles, for the 2007 budget."
"Indeed, no one can deny that the prevention of, and fight against, terrorism, together with improvements to the way in which external borders are administered and the closing of illegal immigration channels are real and serious issues of critical importance, requiring appropriate policies and adequate resources."
"Nor can anyone deny that these are areas in which integrated action at European level indisputably adds value to the efforts of Member States otherwise acting in isolation."
"Nor, finally, can anyone deny that these are problems that, quite legitimately, are of very great concern to EU citizens, as shown by all the polls and surveys. Moreover, Europeans find it not only natural but also necessary for these problems to be dealt with at European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens, there is probably a need for far fewer woolly discussions and brochures containing propaganda and a need, instead, for many more policies and measures that respond effectively to the problems actually experienced by people and felt by them to be important and matters of priority."
"Internal security is one of these areas."
"The 2007 budget will give us the opportunity to make a start on no longer disappointing people."
"Thank you very much for your words and your congratulations, Mr Deprez, but you should also offer your condolences to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, the new financial framework has only just been finalised today, and we are already faced with is deficiencies."
"The Commission could not solve the impossible, and within this framework, the European Union will not be able to achieve a breakthrough in the areas of competitiveness, research or innovation, which had actually been marked as priorities by the Council and the Commission themselves."
"The annual political strategy of the Commission does not promote an economic reform able to meet challenges."
"It seems that the competition imposed on the world and Europe by the emerging Asian economies is ignored."
"Acting together, Member States may be able to meet these global challenges, but if they are on their own, it is certain that they will lose out in the expected processes."
"The 2007 budget will cause disappointment, because it should be strategic, but it is, in fact, straining within its narrow limits."
"According to the indications, this budget will primarily please new Member States."
"The three-year waiting period is over, and they will, at last, share development resources to the same extent as the others."
"They can now start to develop vigorously if they outgrow their childhood illnesses and do not get stuck at the current 20-30% resource utilisation level."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Elles, our rapporteur, for his critical and prudent work."
"I hope that the position of Parliament will still be able to influence the final form of the budget."
"Mr President, 2007 will undoubtedly be a very challenging year for Europe and its citizens."
"The enlargement of the Union by another two countries, the ongoing process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty and, most of all, the start of implementation of the new financial perspective must be supported by effective implementation of European Union policies in such a way as to meet global challenges and the expectations of our citizens."
"Setting out priorities for the coming year is, in view of all this, strategically important for each of the seven years covered by the new financial perspective."
"That is why it is surprising and worrying that there are already visible discrepancies between the global challenges which the Community faces and the measures that are supposed to ensure an increase in the competitiveness of its economy."
"Furthermore, when identifying the challenges, the European Commission seems to have failed to notice the dynamic changes occurring in the global economy, especially in the fastest developing markets such as the Chinese or Indian markets."
"In terms of internal policy, and according to the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission should, at a Community level as well as at a national level, unequivocally support elements of a modern economy such as scientific research, innovation and information society technologies."
"In the face of increasingly fierce global competition it is also vital to formulate a strategy that enables employers and workers to adapt to the changes taking place."
"In this respect the Globalisation Fund being discussed today may be a first step in the right direction, and the EU budget revision scheduled for 2008 will be a real instrument for adapting multiannual financial plans to a rapidly developing world."
"It is the only way of maintaining a strong political and economic position and of overcoming the internal crisis the European Union is currently experiencing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Elles for his work."
"The Annual Policy Strategy for the 2007 budget will be decisive in shaping the further positive development of Europe."
"The support for the two internal policies – the Lisbon objectives and rural policy – seems to me to be particularly worth mentioning in this connection."
"In view of demographic developments and globalisation, it makes perfect sense to pay greater attention to our reformed agricultural policy and our rural policy."
"In this case, in particular, the Lisbon objectives can and must be used to solve current problems such as unemployment and economic stagnation."
"The common agricultural policy, the EU’s only communitarised policy, has been constantly subjected to reform in recent decades compared with other policy fields."
"Agricultural policy-makers and farmers have repeatedly proved their willingness to make sacrifices and accept change for the sake of a European community."
"Players in European agriculture have demonstrated that they are amenable to reform."
"It is now time to honour this."
"Sustainable agriculture, our European model, needs planning security, and establishing the budget until 2013 – that is to say, for the next seven years – has given it just that."
"It must also be beyond doubt, however, that, as decided in the course of CAP reform, the budgetary resources will apply until 2013 without cutbacks."
"We have carried through the reforms, and now we farmers have reached our pain threshold."
"This is as far as we will go."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as we begin preparing the 2007 budget, I share the concern, expressed by Mr Elles in his report, about the gulf between, on the one hand, the ambitions that the European Union has set itself for the future and, on the other, the budgetary regime to which it has, this very morning, resigned itself for the next seven years."
"Nonetheless, the indications are that, in 2007, the budgetary estimates should enable us to continue with our current policies, while at the same time launching the new generation of European programmes, relating in particular to regional policy."
"The fact is that, alongside the new financial perspective, new programmes aimed at regional development will be implemented, and we are gradually going to have to familiarise ourselves with these."
"We go on repeating that cohesion policy is essential to Europe’s overall dynamism."
"It must enable the regions, diverse as they are, to complete their transformation and to prepare for the future in the best conditions and, in that way, to achieve an optimum level of development."
"What is more, Europe’s regions occupy a central place in the Lisbon Strategy, and the new structural policy will always have to be in a position to strengthen economic and social cohesion and to reduce the gap between the levels of development of, on the one hand, the new Member States and, on the other, the old ones."
"It is in order to achieve these objectives that it must be provided with the appropriate financial resources."
"It is therefore important, as emphasised by Mr Elles in his report, to make sure throughout the budgetary procedure that the funds appropriated to this policy are commensurate with the challenges to be met."
"In preparing the draft budget for 2007, we shall therefore make sure that these priorities are respected and that adequate resources are allocated to them."
"– Mr President, we wish to initiate the financing of new priorities."
"However, the amount of the preliminary draft budget, with payment appropriations which do not exceed 0.99%, unfortunately reflects the glaring inconsistency between the challenges in the sector of research, innovation and competitiveness and the narrow margins allowed by the budget."
"Nonetheless, development and employment must be our main objective, the main contribution to the achievement of which must be the Lisbon Strategy, with policies which need to act complementarily and be adapted to the new dynamic environment which is the consequence of globalisation and interdependent economies."
"I agree with the Elles proposals on ensuring the qualitative value of every last euro, especially in view of the new nature of the challenges, which we have met so far calmly and without vision."
"I refer to the challenge of emerging economic behemoths, especially China and India."
"However, the relaxed and 'flabby' stand being adopted by the Commission in the preliminary draft exacerbates our concerns about the reduction in the level of interventions."
"The restrictive framework illustrates our inability to combine objectives and financing possibilities."
"Unfortunately, Commissioner, 0.99% in payments for 2007 raises once again the tragedy of narrow margins for the realisation of our European vision."
"I wonder if the next Presidency will, at long last, have the power to surmount and join us in our efforts to overcome this perpetual European financial Calvary."
"I hope so, but I also doubt it."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate you on the fact that your country won the European Cup this evening, although, since Barcelona has a Dutch trainer, perhaps some of this credit could also go to my own."
"I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report, because it is a hard-hitting document that gets its priorities right."
"What is more important, though – and I am, this evening, primarily speaking as shadow rapporteur for the agricultural budget on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – is that this report is like a warm bath for European farmers and horticulturalists compared to what the British Labour Government gave them during its presidency."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Elles on this."
"As for agriculture and horticulture, it is all hands on deck, for the Council’s easy way-out, allowing countries to transfer, on a voluntary basis, 20% of the premiums to rural development, could well prove to be a stab in the back for hard-working farmers and horticulturalists."
"Not that I am opposed to rural policy, but given the voluntary nature of this proposal, there is the real risk that farmers from the different Member States will be faced with a playing field that is anything but level, which will have an effect on the single market."
"Similarly, the possible voluntary transfer of 20% of the premiums will probably, due to the financial emergency brake applied during the interim review, represent yet another attack."
"After all, pledges to candidate countries Romania and Bulgaria may eventually result in yet another 15% in reductions for agriculture and horticulture in the old Member States."
"In that way, Europe is at risk of losing control over the common agricultural policy, for a 35% reduction in the level of premiums will consign the common market firmly to the history books."
"As guardians of the common market, Parliament and the Commission will need to pull out all the stops in order to avoid this."
"Moreover, I am also shocked at former Commissioner Bolkestein’s remarks, because as Commissioner for the Internal Market, he recently rejected once again the Prodi Commission’s agricultural reforms and their funding, which he had originally approved, adding that agricultural policy should be abolished."
"I urge the present Commissioner for the Budget to be wary of the common market and to prevent European agricultural funds and European agricultural policy from being eroded still further, for let us be honest: Europe’s export refunds have been pared down by 80%, 60% of agricultural export to developing countries is already being channelled to the EU, and we have an agreement with the world’s 48 poorest countries."
"I do not know another continent that has done more for liberalisation of agricultural policy than Europe, and we have done quite enough."
"That concludes this item."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"The next item is the report by Constanze Angela Krehl, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on preparing for the assent procedure for the Community’s strategic guidelines for the period 2007-2013 (Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs) [2006/2086(INI)] (A6-0175/2006)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with its adoption of the Financial Perspective today, the European Parliament has taken an important step towards enabling the structural programmes to begin in the regions of the EU as early as possible, in 2007."
"We shall take a further important step tomorrow by adopting our proposals on the strategic guidelines for cohesion policy."
"I should also like to take today’s opportunity to make it clear once more that Parliament accelerated the procedure tremendously by dealing with these guidelines in parallel with the negotiations on the Financial Perspective and the regulations on the funds, and I should like to thank all my fellow Members who are present for this debate, too."
"I apologise for the late hour, but it was the only chance of adopting this report before the end of the May session."
"Doing it any other way would have meant further delays to the overall handling of cohesion policy."
"The Commission’s proposal is comprehensive."
"Nevertheless, I have some important proposals to supplement and strengthen the policy approaches."
"These are based on the fact that EU enlargement in 2004 has exacerbated the disparities between the regions and on the fact that we have to use the scant resources available in a strategically intelligent and efficient manner."
"That is why we must also make more intensive use of the opportunities for private cofinancing in the coming years."
"What do I wish to emphasise in particular in my speech today?"
"Firstly, in my view, we must make it clear that cohesion policy should naturally support the Lisbon Strategy, but we must not forget sustainable development of the EU in accordance with the Gothenburg objectives in the process."
"Secondly, as we know, 80% of the European population lives in cities or urban areas, which means that we have to place greater emphasis on this dimension of our strategy."
"Thirdly, we must enhance the element of territorial cohesion in our planning: a demand also rightly made by the Committee of the Regions."
"Within the Commission’s three guidelines – making Europe and its regions more attractive for investors and labour, promoting knowledge and innovation for growth, and more and better jobs – we support the development of a durable transport infrastructure, including in border areas."
"In this connection, we attach particular importance to the implementation of environmental priorities such as Natura 2000, the Water Framework Directive and the sustainable prevention of natural disasters."
"We should like to draw attention to the particular prospects offered by the use of renewable energy and, with it, the development of new technologies in this field."
"The development of research infrastructures and the utilisation of the research results for SMEs is an important concern in our strategy, as is access to modern information and communication networks."
"All of these points are related to the development of an economy that creates more and, particularly, better jobs in the EU."
"However, another very important prerequisite for jobs is that people living in the EU be as highly qualified as possible."
"In this connection, the lifelong learning strategy is central to our report, and we support programme approaches for children and young people and for the training of workers, and the access of the elderly, too, to education."
"I should like to make it clear that discrimination-free access to the EU cohesion policy must be guaranteed for the future in respect of all the priorities set out in the report, including, but not limited to, persons with disabilities."
"We want to be able to further use and develop the positive experiences gained with the old Community initiative EQUAL in the next subsidy period."
"Social partners, and also organisations, associations and regional players, must be involved much more actively in drawing up the programme at regional level."
"Discussions with the Commission have revealed that a large number of our proposals can be incorporated into the Commission’s final proposal."
"This will enable us to take new strategic approaches to the work of the next seven years, which I warmly welcome."
"I should like to thank my fellow Members from the political groups for their broad support, and it only remains for me to call on the Council to adopt the whole package on cohesion policy as soon as possible."
"This way, we hope to reaffirm and reinforce the confidence of the European public in the solidarity of European policy."
". Mr President, I very much welcome the draft report adopted by the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development on the Commission communication on Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs: Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-2013."
"In particular, I should like thank Mrs Krehl for her hard work in drafting the report."
"The draft Community strategic guidelines for cohesion reflect the two key principles of the European Union’s future cohesion policy."
"These are the strengthening of the strategic dimension of regional and cohesion policy to ensure that Community priorities are better integrated into national and regional development programmes, and ensuring that there is greater ownership of the policy on the ground with a better partnership between the Commission, the Member States and the regions, including social partners."
"With the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, cohesion policy has become the primary financial instrument at Community level to ensure that its resources are used for the implementation of the growth and jobs strategy."
"This is reflected in the priorities contained in the draft Community strategic guidelines for 2007-2013, which seek to provide a balance between the twin objectives of the growth and jobs agenda and territorial cohesion."
"In line with the growth and jobs agenda, the guidelines call for the next generation of programmes to target resources on the following three priority fields."
"Firstly: enhancing the attractiveness of Member States, regions and cities by improving accessibility, ensuring adequate quality and level of services, and preserving their environmental potential."
"Secondly: encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of the knowledge economy through research and innovation capacities, including new information and communication technologies."
"Thirdly: creating more and better jobs by attracting more people into employment or entrepreneurial activity, improving the adaptability of workers and enterprises and increasing investment in human capital."
"In sum, the guidelines provide a variety of priorities, with sufficient flexibility, which can be taken into account when designing investment strategies that differ across Europe’s regions."
"On the other hand, the guidelines also focus on a limited number of priorities to ensure that a genuine concentration of resources takes place in order to increase the effectiveness of investment and to make the growth and jobs strategy a reality."
"To conclude, the Council has come to a political agreement on the Structural Funds regulations for 2007-2013."
"For the Commission, the next step is to draft the final version of the Community strategic guidelines for the Council to adopt."
"The draft report adopted by the Committee on Regional Development will help to shape the final version of the guidelines, along with the comments submitted by the Member States and the results of a public consultation exercise held last year."
"Mr President, as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport, I was surprised to hear that this topic has been included in the agenda."
"Perhaps the hectic and accelerated events and the debate on financial directives and funds have also contributed to the fact that we have not been informed earlier of the compromises arrived at by the Committee on Regional Development with regard to the excellent report of Mrs Krehl, compromises that will be submitted to vote in this House tomorrow."
"I am the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport, which gives high priority to the cohesion of the extremely heterogenous European Union, and to the infrastructural and tourism developments, which constitute the instruments for achieving cohesion."
"We admit that, due to the relatively strained Community resources, each investment must represent European added value, and must induce additional economic growth."
"We are giving priority to road and primarily cross-border railway developments, because this is where business inertia and reticence are at their highest levels."
"Apart from railways, we would also like to give priority to the development of inland navigation, because these are instruments that protect the environment and increase competitiveness at the same time."
"We must give peripheral areas high priority, because the provision of access to such areas cannot be solved with a market-based approach, and regional development is a precondition of their competitiveness and of ensuring that the population does not move away; within the provision of access, we must also create bypasses and interconnecting roads."
"When we are financing TEN-T, we must understand that we cannot only accept TEN-T centres in old Member States, and the cohesion fund cannot solve every problem, for instance those in the Baltic States."
"Additionally, we, the Committee on Transport, have supported the development of complex urban transport systems, the integrated development of suburbs, and Community assistance for this type of rolling stock."
"There is also a demand for the development of tourist areas, because this is what keeps people there, and we must keep tourism-generated revenue in Europe."
"For this reason, in our opinion, we urged that Community assistance be granted to regional airports."
"Let us not have any illusions: in new Member States, the involvement of private capital is not a magic remedy for market-based infrastructure development, especially in peripheral regions, because solvent demand is low, and the return on the investment is slow."
"This is why I support the utilisation of structural funds in PPP constructions, too. This may actually make investments efficient."
"I congratulate the draftsman of the report, I would like to thank you for your attention, and congratulations on the Barcelona victory, Mr President!"
". Mr President, the signing of the interinstitutional agreement today allows the legislative work related to the implementation of cohesion policy in the 2007-2013 period to continue."
"In accordance with the mandatory procedures, the European Commission will present the strategic framework after the package of regulations related to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund has been adopted."
"The European Parliament should expect the European Commission to identify priorities and courses of action in such a way as to maintain the essence of European cohesion policy while creating the conditions for implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The strategic guidelines should, as the rapporteur rightly points out, flesh out the framework described in the regulation rather than replacing or changing it."
"We are aware that the strategic guidelines will be the basis for the final versions of the National Strategic Reference Frameworks drawn up by the Member States."
"That is why it is necessary to formulate them in such a way as to avoid problems with their interpretation."
"In view of this I would also like to point out a few elements in particular which should feature in the Strategic Reference Frameworks."
"The challenges related to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy mean that the urban dimension of cohesion policy is gaining particular significance."
"It should become one of the main elements of the strategic guidelines."
"It will only be possible to achieve the aims of the strategic guidelines once there is better transport access, and that is why building transport networks, especially the transeuropean networks, is one of the basic tasks at hand."
"It will not be possible to reach the goals of the Lisbon Strategy if we do not create the conditions for implementing research and innovative development as well as support for the Seventh Framework Programme, which means that cohesion policy should create the right conditions for research and development."
"The strategic guidelines must be clear and easy to read and understand."
"That is something which the European Parliament has a right to expect."
". Mr President, it is appropriate to have a joint debate on how to derive real and measurable benefit from EU regional policy programmes."
"Channelling the EU’s regional policy funds into projects which help improve development in more disadvantaged regions, as well as economic growth and competitiveness throughout the EU, is the background to the guidelines to be drawn up."
"I wish in particular to thank the rapporteur for addressing this challenge and making a vibrant addition to the strategy document on Parliament’s behalf."
"It is quite right to be unbending when it comes to certain important principles."
"For that reason I am in favour of clawing back funds that have already been paid to the regions and Member States, if necessary, unless important key principles relating to European Union policy, such as sustainable development, equality, non-discrimination and the implementation of environmental legislation have been taken into account satisfactorily in the programmes."
"On the whole, it is important to concentrate the dwindling funds that are available in such a way that the outcome is use of aid that is as effective as possible and achievement of European added value."
"An important aspect of this is the channelling of aid, for example, to sustainably renewable energy sources."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of another matter."
"How might we administer regional projects by reducing bureaucracy, all the while ensuring that there is adequate financial control and supervision?"
"Many projects unfortunately do not get implemented because the bureaucracy is more expensive than implementing the project itself."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, to begin with, to quote one of the phrases contained in the excellent report by our fellow Member, Mrs Krehl: ‘The European Parliament is confident that the Commission and the Council will take on board the suggestions of the European Parliament; this is necessary if it is to give its assent to the strategic guidelines.’"
"You have listened carefully, Commissioner, as I too listened carefully to you just now when you gave your introductory address."
"Although you mentioned the regions several times, the word ‘city’ appeared only once in your speech."
"That is why, three weeks ago at the plenary of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Haüpel, mayor of Vienna, replied ‘That is unfortunately to be feared’ to a journalist who had asked the following question: ‘The urban dimension has been integrated into the objectives in terms of convergence and competitiveness."
"Do you fear that, unless something more specific is stated, it will fall by the wayside?’"
"That is why the Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion are of crucial importance."
"Personally, I recommend adding a fourth priority to the Community’s strategic guidelines. This would be focused on cities and conurbations and on the role played by these."
"I am anxious to point out that by ‘cities’ our Committee on Regional Development means not only cities or urban areas but also, as Mrs Krehl’s report emphasises several times, any territory that includes a city centre, outlying urban areas and all the rural areas that depend on the city, as the city depends on them."
"All these territories indisputably constitute not only the places where 80% of our populations are concentrated but also places essential to the development of our Europe through the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"Mrs Krehl’s report accords an important place to cities."
"The objective of my speech at this time is to point out, while regretting that the Presidency-in-Office is not represented, that the members of our committee or intergroup have on several occasions urged the Council to put pressure on the Member States with a view to their all taking account of the urban dimension on the grounds that it will not be possible to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives if the urban sectors do not play their full role within the framework of the cohesion policy."
"While regretting that the Council is not present, we anticipate your total commitment in this regard."
"The cohesion policy needs to be able fully to bear fruit as a result of the urban sectors participating fully in it."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to Mrs Krehl for her constructive cooperation."
"It has proved possible to orient the guidelines towards the principle of sustainable development."
"I wish to emphasise this point in particular, because the Commission has now moved away from according due importance to this."
"Earmarking, which has now been integrated into the general regulation through the back door as a competitor to the guidelines, causes problems in that it destroys the comprehensive approach of the guidelines, which is both horizontal and vertical at the same time."
"Separating the Lisbon Strategy from the Gothenburg Strategy means that industrial regions and cities are the winners and rural areas the losers."
"I do not want to compete with the previous speaker, Mr Beaupuy, in saying that, as he is talking about the problem regions in the cities, in particular, but this separation calls into question cohesion in many regions – with disastrous consequences."
"I shall simply give the example of the country the Commissioner knows best."
"Following the earmarking, Riga and the surrounding area will obtain all the money, but the Latvian region fundamentally in need of support is Latgale, the poorest region in the EU at the moment."
"This will receive only the remainder of the subsidies, which cannot be right."
"In my view, these problems of the Commission’s own making can only be solved retrospectively if, in the operational programmes, the Commission ensures that, in all dimensions and for all areas – both urban and rural – sustainable development receives equal attention in the economic, social and environmental approach, that is to say, in a balanced development approach."
"Whilst the Commission’s attention is insufficiently focused on this, there can be no real cohesion in Europe."
"I want first of all to thank Mrs Krehl for her report and for the open and inclusive way in which it was produced."
"There are some elements I disagree with, but the report goes some way towards bringing a measure of social and environmental balance into the strategic guidelines."
"It is important for the European Parliament to argue strongly for a more balanced set of guidelines and explicitly to reject earmarking and the thinking behind that approach, which would only compound the imbalances inherent now in Lisbon and in the present Commission guidelines."
"The championing of Lisbon over Gothenburg and of some elements of Lisbon over others in the Commission’s original guidelines is worrying."
"We must direct the guidelines in a way that reflects the principal function of cohesion policy and the holistic development of Europe’s regions, not just business growth."
"I particularly welcome paragraph 9 of Mrs Krehl’s report, with its demand that sound partnership between all parties be enshrined in the regulations and guidelines and its support for the strengthening of civil society."
"I was particularly glad to hear Commissioner Piebalgs recognise that here this evening."
"Thanks once again and congratulations to Mrs Krehl on her report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying a word of thanks to Mrs Krehl for her sound report and excellent cooperation on this issue."
"The economic disparities between the regions of the EU will only increase in the coming programming period – particularly as a result of the forthcoming enlargements – with no increase in Structural Fund appropriations – if we did not know that before today, we do now."
"In the light of this, it is now necessary to use the scant resources available in an intelligent and efficient manner, always bearing in mind that cohesion policy cannot solve all the structural problems or be a substitute for the efforts of the Member States."
"I endorse the critical appraisal of earmarking, for example, which puts us in fetters."
"There is a danger that the regions will not have the flexibility they need in developing the programmes to meet their local and regional requirements."
"I should like to emphasise the particular consideration for the urban dimension, of which the Commission’s proposal takes insufficient account."
"Owing to their economic and social disparities, conurbations are in particular need of increased assistance."
"The use of private cofinancing to aid the implementation of all the programmes is very important. This needs to be emphasised time and again, particularly at a time when public funds are scarce – and this opinion is in fact shared by the majority of all the members of our Committee."
"It is essential to promote private cofinancing at project level."
"Public-private partnerships are, unfortunately, too little used in connection with the Structural Funds, since they raise a host of legal questions that have to be resolved."
"A welcome development is that the negotiations on the Financial Perspective succeeded in largely harmonising the different standards within the framework of cohesion policy for the old and new Member States."
"This report is enormously important because it deals with the idea of growth reaching all of our corners of Europe."
"I support Mrs Krehl’s report and would like to thank her for a truly excellent job and for her constructive cooperation."
"I wish to raise a couple of matters and particularly to emphasise the significance of the social economy and the development of the infrastructure for IT."
"I also wish to emphasise the development of the infrastructure for IT."
"The social economy as a model for sustainable development, with its capacity to reconcile the economic and social fabric in the regions by coupling the spirit of entrepreneurship with social purposes, combating passive dependency on social welfare systems, needs to be recognised and taken into account in social and territorial cohesion policies and frameworks at European, national and local level."
"The reason is that a social economy brings entrepreneurship and creates job opportunities at local and regional level."
"A social economy targets socially excluded goups, for example the long-term unemployed."
"A social economy means innovative entrepreneurship for minority groups and it increases empowerment and strengthens civil society."
"I also wish to emphasise the importance of the development of the infrastructure for IT."
"IT and its infrastructure have exactly the same importance today as roads and railways have long had and continue to have for growth in Europe."
"If new companies are to be able to work in all the regions, there must be IT and infrastructure in place to make it possible for them to work effectively."
"It must not be allowed to be the case that it is not possible to work out in the regions because of an underdeveloped IT infrastructure."
"I therefore think it good that this is emphasised in the Commission’s document and in Mrs Krehl’s report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the issue of rules for the structural funds, there is no time to lose."
"The process of implementing common rules for these funds is an arduous one, and those of us from the new Member States still have fresh memories of what happened in 2004 when we had to deal with months of delays, time that has been difficult to make up."
"I would therefore call for an agreement on the directives on the structural funds to be concluded at the earliest opportunity."
"I feel it would be unfortunate if the agreement were to run aground or be postponed as a result of Parliament insisting on certain requirements right up until the last moment, cost what it may."
"An agreement needs to be reached as quickly as possible so that adequate time is set aside for operational programmes to be drawn up at national level."
"The last bone of contention between the Council and Parliament is the issue of the Community reserve."
"I should like to point out that the Council has agreed that some Member States, including the Czech Republic, will have their structural fund allocations adjusted in 2010 as a result of updated economic growth estimates."
"It would therefore only be fair to address the issue of the reserve from this point of view, because economic growth in some countries has evidently been underestimated."
"The report before us is, to my mind, a well-balanced text that will contribute towards an agreement with the Council."
"I agree with the criticism that has been levelled at the earmarking of resources for the aims of the Lisbon Strategy."
"As things stand, and given that the Commission in particular is insisting on the principle of earmarking, I at least welcome the fact that this is not intended to affect the new Member States, which will have to invest mainly in infrastructure and in combating unemployment, in light of the backwardness of many of their regions."
"I also feel it important to point out that the urban dimension has not been catered for sufficiently."
"Cities face a range of problems."
"That being said, I welcome the fact that the Commission is in favour of lifting the current ban on using money from the fund for housing."
"In the new Member States especially, there are many neglected, run-down high-rise estates, the renovation of which is taking a great deal of time on account of the lack of public resources."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for this report and would recommend its adoption."
"– Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent and detailed work and by thanking her for her willingness to meet and hold intensive dialogue with national representatives of differing levels of responsibility with regard to structural and cohesion policies."
"Thank you, Mrs Krehl."
"Today, following the approval of the multi-annual budget for the European Union’s challenges for 2007-2013, which come at a time of some stagnation and confusion following the effort of enlargement, these guidelines make more sense than ever, since they represent an effort to focus the scant financial resources effectively and intelligently, in order to achieve the maximum added value, as the rapporteur herself has said."
"We are therefore doubly grateful for Mrs Krehl’s great sensitivity towards the diversity of the different needs of the regions and the flexibility of their solutions, with particular attention for regions – from mountain regions to the outermost regions – suffering structural disadvantages, such as depopulation, ageing or difficult access."
"We are also grateful for her insistence on actively promoting equal opportunities between men and women as a transversal condition."
"There can never be too much of that."
"Furthermore, we welcome the innovative and modern restoration of the Delors growth and investment approach, with the call for sustainable transport infrastructures – railways, collective transport and maritime transport – their accessibility and the optimisation of traffic management and road safety and, above all, the need to complete the trans-European networks, particularly where there has not been sufficient development at the borders between States, as in the case of the Pyrenees in my country."
"We also accept its call for the sustainable use of natural resources, particularly water, and the development of sustainable energy sources combined with savings and efficiency."
"I would like to highlight Mrs Krehl’s ability to understand the requirements of the specific relationships between cities and their surrounding areas, taking the approach of an integrated economic area, which in my city, Zaragoza, we call 'the fourth space'."
"I would also like to stress Mrs Krehl's argument that we need to reduce the technological gap between regions and Member States, through the enhancement of technological cooperation networks, and her particular sensitivity towards promoting the development of SMEs and innovation potential, in terms of R+D."
"I would finally like to thank her for all of her efforts aimed at improving employment and the integration of immigrants, and also her view that the situation of workers must not be worsened under any circumstances."
"Mr President, like all my fellow Members who spoke before me, I would pay tribute to the quality of the work done by Mrs Krehl, and I should like to join with her in emphasising the major importance of the objective of territorial cohesion, which I think is crucial to the future of our European Union."
"In my view, this is not made clear enough in the Commission’s proposal."
"What is more, the earmarking of appropriations under the Lisbon Strategy, which has been introduced surreptitiously by means of an annex to the Structural Funds General Regulation, is in danger of further exacerbating inter-regional or sub-regional disparities which, I believe, have in no small measure contributed to the constitutional deadlock in which we at present find ourselves."
"That would, moreover, particularly be the case in countries and regions in which a premium is placed on the objectives of competitiveness and employment."
"Indeed, the obstacles to development vary, and are different, according to the geographical situation of the regions."
"In particular, I should like to emphasise that accessibility remains an indispensable prior condition of the more or less peripheral or isolated regions becoming competitive and, therefore, of their perhaps subscribing to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Earmarking, under the terms of the annex I mentioned, would, if applied rigidly, hamper these regions by preventing them, in particular, from funding vital transport infrastructure."
"What is more, we are talking here about highly technocratic arrangements which, I believe, would make the EU’s regional policy still less transparent and still more incomprehensible to our fellow citizens."
"Is that really what we want?"
"Obviously not."
"That is why, Commissioner, it is important for it to be clearly confirmed to us that there will be acceptance of the necessary flexibility, both in the National Strategic Reference Frameworks and in the regional operational programmes."
"Having discussed the matter a little with Mrs Hübner, I got the impression that she was alert to this issue, but, really, I should like the Commission to take due account of it."
"Mr President, following enlargement, up to 46% more citizens are living in convergence objective regions, while available resources have not increased proportionately."
"This trend is about to strengthen with the forthcoming accessions of Romania and Bulgaria."
"It is therefore obvious that the question as to how to spend these resources in the most efficient way is of the utmost importance."
"The new Member States, which are the main beneficiaries of cohesion policy, have specific socio-economic needs that need to be appropriately taken into account."
"Therefore, I warmly welcome this document and the work of our rapporteur, Mrs Krehl, who committed herself to ensuring that the available resources will be used in an intelligent, efficient and concentrated manner."
"I particularly welcome the rapporteur’s recommendations on links between the cohesion policy and the Lisbon Strategy, as they will bring sustainable economic growth and lasting, quality employment."
"I also welcome the links between the partnership principle and the territorial dimension, as well as the emphasis on more environmentally sustainable transport, national resources management, equal opportunities, lifelong learning and urban development."
"It is paramount that we ensure that all Member States will be able to adopt their national strategy frameworks in time, so that programmes can start as soon as 1 January 2007."
"What is at stake here is the Union’s objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Despite the legitimate disappointment on the level of available resources for cohesion policy, it will be possible with appropriate rules for spending and programme implementation to achieve a great deal of improvement with regard to helping those regions which are lagging behind to catch up in socio-economic terms."
"Finally, I would like to add that I am optimistic and am quite sure that this report will attract broad support during the vote tomorrow."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mrs Krehl on her outstanding report, which expresses Parliament’s concerns regarding the definition of Community strategic guidelines that should govern the application of the economic and social cohesion policy for 2007-2013."
"I wish to say a few words on one issue that particularly concerns me, namely the risk that we run of subordinating cohesion policy to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The risk is a real one and should not be overlooked. Otherwise we may to some degree warp the concept of solidarity and of balanced, harmonious development of the territory – concepts that lie at the heart of cohesion policy."
"If the predominant factor of the Lisbon Strategy is competitiveness, we run the risk of channelling structural funds as a matter of priority to the least favoured regions with the greatest potential for development, to the detriment of regions with less development potential."
"This is particularly true of the nine new Member States, whose territory is made up entirely of convergence objective regions."
"I therefore call for the necessary balance between competitiveness and solidarity."
". I should like to thank the rapporteur again for an excellent report."
"The Commission’s final version of the Community’s strategic guidelines for cohesion will be clear and transparent."
"I assure you that the report and today’s debate will provide valuable input in shaping the strategic guidelines for cohesion."
"That concludes this item."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"– The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- A6-0152/2006 by Mr Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on natural disasters (fires, droughts and floods) – agricultural aspects (2005/2195(INI));"
"- A6-0147/2006 by Mr Gerardo Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on natural disasters (fires, droughts and floods) – regional development aspects (2005/2193(INI));"
"- A6-0149/2006 by Mrs Edite Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on natural disasters (fires, droughts and floods) – environmental aspects (2005/2192(INI)) and"
"- A6-0123/2006 by Mr Rolf Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (COM(2005)0108 – C6-0093/2005 – 2005/0033(COD))."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the Committees on Regional Development, the Environment and Agriculture and the respective rapporteurs, Mr Galeote Quecedo, Mr Berend, Mr Capoualas Santos and Mrs Estrela, for their hard and constructive work."
"Recent trends seem to indicate a growing vulnerability of the European Union to disasters, and natural disasters in particular."
"The incidence of extreme weather events and related natural disasters is increasing, perhaps fuelled by the effects of climate changes."
"This year again, floods have raged in central and eastern Europe with four countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria – requesting assistance through the Community mechanism for civil protection."
"I am proud to say that European solidarity and generosity has once again mitigated the affliction those countries had to suffer."
"The four reports rightly point out the human, environmental and financial costs of such disasters."
"The Commission therefore very much welcomes the European Parliament’s initiative to examine the various aspects involved, with a joint effort by no less than three parliamentary committees."
"The jointly organised hearing earlier this spring has certainly made a valuable contribution to this process."
"The reports rightly consider a whole range of measures aimed at improving risk prevention and the response to crises."
"The Commission agrees with the recommendations regarding the need to adjust action in the area of prevention and management of natural disasters, as well as the need to coordinate Community instruments."
"In fact, the reports reinforce the Commission’s integrated approach to its policy on disasters, which includes instruments regarding prevention, immediate response and more longer-term, solidarity-based action."
"This approach is intended to strengthen the EU’s capacity and effectiveness in preparing for and responding to major disasters, while avoiding duplication of effort."
"Some of the proposals contained in the reports have already been endorsed through the Commission’s action."
"We are now proposing even more concrete ways to act."
"Our recast of the Council Decision establishing the Community mechanism for civil protection is the legal embodiment of a number of proposals put forward in these reports."
"These proposals are consistent with the Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument."
"The recent Barnier report also explores certain forward-looking suggestions for our response to disasters."
"The Commission also welcomes the progress on the negotiations for the proposed floods directive on the assessment and management of floods and the positive vote in the recent ENVI Committee meeting."
"The Commission would equally welcome strong support from this House for a directive that gives all citizens a right to the same approach and level of ambition for flood risk protection, prevention and preparedness, regardless of where they live in the Community: in transboundary or national river basins, or in the coastal areas of the Community."
"Not only are floods on the increase with changes to our climate, but droughts have become more prevalent in Europe."
"At the request of a number of Member States, the Commission is analysing the issues of water scarcity and droughts."
"Options are under consideration and we expect that a Commission staff paper will be available shortly."
"Another relevant instrument for the future could be Life+, the new financial instrument for the environment."
"It aims, , to support the efforts of Member States in the field of forest fire prevention, mainly through the implementation of knowledge-related measures such as training and awareness-raising campaigns."
"Equally, the Commission is prepared to cofinance prevention measures under the cohesion and rural development policies."
"Member States are invited to include appropriate actions in their programmes for the forthcoming period, where prevention will be one of the priorities."
"Under the rural development pillar, Member States can also implement specific measures to restore the potential of forestry or agricultural production."
"Under the rural development programmes, they can also request that a ‘severe natural disaster’ be recognised as , in order to derogate from certain conditions under the ‘agri-environment’ measures."
"Those possibilities continue in the new programming period from 2007 to 2013."
"We must not forget, though, that natural disasters are not the only threat the Union is faced with."
"It must be prepared for and able to respond effectively to challenges."
"Major man-made disasters, major threats to public health and acts of terrorism might require just as much of a common European response."
"For the Commission, it is sometimes difficult to explain why the Union should be absent in some circumstances."
"The lack of a concrete expression of Union solidarity has already been a source of embarrassment to the Union during some of the traumatic events of recent years."
"The Commission is therefore particularly grateful for the widespread support expressed in Mr Berend’s report for extending the EU Solidarity Fund to non-natural disasters and for enlarging the scope of eligible operations accordingly."
"The Solidarity Fund created in 2002 has generally worked quite successfully, if judged against the objectives and conditions set out in its legal basis."
"Aid has been granted in 21 cases, concerning 15 Member States and candidate countries."
"Those who criticise the Solidarity Fund as being ineffective or too slow have a point."
"However, experience since 2002 has also led the Commission to the view that the existing fund has a number of shortcomings and that modifications to the current regulation are necessary."
"That is why we have proposed a new Solidarity Fund Regulation."
"The new proposal is based on the current Solidarity Fund, while introducing a number of modifications aimed at widening its scope, making the fund more transparent, and introducing a number of operational improvements, in particular the possibility of making advance payments so that the fund reacts more quickly and effectively."
"The Commission nevertheless considers that the fund must remain limited to public emergency intervention."
"Insured or private damage, including agricultural damage, should not be compensated."
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle and third party liability must continue to apply."
"As with the current fund, the new proposal is based on the subsidiarity principle."
"The EU should intervene only when a state is considered to be no longer in a position to tackle a disaster alone."
"Consequently, there should be a relatively high threshold for European intervention."
"Today this threshold is defined in terms of direct damage, which must exceed EUR 3 billion, or 0.6% of GNI."
"With the new proposal, the Commission has therefore sought to improve the transparency and simplicity of the criteria governing the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund."
"That would help the national authorities to have a clearer idea of when the fund is likely to be able to support them in recovering from a disaster."
"Alongside the enlarged scope, a major element of the proposal is therefore a new definition of the criteria for triggering the fund."
"The operationally complicated regional criteria would be abolished in favour of only quantitative criteria."
"In compensation for the loss of the regional criteria, the quantitative threshold would be reset at EUR 1 billion, or 0.5% of GNI, whichever is the lower."
"This would increase the predictability of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund decisions, thus reducing the workload in the Member States in preparing applications for support that have little or no chance of success."
"Solely in the case of truly unexpected and exceptional situations, such as those where physical damage is limited, for instance terrorist attacks or major public health crises, the new fund could be mobilised by a political decision of the Commission, to be confirmed by the European Parliament and the Council."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by expressing my gratitude for the positive contributions of many Members from the various political groups, and the helpful support of members of the Committee on Agriculture who worked with me on this report."
"The huge scale of some disasters in recent years, and last year in particular, has led Parliament to give due consideration to this issue."
"Three committees have been set up to provide solutions, from their particular perspective, for preventing disasters or for offsetting the impact thereof when it is not possible to prevent them."
"I have worked on this report for some six or seven months and, having spent that time listening to many MEPs, specialists, economic agents, local, regional and national authorities and the communities affected, I found the experience highly rewarding."
"I was also able to go to the six worst affected Member States last year, namely Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, France and Italy."
"I was delighted with the welcome accorded to us everywhere we went and I have no doubt that in bringing Parliament closer to the citizens, we performed useful work for our institution."
"I also worked hard to establish as broad a consensus as possible on the proposals that I shall present to you."
"I was able, in fact, to accept all the amendments that were tabled – 53 out of 60 – and the few exceptions were for formal reasons of redundancy or duplication and not because of their content."
"The report before us is based on three main ideas."
"Firstly, agriculture and forestry are activities that are closely bound up with the natural world and are therefore at the mercy of climatic phenomena, and exposed to bio-sanitary risks resulting from air, water and ground pollution and from increasing globalisation."
"Secondly, the exodus from the countryside is one of the main causes of the increase in forest fires in southern Europe, especially acute during times of drought, as the year 2005 sadly proved."
"The EU’s budgetary limits must, however, be respected. The proposals therefore submitted fall within the financial perspective that we adopted yesterday."
"The main thrust of my proposal is therefore to optimise the existing political instruments, for example the Solidarity Fund, the European Agriculture and Rural Development Funds, the Veterinary Fund, regional policy instruments, the future Life+ Regulation, by improving them and adapting them within the context of genuine disaster and risk management systems."
"In the case of the latter, this will be done by communitarising a system of insurance and reinsurance to be cofinanced by the farmers, the Member States and the EU via the EAFRD."
"The Solidarity Fund will need to be broader in scope and more flexible, to cover disasters that unfold over time, such as drought, which is currently not included."
"In order to make it more effective, a flexibility clause should be attached to it to ensure the provision of adequate financial resources when they are needed, from common agricultural policy headings that currently go unused."
"The funding priority of EAFRD, on the other hand, should be actions aimed at the forestation and reforestation of burnt areas, along with all possible prevention measures, such as upkeep of forests, the use of biomass to produce energy, the training of economic agents involved and the supply of information to them, and awareness raising on such problems, all made possible with greater cofinancing from national rural development programmes."
"This is just a brief summary of a few points, which illustrate the importance of Parliament addressing the agricultural aspect of such disasters, and I hope that Parliament will lend its fullest possible support."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council will give due attention to these proposals, taking account of the urgent nature of the circumstances."
". – Mr President, over the last eight months we have visited the areas affected by natural disasters in many of the Member States and we have held a public hearing at which some of the people who have not had the opportunity to speak in their own national Parliaments have been able to speak. Today we are presenting concrete proposals, which the other institutions cannot allow to be thrown into the litter bin."
"Some Members could legitimately be pleased with the work done in this area. It is more than the public administrations directly responsible in some of the Member States have done."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we should ask ourselves whether we are more prepared now than we were eight months ago to prevent and combat this kind of disaster and whether we now have more effective mechanisms for helping those suffering the consequences of fire, water or drought."
"I am not sure."
"In any event, I would like to thank all of the parliamentary groups for their commitment and dedication over these months of intensive work."
"I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for taking an interest in who was going to attend the hearing, although I must admit that I would have preferred him to show his support by immediately visiting the areas affected, avoiding the bureaucratic procedures that delayed us for four months and resulting in us missing the opportunity to demonstrate the solidarity of all of us – I am sure – with the victims straightaway."
"I would like in particular to thank Parliament’s services for the professionalism they have shown. They were subject to all kinds of pressures before, during and after the visits made."
"I am delighted that we have been able to vote on these reports at the same time as the reform of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, because we have noted general dissatisfaction with the application of this Community instrument in each and every place we have visited, Mr Piebalgs."
"I believe it to be essential that the Council accept Parliament’s amendments, in particular those that demand, on the one hand, that the Fund assist all of the victims and their families, and on the other, that the Fund’s limits of applicability be reduced and that this Fund can be applied when certain areas are completely destroyed, as in the case of Riba de Saelices, which we have visited."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on these visits we have seen the deficiencies in the information campaigns aimed at prevention and the lack of coordination amongst the competent public administrations in the Member States, including, as we have seen, in Pampillosa da Serra, for example."
"We have also seen the dissatisfaction of the population in broad sectors of society, in NGOs and amongst representatives of civil society."
"I therefore hope that the proposals contained in the reports being submitted for Parliament’s consideration today receive wide support and send a clear signal to the governments of the Member States."
"I would like quickly to summarise what we are asking for by means of ten points."
"First: a European strategy to combat natural disasters; secondly: the involvement of regions and local bodies; thirdly: flexibility in the redistribution of the funds available; fourthly: a Community forest-fire protection programme; fifthly: a specific proposal, Mr Piebalgs, for a directive for fire prevention and management in the European Union; sixthly: that the Seventh Framework Research Programme, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and the Galileo system be applied in order to assist in prevention and early warning; seventhly: information and educational programmes and campaigns agreed with the Member States; eighthly: a Community civil protection mechanism; ninthly: that additional financial instruments also be applied, such as EIB loans or State aid for regional purposes; and tenthly: that the European Parliament continue to carry out its duty of control with regard to the shortcomings in the fight against fire and all of the problems relating to it."
"For all of these reasons, I would call upon everybody to put aside the party-political differences that may have divided us so that we can create a broad parliamentary consensus, which is what the European citizens are demanding of us and which we owe in particular to those who have suffered the consequences of these natural disasters: their victims."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have mentioned the methodology used to draw up these three reports. I refer in particular to the visits that we made to the six countries affected by natural disasters and the public hearing that took place in Brussels."
"In our own countries too – at least this was the case in Portugal – we held public hearings to gather suggestions, information and proposals put forward by the various stakeholders."
"I should also like to thank the Members for their backing, their suggestions and their amendments, and the experts who helped improve my report."
"The climate is changing."
"The year is no longer divided into the traditional four seasons."
"Days of unbroken drought alternate with days of torrential rain and with heat waves."
"Climate change lies at the root of the natural disasters – be they floods, extreme droughts or fires – that have been occurring with increasing frequency throughout the world and have caused terrible damage in terms of human loss, environmental deterioration and reduced economic activity."
"This is one of the major problems of our times."
"2005 began with the world in shock at the scale of the tragedy caused by the Asian tsunami."
"The process of identifying the dead and looking for survivors went on for a number of months."
"In the summer of that year, a series of fires destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest in Portugal, France and Spain, and violent floods spread devastation and death in countries such as Germany and Austria."
"Outside Europe, Hurricane Katrina wreaked unprecedented destruction in a number of North American States, and before the year was out, Afghanistan was hit by a violent earthquake."
"In addition to earthquakes, seaquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods and fires, there are other phenomena associated with climate change and global warming that cause sea levels in coastal areas to rise and beaches to disappear."
"Studies published in magazine reveal that sea levels could rise six metres by 2100, given that the ice of the Arctic and Antarctic is melting increasingly quickly."
"In order to prevent the worst case scenario, serious measures must immediately be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to honour the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Commissioner, you referred to the water shortage."
"Indeed, water must also be used more sustainably, more sensibly and more efficiently."
"More than 1 billion people fight for survival every day because they do not have drinking water, 400 million of whom are children."
"Water-related diseases kill a child every 15 seconds and are linked to many other diseases and malnutrition."
"The distribution of resources between the different domestic, industrial and agricultural users needs to be studied and debated, and waste must be combated."
"It is crucial to encourage the citizens to help prevent these disasters, by reducing greenhouse emissions, as I have said before, by protecting the forests and by not building in high-risk areas."
"Natural disasters cut across borders and their environmental consequences also affect neighbouring countries."
"Given that Community action should complement that of the national authorities, in terms of prevention, planning and intervention, rehabilitation and follow-up, it is essential to step up coordination at all levels, to improve the existing mechanisms and to develop early warning systems."
"Although each region has its own characteristics and each case is different, there are common needs to be addressed, such as defining risk assessment mechanisms and drawing up maps of areas of drought, forest fires and floods."
"My report contains a number of other proposals, which I naturally hope will be endorsed, first and foremost, by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, examples of which include the definition of prevention systems to facilitate the fight against the causes of natural disasters; improved urban planning, especially in coastal areas and high-risk areas; the preservation of natural ecosystems; increased cooperation on civil protection between the Member States and at EU level in order to ensure the availability of additional resources for rapid action to address emergency situations; and the simplification of the rules on implementing the instruments, such as the Solidarity Fund and the Forest Focus Programme."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters – for example the many forest fires and floods, not least in the summer of 2005 – there is an ever-growing demand for European solidarity."
"The solidarity fund set up in the aftermath of the devastating floods in 2002 and designed to run until 2006 is intended to give the European Union greater freedom to act in the event of major disasters or crisis situations, thereby playing a substantial part in enabling the EU to do more and target its efforts better in those areas in which the public expect the European Union to act."
"As you, Commissioner, mentioned earlier, it was extremely difficult, not to say sometimes and in some situations impossible, to use the existing instruments at EU level as a means of responding appropriately to major crises, not all of which, it has to be said, were of natural origin."
"One can take as examples of this industrial accidents – such as the wreck of the tanker , or the bomb attack on Madrid in March 2004."
"In addition, the current threshold for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund is set extremely high, so that exceptional conditions and arrangements abounded."
"The new solidarity fund regulation now rightly makes provision for the extension of its scope, in other words, no longer limiting major crisis situations to natural disasters, but extending the category to include industrial and technological calamities, except where the ‘polluter pays’ principle is applicable or where the damage can be covered by insurance."
"There is also a need for immediate action in the event of public health crises and when terrorists strike, although – and this is the crux of the matter – the budget must remain unchanged."
"The definition of a ‘major disaster’ has also been revised, so that a disaster is regarded as major if it causes damage estimated at in excess of EUR 1 billion or over 0.5% of the gross national income of the State concerned."
"One is talking here about damage in the public sphere rather than to private property or damage covered by insurance."
"As has been said, the threshold was formerly fixed at EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of gross national income, which threshold values had been proposed by the Commission and by this House, but not accepted by the Council."
"Finally, it is also intended that a new political criterion be introduced to enable the Commission, should extraordinary circumstances in a specific part of the territory of an eligible state sufficiently warrant it, to declare a disaster situation to be major, even if the quantitative criteria have not been fulfilled – a criterion that is likely to apply to acts of terrorism."
"It needs to be emphasised that the European Union’s solidarity fund is not a means for taking preventive action, but that it instead responds to disaster situations."
"That, for example, excludes the possibility of the fund being used to provide protection in advance of pandemics or to facilitate other preventive action."
"The solidarity fund cannot engage in preventive health care, nor is it meant to; health policy remains a matter for the nation states, and by that is meant specifically the deployment of vaccines and medicines in the initial response to disasters, medical and psychological emergency care and measures to deal with the risk of contagious disease, for example as a consequence of flooding."
"As before, the fund’s financial assets amount to a virtual budget of 1 billion marks, the significance of ‘virtual’ being that these funds can be drawn on only in the event of a disaster, and must first be mobilised by the Commission and Parliament; it follows that they cannot be transferred elsewhere."
"I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to all who have worked with me on this report – to the Bureau, to my colleagues, and to the Members of this House, irrespective of whatever groups they belong to, with hearty thanks to the Commission, too, for its good cooperation."
"Mr President, the boulevards of Szeged, a city in Southern Hungary, were named after the large cities of Europe."
"This does not reflect sister city relations, but the fact that the city had been destroyed by a flood over one hundred years ago, and was rebuilt by an effort of solidarity involving the entire Europe."
"It was not us, it was not the European Union who invented European solidarity, and it has been in operation long before 2002."
"Obviously, this does not mean that the Committee on Budgets does not support the existence of the Solidarity Fund and the currently planned modifications to its regulation."
"Our Committee wishes to see an efficient Solidarity Fund, and not one that narrows down artificially the scope of those eligible for assistance."
"We agree with the mitigation of damages suffered, and we pressed for the rapid activation of the system."
"We believe that it is important for the Fund to be situated within the flexibility instrument."
"The Solidarity Fund represents a significant opportunity for the European Union to make its citizens aware of its existence in a manner that can be understood by all."
"The European Union can show, in a tangible form, that Brussels is not just a bureaucratic hydrocephalus, but also a helping hand."
"Numerous ungenerous rather than helpful proposals have been made during the debate, and I consider them to be a mistake."
"I thank the rapporteur for his thorough work, and hope that we will only need to use this Fund rarely or perhaps never, but not due to bad regulations inspired by selfishness, but to the absence of disasters causing damages."
"I know that my natural optimism is a mistake, but please support these funds."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though the European Union’s Solidarity Fund has been in existence only since 2002, it is already in need of revision."
"Founded upon the principles of solidarity and aid in a crisis, it has proved its worth in dealing with the after-effects of natural disasters, but it has also become apparent over recent years that its scope cannot be limited to dealing with these."
"It has become more and more plain that industrial and technological disasters and the potential crises resulting from terrorist acts or – something that is of particular importance to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – a public health crisis, make it necessary that we should be in a position to respond and help by means of solidarity and financial resources."
"Just so that it is clear to everyone, once and for all, I am not talking here about preventative measures, which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, fall within the remit of the Member States."
"Our concern is with help, on the basis of solidarity, in dealing with the spreading of diseases, with pandemics, or with accidents such as the one that happened at Chernobyl."
"We want to be able to help without in any way overloading the European budget with unnecessary functions, not even when natural disasters need to be dealt with."
"It is for that reason that I expect the House not to give its backing to the renewed demand – made in another report – for an observatory to report on drought, desertification and other effects of climate change, for these tasks are already being dealt with by the Commission anyway."
"It must be clear to us that every additional agency – or whatever else we want to call these things – restricts the financial elbow room available for our policies, and just how tight that elbow room is was the subject of a resolution yesterday."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mrs Estrela, Mr Capoulas Santos and Mr Galeote Quecedo on their outstanding work. In some respects, an even more positive solution could have been reached, which was proposed in Parliament but which ultimately was not taken forward."
"Parliament must address the natural disasters that have lain waste to Europe in recent years – drought, forest fires and floods – in terms of their impact on agricultural activity."
"As Mr Capoulas Santos correctly pointed out, agricultural and forestry production, unlike other economic activities, is closely bound up with nature and is therefore more fragile when natural disasters strike."
"I therefore feel that following recent experiences, there needs to be a fresh approach to European farming in terms of preventing and responding to natural disasters."
"Current national mechanisms are often inadequate and one-off supranational response mechanisms are often inefficient."
"I wish to highlight the Solidarity Fund, which has already been mentioned today and which we will certainly continue to speak about."
"The Fund is currently under review and it is hoped that drought can be included in its scope."
"At a time when climate change is already being felt and when the vulnerability of farmers in the face of such dangers is becoming increasingly apparent, I feel that it is vitally important to draw up a Community strategy to combat natural disasters."
"Accordingly, in the next financial framework a Community forest and flood protection programme should be created with the appropriate funding, with a view to encouraging awareness raising activities, and fire risk prevention and management."
"This Community programme could be funded by a specific regulation, by its own funding or by its own budget heading under EAFRD or LEADER+, in accordance with an oral amendment that is to be tabled."
"Parliament must therefore provide a clear response for the communities it represents, who have suffered as a direct result of the natural disasters and who are naturally expecting our support."
". – Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years Europe has been affected by natural disasters, which have caused hundred of deaths and terrible economic and environmental damage."
"For Portugal in particular, in common with other Mediterranean regions, 2005 was the driest year in the last 105 years."
"In December, around 87% of Portuguese territory was suffering from extreme drought."
"This was particularly serious in the Algarve region, where the climatic conditions were exceptional – a combination of high temperatures and the dryness of the air."
"In the Algarve region, the natural disaster of the drought of 2005 and the devastation caused by the 2003 forest fires had a terrible impact on local infrastructure, on the natural and cultural heritage and on farming and tourism."
"The water supply to the communities concerned was markedly affected in terms of scarcity and compliance with required quality standards."
"Natural disasters are known to occur when extreme weather events affect a vulnerable area."
"It is therefore crucial that the fragility of these regions be reduced."
"European cooperation on civil protection must be stepped up, in order to ensure rapid response for the affected areas. There must also be increased prevention and a rapid response preparedness instrument for emergency situations."
"This is what these own-initiative reports seek to do and to coordinate."
"Even so, the Solidarity Fund has a long way to go before it is fully developed, which is why we are discussing it."
"It should therefore be acknowledged that almost all the affected areas are classified by the EU and that following the devastation we cannot simply say that we have fulfilled our civil responsibility."
"The restoration of lost ecosystems is vital for the balance of these areas. To this end, solidarity is also crucial."
"It is also crucial to enhance information and awareness raising among the communities and regions that are vulnerable to natural disasters, so as to reduce the risks and the impact of those disasters and so that the people know what they can do to preserve the natural resources in the region."
"Solidarity has been a key word in the EU ever since the Treaty of Rome."
"Let us make sure, however, that it does not become just another empty word in the Community vocabulary."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced here with some extremely sensitive issues."
"The various disasters that have taken place, the distress they cause - which we share with the victims insofar as we are able, as outsiders - and the discontent that is expressed show just how sensitive these issues are."
"Throughout our debates, we have listed what these various natural disasters might have consisted of: fires, cyclones, tidal waves, earthquakes, floods, health crises, terrorist attacks, droughts, shortages of drinking water, industrial and technological disasters, agricultural disasters and undoubtedly many more."
"That is a long list that affects our Union and that calls on it to shoulder its responsibilities."
"Yet, as we were able to recognise in our debates, those responsibilities are shouldered by a variety of partners."
"First and foremost, they are sometimes shouldered by those responsible for the disaster, or for a fire, for example."
"Yet they are also shouldered by insurance companies, which are obviously affected, by the Member States and by the various organisations."
"What is the European Union's role, what is its mission, in this general context?"
"For, as my fellow Member, Mrs Madeira, just said, if we are responsible for solidarity, then we must shoulder that responsibility within the context of our powers."
"Yet, what are these powers, before, during and after these natural disasters?"
"I think that, after having heard our fellow Member, Mr Galeote, draw up a fine list just now, there is a need, Commissioner, for total clarity regarding this responsibility of the Union, before, during and after disasters."
"With regard to prevention, as with regard to protection measures, I believe that we do in fact have a power to exercise and a role to play in the fields of research and coordination."
"As regards the retrospective measures, which draw on our Solidarity Fund, our fellow Member, Mr Berend, has done a very fine job, but much remains to be done because it will always be very difficult to find ideal solutions, given the variety of situations and funding."
"We have a huge amount of work facing us."
"What I am asking you to do, Commissioner, is to find a better solution and to ensure that the European Union responds very clearly in the wake of these disasters."
"Our fellow citizens need a European Union that is very clear in terms of the measures it takes."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time now, we have been subsidising a development in the agricultural, industrial and transport fields that has damaged the environment and brought about the alarming situation that we are currently experiencing, and we are paying the price for it: natural disasters are the witnesses to those mistakes."
"It is now a matter of facing up to the damage caused by those disasters, and we all agree on the need to support the victims and to help them get back on their feet and rebuild their lives after the disasters, as well as the need to support the ‘Disaster' fund in order to show solidarity with all of the victims and to demonstrate that the European Parliament takes an interest in, and cares about, its fellow citizens."
"However, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we also call for investment in the areas of prevention and restoration, instead of the focus being merely on curing the ills."
"Even though we broadly support the analyses of the proposals drafted in various resolutions tabled, in particular, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and by the Committee on Regional Development, I am disappointed by the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is refusing, as it were, to assume its share of the responsibility for the speed with which these phenomena are occurring."
"What shocks me is the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting that the aid not be deducted from the CAP resources."
"We have just spent a year witnessing a significant struggle aimed at obtaining a fund to preserve the biodiversity falling under Natura 2000, and we have failed."
"Yesterday, we all took note of that failure."
"As rapporteur for Life +, I will be unable to agree to this programme – which is already well and truly dwindling away – serving as an insurance policy for disasters that are less and less the result of nature."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is in reality our cultivation methods that we must change."
"The flooding of the Danube can be mentioned by way of example."
"The dams had to be knocked down because the Danube delta, which is prone to flooding, had virtually dried up."
"We now need to pose this crucial question: what kind of agriculture and what kinds of transport do we hope to have in the future if the Kyoto Protocol is regarded as the key element where climate change and the fight against this change are concerned?"
"We must seek out the causes of these disruptions, and we, as Members of the European Parliament, know what they are: they are changes in modes of transport."
"I am in favour of a Solidarity Fund and of giving aid to the victims, but let us genuinely seek out the causes, otherwise we are just going to make changes to a never-ending problem."
". – We have tabled amendments to the report on the Solidarity Fund, because we feel that in its current form it does not address areas that we believe to be highly important, including maintaining the criterion of regional-level disasters."
"The new proposal for the Solidarity Fund needs to respond to the difficulties that have been experienced in relation to its application since it was created in 2002."
"We feel that the Fund should be adapted to the specific characteristics and the actual needs of the different countries faced with a very wide range of different disasters, as in the Mediterranean area."
"We therefore tabled a proposal aimed at reintroducing the concept of exceptional regional disasters, as laid down in the current regulation governing the Fund."
"Let me say that this is a view voiced in the opinion delivered by the Economic and Social Committee, which deems it necessary to continue to address disasters with a serious regional impact."
"I also wish to point out that the report by the Committee on Regional Development before us today takes the view that the Fund should be applied when the majority of the population in a region has suffered from a disaster with serious and lasting impact on their living conditions."
"Similarly, the Portuguese Parliament adopted a resolution aimed at maintaining the possibility of providing support in the event of regional disasters with a significant socio-economic and environmental impact in the least favoured regions of the EU."
"We also tabled proposals intended to ensure that both the promotion of support for reinstating production activity in areas affected by disasters and making land and air equipment immediately available to fight against forest fires should figure among the eligible actions."
"Lastly, we proposed that, as laid down in the regulations of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, a level of economic and social development in a region or Member State should be taken into account when financial assistance is granted under the Solidarity Fund."
"Among other aspects that form part of the new proposal for a regulation, I should merely like to underline our concern at the broadening of the scope of application of the Fund without the financial ceiling being increased."
"In other words, we believe that priority should be attached to natural disasters."
"We also oppose the idea of reducing the mobilisation threshold whereby the EU Member States with the highest GNI stand to benefit most."
". Mr President, I believe Mr Capoulas Santos’ report is excellent and much needed by farmers."
"However, I would like to highlight the rather perfunctory treatment of the damages caused by frost, which is also a form of natural disaster."
"I understand that natural disasters such as fires and droughts are issues somewhat closer to the rapporteur’s heart because he lives in the Mediterranean region."
"In Central and Northern European countries, frost causes very serious financial losses in the agricultural sector, especially in orchards and in the field of soft fruit production."
"When working on this draft, we should create a systemic solution that could apply to all regions of the European Union and all types of natural disasters."
"That is why the elements that have so far been omitted should be incorporated into the report in order to make it complete."
"Another issue that was greatly emphasised in the report was the question of migration from rural areas and farmers abandoning their farms."
"This is partly caused by the lack of viability and the high cost of forest management."
"Serious losses in the forestry sector are caused by inappropriate forest management, monocultures across large woodland areas as well as the planting of inappropriate species of trees."
"I would just like to point out that, during discussions concerning this forestry strategy in Parliament two months ago, Members failed to mention the huge areas of forest where forest management is carried out in an exemplary fashion."
"I am referring here to state-owned forests, including those in Poland, where fires and hurricanes also cause significant damage."
"– Mr President, that 2005 was a year of disasters is something that many scientists attribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect, while others see the cause as lying in the natural cycle of disasters; in any case, the fact is that we are not completely blameless when such calamities occur."
"For example, an increasing number of flood plains have been lost in the course of centuries, and experts believe that we in Europe have, by the building of dykes, pretty well exhausted the possibilities of technological protection against flooding, so that we will, in the near future, have to have ever greater recourse to what are termed ‘retention areas’."
"It would appear that respect for the forces of nature is disappearing altogether."
"There is – as is well known – increasing settlement and industrialisation in exposed areas, for example on the coastline and in the flatlands of rivers, and so natural disasters, under such circumstances, can be prevented only with great difficulty if at all, but we can make the effort – by means of a solidarity fund such as this one – to alleviate the consequences in so far as possible."
"It has to be said, though, that the development and extension of early warning systems is essential in this respect; it is in this area that much remains to be done, and I regard this as an area in which the European Union, in particular, must act."
"What we want to achieve with these reports is a greater proximity to citizens and a greater sense of Community Europe, which is something that the public both understands and welcomes."
"We can certainly make a number of improvements in terms of better coordination and the exchange of good practice."
"However, in the case of large–scale natural disasters, according to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we need higher–level arrangements for financial and technical operational help."
"‘He who gives promptly, gives twice over,’ as they said in ancient Rome. ."
"Although we deal exclusively in these reports with the consequences of natural disasters, we also need to pay great attention to preventative measures."
"In this respect, our policies relating to agriculture, forestry, water management, town planning and regional development policy also need to come under scrutiny, as they could have a substantial impact on the scale of the consequences of natural disasters."
"Take, for example, intensive animal husbandry, which is subsidised by the European Union, but which also leads to greater desertification in certain areas."
"With regard to monitoring climate change and its consequences, I advocate closer cooperation between existing research and scientific institutions and the financing of new community programmes."
"New community institutions, however, usually require a lot of money – they are easy to establish, hard to dismantle – and I also advocate that, in addition to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we also take very great care to respect the principle of proportionality."
"Let us establish new institutions only where they are genuinely needed."
"– Mr President, I shall begin by thanking all of the Members who have participated in these reports, in particular Mr Berend, who has made a great effort to create a majority in relation to the Solidarity Fund, with regard to which there are divergent interests amongst the Members. It has not therefore been an easy job to achieve a common position that makes it possible for this Parliament to act strongly and firmly in the coming negotiations."
"I would like briefly to stress certain important elements relating to natural disasters, since I believe that we must enhance the European Union’s measures for dealing with them, given that Community interventions have so far proven themselves to be insufficient."
"It is therefore reasonable for this Parliament to ask the Commission for a European strategy for combating natural disasters, and furthermore one that acknowledges the specific characteristics of those of a Mediterranean nature, such as droughts and forest fires."
"We must provide resources aimed at the victims of these disasters."
"Furthermore, the creation of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification are important initiatives that we must promote."
"I would like to stress the main innovations incorporated into the Solidarity Fund, which are going to make it possible to respond more quickly and effectively to disasters that the Member States cannot tackle alone."
"Together with natural disasters, admissibility is also extended to industrial disasters, terrorist attacks and emergency public health situations."
"We in this Parliament must be firm with regard to the proposal to lower the threshold for mobilising the Fund from EUR 3 000 to 1 000 million in damage caused. Thanks to this measure, it will be easier to use the Fund than it has been up to now."
"We cannot lose sight of the fact that it is necessary to determine which emergency operations are essential for the re-establishment of the infrastructures and equipment affected, as laid down in the Regulation."
"The provision of air and land resources and the administration of drinking water are clear examples of this, without forgetting the technical assistance that the Commission will facilitate."
"This instrument must respond quickly and effectively, with financial aid, to extreme situations of drought, fire and floods, without forgetting the victims of these disasters who need immediate help and assistance, and who Europe must not turn its back on."
"We are talking about the Solidarity Fund and we must not lose sight of this notion, because the European citizens expect us to respond to their demands."
"We are talking about a Fund that is a political instrument and, as such, it must resolve the difficulties faced by the areas affected and the people living in them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and also Commissioner Piebalgs for his presence in the House, while at the same time highlighting the importance of a joint debate on these issues, precisely so that we recognise that they are all closely related problems."
"The reason why we now find ourselves having this debate is because of a new development that constitutes an even more serious challenge to our territory: climate change due to global warming."
"There is therefore a need to identify long-term prevention measures, which can be summed up using the concept of integrated land conservation."
"Let me explain: since land is subjected to a variety of challenges, a form of conservation is needed that will address all of the aspects in question together: flood safety, by increasing the retention times of our rivers; geological safety, by draining slopes that are characterised by an unstable equilibrium and that can cause numerous casualties, as the recent events in Ischia serve to remind us; and fire safety, through forest-based activities aimed at reducing the risk of fire, without excluding, of course, the possibility of using biomass for energy purposes."
"There is also a need for short-term prevention, especially against floods, which should consist of a radar network that is capable of calculating precipitation and, thanks to river modelling, can guarantee a reaction time that is sufficient to protect the civil population and properties too."
"As Mr Beaupuy has already pointed out, this is what we must do at EU level: draw far more attention to the matter, because that is the only way in which we will actually be able to address these risks."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the solidarity fund."
"As the rapporteur has already said, it was the devastation wrought by the floods in 2002 that prompted this House, the Commission and the Council to set the Fund up."
"This is a second-generation regulation, and the clear and tight framework set down by the rapporteur makes it a really useful and flexible instrument that we can fully support."
"It is indeed the case that the fund is a reactive rather than a preventative instrument, but we believe it is irresponsible, when taking reactive action, to make the same mistakes that brought disaster in the first place."
"Take the example of the rivers that destroyed homes and property; never again must they be so tightly hemmed in; preventing them from being so is the only responsible way of using European taxpayers’ money."
"At the same time, I would like to point out that some Member States have a tendency to simply pocket the European funding and tell the public that it is they themselves that are putting the aid measures in place."
"That is something I regard as unacceptable; we know that the European Union has a credibility deficit, and it is by this instrument that the EU shows that it stands by ordinary people in a credible way."
"The source of aid funds must not be concealed; instead, the Commission must ensure that it is clearly affirmed and that every locality to which it goes receives a report stating what proportion is derived from European funds."
"Those are the main amendments that our group has tabled in the hope of further improving this report."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs; however I note with regret that we are talking about dealing with natural disasters as if they are a phenomenon which can be resolved purely by taking corrective action."
"We are overlooking the fact that the policy for dealing with natural disasters should not be confined solely to the formulation of internal policies to address and prevent them."
"It is equally important for the European Union to assume its share of the very heavy political responsibility for tolerating the causes of serious climate changes over recent decades."
"We need a stricter policy against European and any other industry that has contributed to them, inside or outside the Community borders, so that not only do they have to pay for the damage they have caused, but also – and much more importantly – they have to take measures of limitation and prevention in their future activities and bear the cost of such measures themselves."
"The European Union should also exercise its influence directly on the United States, which is completely ignoring and infringing the Kyoto Protocol and continuing its destructive action, which affects both European citizens and the citizens of the rest of the world."
"Foreign policy is therefore an equally important dimension."
"The geographical scope must be reviewed, in order to ensure support is extended to other countries beyond our immediate neighbours."
"This fund should apply to the various states involved, even to states who are not even candidate members, if they have been hit by an incident which has been caused by or originates in the geographical area of the Community or candidate states."
"In this way, other neighbouring countries will be entitled to solidarity from Europe, either through the fund or through the other mechanisms which apply to international cooperation."
"Our solidarity should not be confined to our borders."
"The fund regulation does not appear to take account of cumulative disasters or prolonged events during which a disaster develops gradually, such as drought."
"Cumulative disasters can also be addressed even if they took place when the fund did not exist, if they have visible consequences."
"Finally, I recognise the importance of the existence of this fund and the significant extension of its scope."
"This does not mean that the regulation, as it stands, satisfies us or that the policy for addressing natural disasters should be limited to it."
"We expect far more, not only as the European left, but also as European citizens."
"Mr President, the Solidarity Fund was introduced after devastating floods in the summer of 2002."
"An attempt is now being made to include terrorist attacks in the list of supposedly natural disasters covered by the fund."
"As usual, there is an ulterior motive at work here: it appears that disaster relief is to be politicised."
"Mr Berend suggests in his report, in the context of terrorist attacks, that the EU should be able to use the fund in such cases as a political signal of solidarity."
"Pandemics are also included, presumably to make the proposal acceptable to a public that is worried about things such as bird flu."
"It is all a long way from the original intention of the fund."
"Who, therefore, decides what qualifies for it?"
"Even Mr Berend says that it is incomprehensible that the Commission can make an arbitrary political assessment, thus calling into question the credentials of the institution that has produced this proposal."
"Once again, we see the confusion and incompetence of the EU in practice."
"Communities that have suffered disasters – natural or manmade – have their national governments to step in and assist."
"Even more likely to come to their aid, in cases of extreme disasters such as the tsunami, is the incredible generosity of the general public."
"The last thing they need is for that perpetual disaster – the EU – to turn up and make things worse!"
"Mr President, it is laudable that the European Parliament is addressing the issue of natural disasters and their impact on the environment and on farming, something I particularly appreciate."
"Although disasters on a larger scale occur on other continents, Europe is no stranger to them either."
"Forest fires frequently occur in southern Europe and floods are a regular occurrence in the central part of our continent."
"People affected by these disasters cannot be left without aid, and Member States should not be left alone to deal with the problem."
"It is laudable that, in Mr Capoulas Santos’ report, the problems in the agricultural sector are so clearly perceived, as it is a sector that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters."
"The problem of natural disasters has quite rightly been linked to another issue that could be described as a socio-economic disaster."
"It is something that threatens European farming in the context of what has been happening at the WTO, namely sudden market liberalisation and the abolition or weakening of protective mechanisms for European agricultural markets."
"Considering that market protection is being reduced, it is good that we at least have the prospect of aid in the event of a natural disaster."
"That is the greatest merit of the reports we are discussing."
"The draft under discussion is an important step on the road to building true European solidarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Capoulas Santos’ report seems comprehensive, and I regard the link between the recitals and the articles calling on the Community institutions to pay the utmost attention to the agroforestry sector as systematic."
"The report adequately summarises the way in which agroforestry production is closely connected with nature and, therefore, with its extremes and accidents."
"Articles 2, 3, 9 and 12 outline the measures needed to restore the balance."
"The common goal – as Mr Prodi also highlighted – is to design the Community strategy to cope with disasters, both by means of prevention measures and by planning the mechanisms for using the Solidarity Fund and the various State aid regimes."
"As regards the development policies, I am in favour of the requested increase in cofinancing amounts."
"I also welcome the articles highlighting the need for the activities aimed at raising awareness and training the parties involved to keep pace with research on the ground, and therefore documentation and mapping."
"Lastly, I agree with the proposals for directives in Article 25 and subsequent articles, which are aimed at making better use of the relevant Community instruments."
"– Mr President, at a time when Euroscepticism is intensifying in certain Member States, I believe that the European Union cannot remain indifferent towards the problem of natural disasters and indifferent towards the citizens affected by them."
"I think that its presence has added value in three sectors: prevention, immediate suppression and restoration."
"As far as prevention is concerned, a typical example is flooding from rivers which do not concern just one Member State, but often many more, including candidate states."
"In Greece, for example, we have precisely this problem with the River Evros, which flows through Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece."
"Consequently, we need a global strategy for addressing such problems."
"As far as immediate suppression is concerned, a typical example is fires, where solidarity is needed between the Member States, which is why I believe we need a European civil protection force, as proposed in the Galeote report, which deals with such matters."
"Thirdly, the Berend report deals with the problem of restoring damage through the Solidarity Fund which has existed – and rightly so – since 2002."
"However, I believe that we need to lower the thresholds for the eligibility of actions, as Mr Berend quite rightly proposes, and extend the scope to include technological disasters, such as major shipwrecks or 'flu epidemics, so that we can supply the populace with vaccines and address the matter adequately."
"The matters which we examine in the Berend report will proceed under the codecision procedure and, consequently, Parliament will fight to the end; however, on the matters addressed in the Galeote report, I think that Parliament should not lower the flag either."
"They are important to the citizens, they are matters which concern their daily lives and we need to fight to the end and put pressure on the Commission and the Council to proceed in the direction that we are calling for."
"– Mr President, the citizens affected by natural disasters, by nature itself, should not find themselves up against the indifference of national and Community governments or the absence of integrated support programmes."
"Most importantly, they cannot constitute a battle field, a field of political expediencies within the framework of the Member States."
"The policies of the states for materially addressing them have, in principle, two stages: prevention and response."
"Firstly I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs and to say that the report by Mr Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is balanced as regards the way in which the problems and proposals are formulated."
"However, I should like to highlight certain points: firstly, the question of paragraph 16, on the basis of which the creation of a public cofinanced insurance scheme and a reinsurance scheme within the framework of the CAP are proposed, and on paragraphs 17 and 19, on the basis of which the establishment of a new risk management instrument and a system to stabilise the prices and incomes of farmers affected by natural disasters are proposed."
"Above all, we must emphasise floods, a matter which exists – and we have experienced it – in Greece, in the Prefecture of Evros where, due to the absence of national measures, the area is affected every year."
"I should like to emphasise that the state needs national and cofinanced projects to protect citizens' property and must be denounced by all of us when it is unable to protect citizens' lives."
"Mr President, in September 2003, following the unprecedented forest fires of the summer that, as you will recall, affected Portugal and a whole host of regions in southern Europe, we took the floor in order to urge the European Union to equip itself with a permanent rapid reaction force."
"We appealed at that time, and we continue to appeal, in the four excellent reports presented to us, not only, I would say, for a little less national self-interest regarding civil protection, but also, as Mrs Estrella proposes in paragraphs 3 and 4, for example, of her report, for enhanced European cooperation regarding civil protection."
"Mr Wojciechowski broadly addressed this precise point."
"We need enhanced European cooperation for at least two good reasons."
"Firstly, the impact of climate change on the frequency of natural disasters, the torrential rain in northern and eastern Europe, drought and the fires that wreaked havoc last year are there to remind us of the crucial need to act, and to act quickly, on this matter."
"Secondly, the financial cost of these disasters is increasing, and our Member States are having more and more difficulty in meeting it by themselves."
"This is, of course, where the Solidarity Fund comes into its own, as it is designed to cover these emergency costs, such as the provision of water, energy and housing, or the repairing of basic infrastructure."
"I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank Mr Berend, who wants to make it easier immediately to access part of the payments and who also proposes to extend the benefit of the Fund to other types of disaster such as drought or even – as he mentioned – biological or chemical terrorist threats or attacks."
"The European Union will never, of course, succeed in preventing all natural disasters, but our duty is to help the Europeans who are hit by these tragedies and to coordinate our efforts more effectively in such cases."
"That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, we must also support the creation of a permanent European civil protection force, the famous ‘Green Helmets’."
"Let us also support the less controversial creation of an operations centre for the management of major crises."
"As you can see, Commissioner - and, in saying this, I am responding to a fear expressed by Mrs Haug, which I share - we are not calling here for more Europe, but for a better Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate all of the rapporteurs and, in particular, Mr Galeote and Mr Berend, on the precision of their reports and the quality of their listening skills."
"I am delighted to observe that an agreement has been concluded between our Parliament and the Commission so as to ensure that the scope of the next Solidarity Fund will from now on cover not only natural disasters, but also industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and major public health crises."
"I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for having supported my amendment, the aim of which is to specify that special attention will be paid to remote or isolated regions, such as island and outermost regions."
"This specification guarantees that, as from 2007, this Fund can potentially be used in the French Overseas Departments - even if they do not fully meet the general eligibility criteria - so that they can take advantage of emergency aid when a major crisis occurs."
"The own-initiative report by the Committee on Regional Development highlights the devastating effect of these disasters on the economy, employment, national and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism and rightly emphasises the need for effective measures regarding warnings, civil protection and aid for the regions and populations affected."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for having included my amendments concerning the outermost regions in the European strategy that he so earnestly desires, in the knowledge that, due to their geographical situation, those regions are exposed to natural risks of a specific character and intensity."
"Faced with the numerous threats that regularly place a strain on those regions, from tsunamis to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes to cyclones, and, from now on, the reactivation of mosquito-borne viral diseases, such as chikungunya in Réunion or dengue in Guyana, the overseas populations are awaiting a suitable response from Europe in terms of security, prevention and solidarity."
"Our Parliament is proving today that it has well and truly listened to them."
"Mr President, in my part of Europe floods are the most frequent natural disaster, but this report rightly covers other kinds of natural disasters as well."
"As far as floods are concerned, neighbouring states should act together, as floods, like pollution, do not stop at borders."
"The flood prevention programme, like flood risk maps, should be set up not just for national states but for whole river basins."
"Since the same kinds of disasters happen year after year, we have to make more effort in forecasting and prevention."
"The Solidarity Fund does not work in its present form."
"A new regulation is needed and it should help prevent environmental pollution as a consequence of natural disasters."
"We should not forget that environmental pollution is a very dangerous consequence of natural disasters in general."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the limited amount of time available to me, I would like to focus in particular on fires."
"As you know, a delegation visited Spain and Portugal and we were able to witness the scale of the ecological and human tragedy on the ground."
"We were able to hear directly from the sectors affected how the progressive abandonment of rural areas and of traditional activities creates a fertile environment for these disasters."
"We heard complaints from people accusing the competent administrations of abandoning the forests."
"For our part, we must condemn the lack of a genuine policy for fire prevention and the leniency of the penalties relating to the causing of fires."
"If we are to be absolutely thorough in our observations, we must point out that, unfortunately, we have witnessed a lack of coordination between the public administrations responsible, and that, in the case of Guadalajara, this has undoubtedly aggravated the disaster."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the victims of these disasters deserve their own chapter. In the case in question, they have felt ignored in their own region."
"From a democratic point of view, it is unacceptable that a committee of enquiry should be set up in Castilla-La Mancha but that the families of the victims should have been excluded."
"It has been the European Parliament that has had to come along and put that unspeakable political behaviour right."
"At the hearing held in Brussels to that end, therefore, a representative of the victims spoke and the European Parliament was able to hear their fair demands as the passive victims of a tragedy that has affected their lives."
"At least they have been heard."
"The courts will now decide whether anybody needs to take responsibility, in addition to any political responsibility, which will undoubtedly have to be taken."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Development for approving an amendment that I presented on the victims and I hope that plenary will vote in favour of it."
"That amendment urges the Commission to provide the resources necessary to alleviate the suffering and meet the material needs of all of the victims of natural disasters and their immediate families, by means of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund and other Community instruments."
"Finally, I am very much in favour of the reform of the Solidarity Fund and I hope that the Commission, following the mandate from this Parliament, will present a proposal for a directive for the prevention and management of fires within the European Union."
"– Mr President, the resolutions that we will approve this morning reflect the truth about the important work that Parliament has been doing on the natural disasters affecting the people and territories of the European Union."
"These texts, which represent Parliament’s opinion in this field, state what we have always expressed: the need to draw up and implement European policies for the prevention of those disasters, for immediate intervention capable of combating them effectively and for compensating for the damage caused."
"We hope that the Council and the Commission will now take Parliament’s proposals into account and respond accordingly, and we shall apply pressure in order to ensure that that happens."
"Nevertheless, the texts that we will approve also highlight the lies and agitation that, in my country specifically, have been demonstrated with regard to this action by the European Parliament, in certain cases and from certain political forces and sectors, even misleading people with regard to its very nature."
"Here today in this very debate we have heard untrue statements – half truths are always untrue – which are entirely contrary to Parliament’s opinion, which is expressed by means of the texts we are to approve and nothing more."
"There is an insistence on a partisan and self-interested approach to dealing with disasters and the pain they cause for so many people, in my region, Castilla-La Mancha, for example."
"This kind of behaviour speaks for itself, and perfectly illustrates the nature of the people indulging in it."
"I have no doubt that our citizens will be able to identify the culprits."
"We are sad about the effects of disasters that have struck us hard and we are sad that we have not dedicated enough time, energy and courage to rejecting this regrettable manipulation."
"Nevertheless, our confidence in our men and women, our commitment to the truth and our dedication to making the proposals that Parliament will approve today a reality will be our best legacy."
"That is what we have worked for, that is what we are still working on, and we will continue to do so."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that in a time of climate change the risk of natural disasters is growing year on year."
"The Union should of course address this situation, but how do we go about this?"
"I do not feel that the right response would be to create a single European policy to combat natural disasters, as proposed in one of the reports before us."
"I do not share the view that, once a problem is discovered, the reaction must be to regulate at Union level."
"As an advocate of consistent implementation of the subsidiarity principle, I take the opposite view, namely that changes to the law at Union level should only be carried out if the Member States are not able to resolve a given problem effectively by themselves."
"Natural disasters cannot be understood as homogeneous phenomena with single strategies and a single legal framework."
"Rather, the right way forward is to diversify."
"Floods are of a completely different nature to, say, fires or droughts."
"The formulation of a European strategy should be restricted to those types of natural disaster for which there can be added value attached to joint action at Union level."
"Otherwise, a joint strategy and directive would be meaningless and would be tantamount to excessive regulation without any positive consequences."
"I believe that the call to the Commission and the Council to table a proposal to harmonise compulsory measures aimed at punishing those who start fires is a glaring example of a violation of the subsidiarity principle."
"Just as fires do not usually have a European dimension, the Member States on their own should be responsible for punishing arsonists."
"On the other hand, I welcome the use of the proposed Galileo system for pre-empting and monitoring natural disasters across the Union, which is an important and positive aspect."
"As regards the Solidarity Fund Regulation, I particularly welcome the fact that financial aid will be made more accessible in the event of natural disasters, since instead of the current EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of GDP, billion-euro losses or 0.5% of GDP will be sufficient."
"Furthermore, where losses are lower, the Commission will, according to the proposal, be authorised to assess the situation."
"The Solidarity Fund will be able to help to repair any damage caused, which may for example help to improve the Union’s image in the eyes of Europe’s citizens."
"For this I thank all of the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, often affect regions in more than one Member State."
"That is why it would appear to be indispensable for the EU to take joint action either to prevent disasters or to mitigate their impact."
"The Solidarity Fund should therefore have a broader scope than it does at present."
"This would permit a faster response to crisis situations resulting from natural disasters as well as those caused by industrial or technological disasters, or by terrorist acts."
"Furthermore, it is also necessary to formulate a European strategy for dealing with the impact of natural disasters, in addition to appropriate Community prevention measures, the tailoring of Structural Funds spending to disaster prevention and closer coordination with other Community instruments."
"Once we have secured the necessary flexibility with regard to the distribution of available resources from various funds, we can then increase their efficiency in the event of a disaster."
"In addition to this, both individual Member States and the European Union institutions have to focus in particular on making the existing early warning systems more effective in order to minimise the impact of disasters."
"Even the largest Solidarity Fund imaginable, let alone the actual level of funding available over the next seven years, would not be able to cover all the costs incurred by European Union citizens each year as a result of the damage caused by unforeseen disasters and catastrophes."
"Mr President, I am from Ireland."
"These proposals relate to natural disasters, such as fires, droughts and floods."
"In Ireland, thankfully, we do not have forest fires or droughts; we have lots of rain – sometimes too much – but no major floods."
"Therefore, the Galeote Quecedo report is of little relevance to Ireland: it is heavily oriented towards the Mediterranean."
"I have no problem with that."
"If we are a European Community we must support each other, while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"European solidarity is the spirit that should underpin all our responses to initiatives such as the reports we are debating today."
"The Solidarity Fund is crucial."
"These reports are well drafted."
"In the Galeote Quecedo report the emphasis is on prevention, research and risk management."
"It also proposes identifying vulnerable areas so that preventive measures can be put in place well in advance."
"What is crucially important is that the environmental issue should be taken into consideration."
"Many of the environmental problems we are now encountering are caused by climate change and they are self-inflicted."
"Droughts and floods in particular are the direct result of environmental neglect and mismanagement: they are manmade."
"The EU is supposed to be leading the way in terms of environmental change, but at the same time the reality is that we are still destroying the world’s environment and we are doing it on a daily basis: greenhouse gas emission levels, for example, are being ignored by many EU countries, including, sadly, my own country."
"The sooner we, as a world community, wake up to this reality, the less will be the need to produce and to adopt the crisis-management measures that we are debating and, hopefully, adopting today."
"I congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Berend once again on a job well done."
"Mr President, the European Parliament sometimes deals with matters that really only concern an elite group, but it mainly handles issues that concern everyone."
"Natural disasters belong to the latter group."
"Frequent floods, such as those in the region I come from, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also the fires which are typical in the southern part of our continent, are real challenges for the international community, including the European Parliament."
"It is important in this context that, instead of increasing the funds set aside for such matters in the 2007-2013 budget, we should make them more flexible and remove the red tape which makes it impossible to use the funds in line with the types of disasters that occur."
"A good example is the situation in Poland in 1997, before enlargement, when my country was affected by major flooding and these funds were reallocated."
"Finally, we must make use of both the Structural Funds in order to minimise the effects of disasters, as well the European Solidarity Fund to help the victims of such disasters."
"As Mr Wojciechowski said a short time ago, this is an example of European solidarity."
". Mr President, we all recognise the importance of being prepared for disasters."
"We all wish for a better response to emergency situations."
"Significantly, we all recognise the need to work together."
"The resolutions passed by Parliament last year, these commendable reports and the Commission’s proposals all aim to achieve the same purpose."
"The call for increased cooperation in civil protection clearly reflects the Commission’s line of thought."
"To react effectively to a disaster, we need to have all our available resources in a state of ready deployment."
"When these do not suffice or are unavailable, the Commission needs to be empowered to find alternative means."
"As regards the agricultural aspects, I should like to emphasise that the Commission will do its utmost to optimise the use of existing instruments."
"It is clear that, at this stage, solutions or assistance for the agricultural or forestry sector in the event of natural disasters will have to come via existing instruments under the rural development and forest policies, state aid and the possibilities that exist under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"I would be more cautious as regards greater budgetary flexibility to ease the problems for the agricultural sector."
"We are tied to the funds available."
"I see major difficulties in using underspent budget lines for disaster relief purposes, but the Commission is prepared to analyse the feasibility of any suggestions."
"One difficulty, for example, is that we will only know with any certainty late in the budget year whether there is any margin left in the budget."
"Finally, it should be remembered that in the future we will be more likely to have to apply financial discipline, which will reduce the likelihood of underspent amounts."
"The Commission is also examining whether risk and crisis management instruments to support the agricultural sector could be a way forward."
"I am particularly grateful for the great expression of support the Commission’s proposal to adjust and improve the EU Solidarity Fund has received today."
"With the new fund, the EU will have an instrument at its disposal that allows it effectively to assist Member States and candidate countries whenever a crisis situation arises."
"An act of European solidarity can be counted on, no matter whether in response to a natural or another kind of serious disaster."
"This will be good not only for the European Union’s image but also, more importantly, for the Union, the Member States and acceding countries and their regions and, in particular, for the people affected by such disastrous events."
"The rapporteur and other honourable Members have spoken in favour of all major elements of the Commission proposal."
"This represents invaluable support in steering the proposal through the remaining steps of the legislative procedure."
"In the light of this far-reaching agreement between our two institutions, the Commission appeals to the Member States and the Council to rethink their position which, up to now, has certainly been much less favourable than that of this House."
"I note that you have proposed to grant Solidarity Fund assistance to candidate countries only if the same disaster also affects a Member State, even if this issue has not been discussed today."
"While I understand the underlying reason – i.e. not to financially overburden the fund – this proposal puts candidate countries in a worse position than they are currently in."
"At present, they are on an equal footing with Member States as regards eligibility for the fund."
"I would ask honourable Members to reflect again on whether politically this is what they really want."
"I also note that the use of the Solidarity Fund for preventative measures has been proposed."
"There can be no doubt that prevention is an extremely important part of a comprehensive policy in relation to disasters, a view the Commission fully supports."
"But it cannot be the role of the Solidarity Fund, which has been designed to bear some of the emergency costs incurred by Member States in dealing with disasters."
"At EU level, prevention and reconstruction measures can be supported by the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, or by agricultural funds."
"In fact, risk prevention is one of the European Rural Development Fund’s priorities for the period 2007-2013."
"In addition, rural development measures under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund can finance the restoration of agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and the introduction of appropriate prevention instruments, including risk prevention for forest fires."
"We need to strengthen all of the European Union’s existing instruments for the benefit of our environment and, more importantly, for the safety and wellbeing of our citizens."
"I agree with those Members who said that actions of solidarity and actions taken to prevent disasters and deal with their consequences will bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"These issues are extremely important in order to get the European citizens’ full support for our work."
"That is why I should like to thank again all the rapporteurs, Mr Capoulas Santos, Mr Galeote Quecedo, Mrs Estrela and Mr Berend, for their excellent reports that will strengthen European identity."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The recent floods in central and eastern European countries clearly showed that, more than ever, an effective and rapid solidarity-based response of the European Union to this type of major crisis is required. Due to the recurrence of such events, it is of the utmost importance that the solidarity instrument should allow for appropriate EU level response to major crises."
"As with the instruments that are currently available, it is extremely difficult to react properly, as illustrated by recent events."
"I warmly welcome our rapporteur’s approach, which argues that the Solidarity Fund must be adapted to new challenges and that there is potential for improvement in the way it is used."
"Major natural disasters within the Union can cause significant human, economic and environmental damages as well as it can affect more than just one European country."
"We must ensure that effective and targeted Community action is possible in areas where public opinion expects the Community to act."
"In this respect, we must also ensure that fund’s financial resources match its geographically and thematically enlarged scope of application."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I would ask that Amendment 7 to paragraph 1, in which a proposal has been made to add 'in particular in China, Belarus, Cuba and North Korea’, also include the words: ‘Colombia, Turkey and Tunisia’."
"Paragraph 1 would therefore become the following: ‘is concerned at the high number of journalists being convicted worldwide, in particular in China, Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Colombia, Turkey and Tunisia'."
". – Mr President, I should like to request a roll-call vote on the motion for a resolution."
". – This proposal was the result of a consensus and a combination of various contributions, and I should like to make an addendum, which has emerged from the consensus between the main political families in Parliament, in order to make this point more precise."
"I shall now read the addendum: ‘calls for this programme to be reflected tangibly in the individualisation of funding for appropriate actions aimed at preventing the risks of forest fires, either via the creation of a specific regulation with appropriate funding, or via the individualisation of a budgetary heading devoted to such actions within EAFRD or the LIFE+ draft regulation.’"
". – Mr President, I should like to request a roll-call vote on the final resolution."
"– Mr President, I am sorry, but you are speaking so quickly that the interpreters are translating too unclearly for us to understand."
"That concludes the vote."
". This report represents Parliament’s position on the Community’s strategic orientations for the cohesion policy for 2007-2013."
"As substitute for the Committee on Regional Development and permanent Member and shadow rapporteur on this report for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I have made firm calls for European economic growth and competitiveness to be decentralised and shifted away from the centre of the Community area to cover all regions, in particular those less wealthy."
"I also feel that these regions will only be able to make a decisive contribution towards creating sustainable employment and towards economic growth in the EU if the existing financial measures specially created to offset the negative effects on regional economies, the dispersion, small size and distance from the European mainland of the outermost regions are stepped up."
"In other words, I believe that a better and more effective Union requires better policies and more resources, with a view to sustainable development, which will in turn contribute towards economic and territorial cohesion, the primary objective of cohesion policy, as enshrined in the Treaties."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Krehl report."
". The Commission’s proposal on the Community’s strategic guidelines for 2007-2013 – on the basis of which the Member States will define their Structural Fund operational programmes – leaves no room for doubt as to the way in which the cohesion policy will be subordinate to the funding of the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ and to the interests of Europe’s captains of industry."
"Among other objectives, competitiveness, privatisation, reducing the public sector and the role of the State in the economy, public-private partnerships, support for the infrastructure of recently privatised sectors and flexibility of the labour market have become objectives of the pseudo-policy of ‘cohesion’."
"The consequences of the change of priority of the Funds – relegating ‘economic and social cohesion’ – is much more significant than it might first appear, even though some concerns do emerge as to whether this will be to the detriment of 'cohesion'."
"Originally, the report clearly rejected the idea that a minimum of 60% of the amounts of the Structural Fund for convergence regions (75% for the others) must be earmarked for funding the objectives of the ‘Lisbon Strategy', and that that criterion had been accepted via Parliament's adoption of the interinstitutional agreement."
"Hence our vote against."
". – As the elected representative of a French region that has been particularly affected by unemployment and relocations – the Nord-Pas de Calais – I clearly approve of the ambition stated in the report, which is one of supporting growth and employment."
"European regional policy, however, cannot fulfil those objectives."
"In 2000, the cantons of French Hainault already lost the structural funds allocated under Objective 1."
"Between 2007 and 2013, European regional expenditure will increase by 31% but, as a result of the unprepared-for enlargement, the proportion allocated to French regions will decrease further."
"Above all, European regional aid does not call into question the policy of the Europe of Brussels without borders, a policy which, while shackling our businesses and our farmers with increasingly binding directives, abandons them to unfettered competition from countries such as China, which practise a genuine form of social dumping."
"Almost one year ago, the people of France and the Netherlands said ‘No’ to this Europe of economic stagnation and social regression."
"Only another kind of Europe, founded on the sovereignty of its nations and on free cooperation, will enable our countries to benefit from genuine economic and social growth."
". I voted for the Krehl report on the Community strategic guidelines on the basis that it goes some way in attempting to inject a more social and environmental side to the Commission's proposed strategic guidelines and because it supports sound partnership between all parties and the strengthening of civil society."
"However, this vote should not imply acceptance of every word of the report."
"I have grave concerns about the inclusion in Ms. Krehl's report of a call for the Commission to promote the use of Public-Private Partnerships and about the absence of a specific rejection of earmarking and the thinking behind that approach."
". The idea of grouping resources and guidelines aimed at developing countries, countries in transition and industrialised countries into one single instrument, and the subsequent regulation thereof in accordance with their geopolitical and economic ‘roles’, is one that we find alarming."
"We are particularly concerned at the excessive prominence attached to the economic and business dimension that the rapporteur has sought to include in the regulation."
"What is more, ‘cooperation with international financial institutions’ is being proposed, demonstrating the support for the policy of structural reforms and adjustments promoted by those institutions. This is seen, for example, in the plundering of the natural resources and the wealth of many countries, in the exploitation of the work force, and in the privatisation of essential goods and services, such as water, health and social security."
"Attempts are being made, in a somewhat underhand manner, to export and intensify capitalist exploitation and the current neoliberal model under the cloak of ‘consolidation of the rule of law’ and ‘good governance’."
"The set of general priorities and principles being established gives us the greatest concern with regard to the set of ‘simplified regulations’ to follow."
". This report on Financing Development and Economic Cooperation actions by the EU has been the subject of much debate."
"As draftsman for the INTA Committee, I have worked with colleagues to ensure that the future shape of this instrument reflects the progressive gains made by the European Parliament over the years in terms of poverty alleviation and empowerment."
"I believe the Parliament was right to reject the original 2004 proposals which prevented the Parliament from establishing priorities and allocating funds to concrete programmes."
"We were also right to reject an open-ended instrument which would prevent Parliament from fully co-determining, on a regular basis, the objectives, scope and methods to be employed by the different instruments."
"I am glad to see we have achieved breakthroughs on review and expiry clauses to allow for better modifications and reporting."
"I firmly believe that, as the legislative authority, the European Parliament must continue to have a role both in the setting of priorities and through a call-back arrangement."
"Our citizens, who have mandated us to set policies and scrutinise the executive, expect no less."
". The practical outcome of the vote on this report is that there is indeed divergence between Parliament – in the guise of the Committee on Development – and the Commission on the financial instruments for the purposes of economic cooperation and development."
"It is therefore important for us to deal with what we believe to be the final outcome of this debate."
"Rather than the issue of whether there are one or two instruments, depending on whether the countries involved are industrialised or not, the important thing is that the EU ought to be aware of its financial limitations – all too evident in the next financial framework – and must therefore set out clear priorities and criteria for action."
"Given that it is impossible to attend to all situations, the priority regions and programmes need to be identified."
"This, rather than the number of programmes, is the crucial question."
"Furthermore, international cooperation is not an exercise in competition between possible world powers."
"More than anything, it must be a coherent expression of an external policy that respects values, principles and priorities."
"Mr President, I voted against Mr Berend’s report, in spite of the fact that it was an excellent report."
"I voted against it because, while we have extended the scope of the Solidarity Fund – which now includes everything from industrial disasters to terrorist attacks – we have narrowed down its regional scope, and in particular, we did not extend it to areas situated in potential Member States, in regions adjacent to the territory of current Member States."
"We have excluded from it the entire Western Balkan region, which I find very regrettable, because if the Danube floods, the Solidarity Fund will assist Romania and Hungary, but it will not assist Serbia and Vojvodina."
"This is entirely unacceptable and contrary to the permanent requirement of considering the neighbouring Western Balkan regions as potential Member States."
"This is a concrete situation where selfishness has already won."
". The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament abstained from the vote on the report on the EU’s Solidarity Fund because, although this Fund is an instrument of the highest importance for the policy of European solidarity, it did not undergo the necessary reforms to make it more effective and workable in terms of its objectives."
"On the other hand, despite the fact that the proposals aimed at including drought in the report before us were incorporated, some of which we had tabled, insufficient attention is paid to the phenomena of extreme drought and high temperatures, to the natural disasters that have lain waste to a number of European countries, especially in southern Europe. As they develop slowly, these phenomena are rarely perceptible over a short space of time."
"These proposals also state that the removal of the regional criterion from the scope of the regulation, only appearing as a public criterion, is clearly inadequate."
"This amendment was a waste of time in terms of the objective of recovering the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the affected areas, with the support of this instrument."
"We should like to emphasise the fact that, in spite of everything, some progress was made in relation to the doctrine, and that, accordingly, its particular character was acknowledged."
".I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Berend, on the proposal for a regulation, at first reading, of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund."
"It was becoming urgent to reform the Fund, which was created in 2002 and which has sole responsibility for dealing exclusively with natural disasters, in order to enlarge its scope, to simplify the way in which it is used from the point of view of emergencies and, lastly, to prevent misuse."
"Not only the major climate, industrial and technological changes, but also terrorism, health risks and so on were making it crucial for the European Union to provide its citizens and the Member States with access to a tool that is capable of coping with a disaster that would render a Member State, on its own, powerless."
"The reform of this Fund is a crucial safety element in today’s risk society."
"Some of the proposals that we tabled were unfortunately rejected, which were as follows:"
"- maintaining the eligibility of regional disasters in the Solidarity Fund; and"
"- the possibility of higher levels of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund – 75% rather than 50% of the total eligible costs – for ‘cohesion’ countries and for ‘convergence’ regions."
"I should like to say that the same European Parliament adopted on the same day, in the Quecedo report, the recital stating that ‘the EUSF should continue to enable action to be taken in the case of disasters which although significant do not achieve the minimum level required and that assistance may also be provided in special circumstances in cases where most of the population in a specific region has been affected by a disaster which will have a serious, long-term effect on their living conditions’."
"This contradiction between the content of the adopted resolutions – legislative and non-legislative – is highly significant."
"In other words, when it comes to stating good intentions – such as in the ‘Quecedo’ report – the majority in Parliament approves, but when it comes to making the execution and the funding of those intentions a reality – such as in the Berend report – the majority in Parliament turns its back, rejecting the regional dimension of the Fund and clearly benefiting the large countries, with their majority representation in Parliament."
". I abstained from the vote on the EU Solidarity Fund because I believe that the review of this instrument fell well short of what is urgently required if we are to address natural disasters that occur without prior warning and that have devastated Union territory."
"This review should have taken account of the serious nature of the situation, including the fires that have devastated entire forests, the droughts that have lasted for years and the torrential rains that have lain waste to whole regions in Europe."
"Yet what we have is a review that failed to take account of the reforms needed to increase the effectiveness and workability of the Fund."
"In spite of the timely inclusion of drought in this instrument, I feel that this phenomenon, which develops slowly and is barely perceptible in the short term, has not been given due prominence."
"Extreme drought has now affected France, Italy, Spain and Portugal."
"Lastly, by opting for public, as opposed to regional, criteria, the opportunity has been missed for this instrument to be given the means to carry out adequate recovery of the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the affected areas."
". I support this report."
"For too long the European Union has not paid sufficient attention to the need for a common energy policy."
"We have spent billions on security of food supplies via the CAP, yet nothing on security of energy supplies, leaving the prospect that Europe’s future would be, in a crisis, eating raw vegetables in the dark."
"Recent events in Russia – and elsewhere – show the importance of energy security."
"This must become a key element of our foreign policy in cooperation with the world’s other major consumers whether the United States or Japan, China or India."
"At the same time, we must stop tying our hands behind our backs."
"A tidal barrage across the Severn Estuary in my own constituency could supply up to 10% of Britain’s energy needs from a renewable green scheme with no CO2 emissions."
"Yet this scheme could be blocked with its enormous positive benefits by the fine print of the Habitats Directive leaving the unsafe alternative of nuclear power, which is infinitely more polluting to habitats across the world."
"We still have farms in the United Kingdom that have restrictions on stock movements left over from the Chernobyl disaster two decades ago!"
".Even if the basic idea of the Energy Community Treaty (ECT) appears sound, insofar as it is concerned with helping countries in south-east Europe, which are experiencing significant problems in that sphere, we believe that this Treaty has, inter alia, two major flaws."
"Firstly, the Treaties do not confer any powers regarding energy – and, still less, powers of equivalent significance – on the European Union, the Commission having made use of provisions on competition policy to claim such powers."
"Secondly, the ultimate aim of the ECT is to create an internal energy market between the European Union and nine other countries, even though, within the EU, this policy has already shown its limits: the gradual replacement of public monopolies by monopolies or quasi-monopolies, with an attack on public services; the rise in electricity prices even in those countries in which electricity generation depends very little on the price of oil; the risk of shortages in the short term because of a policy that gives priority to deregulation faced with the issue of security of supply; and so on."
"There were other ways of helping our European neighbours to meet their energy needs aside from creating a controversial institutional and political system within the European Union itself."
"As usual, however, the pro-European ideology has prevailed."
"Mr President, the EU’s human rights policy needs to be independent and bold, and we cannot turn our back on human rights violations for economic interests, for example."
"Human rights cannot be relinquished, and no price can be put on them."
"I have repeatedly expressed concern about the EU’s growing dependence on energy."
"That in itself is not a danger, but difficulties arise if the dependence is one-sided."
"EU dependence on Russian energy resources in particular seems to be growing."
"It is increasing to a level that could be regarded as worrying, both in terms of security of supply and, in particular, for political reasons."
"I would like us to have had the courage to say that there was a risk and draw the necessary conclusions."
".I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mr Howitt, on Human Rights in the World 2005 and the EU’s policy on the matter."
"At a time when the major victories in the field of human rights are being continually and insidiously undermined, the role of the European Union, as an emerging humanist civilisation, is vital."
"As the representative of EU citizens, the European Parliament has a great and immense responsibility where human rights are concerned."
"Firstly, within the Union itself by ensuring that the Member States ratify and implement the major international human rights treaties."
"Secondly, the Union, as an area of peace and democracy, must remain the guarantor for human rights in the world by ensuring that our declarations based on our values are followed through in all European policies."
". In supporting this report, I am keenly aware that the EU stands accused of paying lip service to human rights, ignoring abuses by major trading partners, arguing for UN reforms it will not implement, and ignoring international legal obligations at home whilst preaching them abroad."
"It is hypocrisy that Colombia gets trade advantages for workers' rights when it has the world's highest rate of murders of trade unionists and that EU officials in Zimbabwe are ignorant of key EU human rights guidelines."
"It is even worse that EU governments fail to practice what they preach."
"Nine countries, including Ireland, Germany and Portugal, refuse to sign the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture."
"Eleven countries have not signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings."
"Seven countries are considering opt-outs from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court."
"I fully support the conclusions by my colleague Richard Howitt and his call for a unified EU human rights report identifying an annual list of countries of particular concern, a sliding scale of sanctions against abuser countries, removing the national veto for their agreement, implementing the human rights and democracy clause in the EU's international agreements and introducing human rights impact assessments for EU actions abroad."
"The promotion of human rights is an extremely important issue of which account should be taken in all policy areas."
"We believe that human rights are universal and that we should fight to ensure that they are respected in all countries."
"However, the European Parliament is using this report to promote the EU’s positions."
"We are opposed to quite a few features of the report, for example those wordings designed to increase the power of the European Parliament, and we have therefore voted against the report."
"Obviously, we condemn all human rights violations."
"This report contains some points with which we agree – such as the need to safeguard the fundamental rights of the Sahrawi people and to ensure a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara based on the Sahrawi people’s right to self-determination, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, especially Resolution 1495. Yet in common with previous years, this report has been little more than an exercise in hypocrisy, a weapon of pressure and political interference, in which so-called ‘friendly’ countries are protected and the ‘others’, those that the USA and EU have designated as a target, are criticised."
"This is an exercise with which we can have no truck."
"Consequently, the majority in Parliament once again refuses to condemn the serious violations of human rights committed in Iraq, fails to note that the war in Iraq is illegal and runs counter to international law and the United Nations Charter, and omits to call on the UN to open up a detailed inquiry into the use of banned weapons, such as white phosphorous during the capture of Fallujah, and of ‘collective punishment’ against the Iraqi people."
"The majority in Parliament has also not issued a single word of condemnation towards the Israeli Government for the occupation and oppression of Palestine."
".This report will no more improve the worldwide human rights situation than previous reports on the same subject did."
"Its real aim, however, is something different."
"It is aimed at increasing the powers of the Europe of Brussels regarding foreign policy."
"In speaking of ‘the powerful impact the EU can have on human rights when it speaks with one voice’, particularly at the UN, and in drafting proposals designed to increase this ‘impact', Mr Howitt's report is in keeping with the idea that consists in gradually depriving the Member States of their sovereignty regarding foreign policy, to the advantage of the European institutions."
"That is the ambition of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the CFSP, which consists, inter alia, in stripping France of its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council."
"On the other hand, Article 97, which requires European governments to be even more tolerant than at present with regard to non-European immigration, jeopardises the human rights situation in our very own countries."
"In fact, the areas of lawlessness that are multiplying in our urban areas are one of the consequences of the uncontrolled immigration to which our nations have been subjected for 30 years."
". I voted for my colleague Richard Howitt's report on Human Rights in the World."
"In particular, I voted in favour of Amendment 12 on the violation of human rights in the Western Sahara, which was a free vote."
". – It is unfortunate that, when it voted today, this House rejected a motion from my Group which condemns the grave human rights abuses in Iraq and recalls ‘that the war in Iraq is illegal and violates both international law and the Charter of the United Nations’."
"A majority in this House, voting by roll-call, was also found to reject the demand that the UN should mount an investigation ‘into the human rights violations committed by the international coalition, particularly as regards the use of prohibited weapons such as white phosphorus in the attack on Fallujah and the collective punishments inflicted on the Iraqi population, which are banned by international agreements’."
"This vote may be taken as emblematic of the double standards to be found in the human rights report."
"Human rights violations in states with which the European Union is on friendly terms are subject to insufficient criticism or to none whatever."
"One consequence of this is that no reference is made to the ongoing offences against human rights in Turkey."
"Restrictions imposed around the world on the right to refuse to do military service are simply whitewashed away, and, if one were to go by the human rights report, neither NATO nor EU Member States are waging war or participating in warfare at all."
"It was heartening, though, to note the adoption of a motion on the Western Sahara in which the Group of the Left denounced ‘the continued violations of the human rights of Saharaui population’ and called for ‘the protection of the Saharaui people’."
". The extraordinary role played by the EU as a whole, and by the Member States individually, in promoting human rights on the world stage is something in which, as Europeans and as citizens of the world, we should all take pride."
"Let us face facts – the picture is on the whole a positive one."
"Traditionally, Parliament used to publish every year what bordered on a list of violations of human rights around the world, and ultimately failed in its objective to monitor the activities of the Community institutions."
"Indeed, without prejudice to constant concern with human rights violations, Parliament’s main obligation is to assess the usefulness of our endeavours in combating these violations."
"Accordingly, I welcome this new approach and believe that it will only be truly effective when it is accompanied by a genuine assessment of the impact of EU human rights actions at international level, in the short, medium and long term."
"The impact of our actions is a determining factor in whether or not those actions are worthwhile."
"In politics, good intentions are not only inadequate, they are also a waste."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues support the highest standards of human rights in the world."
"However, the issue of an absolute ban on the death sentence remains a conscience based issue for individual MEPs."
"Nevertheless, we all condemn the inappropriate and excessive use of the death penalty in countries such as China and Iran."
"We believe that issues of international human rights violations should not be dealt with by the International Criminal Court but should be convened by UN ad hoc Tribunals."
"– The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament on ‘human rights in the world’ cynically expresses the imperialist policy of the ΕU."
"It endeavours to present it like a global trustee and defender of human rights, an 'exporter' of democracy to the world."
"The EU's respect for and devotion to human rights and democracy was experienced at first hand by the people of former Yugoslavia, by Afghanistan, by Iraq, by Palestine and so on, who have been drenched in blood by the imperialists of the ΕU, the USA and ΝΑΤΟ, in the name of human rights."
"It uses human rights and their selective, so-called protection as a pretext which gives it the right to intervene in every corner of the planet."
"Through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (ΕΙDHR) it finances 'coloured revolutions' and all sorts of submissive NGOs in order to coerce and undermine governments of countries which do not comply with its strategic aims."
"The references in the report to poverty, the environment, employment rights and so forth are an insult to the peoples groaning beneath imperialist sovereignty and capitalist exploitation."
"The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report, denouncing the insulting hypocrisy of the ΕU and the selective use of human rights as a means of imperialist pressure and even of unleashing wars against peoples."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome much of what is contained in this report."
"We support the emphasis on qualitative value for money, the proposals on cost-benefit studies and agree that the Commission should be providing greater vision on economic reform."
"There are some areas of this report that we are unable to support, such as the CFSP text and the references to the new freedom, security and justice agenda."
"These are areas where the Conservative Party has had a long-standing opposition to moving to the Community method."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of Mr Elles’s report on the 2007 budget: the Commission’s report on the Annual Policy Strategy."
"We are, however, critical of the report’s assertion that setting up what is known as the Globalisation Fund may constitute important progress for the EU."
"Moreover, we reject the report’s proposal that, in the long run, the EU should have its own resources rather than rely on contributions by the Member States."
"Our basic view is that it must be for the Member States to decide what resources the Union has at its disposal."
"Any form of EU tax would be a departure from this principle."
". This report concerns the budgetary guidelines for 2007, the first of the financial framework 2007-2013, and is hindered by the most worrying aspects of the agreement on the financial perspective."
"Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, the guidelines for 2007 give tangible form, in budgetary terms, to the EU’s policies of capitalist competition, liberalisation, interference, militarisation and securitarianism."
"Unsurprisingly, therefore, the majority in Parliament rejected the observation that ‘the Lisbon Strategy has proved itself to be a failure as regards the implementation of its stated objectives of 3% average economic growth and full employment via the creation of 20 million jobs’."
"It has also rejected the evidence that this ‘Strategy’ is ‘the main instrument of promoting the liberalisation and privatisation of public services, the flexibility and adaptability of the labour markets, lower salaries and the opening to private interests of the core provision of social security, including pensions and health’."
"Even in the management of Community programmes and agencies, the policy of lowest cost (who would have thought it?), whereby services are 'outsourced' and 'hired out’, has been pursued with such zeal that even entities that support the EU’s propaganda effort run the risk of being closed or privatised."
". I welcome this report which addresses the Commission's strategic priorities for 2007."
"Establishing clear priorities has become increasingly important in the case of the external actions budget heading given the cuts amounting to around 20% in funds committed."
"More than ever the trade dimension continues to impact on domestic political priorities in the budget."
"If the Doha Round is successfully concluded, the conditional agreement on the definitive elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies by 2013 would translate into incremental yearly EC budget savings that are estimated to be around EUR 3 500-4 000 million per year, depending on internal and world market prices, as of 2013."
"As rapporteur for a forthcoming report on trade-related assistance and draftsman for the annual strategic priorities, I have called for greater transparency in the funding of the so-called 'Barroso' billion, committed to support the trading capacity of developing countries."
"This pledge should not involve cosmetic re-labelling of funds given to infrastructure."
"The Commission must commit to producing an annual report on aid for trade to enable Parliament to scrutinise these funds and assure that they are truly additional."
". The situation described in this report demonstrates how all of the shortcomings relating to the adoption of the financial perspective 2007-2013 have brought increasing, unnecessary difficulties for the functioning of the EU."
"First and foremost, the glaring discrepancy between the Union’s budget and its increasing responsibilities can only have detrimental consequences for the EU's capacity to take action, and in turn for its image among the citizens."
"On the other hand, there can be no doubt that, on account of the delays that have occurred, this is a document that does not give a quantitative expression of priorities."
"Without values, it is difficult to appreciate the extent to which the proposed options are to be pursued."
"This presents us with a twofold difficulty."
"In light of the circumstances, it was inevitable that this would be the case."
"Consequently, what remains is for us to draw the necessary lessons from this situation for the future, the main one being that we must first agree on the major objectives and the Union’s designs, and which policies we should be pursuing whereby we shall be able, in good time, to obtain an agreement as to the funds that they need."
"The report proposes an insurance scheme for farmers, jointly financed by farmers, the Member States and the EU within the framework of the common agricultural policy."
"That is something about which we have our doubts."
"We Swedish Social Democrats are opposed to new instruments and more funding for the agricultural sector."
"Given the heavy funding of the EU’s common agricultural policy from the budget, the sector itself should be able to finance aid to farmers hit by natural disasters."
"Moreover, there is no scope in the budget for increased appropriations."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"In an EU with 25 Member States, the report focuses too much on the problems in the Mediterranean area of Europe."
"Within the EU, there is a host of problems resulting from freaks of nature, such as floods in central Europe and heavy storms and frost in northern Europe, yet it is forest fires in southern Europe that are the problem constantly addressed by the European Parliament as one that needs to be remedied through the EU."
"We believe, however, that it is exclusively the Member States affected that are responsible for ensuring that measures are taken in this area."
"The fact is that, if the Member States are relieved of responsibility for taking such measures and for putting preventive systems in place to forestall disasters of this type, the risks will increase."
"In insurance theory, this is called ‘moral hazard’."
"The report lists a host of different measures at EU level, all with attendant costs requiring significant increases in the budget."
"We are opposed to a specific EU programme for forest protection because we believe that it is the Member States that should assume responsibility for protecting forests."
"The report’s idea of awareness campaigns at EU level with a view to promoting a change of attitude towards the use of fire (paragraph 23) is one of several examples of the way in which the wealth of ideas that emerged while the report was being prepared has completely lost touch with reality."
"We have therefore voted against the report."
"– Agricultural and forestry production are closely bound up with nature and constantly exposed to it."
"Consequently, there needs to be a compensation fund, especially for small- and medium-sized holdings which, unless they receive compensation from the ΕU and the state, cannot continue their activities because, apart from the consequences of the anti-farming policy of the ΕU, they have to deal with climatic dangers, as in my country, in the areas of Thrace and Thessalia, where their production has been destroyed by floods and they face an acute problem of survival."
"Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the fact that the frequency of unforeseen natural phenomena and the risk of the viability of farmers is a consequence of the predatory plundering of natural wealth and commercialisation of the environment, a policy which constitutes the cause and which, unfortunately, is being promoted by the ΕU with tragic consequences."
"If this philosophy continues of not addressing the cause and of fire-fighting by giving compensation, then the consequences of the fatal climatic phenomena will soon be so great that it will be impossible to satisfy the people affected with compensation, even if it accounts for a large sum in Community and national funds."
"A review of this policy is therefore the best way of preventing and protecting against natural disasters."
". As with the Estrela report, I do not believe that there is practical or financial justification for creating an agency on drought and floods."
"Other forms of environmental action on floods are urgently required."
". Following the natural disasters across large parts of Europe, we have seen the inadequacy of the Solidarity Fund since it was set up in 2002, given the unpredictable nature of these phenomena."
"The vulnerability of farming to the climate has been shown in stark relief in recent years by cases of extreme drought in Portugal, Spain, Italy and France."
"In light of these situations, and the need to prevent future recurrences, the rapporteur has suggested a fresh approach to improving protection for communities and farmers from the devastating impact."
"I therefore feel it is vitally important to set up a disaster management system, a risk management system and a stabilisation support system following such crises."
"Lastly, training for prevention is a further crucial measure in such situations."
"As part of the civil protection measures, the Forest Focus programme and the rural development programmes, we have a framework in place for the necessary measures for raising awareness among communities and prevention training and information for those responsible for crisis management in these situations."
"All measures – both those already in existence and those proposed here – need to be available."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the Capoulas Santos report."
"Mr President, even though this does not come under the explanations of vote, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank you for the expertise you have demonstrated in presiding over the House."
"You will have noticed that many of us support you in that regard."
"It was with great conviction that I voted in favour of the Galeote Quecedo report, particularly Articles 18 and 32."
"Article 18 refers to best practices, by maintaining that the experience built up both at national and at regional and local levels should be disseminated and used in other countries."
"In that connection, I believe that we could genuinely help other countries a great deal, through volunteering, for instance, as done by fire fighters, whose work can be carried out in many other regions and countries."
"I sincerely hope, therefore, that we will proceed along those lines."
"Article 32, on the other hand, refers to the removal of administrative barriers, particularly for border regions, which have specific needs."
"I completely agree with this."
". In view of the fact that the report acknowledges the following issues:"
"1 – The ‘specific nature of natural disasters occurring in the Mediterranean’;"
"2 – The necessary adaptation of Community instruments on prevention, research and risk management, civil protection and solidarity;"
"3 – The need to carry out an exhaustive survey of the locations which are most vulnerable to fires and to prolonged droughts;"
"4 – The need to adapt future strategies to outlying and outermost regions, and in the least favoured regions concerned by the ‘convergence’ objective."
"5 – the need to set up a forest fire protection programme, with a view to developing a more prominent and better integrated pan-European culture of forest fire risk prevention and management, in order to complement current national instruments;"
"6 – The need to set up a European monitoring centre for drought and desertification integrated into the activities of the seventh framework research programme (2007-2013);"
"7 – the need to warn Member States as to the importance of carrying out their rural development plans, and of including within those plans proposals aimed at resolving demographic decline and the low levels of retraining the work force, the abandonment, reforestation and excessive fragmentation of these areas,"
"I voted in favour of this report."
". We warmly welcome the fact that some of the proposals we tabled were adopted, which were as follows:"
"- protecting the scope of the Solidarity Fund, which should continue to cover intervention in the case of disasters which are, though significant, under the damage threshold laid down but embody severe and lasting repercussions on the living conditions of the inhabitants of a given region, with the possibility of extraordinary assistance existing in such cases;"
"- the existence of a wide network of agricultural SMEs and an agricultural policy promoting more sustainable production methods, notably as regards water and soil use, is a vital precondition for fighting the effects of drought and forest fires;"
"- believes it is essential, in the context of the new financial framework for 2007-2013, to establish a Community programme for protection against forest fires, with a view to promoting awareness campaigns and risk prevention and management measures in respect of forest fires, suitably funded and complementing agricultural and structural policy, taking account of the specific nature of forests in the Mediterranean."
"We therefore voted in favour of the report, although we regret the fact that other proposals that we tabled were not adopted, which would have made the report more complete in terms of policies aimed at supporting farmers affected by disasters."
". The following points were adopted in plenary:"
"1 – The acknowledgement of the specific nature of natural disasters occurring in the Mediterranean;"
"2."
"The establishment of a Community forest fire protection programme;"
"3."
"The assessment of the possibility of creating a farming disaster fund;"
"4."
"Maintaining the eligibility of regional disasters in the Solidarity Fund;"
"5."
"Adapting the Solidarity Fund, in terms of time limits and eligible actions, in order to enable it to deal with the specific nature of natural disasters, such as drought and forest fire;"
"6."
"Special attention to the least favoured regions in the event of natural disasters."
"It should be noted that, on the basis of proposals by Members from central and northern European Member States, the inclusion of the specific nature of the Mediterranean forest, which we had previously managed to ensure, has been watered down, in spite of our vote against."
"This is another example of a situation in which those in control call the shots; that is to say that in this ‘federalist’ Parliament, the weighting of Members from each country, with central and northern European MEPs the dominant force, is a decisive factor in undermining the interests of Mediterranean countries, in which more than 90% of forest fires take place."
". I welcome the Estrela report."
"Although it does not introduce any technical innovations in terms of natural disaster management and prevention, it does offer an important survey of the possibilities and the knowledge currently available."
"I warmly welcome the proposals to create directives on the prevention and management of fires and drought, which I believe to be an extremely important factor in forward planning and a more efficient response to natural disasters."
"I also welcome the proposal to set up a European Monitoring Centre on drought, desertification, floods and other effects of climate change, which should play a vital role in studying and coordinating best practice as regards civil protection."
"The report mainly relates to the problem of forest fires and drought, and refers occasionally to floods, which means that it is of crucial importance to Portugal and the other Mediterranean countries."
". We believe it is crucial that a Community programme to protect forests from the scourge of fires should be created in the next financial framework 2007-2013, with the appropriate funding, with the aim of fostering awareness raising activities, and fire risk prevention and management."
"This programme should be given adequate funding, should go hand in hand with farming and structural policy, and should take account of the specific character of Mediterranean forests."
"We therefore believe that the Solidarity Fund should attach special prominence to time limits and eligible actions, and to natural disasters specific to the Mediterranean, including drought and forest fires."
"On the other hand, Solidarity Fund intervention must be possible even when disasters, however serious, do not reach the required level, and that aid should be provided in exceptional circumstances when the majority of the population in a region has suffered from a disaster with serious and lasting impact on their living conditions;"
"Although the report does not address all of these questions, we voted for it, because it is a positive, albeit inadequate contribution."
"In her report, the rapporteur discusses natural disasters from an environmental perspective."
"It is proposed, for example, that a European observatory be established."
"We do believe that cross-border environmental problems should be dealt with at EU level."
"It is, however, extremely doubtful whether natural disasters are cross-border in character."
"The issue of rivers bursting their banks may be something that can be resolved at EU level, but there is already a rivers directive that regulates how this type of problem might be tackled."
"Where fires are concerned, we believe that it is up to each Member State to create the structures required for preventing these and the damage they cause."
"If the EU were to cough up every time a natural disaster occurred, there would naturally be fewer incentives to do preventive work."
"This would lead to further and more serious disasters occurring in the future, something that would obviously be very harmful to the environment and expensive for taxpayers."
"The rapporteur wants the EU to call on the Member States to establish national forest funds for the prevention of natural disasters."
"That is something we believe to be an issue for the Member States, which should therefore decide for themselves whether or not it is necessary to do this."
"For the aforesaid reasons, we have voted against the report in today’s vote."
". I voted for the Estrela report on the environmental aspects of natural disasters, but against the creation of a special agency on drought and floods."
"I believe there is no justification for creating such an agency and no budget either."
". Natural disasters are crises that may strike at any given moment, and without prior warning."
"For this reason, prevention measures must be taken."
"Disasters of this nature that my country and other EU Member States have suffered lead me to join the rapporteur in calling for effective prevention measures, such as technological research and development and the establishment of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification."
"This kind of phenomenon has a serious impact on the lives of the communities affected for an indefinite period."
"It is for this reason that the Solidarity Fund should include extreme drought in its instruments, and should take account of the necessary civil protection aspects."
"In this regard, it is vital to raise awareness among the communities involved. Furthermore, the Member States must show mutual solidarity in order to act and to combat these events and the serious repercussions that they engender in the living conditions of the people affected, if necessary with joint resources."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Estrela report."
".The relentless quest for all forms of prevention and, to that end, the carrying out of technological research and development activities, public awareness raising, the coordination of emergency assistance and the deployment of a civilian force in the event of a natural disaster are crucial elements that we must provide for and put in place as soon as possible."
"On the other hand, I am opposed to any creation of an observatory."
"That structure is in fact likely to cost a great deal of money for little reward."
"Above all, the amount of money spent on funding to ensure that this observatory could operate would be cut from the crucial aid for activities on the ground."
"It is, moreover, always very easy to create observatories, but virtually impossible to do away with them."
"To my regret, I am unable to go along with the Berend and Galeote reports, although I would emphasise that this is not out of any opposition to mutual solidarity between Member States when disasters strike."
"What both reports have in common is that they rely heavily on an EU framework with the primary intention of preventing (natural) disasters, responding to them and dealing with them."
"This might be justified if all Member States were facing the same problem to a greater or lesser degree, but that is far from being the case, and so any action by the EU ought to be restricted to supplementary operations that the Member States themselves are unable to support."
"Better use is made of the EU whenever its initiatives are concentrated on disasters affecting more than one Member State and that are either not capable of being prevented or of being insured against, and the consequences of which are beyond the capacities of Member States to manage."
"I would therefore have been able to support a limited additional instrument of which use could be made where circumstances justified it."
"These proposals do, nevertheless and very rightly, remind us of the importance of preventative action."
"It is my hope and expectation that both the Member States and the EU will use all means at their disposal to minimise the risks of a disaster occurring."
"After all, prevention is always better than cure."
"The reports propose that a number of funds be established and that more use be made of Structural Funds and the Solidarity Fund to finance EU measures designed to prevent natural disasters and to tackle their consequences."
"They also propose that a European monitoring centre for drought and desertification, a European Fire or Forest Fund and a disaster fund be established within the framework of the common agricultural policy and that intensive information campaigns on the sustainable use of water be conducted."
"It is also proposed that the scope of the European Solidarity Fund be extended to cover the consequences of public health crises, terrorist attacks and technological disasters."
"The June List welcomes international solidarity when a country is hit by disasters."
"The EU must not, however, use these disasters as an argument for extending its power and developing a common policy in this area or for establishing further institutions."
"If the Member States are relieved of responsibility for taking measures and for putting systems in place to prevent disasters of this type, the risks will increase."
"In insurance theory, this is called ‘moral hazard’."
"We have therefore voted against both reports."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are discussing the coordination of solutions to natural disasters and cooperation on such matters."
"I am naturally happy that the report proposes an information and education campaign and the prevention of such events."
"I am sure that help will be targeted mainly at areas of high risk, and that it is necessary to protect the environment and safeguard natural resources."
"I am convinced that such cooperation should be on a voluntary basis, and I am in favour of individual countries endeavouring to make major improvements to the coordination and communication of information."
"However, I strongly believe that contributions to individual agencies and to the setting up of European units should be made on a voluntary basis and should not be mandatory."
"Consequently, I did not support the adoption of point 31 and I abstained from the vote on this report."
"– Mr President, that we in Europe must stand together in contending against the adverse consequences of natural disasters is not a matter of doubt, and for that the regions affected rely on the solidarity of neighbouring Member States;"
"European programmes are also needed to help in crisis situations."
"The report provides a whole range of examples of how to go about this."
"To European aid in a crisis, then, one has to say ‘yes’, but the prevention of disasters is primarily a responsibility for the Member States, and it is a responsibility from which we should not discharge them by passing it on to the European level; the same is true when it comes to organising the response to crisis situations, otherwise known as ‘European civil protection’."
"There is no need for new powers in respect of civil protection and disaster prevention; they would result in twin-tracking and wasted money in administrative systems."
"That neighbouring states within Europe should help each other when disaster strikes is, then, perfectly obvious; what Europe can do is to help with programmes promoting improved coordination and alleviating material need."
"New European powers, though, would do more harm than good, and these reports do not alter the fact that this is still something we need to talk about."
"– Mr President, would you be willing to take note of the fact that I missed a number of roll-call votes yesterday as a result of the malfunctioning of the bell on my floor?"
"Mr President, I had the same problem yesterday as Mrs De Vits and I wanted to highlight it."
"The bell does not work properly on our floor, and, when I arrived at the Chamber to take part in the vote, ten minutes late, the bulk of the roll-call votes had taken place."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Nepal(1)."
". – Mr President, following weeks of massive demonstrations, with hundreds injured and even killed, King Gynanendra, at the beginning of May, at last caved in and surrendered the power of which he had taken possession in February 2005."
"His imposition of a state of emergency had been justified on the basis that the authorities had failed to defeat the Maoists in battle."
"What has been going on in Nepal over recent months has been quite unparalleled."
"Having visited it over a dozen times, I know this state in the Himalayas very well."
"Its people had spent years enduring a terror regime with arbitrary arrests, and they vented their fury in active resistance, which will, in due course, make a return to democracy possible."
"A new multi-party coalition under a very experienced prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, commenced face-to-face negotiations with the rebels."
"It is planned that a constitutional assembly be summoned to decide what form the state should take in future, and the Maoists have declared themselves willing to accept its decision."
"I believe it to be particularly important that they should now also lay down their weapons and cease from standing in the way of the country’s democratic development."
"I hope that the new coalition will be able to muster all its forces in order to maintain public safety on a lasting basis."
"Political detainees, human rights activists, students and journalists must be set at liberty."
"The tens of thousands who have been sent into exile must at last be allowed back into their homeland without needing to fear for their lives."
"I now expect the Tibetan refugee centre and the Dalai Lama’s office in Kathmandu to be reopened."
"We Europeans should show our solidarity by sending a group of MEPs to Nepal as soon as possible."
"Let us encourage those who are involved in the re-establishment of democracy, both the non-governmental organisations and the ordinary public, who will need not only technical and financial help from outside – important though that is – but also stability and peace at home."
"Let us hope, too, that tourism – the main source of income for a country that is still a fascinating one – will flourish once more: Namaste!"
". Mr President, of course we think that Nepal is a distant country and that these matters are not always very easy for us to understand."
"However, I must say that some things simply do stand out."
"Before I entered the Chamber, a journalist asked me if I thought that the European Union should become involved in reinstating democracy in the world."
"I said that the European Union obviously has limited powers and that we must always support certain values."
"We are well aware that the situation in Nepal is unique."
"It is not merely a simple choice, based on the fact that the strong rule of a king has exceeded the mandate granted to the latter by Nepalese law, and as a consequence has brought with it serious problems for many Nepalese citizens."
"It is also a problem of the Maoist guerrillas in Nepal."
"Let us remember that we must be very careful when deciding who to support in Nepal."
"It would be a great tragedy for the country if, after the king is removed from dictatorial power which he wilfully claimed and after a short transitional period of democracy, Maoist tyranny should ensue."
"We are well aware that revolutionary Communists have frequently acted in such a fashion: they fought against a strong monarchy under the banner of democracy and then destroyed democracy in order to build their tyrannical governments."
"We must be very careful and, whilst supporting democratic change, demand respect for minorities and the opening of a centre for refugees from Tibet, which is something that was mentioned by Mr Mann."
"At the same time, we must carefully monitor the situation so that we can prevent one bad solution becoming another, even worse, solution."
"That will be the task of the European Union."
". – Mr President, all the indications are that things in Nepal are taking a turn for the better."
"It is not acceptable that, in any country, wherever in the world, all power should be in the hands of one person, as was, I think, formerly the case with the King of Nepal."
"There is certainly no doubt that we, here in this Chamber, at the heart of European democracy, should support by all means available the developments towards democracy in Nepal."
"I think that the king has acted reasonably in calling a constitutional assembly in order to endow Nepal with a good new constitution."
"It strikes me as particularly important that every group, whether currently outside Nepal or present within it, should be able to regard the electoral system as representative and inclusive, for, in Nepal too, representative democracy must prevail."
"The great question is: what can Europe do about it at this stage?"
"If it is thought to be of value in terms of the development of democracy, and if the parties and the prime minister think it useful, that a delegation from this House should go to Nepal in order to give support at this time of change, then that – it goes without saying – is what we must do."
"I also believe that the European Union should become actively involved, at a high level, in the negotiations on the new constitution."
"It may well be that we can make some contribution, and I am in agreement with the wording of the resolution according to which we should do this together with the other major powers, not least the United States and India."
"More time will be needed to enable the wounds from the past to heal, but we must use all means available, including money and financial resources, in an attempt to help them do that as soon as possible."
". Mr President, I warmly welcome the long overdue return to democratic rule in Nepal."
"The SAARC delegation and I, as its chairman, have been concerned since the imposition of direct rule by the King, and have worked with the Troika to promote a return to democracy."
"Finally this has taken place."
"The new government faces many challenges, including limiting the King’s power and bringing the military under democratic control."
"I therefore welcome the fact that today they are already discussing a new role for the monarchy, which I hope will prevent any kind of return to the disruption to democracy that we saw over the last year."
"The main priority for my delegation is to see the establishment of lasting peace, and Maoist cooperation is pivotal to achieving this."
"The fact that the ceasefire has been respected is an indication that the right environment for peace talks is being created."
"However, I call on the Maoists to demonstrate their genuine commitment to stop recruiting militia, to put an end to any extortion and to return confiscated land."
"Both sides need to make the ceasefire permanent and to enter into a constructive dialogue as soon as possible, with the aim of holding free and fair elections and putting the Maoists on the same footing as the other political parties."
"I support what Mr Mulder said in terms of the European Union’s role and how we ensure that we get lasting peace in Nepal."
". – Mr President, a new era is beginning in Nepal following 10 years of civil war and almost 13 000 deaths."
"King Gyanendra’s decision in February 2005 to dissolve the government and declare a state of emergency has been the straw that broke the camel’s back in terms of Nepalese patience."
"We must make it absolutely clear that it has been the demonstrations in favour of democracy and peace that have forced this change."
"Those demonstrations, which were dealt with brutally by the police and which have left several people dead and many injured, have forced the king to abandon the military dictatorship, to restore Parliament and to hand the administration over to a government made up of a multi-party alliance."
"We are now seeing a glimpse of a new opportunity to reach a peace agreement with the Maoist guerrillas, which had previously declared genuine ceasefires which were rejected by the King; now, however, the ceasefire has been accepted."
"Our hope is that what is currently a temporary ceasefire will soon become a permanent one."
"In the mean time, we must welcome the move from arms to the political arena, as demonstrated by the agreement that the Maoists have signed with the multi-party coalition to hold elections to a constituent assembly in the near future."
"This Resolution also gives us the opportunity to welcome the fact that the government has repealed the royal decrees restricting press freedom and establishing strict controls on NGOs and also to call for the release of all of the political prisoners, journalists and human rights activists remaining in prison."
"The European Union must monitor the situation very closely and assist this process wisely."
"For example, the new government has decided to freeze the purchase by the previous government of military aircraft and weapons; the Council and the Member States must respect this decision and must maintain the freeze on military aid."
"Nepal no longer needs arms, but rather it needs to return to democratic and institutional normality."
"Furthermore, as has been said, the European Union must contribute to the peace process, providing assistance for demobilisation and economic aid for development and humanitarian programmes and also sending electoral and human rights observers."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, southern Asia has long suffered from instability in a number of countries in the region."
"Certain regions in the individual countries are in rebel hands and this is true of most of the territory of Afghanistan and Nepal."
"Whilst in Afghanistan the countryside is in the hands of the chiefs of clans and tribes, 75% of Nepal is controlled by groups with which the official authorities have so far refused to negotiate. After the king assumed absolute power, other political players also ran out of patience and in February 2006 people took to the streets."
"Now that a new coalition government has been formed, there is vital work that needs to be done; for example, the constitution needs to be changed to include safeguards of democracy and, most importantly, the involvement of all stakeholders in resolving the situation."
"According to the most recent reports, this is the current state of affairs."
"Preparations for elections of course need to be speeded up."
"An elected parliament should draw up a new constitution at the earliest opportunity, and our job is to support the process of democratisation, an integral part of which is freedom of the media and development of the country’s economy."
"The resolution that we have proposed and supported will contribute in the search for a democratic path out of the current crisis, and I believe that the Commission has already earmarked appropriate funds to support the entire process."
". – Mr President, in Nepal, a king has managed to destroy not only a new democracy, but also an ancient monarchy with deep roots among the people."
"Restoring both on an unequivocally democratic basis will be a very difficult task, and one in which our support will be required, for there is a risk of evil being used to drive out evil and of one dictatorship replacing another."
"I would not like to see the democrats who are now at the helm in Nepal suffering the same fate as Kerensky after the first Russian revolution, when, the rule of the tsars having been overthrown, it was replaced shortly afterwards by a totalitarian one-party dictatorship."
"It is for that reason that we must give the democratic forces – which are very weak and fragmented – massive support and ensure that this democracy does not soon give way to another dictatorship."
"All the Nepalese need to do is to take a look at their neighbours in Tibet to see the damage a one-party dictatorship can do to an ancient Asian culture."
"So let the Nepalese democrats be given every possible support in order not to end up being ground up between two millstones."
". Mr President, I think we need to be positive."
"Mr Posselt, who spoke just a moment ago, was far too negative."
"We should echo what Mr Mulder said and look on the events of the last few weeks as a turn for the better."
"We in the European Parliament and the EU as a whole must do all we can to support the moves towards democracy."
"As the resolution says, we must continue to highlight minority rights, and, as we did this morning, we should vote so as to support the ideas in the Howitt report."
"We should support the government to make certain there is democratic control of the military, and reinforce the call made by my colleague, Mrs Gill, for lasting peace."
"If this is to be successful, we in the European Parliament must do everything we can to address the root causes of the conflict in Nepal and ensure that there is much greater economic prosperity and much better redistribution of wealth throughout Nepal."
"That would be positive and could be the route to lasting success."
". Mr President, I think it is clear after this debate that there is broad agreement in this House that Nepal may just be starting to turn the corner and there may for once, after ten long years of war, be a sign of hope."
"Nepal’s problems demonstrate the weakness of the EU, but the recent reinstatement of democracy gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our strengths."
"In the absence of a collective will to find a solution in Nepal, we cannot impose one."
"But now we have the opportunity to guide, to assist and to advise all the democratic forces in Nepal as they continue their long, tortuous journey towards a multi-party democracy and respect for human rights."
"This resolution contains a number of worthy ideas, in particular the establishment of an international contact group and continued engagement of the international community within Nepal, guiding all these democratic forces."
"We must continue to support the democratic growth of Nepal."
"We cannot criticise and we must have a clean pair of hands in our negotiations with all parties in that country."
"I commend every mechanism within this resolution to the House and I hope to hear from the Commissioner that the Commission will continue to support us in this aim."
". Mr President, events have been taking a positive turn in Nepal, with King Gyanendra finally backing down in the face of mounting opposition to his absolute rule."
"The impact of the people’s democratic movement is impressive: Parliament has been restored, the government is committed to electing a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the Constitution and, most importantly, talks will soon be under way between the new interim government and the Maoists, under a mutually agreed ceasefire."
"This is a major victory for the Nepalese people."
"There is now a tremendous opportunity for the new government to restore democracy and pursue a peace process, but the many challenges that lie ahead should not be underestimated."
"The victory of the pro-democracy movement marks only the first step in Nepal’s long road to peace and stability."
"The new interim government is faced with important challenges: planning for constitutional changes, keeping the peace process with the Maoists on track and responding to calls for transitional justice."
"The primary goal must now be to agree a formal ceasefire and bring an end to hostilities between the Royal Nepalese Army and the Maoists."
"The second is to take forward a peace process based on constitutional redress."
"The third is to ensure that Nepal emerges again on the world scene as a stable democracy."
"The EU has a key role in helping Nepal through this difficult process."
"The Commission is ready to contribute to a possible peace package."
"Such a package could include, , support for elections, election observation, ceasefire monitoring and the necessary technical assistance."
"Working closely with the European Union Member States and successive European Union Council presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all efforts that may contribute towards a stable, democratic and peaceful Nepal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on Sri Lanka(1)."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance took the initiative of calling a debate on this issue because the Tamil Tigers had left the negotiating table."
"The conflict concerned has claimed at least 60 000 lives, and millions of people have been compulsorily displaced."
"This situation will never be resolved if both parties do not sit down at the negotiating table and remain there for as long as it takes to obtain a solution."
"The fact that the Tamil Tigers have now left the negotiating table is destructive for all the parties."
"They are in a minority and will never be able to achieve their aims through violence."
"The path of negotiation where we can be of help is that which will lead to a successful outcome and on which both parties have some prospect of gain."
"We must turn our attention to the Sri Lankan Government."
"As recently as in May, at least 18 civilians were killed on Kayts Island, and there are witnesses to confirm that the Sri Lankan navy murdered innocent civilians – at least 13 of them – because they were unwilling to leave their homes."
"Sri Lanka is responsible for a long list of human rights violations that it has never carefully investigated."
"Now that the country has been elected to join the UN Human Rights Council, it is absurd that it does not itself fulfil fundamental requirements to investigate human rights violations and take measures to bring their perpetrators to justice."
"If both parties get their act together and assume their responsibilities, we too can accept responsibility for helping with the peace process."
". – Mr President, the situation in Sri Lanka is getting worse."
"The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are committing new atrocities, and it is the Sri Lankan Government that decides where."
"The general image of the situation presented by some of the media is that it is a war with the heat turned down, and that description I regard as an accurate one."
"The question that arises has to do with what role the EU might play in de-escalating this conflict; how might it be possible to prevent it from getting even worse?"
"It has been proposed that the LTTE be, officially, put on the EU list of terrorist organisations; to do so would be extremely counter-productive, particularly in the present situation, as it has not been possible to hold the negotiations on EU territory and the fact that there is any kind of negotiating process at all is thanks to the Norwegian Government in particular."
"That being so, the way the EU should do its bit for de-escalation is to refrain from apportioning blame, something of which the proposed resolution is a lamentably bad example, in that it tends, fairly one-sidedly, to present the LTTE as the guilty party."
"The Sri Lankan Government, too, has recently done much to crank up the conflict."
"There is a quite different respect in which the EU plays an important part in this, for some of its Member States are continuing to deport people to Sri Lanka, consigning them to a situation of simmering warfare, and these deportations must be brought to an immediate halt."
"We must get really actively involved, without attaching blame to one side or the other, and that is a demand I make not only of the Commission, but also of the Council."
". Mr President, as in any conflict there are abuses on all sides, but the urgent resolution before the House this afternoon quite properly focuses on the appalling activities of a terrorist organisation, the LTTE."
"The LTTE is interested in one thing and one thing only, and that is political power."
"It does not represent all of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka."
"It certainly does not speak for them."
"Its murderous campaign has not improved their situation one iota."
"On the contrary, the Tamils, like all the other people of Sri Lanka, continue to suffer casualties, economic hardship and disruptive lives because of the uncertain and dangerous security situation."
"I hope it is not too late for the LTTE to pull back from the brink."
"At the beginning of this year there had been optimism that the ceasefire agreement would be reinforced and that substantial progress towards peace would be achieved."
"The failure of the LTTE to agree to a second round of Geneva negotiations and its resumption of a terrorist campaign have removed this hope."
"It is imperative that the LTTE is held to account for its actions and that further international pressure is brought to bear on it at this time."
"Unlike Mr Pflüger, I therefore urge the EU to add the LTTE to its list of proscribed terrorist organisations."
"I do not see this as a hindrance to future negotiations, but as a major incentive for the LTTE to stop the violence."
"At the same time, this ban must be backed by effective action by Member States to prevent funds and other support reaching the LTTE."
"Human Rights Watch, a highly respected international NGO, has testified to the intimidation, extortion and physical violence that has been inflicted on Tamils living in Britain and other countries in order to suppress criticism and ensure a steady flow of income."
"Every EU country where there is a Tamil community should establish special police taskforces to investigate and prosecute the agents of the LTTE, as well as freezing bank accounts linked to them."
"This should be seen as another dimension to the war on terrorism."
"For its part, the LTTE should immediately impose a ceasefire, give up its child soldiers, stop its suicide bombings, and agree to return to the conference table in a positive and constructive spirit."
"That is the greatest service it could provide to the Tamils and all the people of Sri Lanka."
". Mr President, we all hoped that the talks held in Geneva in February involving the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE might have been the beginning of a road towards peace, only for the Tamil Tigers, as we all know, to pull out of the second round of the negotiations."
"We all, of course, urged them to return to the negotiating table – I say all of us, but if we ban them they will not be able to do that – because a political solution is the only hope."
"Already LTTE delegations to EU Member States will not be received."
"The Council, as I have said, is considering listing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation."
"Surely it can see that will probably happen if there is any more violence and it will just be isolated even further."
"Negotiation is the only way forward, but negotiation should involve all groups, including other Tamil organisations – peaceful Tamil organisations, such as the Tamil United Liberation Front, for instance."
"The Government must also play its part and it is certainly not blameless in this."
"Both sides have violated the ceasefire."
"Both sides have, I believe, committed gross violations of human rights."
"I call on the Sri Lankan Government, for instance, to investigate fully and to prosecute cases of extra-judicial killing."
"It says it is investigating, but I want a full investigation."
"I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission."
"On the other hand, I want the Tamil Tigers to cease their violence completely, stop using child soldiers and return the child soldiers they are using to their families."
"Only if all parties show restraint that will we prevent further violence, otherwise it is the ordinary citizens, yet again, who will suffer."
". Mr President, this joint resolution contains many points and I, like others, support some and have reservations about others."
"We all condemn the violence taking place in Sri Lanka and we all bemoan the loss of life."
"We have highlighted the points we have in common and, having worked on a joint resolution, I really regret the inflammatory remarks made a few minutes ago by Mr Van Orden, who seems to have made a ‘hit-and-run’ contribution and left the Chamber."
"It shows a fundamental misunderstanding not just of the process in this House but also of the severity of the situation and of the way forward."
"Mrs Lynne highlighted a couple of points that need to be re-emphasised, for instance, for a peace process to be successful, all parties have to be involved in it."
"Perhaps we were wrong to talk in the resolution only of the LTTE and the government, when there are plenty of other organisations."
"There have been too many unexplained deaths in Sri Lanka, whether it was that of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar or the Tamil MP Joseph Pararajasingham, both of whom I and others had met and both of whom had been present in this Chamber."
"We hear about many deaths, but too many go unreported."
"We must give full support to the peace process, but we must recognise, as Mr Pflüger and others have said, that unfortunately, in a civil conflict like this, a lot of people are involved."
"We need them all around the table and we cannot apportion blame beforehand."
"Paragraph 17 on prescription will have a serious and negative impact on the process."
". Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Lynne, asked for a new Human Rights Commission to be set up in Sri Lanka and I am very pleased to announce that the President yesterday did just that, in anticipation, I suppose, of our resolution in this Parliament."
"The Human Rights Commission is now up and running."
"I think it was Winston Churchill who said that ‘jaw-jaw is always better than war-war’."
"What we have to do is continue talking."
"There is no final military solution to this conflict, which has now raged in the country of my birth for over 25 years."
"Thousands of people have died and, with no possibility of a military solution, we must negotiate and talk until a commonality of interest is found."
"Who should do the talking?"
"The European Union is a Co-Chair and I am led to believe that the Council has decided to ban the LTTE as a terrorist organisation."
"But we must continue to talk and the EU and the Co-Chairs, including Norway, in consultation with India, now have the role of peacemakers."
"We have to bring peace to the island."
"The intransigence of the LTTE, which periodically talks peace and then goes back to war, has got to stop."
"The international community is not going to be fooled anymore by this stop-go, stop-go process."
"I would like to thank my colleagues in this Parliament for the cooperation and understanding they have shown in this matter."
". Mr President, I should like to express my great concern about the breakdown of the peace process in Sri Lanka."
"I would appeal to all parties to renounce the vicious cycle of violence and to approach this dispute constructively."
"All parties must abandon violence once and for all."
"After an encouraging return to the negotiating table in February, the LTTE’s refusal to participate in the second round in April was very disappointing."
"The LTTE needs to resume peace negotiations with the Government of Sri Lanka, and the government too must be careful not to jeopardise the very delicate peace process."
"In my view the Commission needs to play a more proactive role to enable this process to move forward."
"The European Union, as we have heard, is a Co-Chair, but we appear to be playing a rather passive role, rather than seeing ourselves as dynamic players."
"I believe that together with the other Co-Chairs – the USA, Norway and Japan – we should urgently consider how we can strengthen Norway’s role as facilitator, in order to make positive progress towards a peaceful resolution and to get an agreed roadmap to end this conflict."
"The European Union is pouring enormous resources into Sri Lanka."
"We need to get some real results to ensure that the lives of the people there are remarkably improved."
". – Mr President, as has already been said, there can be no easy solution to a conflict that has been going on for nearly 25 years."
"What we are dealing with here is a sort of suppurating swelling that breaks out from time to time."
"I agree with all those speakers who have said that it is no solution at all to have recourse to force of arms in order to win a particular dispute."
"We should instead carry on talking."
"The great question is: what is the best way to do this?"
"Norway has been acting as a mediator since 2002, and Mrs Gill and the other Member were quite right to point that out, but whether Europe can play a more significant role is a major issue."
"Would it do any good if a major politician from Europe were to go to Sri Lanka to talk with the two sides and with other interested parties too?"
"A delegation of us went there last year, and, at the time, the suggestion was made from various quarters that it might be useful if some greater power than Norway were to emerge as mediator."
"I would be particularly appreciative if the Commission could let us know what it thinks of this suggestion."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anti-personnel landmines are terrible weapons, especially when they hit a bus full of people, and it does not matter whether those people are soldiers or civilians."
"This clearly brutal operation by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was swiftly followed by a disproportionate response, namely the bombing of land under their control."
"We are now faced with a further round of violence and another opportunity to supply weapons, to criticise the Sri Lankan Government and to lay down very peculiar conditions for the Colombo Government to take part in the next possible round of peace talks."
"Who is so interested in the possible deposits of oil and gas between the shores of the island and the federal state of Tamil Nadu?"
"Sadly the motion for a resolution fails to answer this question."
"Perhaps the next one will."
"Right now, all we can do is support the resolution."
"I would merely like to conclude with a question for Mr Schlyter, an advocate of ethnic rights."
"How are those rights enforced among the Sinhalese in the northeast of the island?"
"Mr President, the current situation in Sri Lanka is considered to be the most difficult we have witnessed in the four years since the truce was declared between the Tamil Tigers and the government."
"Conflict in this region has already claimed 64 000 victims and a further 300 lives have been lost in a series of terrorist attacks during the last six months."
"A week ago, the attacks of 11 May culminated in the sinking of a navy vessel with 18 people on board."
"The lives of peacekeeping observers are also in serious danger."
"These incidents undermine the already fragile ceasefire and threaten to destroy it completely."
"According to the principles of the peace agreement, the territorial waters around Sri Lanka lie under the jurisdiction of the government, and both sides are fully responsible for protecting local observers."
"It is particularly worrying that the escalating conflict is preventing the economic development of the island, that aid is not reaching those affected by the tsunami, that there is growing racial and ethnic discrimination, that children are recruited to the military and that the independence of the media is limited."
"International institutions must categorically condemn the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka to date."
"Support should be given to measures to set up a second round of conciliation talks and to work towards mobilising local communities to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to prevent the shedding of civilian blood, especially the blood of children."
". Mr President, the Commission continues to follow the situation in Sri Lanka very closely and welcomes the interest shown by the European Parliament in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict for all the people of Sri Lanka."
"The Commission shares your concerns about the worrying situation in the country."
"It is clear that the situation in Sri Lanka is now at a critical juncture."
"However, the solution can only be a negotiated settlement of the conflict."
"Following the first round of talks in Geneva in February, the Commission was rather optimistic about the readiness of the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to enter into discussions on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement as a prelude to possible talks on an overall peace settlement."
"The Commission is very disappointed that the second round of peace talks has now been put back indefinitely and that there are no prospects for new talks at the moment."
"The Commission is very concerned at the recent deterioration in the situation, in particular the suicide attack directed against the army chief, Lieutenant General Fonseka, and the recent rebel attack in northern Sri Lanka against a troop carrier and accompanying vessel, which killed 17 soldiers."
"Both actions led to retaliatory air strikes on rebel positions, causing casualties and deaths."
"We are clearly witnessing a very serious escalation."
"The navy attack was an open violation of the ceasefire agreement by the LTTE and is made more serious by the known presence of Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission monitors."
"The European Union has repeatedly condemned violent acts that have caused death and suffering among all the communities."
"The European Union has called on both parties to do all in their power to show restraint and to prevent further violence."
"These new developments are important for the EU in its role as a Co-Chair of the Tokyo Donor Conference, and we should carefully calibrate our response."
"An extraordinary Co-Chairs’ meeting in Oslo at the end of April took stock of the situation."
"A new meeting of the Co-Chairs is scheduled to take place in Tokyo on 30 May."
"The indications are that neither side seems keen to continue the peace negotiations and go to the planned second round of peace talks in Geneva."
"However, neither side wants to pull out completely and be accused of triggering all-out war."
"We thus continue to monitor the situation very closely and will explore any opportunity that could help stabilise the situation in Sri Lanka and lead to a peaceful, negotiated resolution of the conflict."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the debate on two motions for resolutions on Taiwan(1)."
". Mr President, the World Health Organisation exists to safeguard the health of everyone in the world, without exceptions and without gaps."
"If, as in the case of Taiwan, gaps are imposed for political motives, that can only assist the spread of disease and cause many preventable deaths and considerable suffering to thousands of innocent civilians."
"It is my view that, with all due respect to the Government of the People’s Republic of China and without violating any relevant United Nations resolutions, the 23 million Taiwanese people should, for the sake of world health, be allowed to be represented by their own observers in the WHO."
"This would be fully in keeping with the current practice, which allows entities that do not constitute states under international law – such as the Holy See, Palestine and the International Red Cross – to have observer status."
"Such representation will not in any way constitute political recognition of Taiwan as an independent state, but would be done solely to facilitate international public health and in particular to prevent the spread of highly dangerous communicable diseases, such as SARS, avian flu and HIV."
"So, colleagues, let us put the world’s health before regional political conflicts, and let us call upon the WHO to show the necessary courage and the People’s Republic of China to show the necessary goodwill and allow the observer status participation of Taiwan to go ahead."
". – Mr President, in view of the current context, with the high risk of several infectious diseases spreading across borders, such as bird flu or SARS, it is important that we establish the fastest and most effective possible mechanisms for prevention and response."
"All of the regions of the world must therefore participate directly and freely in the international cooperation networks, forums and programmes in the field of health."
"23 million people live in Taiwan, but it is not covered by United Nations protection in the event of the outbreak of an epidemic on the island."
"This Resolution therefore urges the Commission and the Council once again to insist that the Chinese Government, taking advantage of the particularly privileged relations we have at the moment, accept that Taiwan should have observer status in the World Health Organisation, or at least in the World Health Assembly."
". Mr President, we do not let any opportunity pass us by in this House to defend human rights and the great principles of democracy, but when it comes to Taiwan, we take a more flexible approach."
"Let us not forget that Taiwan is the only one of the four large Chinese societies in Asia to have both democracy and respect for human rights."
"In the People’s Republic of China, there is neither democracy nor respect for human rights; in Hong Kong, there is respect for human rights but no democracy; and, in Singapore, there is democracy but no respect for human rights."
"The joint resolution under examination does, however, go far beyond the usual diplomatic disputes."
"Our demand, which centres on Taiwan's being granted observer status at the World Health Organisation, is a public health issue of the utmost importance."
"It concerns both the 20 million residents of the island and the entire international community, us included."
"Given the issues at stake – among which I will simply mention the dangers of an epidemic that are threatening us – this demand is the bare minimum."
"I call on my fellow Members to think about the consequences of our joint resolution, and to adopt it despite the Socialist Group in the European Parliament’s last-minute u-turn."
"I would have welcomed more firmness on this matter from our fellow Members in the PSE."
"Even though they claim to be defenders of democracy and human rights, they were sadly unable to resist demonstrating, in this House, their solidarity with their Chinese Communist comrades."
". Mr President, I genuinely regret what I have just heard - after all, we hear it said so often in this House."
"We can recognise Taiwan's achievements in the field of health care, as well as its involvement in international activities in that regard."
"From a legal perspective, however, it is not possible for Taiwan to obtain observer status at the World Health Organisation."
"Only States can have that status."
"European policy recognises one China; the European Parliament supports that position."
"At the time of our previous resolutions on that same issue, which were adopted in 2002 and 2003, the Commission told us that it would examine the issue of Taiwan’s participating in the work of the WHO, in particular through non-State channels, via an NGO for example."
"The Taiwanese authorities are members of the World Medical Association and of the epidemiological training schemes network. These two NGOs are themselves members of the WHO Global Outbreak and Alert Network."
"They take part in the warning system."
"Currently, it is wrong to say that Taiwan does not benefit from United Nations protection."
"Nevertheless, we can call on China to examine the issue of Taiwan’s contributing to an appropriate field of international cooperation regarding public health."
". – Mr President, who would want to endanger their own health or someone else’s?"
"Nobody, surely, would wish to do so, but the situation in Taiwan appears to be an exception."
"The health of its 23 million citizens, and also that of the many foreigners who live on the island, is in serious danger."
"Why is this so?"
"It is, quite simply, for political reasons that Taipei is being systematically excluded from the activities of the World Health Organisation, and this is an intolerable and shameful state of affairs."
"During my visit to Taiwan, I also heard this charge levelled not only by Europeans who think as I do, but also by the indigenous population."
"I am prompted to support this clear resolution even more strongly as a result of a very recent development in Taipei – as recent as this week, according to senior European diplomatic sources."
"Most of all, the Taiwanese authorities wanted to depoliticise WHO membership."
"Their primary aim was ‘meaningful participation’, in other words technical involvement in all WHO activities, precisely as described in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the joint motion for a resolution."
"What I expect of the European institutions is the greatest possible effort towards protecting and promoting public health throughout the world."
"Even one single unprotected spot – whether it is called Taiwan or something else – puts the world at risk."
"Let the Chinese and the non-Chinese take this to heart, now or in future."
". Mr President, anyone who is well acquainted with the historical events of the last 60 years knows that it was in Taiwan that heroic Chinese people led by the brave general Chiang Kai-shek fought against the murderous regime of Communist mainland China."
"For a long time Taiwan was ruled by authoritarian governments, but these governments were not murderous."
"There was no religious persecution, no class persecution and no persecution of religious minorities."
"Today, we must not yield to the dictates of Communist mainland China."
"We have to give the Taiwanese Chinese the very least they deserve."
"Common sense for the sake of the world, for the sake of health and for the sake of Chinese people in Taiwan demands that they should be given the right to belong to international organisations, including the World Health Organisation."
"Mr President, I simply cannot understand why a country that is democratic, respects human rights and intellectual property, is tolerant of religious beliefs, trades with the whole world and is no threat to anyone should be discriminated against by international organisations which have the good of the whole of humanity as their goal."
"The organisation we are talking about is the World Health Organisation."
"It is clear that birds carrying avian flu are not interested in the political reasons behind Taiwan’s isolation from the global community."
"It is obvious that Taiwan must participate in joint efforts to prevent the spread of this disease."
"At the very least, Taiwan must be granted observer status within the World Health Organisation."
"May this happen and may it be the start of full Taiwanese participation in international organisations."
"Mr President, Taiwan is a prosperous, peaceful, democratic country which upholds high standards of human rights and the rule of law and threatens no-one."
"Its citizens enjoy some of the best healthcare provisions in Asia."
"For some time, going back to the SARS epidemic three years ago, Taiwan has attempted to gain observer status in the World Health Organisation."
"Regrettably, the People’s Republic of China has used every available means to block this."
"Taiwan deserves better."
"It already faces an immensely hostile military build-up by China, which last year passed the anti-secession law, escalating the degree of confrontation across the Taiwanese Straits."
"Taiwan, like Hong Kong, is already a full member of the WTO, as the People’s Republic of China saw commercial advantage in having it in the organisation."
"Its current opposition to Taiwan’s WHO bid – and of course Taiwan would be a key player in preventing any future bird flu pandemic, should that arise – is frankly inconsistent and makes China look like a big bully."
"Mr President, I need no lessons in politics from MEPs who have been reported as singing a Horst Wessel song in the past."
"I have three points to make."
"Firstly, this resolution is an abuse of our Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 115 is not intended to be used in this way."
"If it were, I would have attempted to raise the issue of the sadly mismanaged primary healthcare trust in west Gloucestershire closing two out of two local hospitals in Lydney and Cinderford."
"We all know what this is about: it is an attempt to undermine by creeping resolution our one-China policy – a perfectly reasonable political position, which I do not happen to support."
"Let us have an honest debate about it rather than hide within the Trojan Horse of supposed healthcare issues."
"The resolution is a serious one: it is true that Parliament has previously supported Taiwanese observer status at the WHA – not the WHO."
"Secondly, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network comprises a series of 40 different institutions from amongst the almost 200 Member States of the WHO."
"There is no universality, so there is no Taiwan gap."
"In fact, a number of NGOs with Taiwanese membership are members of GOARN and, therefore, they have no shortage of information."
"Thirdly, given the quarter to half a million Taiwanese immigrants in Shanghai alone who regularly travel between China and Taiwan, it is hard to imagine that the Chinese would take any risks of them bringing in diseases from Taiwan."
"Mr President, Taiwan is a sovereign nation and its people have worked hard to become a major economic player in Asia."
"Through this same hard work and willingness to interact peacefully with the rest of the world, it is becoming a significant economic player globally."
"Yet Taiwan’s progress in joining the world’s community in other spheres is blighted by the People’s Republic of China."
"Not allowing Taiwan to join the World Health Organisation – how sad is that?"
"It is pathetic that the World Health Organisation and other countries cooperate with this embargo on Taiwan."
"Hopefully, the EU will get the nerve to say to China, ‘we love you, we will trade with you, but we will not cooperate with you or say you are right when you are wrong’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that everyone agrees that it is unacceptable that the island of Taiwan should be excluded from the World Health Organisation and from its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network."
"Nevertheless, since 1971, since the Chinese seat at the United Nations was granted to the People’s Republic of China, the problem has been there."
"We are not concerned in this House with settling diplomatic problems, we are talking about health problems."
"The World Health Organisation’s statutes do not provide for observer status; we must therefore find and propose compromises that will enable Taiwan to take part in the work done by the World Health Organisation."
"One solution would be to go through a non-governmental organisation and, more specifically, a foundation, which would enable the Taiwanese authorities to have a separate delegation from the Chinese one, and thus access to the World Health Assembly."
"I will nonetheless vote in favour of the resolution proposed, but I believe that we should not mix up the various problems."
"Mr President, the threat of a flu pandemic or of other infectious diseases is one of the most serious problems facing modern civilisation."
"Infectious diseases such as HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and SARS are becoming increasingly common worldwide."
"Not permitting Taiwan to join the World Health Organisation at all exposes the over 20 million strong population of this island to the risks arising from exclusion from the global community."
"Taking into account the high quality of the Taiwanese healthcare system, it would also be in the interest of the international community to permit Taiwanese specialists to attend the meetings of World Health Organisation experts to discuss the fight against avian flu."
"As far as the aforementioned matter is concerned, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation should include the Taiwanese Centre for Disease Control in the global epidemiological early warning and response network at the earliest possible opportunity."
"The European Commission and the Member States should support Taiwan’s application for observer status in the World Health Assembly."
"The health of the citizens of Taiwan and of the populations of South-Eastern Asia and the whole world is at stake."
"– I am disappointed that at the end of this debate there has not been a unanimous position on this issue in Parliament."
"I regret the fact that the legal issue relating to the formula in Article 3 is not the wording that enabled us to reach consensus."
"In any event, I hope that this lack of consensus does not undermine what was said by the previous speaker Mr Pionior, with whom I agree completely."
"There is a public health problem of the highest importance."
"It is vital to ensure that Taiwan is brought completely into the world protection network, because it is not just the 20 million people who are at higher risk – we all face greater risks if the island remains outside our system."
"This is our fundamental concern and I hope that the Commission is equal to the task of addressing it."
". Mr President, after nine fruitless efforts to join the World Health Organisation as an observer, Taiwan has indicated that it is now considering lowering its ambitions and asking instead for meaningful participation in the work of the WHO."
"That means that Taiwan has decided that, in this area, substance and pragmatism are more important than legal form."
"That is the position the EU supports."
"In May 2004, the Irish Presidency, explaining why the EU did not support a vote on the issue of Taiwan’s observer status in the WHO, asked the WHO Secretariat for Taiwanese officials to be involved in technical work and meetings of the WHO where appropriate."
"The Irish Presidency referred to the WHO principle of the ‘enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health’ as one of the fundamental rights of every human being and also to the precedent that had been created by the involvement of and practical cooperation with health officials from Taiwan during the SARS crisis, which could serve as an example."
"In particular, in view of the arrival of avian influenza and the risk that implies, the Austrian Presidency, after discussion with Member States and the Commission, again took up the issue of practical cooperation with the WHO."
"Subsequently, on 2 May, EU representatives in Geneva had a very constructive meeting with the Director-General of the WHO."
"In fact, over the last year, representatives from Taiwan have participated in a number of technical meetings taking place under WHO auspices."
"Our clear understanding is that the WHO Secretariat is prepared to further explore possibilities for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the technical work of the WHO."
"We can only welcome this and will follow the matter with great interest."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, given that yesterday the Government of Sri Lanka announced the formation of a Human Rights Commission, could we make an oral correction to our joint resolution?"
"Paragraph 11 of the resolution states: ‘Calls on the Commission and the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure the reactivation of Sri Lanka’s Human Rights Commission’."
"We would like to replace that with the following: ‘Welcomes, therefore, the announcement of new members of Sri Lanka’s Human Rights Commission’."
"That concludes the vote."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 18 May 2006."
"I am delighted to inform you that a Delegation from the Maldives Parliament is present in the official gallery."
"Also present in the official gallery are members of the Delegation from the Mexican Parliament, made up of a group of senators and deputies, as well as Mrs Aminetu Haidar, winner of the Juan María Bandrés Prize …"
"… for the defence of the right to asylum and solidarity with Saharawi refugees."
"Before I give the floor to the Prime Minister of Belgium, I must pay tribute to the victims of the terrible earthquake that has taken place in Indonesia, with almost 6 000 dead, 20 000 injured and between 100 000 and 200 000 people affected."
"I have expressed our solidarity to the Indonesian Government and I am delighted that international aid – European aid in particular – is being mobilised quickly in order to help those affected by this latest tragedy."
"– Mr President, I would ask you to give me the floor on the basis of Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, which relates to the examination of respect for fundamental rights."
"I should like to request, on behalf of the leaders of the groups Mr Wurtz, Mrs Frassoni, Mr Watson and Mr Poettering, that the agenda of the next session of the Conference of Presidents should include those incidents that, in the past few weeks and months, have particularly worried all of us in the European Union, namely the increase in xenophobic, racist and, in particular, homophobic violence in the European Union or targeted at EU citizens."
"We are particularly concerned about the fact that a leading Member of a governing party in one of the EU's larger Member States, the deputy leader of the Catholic League of Polish Families – who is now the deputy leader of the main governing party of Poland – has openly advocated violence against homosexuals who want to exercise their right to demonstrate in Warsaw."
"It is unacceptable for leading representatives of the government of a Member State of the EU to behave in that way."
"I should like to take advantage of the presence of Prime Minister Verhofstadt, who is one of the most tolerant Heads of Government in the Union, and who consistently defends the citizens' civil rights, to appeal to you as President of the House: let us consider how we in the European Parliament can counter the fact that, every day, the Right in Europe goes one step further to test how far they can go in provoking civil society."
"We have had enough – we can no longer accept the provocation, whether it comes from the in Belgium, the in France, the League of Polish Families in Poland or the Nazis in Germany."
"Let us discuss how we can signal our opposition to this."
"Mr President, just as Mr Schulz referred to Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, I believe that I, on the basis of that same Rule, am equally entitled, since all MEPs in this institution have the same rights, to say that I regard it as a downright disgrace that, to all intents and purposes, undue advantage is being taken – with your permission no less, since you are not intervening – in that a debate, that is, strictly speaking, not on the agenda, is being held where the largest party in Belgium, or at any rate in Flanders, is insulted and maligned, and associated with a murder incident."
"This is something I refuse to accept."
"I think that you, in your capacity as President, should step in when the Rules are being manifestly manipulated in this Chamber."
"Mr President, I speak with regard to Mr Schulz’s intervention."
"Mr Schulz, please refrain from interfering in Poland’s domestic affairs, as we do not interfere in Germany’s domestic affairs."
"Do not use points of order to hold debates amongst yourselves."
"Mr Schulz has referred to a Rule of the Rules of Procedure which allows Members to speak in order to draw attention to a human rights issue during the examination of a legislative proposal."
"The subject is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the future of Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our sitting today is innovative, because the Prime Minister of Belgium is here, who has been invited to speak to plenary in order to contribute to the political reflection in which the European Union is currently immersed."
"As you know, normally Heads of State only speak to plenary at formal sittings which are not followed by a debate, or when they are Heads of Government of the country holding the Presidency of the Union."
"Nevertheless, we have decided to invite those Heads of Government who wish to take part in the debate on the future of Europe and to listen to their views on it."
"Today we have the honour of receiving Mr Verhofstad, the author of a short but striking book – 'The United States of Europe' – which makes a significant contribution to the current debate."
"I would also like to point out that Belgium has just completed a parliamentary marathon to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, since that country has had to obtain the assent of seven parliamentary assemblies."
"There is no doubt that at the next European Council important decisions will have to be taken with regard to the issue that has brought us together today."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank your President, Mr Borrell, and all those who have taken the initiative to invite me here today to embark on a series of debates you will be having."
"I should first of all like to thank you for organising this initiative, and I have already noticed from the introduction that your House is still as lively as I remember it being back in 2001 when I as President-in-Office of the European Council came to defend the decisions of our presidency."
"Although I am very flattered, Mr President, by this invitation, this initiative is also evidence of the efforts made by your House and of the perseverance it has shown."
"Allow me to remind you first of all that your Parliament has played an important, if not decisive, role in the Convention."
"I am delighted that, with this initiative, the European Parliament is once again assuming its responsibilities in shaping the future of Europe."
"I would not wish to start my address on the future of the European Union without first mentioning a date from the recent past: 1 May 2004, which is just over two years ago."
"A milestone in the history of Europe; a key date for the European Union: sixty years after the Yalta Conference, 48 years after the Hungarian Uprising, 43 years after the construction of the shameful Berlin Wall, and 35 years after the Prague Spring, this day was, as Bronislaw Geremek put it, ‘the real end of the Second World War, and the real beginning of a unified European Union’."
"The reason why I briefly mention that day is that many people today seem to have what I would call a particularly short memory when they talk about the enlargement of Europe and of the European Union."
"The Union is said to have been too hasty in welcoming the former Soviet satellite states into its fold."
"The Union is said to be expanding too fast."
"The Union is said to have reached its natural borders, and to have exceeded the limits of its so-called absorption capacity."
"What, though, does ‘too fast’ mean to people who were oppressed for nearly half a century?"
"What is ‘too hasty’ for people who we scarcely bothered about before they freed themselves from the Communist yoke?"
"Come to think of it, what are ‘natural borders’?"
"Where do such borders lie, when we see that European cities such as Belgrade and Dubrovnik are still outside the European Union?"
"And what ‘absorption capacity’ are we talking about?"
"The one in our head or the one in our wallet?"
"What I wish to make clear at the outset of my speech is that the future of the Union must not be thought of in terms of ‘either …or’: either ‘enlargement’ or ‘deepening’; either Turkey or the Constitution."
"History and the direction of history are unequivocal."
"The Union must continue to grow."
"This is the only guarantee for lasting peace and stability in Europe."
"The only guarantee that Bosnia or Kosovo, or the entire Balkans for that matter, will not go up in flames again tomorrow."
"The only hope, too, that countries such as Ukraine will become stable democracies in future."
"At the same time, the Union must be deepened further, and European integration must continue unabated."
"In any event – and that is something that lies at the very heart of this debate – it is time we put an end to the period of stagnation in Europe."
"After all, lack of progress in European integration did not start with the referendums in France and the Netherlands, as many people would have you believe."
"The citizens have been experiencing a crisis in Europe for longer than that: division over Iraq, non-compliance with the stability pact, and the debate on financial perspectives which we resolved in the end."
"I would also dare to add the Lisbon Strategy to this list."
"Let me make it perfectly clear that there is nothing wrong with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, but the so-called ‘open method of coordination’ used to implement it has been far too weak to give European unification and integration a fresh, decisive impetus after the successful introduction of the euro."
"No choice should be made between deepening or enlarging first, as some people lead us to believe."
"Both are necessary."
"Nor should a choice have to be made between Europe as a free trade area or Europe as a political entity."
"Here once again, the direction of history is unequivocal."
"We are in fact evolving very rapidly, from a uni-polar world dominated by the United States of America, to a multi-polar world in which countries like China and India are rightly demanding an emphatic role."
"If Europe wants to continue to play a leading economic, political or military role in this new world order, then political union is the only alternative."
"No single Member State, not even the large ones, can harbour any illusions about going it alone on the world stage."
"As my illustrious predecessor, Paul Henri Spaak, rather cynically put it so many decades ago:"
"‘Europe still consists solely of small countries."
"The only relevant distinction that remains is that some countries understand this, while others still refuse to acknowledge it’."
"It was Paul-Henri Spaak who said that, not me."
"In short, the question is not whether the Union will evolve into a more federal, political entity, but rather when this will eventually happen, or better yet, whether this will happen in time."
"That is the fundamental question."
"I, for one, have some doubts as to whether we will make the leap in time and evolve into a fully-fledged political union, and I am happy to share those doubts with the European Parliament."
"It is true that on 29 May and on 1 June 2005, the referendums in France and the Netherlands dealt a blow to the emergence of a European political union."
"The rejection of a constitution, which – although far from ideal – could have ushered in much more democracy, more transparency and more efficient decision-making, was a sledgehammer blow for those working on Europe’s political union."
"We cannot deny that the blow that both referendums caused was so great, that it is unclear even now whether the Constitution can still survive."
"The ratification process continues, and 15 countries have so far approved it, but let us be honest with ourselves."
"Some Member States may have been relieved when France and the Netherlands voted ‘no’."
"At any rate, they have postponed their own referendums indefinitely."
"In any case, the outcome of these two referendums has left Europe in confusion. And today, exactly one year on, there is no end in sight to that confusion."
"For we must face the facts."
"The subsequent 'reflection period' has yielded little or nothing at all."
"Over the last twelve months, there has been no noisy brainstorming session about the future of Europe, but rather a deafening silence."
"A few new ideas have surfaced in the past few weeks, it is true, but I would join you in doubting whether they will amount to much. One such example is, at the risk of sounding condescending, the ‘Europe of projects’, but what we really need is ‘a project for Europe’."
"Or the idea of having everyone renew their vows to Europe. Or the intention perhaps to save part of the constitutional treaty by 2009, without any certainty that it will not be voted down again."
"Be that as it may, it is to be expected that we in the European Council are going to extend the reflection period in just a few weeks."
"Elections will be held in France and the Netherlands, and an important presidency, the German Presidency, is coming up."
"There is a right time for everything, conventional wisdom has it."
"However, deciding when to act based on an election in another Member State or on who presides over the Council of Ministers is not the best approach, in my view."
"There will always be an upcoming national election somewhere, and waiting for the right presidency means running the risk that no one will grasp the urgency of the matter. Habits set in."
"Wear and tear take their toll."
"Why should we make a fuss about the future of Europe?"
"It is doing just fine, without a project, without a constitution."
"Yet I firmly believe that we must act as a matter of urgency."
"And I would like to reiterate the reasons for this: Europe's economic growth is lagging behind, our political influence in the world is waning and our military strength is below par."
"To find out what we need to do, we must first take a close look in the mirror, and together answer questions such as: Why did so many citizens turn away from Europe in those referendums?"
"What went wrong in France and the Netherlands?"
"What is the real reason why they did so in two states that were founding Members of the European Union?"
"In my view, two main answers or explanations can be given."
"The first, which is also a form of self-criticism, is that many national political leaders have long painted a negative picture of Europe in their own countries."
"When things go well, the feathers are immediately donned in the national cap, but when something goes wrong, the accusing finger is always pointed at Europe."
"And it must be said: Europe is a willing victim."
"No reaction or reply is hardly ever forthcoming when you abuse or lay into it."
"The most grotesque distortions gain currency: Brussels is supposedly home to an immense, Kafkaesque bureaucracy."
"The truth is, that some 24 000 civil servants work in the European institutions."
"This figure is smaller than the civil service of nearly every large European city."
"Europe is also said to be an enormous money-squandering machine."
"While I cannot deny that funds are sometimes misspent, and that is also the for the Court of Auditors’, the truth is that the budget of the European Union is 20 times smaller than that of the United States, and 40 times smaller than that of all other (national, regional and local) governments combined."
"Each European citizen pays less than five euros a week for Europe – a fraction of what he or she has to pay for his or her national, regional and local governments."
"In return for these five euros, the citizen has enjoyed peace and prosperity for years, some of them, including us Belgians, for more than half a century."
"As we know in life, though, and certainly in politics, gossip is more stubborn than the truth, especially when that gossip is bandied about constantly, whether or not it is relevant."
"There is, however, a second, and in my view, more decisive reason why citizens are put off and voted ‘no’ in both referendums."
"In their judgment, Europe no longer provides a sufficient answer – if any – to their many questions and concerns."
"I think that in this age of unbridled globalisation, they see the European engine sputtering and the European economy gasping for breath."
"Unemployment remains high."
"Companies are often relocating to the (Far) East, taking jobs with them. A powerful European response is not forthcoming."
"Although cross-border crime is on the rise, let us be honest, we had to wait – I remember it very well – until the Twin Towers were levelled before an agreement could be reached on the European arrest warrant."
"And the same thing is happening now with the European patent."
"Everyone knows that this tool is absolutely necessary if we are to make up for our lag in research and development, but in spite of all the Council’s declarations of intent, this could drag on for years."
"This being so, it should come as no surprise that European citizens are opting out of referendums – and let us be honest about the fact that it is not one."
"We are all too aware that the European Union, as it functions today, lacks the necessary power to provide clear and decisive answers to the concerns of the people, and we are only too aware of why this is so."
"Until such time as Europe embarks on the road towards a real federation where the unanimity rule is scrapped, or at least limited to the strict minimum, it will continue to be powerless to react rapidly and decisively to new challenges."
"To put it in a different way: a confederation, based on the intergovernmental method and the principle of unanimity, has no choice but to paralyse our Union."
"I think that 50 years after the launch of the Union, it is high time to make a choice once and for all: confederation or federation; unanimity or qualified majority; intergovernmental or community approach."
"A 'board' led by a number of Member States, or a strengthened European democracy based on an active European Commission and a fully-fledged European Parliament, which make up the essence of European democracy."
"Allow me to illustrate the crucial importance of this crossroads by returning to the major challenge facing us, and I believe that the major challenge facing us now is the modernisation of the European economy."
"If one looks at the figures, what are they now and what do they tell us?"
"Average GDP growth in Europe over the last ten years has been 2.3%, compared with 3.3% in the United States."
"In Europe, the total employment rate increased by 9% during that same period."
"In the United States, it increased by 14%."
"Far more striking is the fact – which we must indeed acknowledge – that, while, in the 1980s, per capita income was still at the same level in Europe and the United States, European per capita income is now 30% below that of its US counterpart."
"I have not even touched on China, India or Japan, about which a great deal is said."
"Last year, China's economy grew by almost 10%."
"The European Union’s trade deficit – we always talk in terms of surpluses, but let us also look at the deficits – with Asia rose to EUR 100 billion, and is expected to rise even further over the next few years."
"The European Union's response to this problem is called the ‘Lisbon Strategy’."
"As I have already said, there are no question marks concerning the objectives of this strategy."
"Europe must become ‘the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy’."
"However, the method used to that end, which enables the Member States to decide for themselves how they intend to go about meeting that objective, is not effective."
"The facts show that we are falling further and further behind in a large number of areas."
"There is a simple reason for that."
"The Lisbon Strategy makes use of the aforementioned open method of coordination, a form of intergovernmental approach that is mainly based on best practices, benchmarking and peer review."
"Aside from defining a number of general objectives, the role of the European institutions is limited to drawing up rankings and tables for the purposes of drafting reports."
"That is precisely what others do too in their reports: I am thinking of the World Competitiveness Centre (IMD) and the World Economic Forum (WEF)."
"The only difference between the reports drafted under the Lisbon Strategy and the ones by these economic institutes is that the latter show that nearly all of the countries in Europe are declining."
"Some will hasten to say that this is naturally due to the strength of the euro."
"Yet, it is primarily due to the lack of common reforms in the European Union."
"In short, although we are striving to make our knowledge-based economy the most competitive one in the world, it must be pointed out that we are in danger of becoming less competitive by the day."
"A conclusion is required, which I have tried to defend not only within the Council, but also, prior to that, at the European Parliament, for example when I was invited by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"That conclusion is as clear as day: the intergovernmental method, without commitments, that underpins the Lisbon Strategy does not work properly."
"What we really need is a much more binding, Community-based approach. Social and economic governance in the true sense of the word."
"A joint European socio-economic policy, in which the Union provides a broad outline of the necessary reforms. These reforms are absolutely imperative if we want both to face up to rising competition from new growth areas and to protect the social model of which we, in Europe, are so rightly proud."
"These reforms require action not only with regard to industry, innovation, research and taxation, but also with regard to the labour market, pensions, social security and health care, without mentioning other areas."
"The method to be used here – and I do not want any ambiguity on this matter – cannot simply consist of indiscriminate harmonisation;"
"I am opposed to indiscriminate harmonisation or, in other words, to a form of standardisation that takes no account of the differences among the Member States."
"Plainly ignoring the differences in customs is not an option."
"No, what I am advocating is a policy of convergence, a similar approach to the one that was successfully applied to the Stability and Growth Pact and that led to the introduction of the euro, because that is indeed what was at the heart of the Pact: a policy of convergence."
"Unlike harmonisation, which is based on absolute values and which denies the differences in Europe, convergence is about setting minimum and maximum levels, a range of values; it is about creating a framework in which the various Member States of the Union must operate and modernise their economies."
"The maximum levels are needed in order to inspire the Member States to implement reforms. The minimum levels are needed in order to prevent social dumping."
"Convergence also enables the various Member States gradually to develop in line with each other and the Union to become competitive again faced with other growth regions in the world, the main difference being that cut-throat internal competition is prevented and that the Union is not forced to give up its social approach."
"I also believe that Europeans will thus be able to regard the Union once again as a solid partner, a federation of peoples and nations, which this time round is able to provide an answer to the challenges of globalisation."
"In any case, by radically changing the course of the Lisbon Strategy and enhancing this strategy by employing a more compelling and precise Community method, the Union will once again be able to capitalise on past successes."
"It must be acknowledged that neither the internal market nor the euro would have come about without a powerful Community driving them forward."
"It must be said today that, for the internal market, this driving force took the form of the principle of mutual recognition and of qualified-majority voting, as developed by Mr Delors."
"As for the euro, it would never have come about without the Maastricht criteria and the standards set out in the Stability and Growth Pact, which is also a driving force of the Community."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while a new Community economic strategy of this kind is highly desirable for the Union, it is certainly crucial for the eurozone."
"A single currency and a monetary Union are destined to fail in the long run if they are not supported by a common approach to social and economic challenges."
"The absence of reforms in one country will inevitably have a negative bearing on the health of other countries, in other words, of the entire zone."
"If anyone had doubts about the need for, at the very least, a form of economic governance in a monetary union, they need only imagine the United States with one currency, the dollar, and one central bank, the Federal Reserve, but with a different socio-economic policy for each of its 50 states."
"We would regard that situation as ‘unmanageable’."
"The fact is, we are faced with that unmanageable situation now, within the European Union, or at least within the eurozone."
"Then we wonder why we do not have the same economic growth as other regions in the world!"
"That is why, for some time now, I have advocated taking an initiative to strengthen the Eurogroup."
"Not with the aim of excluding anyone, because – I repeat – if the 25 Member States were able to apply themselves to developing a new Community strategy together, then I would undoubtedly prioritise that joint approach."
"Yet, if that proved impossible - which I increasingly fear to be the case - then there is no question of not taking action at all."
"Moreover, when I talk about the Eurogroup, I am referring not only to the current members of the eurozone, but also to all the countries that, under a contractual clause, are destined to join the eurozone."
"In other words, no one is being excluded from joining the EU and from being part of the eurozone."
"What might strengthening the eurozone entail in terms of creating the social and economic governance that is so lacking in the Union?"
"I am thinking about 'strengthening' here with regard both to the institutional aspects and to the content."
"In particular, I am thinking about jointly preparing the EU spring summit, about frequently drafting reports and recommendations for the eurozone within the European institutions, about defining common macroeconomic starting points when drafting national budgets, about drawing up convergence criteria on social, fiscal and economic matters – a very important task – and about holding meetings that bring together within the enlarged Eurogroup not only finance ministers, but also employment ministers, social affairs ministers and ministers for science policy - my finance minister agrees."
"Finally, I am also thinking about ensuring autonomous representation within the international finance institutions, which is an obvious step to take when one has a monetary union and a single currency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, so far, I have focused almost exclusively on the economic challenges facing the Union."
"I would be trivialising matters if I were to overlook the other areas in which we need more, not less, Europe."
"One such area is justice and security, in which we should be more effective in the fight against illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism."
"As regards research and development – please forgive me for repeating myself – we urgently need the European patent."
"The same goes for a common foreign policy."
"With regard to this last point, we must acknowledge the fact that only a European defence can move us closer to a common foreign policy of that kind. My personal experience in 2003, shortly before the start of the war in Iraq, was painful but instructive."
"At that time, in 2003, it seemed totally impossible to debate the Iraq crisis within the European Council."
"Divided as we were, we preferred to keep our cards close to our chest."
"In short, only when we develop common instruments, such as a European army and European diplomacy, will we be forced to lay our cards on the table - and in due time - in the event of an international crisis."
"I know that the idea of developing a European army or European defence is likely to be perceived by some Atlanticists as a sacrilege or as a denial of our transatlantic obligations."
"Well, that is not the case."
"In the 21st century, NATO is going to change; it is likely to evolve from a regional defence alliance into an international security network, consisting of allies and partners."
"At the same time, there is every reason to believe that we will make ever more explicit efforts to tackle international security issues within this kind of renewed international cooperation association, rather than continue to call on the so-called coalitions of the willing."
"The disadvantage of these coalitions is that they disintegrate easily following each change of government."
"Within this new ‘transatlantic security network' – the foundations of which will be laid in Riga – Europe’s defence must be developed and integrated as an autonomous European pillar."
"It goes without saying that a great deal of resistance will have to be overcome in order to succeed in this. Resistance on the part of some Americans, for example, who can only see NATO as an alliance of countries, and resistance on the part of some Europeans, too, who continue to regard European defence as an alternative, or even a rival, to NATO."
"Yet, I believe that, by finding a middle ground between these two arguments, it will be possible in the long run to overcome this resistance."
"The European operations conducted in Bosnia, Macedonia and Congo have shown this."
"Be that as it may, the development of Europe's defence, which is intended to operate both as an autonomous entity and as a pillar of NATO, is urgent and essential."
"We cannot play the part of the world’s moral conscience without having the military might to back it up."
"Nor can we constantly call on the United States to come to our rescue when we are faced with a civil war on our own continent, as was the case in Bosnia and Kosovo."
"The question remains: what does all this have to do with the Constitution and the draft Constitution?"
"Theoretically, of course, there are various possibilities."
"We can opt for the , regard the constitution as a lost cause and continue to work on the basis of the treaties signed in Nice and elsewhere."
"That is not, in my opinion, the right way forward, for then, we would retain the unanimity rule, which, in turn, means vetoes and, perhaps, paralysis."
"We can also take an approach that could well catch on, namely a ‘pick and choose’ approach, if I can put it that way, trying to save the most attractive parts of the constitution, but my question is, then, which parts?"
"I can imagine that every member of the Council will have a different priority."
"For one member it will be the subsidiarity test, while for the other, it may well be larger powers for the European Parliament, for example."
"I will let you guess."
"Ultimately, the odds are that at the end of the ride, we will end up with more or less the same Constitution."
"It is highly doubtful that ratification in two or three years’ time will have a greater chance of success than today."
"We could also take a ‘roll-back’ approach, where we interpret the outcome of the referendums as a sign that the citizenry actually want less Europe, meaning that we should reduce Europe back to nothing more than a free-trade zone."
"However, dropping our European ambitions and going against the course of history would be like abdicating, a form of betrayal, for the success, to date, of European unification cannot be denied."
"It has proven to be the best remedy for poverty, dictatorship and war."
"Europe has brought long-lasting peace, social protection and unprecedented prosperity."
"So we must stop being cynical and painting a picture of the Union as some kind of inconvenience."
"Practically and politically, there is just one option that remains, and that is to press on with the ratification of the Constitution."
"Each country and each citizen of the Union has the right to express an opinion on this Constitution, but remember, there may have been two 'no' votes – in the Netherlands and France – but there were 15 'yes' votes in the 15 other EU Member States."
"I do not think that Europe would be a democracy if it did not take that simple statistical fact into account."
"Moreover, in my view those who in recent months have put ratification on the back burner are duty-bound to start or resume the ratification procedure – and I will tell you why."
"We agreed this when we approved the draft Constitution in the European Council."
"That is why we added a special declaration to the constitution, declaration 30, which states: ‘If four-fifths of the Member States have ratified it two years after signing it, and one or more Member States have encountered difficulties in proceeding with ratification, the matter will be referred to the European Council’."
"Well then, if not all of the countries start a ratification procedure, then the content of this declaration will obviously be pointless, which means that any breakthroughs in the European Council will be blocked."
"Anyway, I personally think that four-fifths of the Member States is feasible within the European Union – if, that is, everyone assumes their share of responsibility."
"If we manage to reach that quorum, then a totally new situation would arise, a situation which certainly opens up new prospects vis-à-vis the current barriers."
"After all, if that happens, if we reach this four-fifths quorum and when we meet, I cannot imagine the Council simply running through the agenda as usual and not discussing anything, in the knowledge that the necessary ratifications were missing in the Union."
"This declaration to the Constitution would be rendered meaningless."
"In the meantime, however – and that is also the message I would like to press home today – whether or not we reach the four-fifths quorum, nothing is standing in the way of the further integration that I have just described – quite the opposite."
"It would be good if a second track were opened alongside the ratification track."
"This second track would not require any changes to the treaties."
"It would be a project involving all countries that wanted to take part, as I described in detail a moment ago."
"In other words, I am suggesting that we quickly develop a new strategy along two lines."
"The first involves moving forward with ratification and fully fleshing out and applying declaration 30 to the Constitution; the second involves making a new and significant leap forward in European unification, without requiring any amendments to the treaties, on the basis of a number of points I set out a moment ago."
"This two-track strategy is, in my view, the only way to get through the current period of uncertainty, which could drag on for years, in a meaningful way, and, above all, the only way not to waste time."
"After all, time is the last thing we can afford to waste."
"In conclusion, I would like to add that, 52 years ago, the European Defence Community collapsed after a 'no' vote in the French Parliament."
"There was great dismay at the time, but the European leaders of the day did not let that setback throw them off balance."
"In fact, they knew perfectly well what they had to do."
"They did not need time to reflect."
"They did not need to make enquiries or organise opinion polls."
"They spent two years negotiating in one place, Val Duchesse, just a couple of kilometres from here."
"They then took the results to Rome, where they signed a treaty that led to the creation of the European Economic Community."
"That was when they put Europe on the right track for good."
"That was 52 years ago."
"It is exactly the same thing that we need today."
"After all, the situation today is not all that different from the situation 52 years ago."
"Today, the majority of the French and Dutch citizens voted against the constitution, and today we must not let ourselves be thrown off balance."
"Today, the time is ripe for a major leap forward."
"And today we need bold policy to put Europe back on track."
"Why, so far, have we not done the same thing they did 52 years ago?"
"What is the big difference?"
"What is needed?"
"The answer is simple: courage, political courage."
"The same courage that Jean Monnet, Alcide de Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer, Max Kohnstamm, Paul-Henri Spaak and Robert Schuman demonstrated back then; the courage to pick ourselves up after a major setback, square our shoulders and keep on going."
"That, more than anything, is what we need now."
"Thank you very much, Prime Minister."
"Thank you for your extensive and penetrating speech."
"The chairmen of the political groups will speak next and then you will have the opportunity to respond to them."
". – Mr President, Prime Minister Verhofstadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 455 million people now live in the European Union, many millions more than the populations of the United States of America and Russia combined."
"Soon there will be almost 500 million people in 25, then 27 and later perhaps even more countries."
"I must say that, whenever I leave Europe and then return, I always have a profound feeling of gratitude to be back in Europe, because there is no other continent with as much diversity – including cultural diversity – as the continent of Europe and the European Union."
"However, this continent is also a difficult one – just think how many parties are represented here in the European Parliament and how we continually need to work to reach joint results."
"I should like to say, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that, in our opinion, the Treaty of Nice cannot form the basis for leading 500 million people into a brighter future."
"We must go further, and we therefore welcome today's debate."
"A debate should result in people listening to each other, understanding each other and, hopefully, reaching joint results."
"I am therefore pleased that Prime Minister Verhofstadt is here today, and it was always the three Benelux countries that gave the greatest impetus to Europe."
"I hope and expect that, at the end of this process of strengthening the substance and the principles of the European Union, the three Benelux countries – not just Belgium or Luxembourg, but the Netherlands too – will be at the forefront of European development."
"Immediately following Nice, the European People's Party said that Nice was not enough, and we had some very frank discussions with President Chirac in Strasbourg in December 2000."
"At our congress in January 2001, we in the European People's Party drafted a resolution saying that we want to go further, we want a new conference, and we want, if possible, a constitution, a constitutional treaty."
"Perhaps the name 'constitution' was too ambitious for many people."
"That may well be the case, and we must look into it carefully."
"I would remind you of what Mr Juncker said last Thursday when he deservedly received the Charlemagne Prize of Aachen: it is not acceptable for the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the EU to spend Monday to Saturday talking down the European Union and Brussels, and then to expect there to be a good result in referendums and plebiscites on Sunday."
"This is unacceptable, and that is why we call on all governments in the European Union to depict Europe as it really is – with both its positive and negative developments."
"We in Europe have got used to always just talking in negative terms: for many people, the glass is always half empty instead of half full."
"Mr Verhofstadt, you referred to 1 May 2004, when eight formerly Communist East European countries – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were occupied by the Soviet Union – acceded to the European Union, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia."
"It is not the European Union that has expanded, but its force of attraction."
"Its strength in peace, freedom, democracy and the rule of law was the force that attracted these countries, so that they ultimately became Member States."
"We should publicise this as a really great success for European development."
"Let us take the Euro: we are quite justifiably discussing the stability of the Euro."
"Much of this discussion has been presented very negatively, including in connection with the reform, and it certainly is a considerable challenge."
"However, just imagine we did not have a common European currency."
"Where would we now stand in the globalisation process if the countries of the European Union were still devaluing their currencies to give themselves an export advantage in the European Union?"
"Europeans would be set against each other, and it would take away from us any chance of being competitive on a global scale."
"So let us be positive about Europe!"
"I have just been talking to the Dutch Minister for European Affairs."
"I found it very enlightening to hear him say that, in an Internet survey in the Netherlands, many of the participants said that we needed more Europe, for example with regard to internal security, agreements on immigration and the major issues of asylum."
"It is therefore our common task to find a way, through discussions and then decisions, of turning the substance and principles of the Constitution into political and, in the first place, also into legal reality."
"Mr Verhofstadt, I welcome your statement that the ratification process should continue."
"We should also particularly like to thank Estonia for having ratified the constitution a few days ago."
"We would encourage Finland to continue with the ratification process – the leaders of the groups will be going to Helsinki tomorrow."
"I would also say to our Polish friends and partners that you have a good point on the issue of energy."
"You are quite right to expect solidarity when it comes to energy supplies."
"Solidarity applies to all the countries in the European Union, but Poland, too, must exhibit solidarity when it is a matter of our future, on the basis of a treaty, a constitution, that gives us a prospect for the future."
"Solidarity is not a one-way street, but a two-way process, and it applies to all Europeans."
"Let me conclude by saying this: our group is deeply committed to subsidiarity, and subsidiarity includes local, regional, national and European levels."
"The local level and the lower levels in the sense of 'close to the people' need to act when they are the best ones to do so, but the European Union needs to act when the nation states can no longer act, when they are too small to solve the problem."
"It is therefore our duty to make the path, the principles and the foundations of the Constitutional Treaty a reality."
"We must find common solutions, in all 25 countries and here in the European Parliament too."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your speech, Mr Verhofstadt."
"You said that we need courage, and I thought that your speech was very courageous."
"I have seldom heard a member of the European Council be as critical of the institution as you have just been."
"It is true that the crisis in Europe is also, in part, a crisis of the European Heads of State and Government."
"I promise you – and this is something I say frequently – that in future I will say: it is, in part, a crisis of the European Heads of State or Government minus Mr Juncker and Mr Verhofstadt."
"It is quite clear that both you and Mr Juncker, in what you have said here and in what he said last week, are demonstrating a clear commitment."
"It is a commitment not just to strengthening integration or to expansion; you have made a commitment to a fact that should really go without saying for a Head of State or Government, namely that you stand by what you say and do."
"In Rome, all of the Heads of State or Government who sit on the Council and take part in the summit ceremoniously – there could hardly have been more ceremony – signed this treaty, but some of them then went home and acted as if they had no idea where they had been."
"That is one aspect of the crisis surrounding this constitution."
"It is very much to your credit that you have stood up for it so clearly."
"I can tell you that I should have liked to have heard a speech like the one you gave today from certain leaders of other institutions in Europe."
"I should like to discuss two elements to which you referred directly, Mr Verhofstadt."
"The question of whether we will get 20 'yes' votes, and how we should deal with the two 'no' votes, is an important one."
"We now have 15 states."
"We very much welcome the fact that the Finnish Presidency of the Council has stood up and said: no, for us the constitution is not dead."
"Mr Vanhanen is doing what you are doing."
"My government says that he has signed the constitutional treaty; we want our Parliament to decide."
"That is the logical and normal way to go."
"The Estonians ratified the constitution a few weeks ago."
"I do not see why we could not achieve the figure of 20 so that the agreement between the Heads of State or Government to which you referred – not the agreement by the European Parliament, but the agreement by the Heads of State or Government – can enter into force."
"Therefore, we cannot give up on the Constitutional Treaty, and it is reckless for senior representatives of the European Union to say 'let us think of something else' rather than first of all following the ratification process through to the end."
"That was an important statement that you made to Parliament today."
"You also referred to another particularly important point."
"The issue of how we in the European Union even assess what has happened differs from one political camp to another and from one country's political class to another."
"There is one thing I am sure of, though."
"This morning, Mr Poettering, I also spoke to the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, Atzo Nicolaï."
"Surveys in the Netherlands show that the vast majority of Dutch people are in favour of the European Union."
"The same people who said 'no' in the referendum, when they are specifically asked whether they want more Europe, say 'yes'."
"They want more social protection, more environmental protection and more stability."
"Why, then, did they not vote for this Constitution, which provides more social protection, more environmental protection and more stability?"
"They must have their reasons."
"Of course, it is partly due to problems in the EU, but it is also due to domestic politics in these countries."
"I am pretty sure that, if Mr Chirac had said to the French people that he would resign if they accepted the Constitution, there would have been an overwhelming majority in favour of the Constitution in France."
"I am quite convinced of that."
"Perhaps that is how to get the Constitution accepted in France."
"However, it is quite clear that there is a connection between the depression in certain Member States and the fact that their populations rejected the constitution."
"We cannot deny that, but, given that it is the case, it also sharpens our eye for those people who said yes."
"It also makes us more acutely aware that courage is worthwhile, because one head of government in Europe did put his political fate on the line for the constitution – Mr Juncker said to the people of Luxembourg, 'I believe that, in the long term, more Europe is the only way that we can keep our small country as socially, economically and ecologically strong as it is today."
"I am absolutely convinced of that."
"If you have a different opinion, if you think that Europe needs to be administered differently, then you need to find a different Prime Minister'."
"So, he linked his fate with that of the constitution, and thus won his people over to the constitution in a referendum just a few weeks after the 'no' votes in France and the Netherlands."
"I think you are right, Mr Verhofstadt."
"Europe is lacking in courage."
"Nobody has the courage to say 'I have a conviction, and I am prepared to put my political fate on the line for this conviction'."
"Members of the European Council have taken the decision to stand before their parliaments and say 'even though the overwhelming majority of the population is against it, we must send soldiers to such-and-such a place, because there is no other way'."
"They could do that, they managed to push through their conviction there; I will make no comment on that here."
"I should have liked them to apply the same energy to the European Constitution and to say, with the same energy, 'I will fight for my conviction, just like we fought for other projects'."
"If they had done so, Europe would have got much further."
"I am grateful to you, and I am firmly convinced that, if there were more Verhofstadts in Europe, we would make much more progress."
"."
"Mr President, it is hard to respond in just four minutes to such a tour de force about the future of Europe."
"My group welcomes the presence here of Mr Verhofstadt, both as a prime minister and as one of the major architects of European reform."
"As you recognised, Prime Minister, in the Laeken Declaration in 2001, the European Union has been talking more to itself than to its citizens."
"Yet five years after your Presidency, the task of reconnecting Europe with its citizens still shows too little evidence of progress."
"Indeed, just yesterday a survey showed that 82% – more than four in five – of our fellow citizens feel that government at European level fails to communicate with them."
"Despite the year-long period of reflection – and eight months into the Commission’s much vaunted plans – little has been broadcast beyond the bastions of the Berlaymont."
"However, the same survey might hold the seeds of hope, for though Europe may not be brilliant at communicating what it does, that survey shows that our citizens still trust the European institutions to do it."
"In fact, more of them trust the European institutions than their own national governments."
"So here is Europe’s mandate from the people: a mandate to deliver the reforms needed to meet challenges like energy security, migration, climate change and organised crime, which individual Member States struggle to deal with under the current set-up."
"Greater coordination of economic policies, as you recommended, Mr Verhofstadt, would certainly help, as would greater defence coordination."
"Mr Barroso has pointed to the need for practical achievements to reinforce our links with citizens and rally them to our cause."
"But this ‘Europe of Projects’ can never get off the ground until Member State governments explain to their people what they are doing together in Brussels and why, and until we give the Union the money and the legal powers to push through initiatives like the common energy policy, which faces an uphill struggle against blocking forces in the Council, as too do many other initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs, for example, where the absence of qualified majority voting so often results in stalemate."
"Quibbling over the clause in the Treaty will resolve little, and change rests, in any case, on the same unanimity which has led to inaction up to now."
"As you said, Prime Minister, it is the Constitution – as practical as it is ideological – that can best put the institutional building blocks in place to move Europe forward."
"It is all very well for Mr Schulz to rail against it, but it was his Socialists in France who helped to kill the Constitution in that referendum."
"We need to make our period of reflection a period of analysis, producing proposals on how to proceed."
"This month’s Interparliamentary Conference on the Future of Europe kick-started the process."
"Today’s sitting is the logical extension, and let us hear more debates with national leaders."
"On Europe Day, Estonia became the fifteenth state to ratify the Constitution and Finland will soon follow."
"To me, that Treaty looks far from dead, and with the political courage of leaders like Guy Verhofstadt, Angela Merkel and Romano Prodi – leaders committed to Europe – then Europe’s future is surely brighter."
"As the Prime Minister told us, we have a lot of work to do."
"However, we have the people of Europe behind us in our task, because they recognise, however much some of our national leaders like to deny it, that the big problems we face, the major challenges of globalisation – population growth and migration, climate change, internationally organised crime – cannot be dealt with by nation states built on the 18th-century concept of military industrial power; they require us to overcome our tribal and our religious hatreds and to work together for the future of all our citizens on a planet which we share with others."
"Mr Verhofstadt, thank you very much for being here with us today because, in this period of generalised siesta that has, alas, also taken hold of the Commission and Parliament, I am delighted that you have brought the debate on the future of Europe here to us."
"We also hope that your generous efforts will help us, together with the other European Union Member States and our institutions, to bring a glimmer of enlightenment to this constant crisis."
"We substantially agree with your vision for the institutions and we endorse what you have said about Lisbon."
"We can even agree on the fact that ratifications should continue, but we also think that it will be impossible to make France and the Netherlands accept the existing text and, moreover, your two-pronged strategy falls down, in our view, on the weakness of the political solutions."
"We are trapped in a perfectly obvious contradiction."
"If the European Union is to be loved by its citizens, it has to show them that it works, but in the last few years no great initiative has been taken on the environment issue, the jobs issue, peace, development, human rights or the integration of new citizens."
"Thus there is only one thing to say: institutions and policies are indissolubly linked, and that is where we no longer agree with you."
"The majority of our citizens cannot be won over by the idea of a federal, democratic and peaceful union, based on thoroughly disquieting examples like the United States, China or India."
"Furthermore, neither the Socialists nor the Greens who did not vote for the Constitution will be won over by the idea that we must keep up with the growth seen in the United States, China or India, because such growth results in poverty and the consumption and wastage of resources."
"I could not help noticing, Mr Verhofstadt, that in your speech you did not once mention the considerable environmental and ecological challenges that we are facing."
"That, unfortunately, may be a sign that the departure of the Greens from your government has perhaps led to a slight reversal in your thinking about the sustainability question."
"Sadly, we also think that to talk about a European army in a situation in which we Europeans shilly-shally in most crises and are forced to follow the United States – and in which our credibility on all human rights issues and on the peace and disarmament question is rapidly losing momentum – clearly, to talk about an army is perhaps too great a leap forwards, and one that we do not endorse."
"Mr Verhofstadt, we are of the opinion that a European Constitution is in fact necessary and that we have to find a way to win the citizens’ support for one, but we shall certainly not be able to do so with more market, more liberalisation and more firepower."
"We shall only succeed by genuinely changing Europe’s policies with a view to greater sustainability."
"."
"Mr President, I should like, if I may, to make a preliminary remark, since we are inaugurating a series of new-style debates today."
"I believe that it is impossible to respond seriously, in three or four minutes, to an speech that lasts three quarters of an hour and that is also in-depth."
"In my opinion, the procedure needs to be revised."
"I have a great deal to say about some of the ideas put forward by Mr Verhofstadt. For example, about the idea of putting the Union’s crisis down mainly to a question of method, which is not federal enough in his opinion, by choosing to overlook the content of the economic and social decisions taken."
"That is an analysis that I regard as inadequate and that my group does not support."
"Or, indeed, about the idea of introducing, in the name of a form of social and economic governance, maximum social levels alongside the minimum levels that already exist."
"I do not really understand his reasoning, which seems to me, in any case, to be heading in the wrong direction."
"I have a great deal to say, too, about Mr Verhofstadt’s appeal for a military Europe and for that military Europe to be thoroughly integrated into NATO, an appeal with which we do not associate ourselves."
"I will not be able to expand on these various points now, because I would like to address another point that I feel Mr Verhofstadt glossed over."
"It concerns what is, in my opinion, our main problem today: I am referring to the reasons for the widening gap between Europeans and the Union."
"The results of the Commission’s consultation do reveal to us, however, some precious information about the cause of this disaffection, and I should like to mention three examples."
"Firstly, 47% of the people polled as part of this consultation see globalisation as a threat to jobs."
"In October 2003, 56% regarded globalisation as a good opportunity; 20% fewer of them think the same today."
"Yet, in October 2003, Europe was no more federal than it is today."
"Here is another result: what do the people polled think about the role played by the European Union in fifteen or so areas ranging from environmental protection to the fight against terrorism, via social policy, with the protection of social rights only appearing at the end of the list?"
"They gave these areas a satisfaction rating of 4.7 out of 10."
"That has nothing to do with the Union’s being more or less federal."
"As regards Europe's ability to combat unemployment, which was consigned to the bottom of the list, the satisfaction rating is 3.8 out of 10."
"This figure, I would point out, is the average across the 25 Member States."
"How would you rate the educational performance of a pupil scoring 3.8 out of 10 in a core subject?"
"That is how people perceive Europe's current ability to deal with the problems linked to globalisation."
"I believe that that is the main problem."
"We cannot cleverly sidestep it."
"Finally, what, in the eyes of most of the Europeans polled, is – and I quote – ‘the key element for the future of Europe’?"
"The most popular answer: to achieve comparable living standards throughout the Union."
"That is the opinion of 51% of those polled in the 25 countries and of as many as 74% in the new Member States."
"Our new fellow citizens obviously have no desire for their countries to form a kind of low-cost or cut-price Europe, which business communities long for."
"To summarise, globalisation is perceived as a threat to the social model, and the single market is not seen as an answer to this fundamental problem."
"These concerns will not be alleviated by the project of a barrier-free transatlantic market, which is on the agenda of the next European Union-United States summit."
"Sidelining this section of the debate once again will not help us, in my opinion, to break the deadlock."
"It is only by accepting real changes, not only institutional ones, but also ones related to economic, social and political lines of action, that we will have the opportunity to breathe life back into the European dream."
"Thank you very much, Mr Wurtz."
"In future debates of this kind we shall consider a more consistent way to allow the chairmen of the political groups to speak."
"For now, however, we must distribute the time in the manner we had planned."
"."
"Mr President, to call this a debate about the future of Europe is frankly farcical."
"What we have here is rather the self-serving political elite talking amongst themselves."
"They could not be epitomised better than by a person like Mr Verhofstadt."
"I must say I find it a bit rich for the Prime Minister of Belgium to come along here and tell 24 other nation states what they should do."
"I say that because perhaps he ought to look a bit more in his own back yard."
"The most recent opinion poll in Belgium – or should I say in Flanders – shows that 51% of people there favour independence from the Belgian state."
"The Vlaams Belang is now the biggest political party in Flanders."
"Is it, Mr Verhofstadt, because you are so embarrassed and ashamed that your own country is falling to pieces, that you come along here to encourage the rest of us to self-destruct as well?"
"I am not sure."
"I suppose there was at least a certain honesty about your speech, because you are an unashamed Euro-nationalist."
"You could not give a damn what ordinary people think."
"You could not give a damn about the referendum results in France and in the Netherlands last year."
"You said yourself today – in that most incredibly arrogant speech – that the whole process of political integration will continue regardless of what the people say."
"What you are doing is threatening the very basis of national self-determination and democracy."
"In the last century, this principle was thought to be so important that if you look in your own back yard, you will see the graves of many British soldiers who went to defend that very principle, on which you now seem to have turned your back."
"It was clear last year!"
"What is it about you, Mr Verhofstadt?"
"What part of the word ‘no’ do you not understand?"
"Calm down, Mr Schulz, calm down."
"Please argue amongst yourselves outside of the Chamber when the sitting is over."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for coming and for starting what is a very important debate, despite the fact that I would not agree with some of his ideas and conclusions."
"The essence of the best idea and the best debate is when you have divergent opinions, coming together to try and garner the best from the situation."
"A number of key elements that were mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech are deserving of more in-depth analysis and comment."
"However, if I may be so bold, I would like to touch on two or three elements."
"With regard to the situation of whether or not the people want Europe or Europe, I would never dare to speak on behalf of all the people of Europe."
"However, I can speak on behalf of the people in my constituency in the south-west of Ireland, whom I met last weekend."
"Out of the 4500 people I met last week in Ireland, 3000 of them brought up issues of European concern that they wanted to see solved."
"Amazingly enough, for all the issues that they brought up, they saw that the best way of getting a solution was at a European level – not at a national level – because they saw there was a bigger picture involved."
"These issues involved the environment, fisheries, free trade and so on. They saw their best hope of advancement on all of these issues coming from a European level."
"People want more Europe in certain areas, but if you tell people in the world, or people in Europe, or people in my country, that they will be part of a European army; that their taxes will be determined by Brussels; that they will have no say with regard to what kind of a police force they will have, they will reject it out of hand."
"This is not because they dispute the argument or the veracity or the genuineness of the argument put forward, but because they see those as red-line issues."
"They see those as issues that are best dealt with by the people in their own country."
"One of the most important issues we have to discover is not to go down the simple road of saying ‘you are either for a federal Europe or against it’."
"Personally, I am against a federal Europe."
"The kind of model that has been successful for Europe has been one that we have created ourselves."
"It is not something that has been copied from some other model."
"It has been a creation out of necessity – the necessity that we now face before us."
"You touched on it yourself, Prime Minister, during your own questions concerning economics and other areas."
"The discussion is now taking place."
"Decisions will have to be taken at some stage in the short term, not in the long term, and such decisions will subsequently need to be properly implemented."
"The Foreign Ministers in Vienna last week were correct when they said it was wrong to call this document a Constitution, because it is not a true Constitution in its right form."
"Call it a for a new Europe, but not a for a new Europe."
"Mr President, the presence here of the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, and the speech he made as part of this debate illustrate perfectly, in fact, everything that is fundamentally going wrong in the European Union, for indeed, the real problem in Europe and with Verhofstadt is that the so-called statesmen no longer display even the most elementary democratic reflexes, are no longer prepared to listen to the people and electorate and are, instead, convinced that they, in their ivory towers, know best."
"In fact, we had another glowing example of this only a few minutes ago."
"Mr Verhofstadt is now urging his European colleagues to ignore the devastating results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands and continue to act as if nothing is wrong."
"Although Mr Verhofstadt is keen to get noticed as the champion of public involvement via referendums, he has not dared organise the promised referendum in his own country."
"Indeed, Mr Verhofstadt’s public involvement cannot be organised until he is certain of being right and not at any risk of losing."
"This European democratic deficit is at its most obvious in the case of Turkey, which threatens to paralyse the entire European system."
"Europe has not run aground as a result of the outspoken, proper and well-founded distrust of the voting public in the Netherlands and in France, but rather because of the reasons that underpin it."
"Europe is stuck because eminent European statesmen refuse to define the territory of the European Union, refuse to restrict the potential accession of new candidate countries to countries that belong to Europe culturally, geographically and historically, which obviously does not include Turkey."
"In fact, Prime Minister Verhofstadt himself is one of the outspoken champions of this Turkish accession and refuses any referendum or democratic input on that subject."
"A month ago, that other ivory-tower sage, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, said that he could see no reason why a debate about the European boundaries should be held, on the grounds that such a debate could not lead anywhere."
"As it happens, the opposite is true."
"Only when the European citizens are reassured that Europe has boundaries, only when they know that their Europe is restricted to countries that have a common basis, something that is essential to them, only when the European citizens discover that their statesmen are once again prepared to listen to their voices and prepared to respect the outcome of democratic referendums, only then, and not before, can European recovery set in."
"I would like to repeat that in that sense, it was good and symbolic that it was none other than Mr Verhofstadt, the man who, in his own country, represents only 15% of the voters, that it was he who should come here to represent the eminent, pedantic eurocrats who are never prepared to listen, that is the role that was made for him."
"As you can see, Mr Verhofstadt, this is a pluralist parliament."
"."
"Mr President, rest assured, I have to face Mr Vanhecke’s cohorts in my own parliament too."
"I notice that there is, in actual fact, little difference between what he says here and what he says in Belgium."
"To him, Europe is just the church tower and nothing else."
"That is why he does not tolerate any further consideration being given to Europe, for he is interested only in what happens in a 5-mile radius around him."
"I, for my part, have a different opinion of Europe."
"I believe that Europe has a destiny and that it must follow that destiny."
"Above all, I believe that the history of Europe moves in a certain direction, and that is something that we must never forget."
"It is in fact history that teaches us what we should do, even if our points of view are sometimes very different."
"There are those who believe that things are moving too quickly or too slowly, or that other concepts should be developed."
"Yet, one thing remains clear, and that is history."
"History teaches us that, when we were divided and inward-looking, Europe was in crisis, a war was being fought, civil wars were constantly being fought."
"I will therefore ask those who now claim that they do not want to enlarge Europe, to include the Balkans, for example: why should these countries be denied stability?"
"If, in fact, they do not join the European Union, we know full well that, in the next two or three years, this part of the world will once again be in the grip of violence and war."
"Naturally, the countries concerned must meet all of the conditions."
"However, those who claim today, , that these countries and these populations cannot join, that there are borders, are actually telling them that they do not want them to enjoy what we have been enjoying for 50 years now in the European Union: peace, stability and well-being."
"That is something that we cannot accept."
"That is the selfishness that was being expressed a short while ago, and we must not give into it now."
"That is the current challenge, not the issue of Turkey."
"Is it not the case that the only reason why Turkey is being used here is as a pretext for displaying selfishness?"
"Turkey is of no consequence to them."
"Whether Turkey joins or not, all that matters is that they can demonstrate that it would be best if we were all to end up self-sufficient."
"That is what the last speeches we heard, including the speech by Mr Farage, who said all kinds of things a moment ago, came down to in practice."
"I can tell you, Mr Farage"
"I can tell you that I am saying thing in the Council as here in Parliament."
"That is absolutely necessary, because you cannot say one thing in the European Council and then the opposite in London or another city in Europe."
"I try to give exactly the same message to both the Council and Parliament."
"Indeed, the most important thing, Mr President, is that, during the Council on 15 and 16 June, which will be a very important Council, we must try to decide together how to continue the process."
"Once again, I have nothing against extending the period of reflection."
"Nonetheless, I am going to ask that consideration also be given to Declaration 30 annexed to the Constitution, which was adopted by the Convention, by the European Council and by the countries of the European Union who ratified the Treaty."
"That does not in any way mean that we carry on regardless whatever the majority of French people or the majority of Dutch people think."
"That is the reason why I am suggesting to you a second strategy, alongside the continuation of the ratification process."
"It is true, indeed, that we have to respond to the expectations of citizens and to their fears."
"We cannot do that by saying to them, ‘There you are, we have a Constitution’."
"Simply waking up one morning to hear that they have a Constitution is not going to reassure them."
"That is not how things work."
"We are the ones, above all, who need the Constitution to make progress on a certain number of things."
"We also need tangible policies and something which, in my opinion, is lacking most of all in the European Union, socio-economic governance."
"Why do you not understand that a monetary Union without a common socio-economic policy and strategy is utterly preposterous!"
"That might already be, as I hope, the conclusion of the Council on 15 and 16 June."
"We would have made a step forward and not only for ourselves or for the institutions."
"Perhaps I should plead guilty, Mr Poettering."
"At the beginning, with the Laeken declaration, we perhaps used the word 'constitution' a bit hastily for the time."
"The fact remains that now we must recognise that we need a twofold strategy."
"There is the Constitution, which we shall perhaps have to renegotiate to achieve unanimity."
"There is also a credible socio-economic policy that you, the Council and Parliament, have to put in place without delay, because that is what people want."
"Therein lies the response to globalisation."
"Europe is not the source of globalisation; no, it is the right answer to globalisation and that is the message that we have not yet adequately developed and put across to the nations of Europe."
"Mr President, the other day in my country, a great Europeanist – Fernando Álvarez de Miranda – told me that the Europeans’ problem is that they have lost their excitement about Europe."
"It is true: we are often Europeans without realising it, and we do not realise what great progress the Union has made; we do not give Europe the credit for it and instead we blame the Union for our little frustrations."
"We are now in this period of reflection, trying to demonstrate that Europe works."
"As you have said, offering an example, I often wonder whether we are doing the right thing."
"For example, we say that Europe must gain legitimacy by creating work; but does Europe – the European Union – have the instruments for creating employment, or are they national instruments?"
"If we set objectives that do not depend on the Union, but on the Member States, and we do not achieve them, then the Union will pay the price."
"I am therefore going to propose to you, Mr Verhofstadt – and you can do this, because you are the Prime Minister of your country – that one day you carry out the following test, in order to demonstrate what life would be like for the citizens if Europe did not exist; you could, for example, on 29 May or 1 June, install border posts between your country and France and between your country and the Netherlands, and at those posts you could put customs officers who could ask the French or Dutch citizens for their passports and tell them that their French car insurance was not valid in Belgium and that they have to take out a green card."
"And on one day – just one day – you could re-establish the Belgian Franc, and the euro would not be legal tender in Belgium and would have to be exchanged; and, when French and Dutch citizens returned to their beautiful countries, Mr President, those customs offices could make them fill out a form indicating the goods that they have bought in your country."
"That would show them what the European Union is, Mr President."
"– Mr President, I am quite delighted that we once again have a statesman who has a vision of Europe, because part of our problem is all this pussy-footing around, this self-doubt, this half-heartedness, this downright fear of taking further steps towards European unity."
"If even political leaders are not committed to Europe, people become disorientated and distrustful."
"Therefore, Mr Verhofstadt, I should like to welcome you, and to thank you for the vision you presented both in your book and here in Parliament."
"You have repeatedly emphasised that the heart of the European idea is political union, not just a huge market."
"The European Economic Community was just a detour that we had to take because the Defence Community did not become a reality."
"That bears repeating, and the Treaties of Rome were preceded by the Messina Declaration."
"I very much welcome the possibility that we might be able to adopt a kind of 'Second Messina Declaration' next spring."
"It will not be called that, but the core could be the same: a renewed commitment to the objectives and grand projects of the EU in the coming years and decades."
"We also need projects that are attractive to the people."
"Once again, we are discussing energy policy."
"We know that, in 20 years' time, 70% of our energy will come from imports from unsafe regions."
"Why do we not have the courage, as Jeremy Rifkin proposed, to launch a third industrial revolution in Europe with a solar hydrogen economy?"
"We need it all: coal, oil, gas, that is business as usual, but this new basis for an energy revolution would be something that many people could approve of, and I would advise you to adopt something like this at the summit in June."
"Mr President, personally, I find it very positive and very encouraging to see, at last, a European head of government pleading, committing himself and even campaigning, in an excellent book that I recommend to you, for a revival of European integration."
"These days that deserves acknowledgement."
"Prime Minister, we agree with your observations."
"Europe is experiencing a crisis of vocation, a crisis of inspiration, and, faced with this situation, the European Council cannot simply extend for a year the period of reflection."
"It is not a wild rush forward that people need."
"What the nations of Europe expect from their politicians is that they put forward a vision and outline perspectives."
"Here I should like to say a word about those perspectives."
"Firstly, we have, as you keep on repeating, an urgent need for economic governance for Europe."
"We have the euro, that is fine, but it is not enough."
"If we want to create growth and employment, we all know that we have to go further and coordinate our economic, budgetary and fiscal policies."
"Secondly, we have an urgent need for new common policies: I am thinking of research and development, I am thinking of defence, I am thinking of the question of energy and its supply and production, and I am thinking also of the question of migration and codevelopment."
"On each of these questions, it would be completely unrealistic, and even misleading, to think or to give the impression that appropriate answers could be found at national level."
"Furthermore, we also urgently need a strengthened European presence in the world in order to create at last a new balance."
"In order to achieve all that, we shall obviously need to draw up a new Constitution that is shorter, simpler, clearer and refocused on the great principles on which our Union is founded."
"This text will have to state who we are and what values and what political project we are defending."
"Prime Minister, you have understood what we are expecting from the next Council."
"It is that, for once, Heads of State or Government should put aside their political scheming and ulterior motives in order to place themselves, quite simply, at the service of the general European interest as a matter of urgency."
"– Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, some thinking is being done in Europe after all, it would appear."
"Who would have thought it?"
"By a Head of Government, in the middle of a pause for reflection; and on the subject of Europe, too."
"I would thank you for your intervention and for the clear and courageous language with which you have broken through the governments’ deafening silence – or, as some people would say, cacophony – and, in this House and in the middle of the crisis, risen above all the internal political considerations and mutterings about renationalisation in order to speak on behalf of Europe."
"To do so is not pleasant, but it is important and significant."
"You have resisted the temptation to manipulate the European debate and the motives of those who voted ‘no’."
"That is currently the big problem, as I see it."
"Almost all the governments now try to attribute to people motives that they did not have, as if those who said ‘no’ had done so not in order to vote in favour of a more democratic and more social Europe that is capable of taking action and in order to direct their protest against Europe as it is at present but, instead, in order to demand less Europe."
"You have, in actual fact, listened to the people and not only to the other governments, as the British and Austrian Presidencies of the Council did."
"You withstood the hubris that persuades us that we were much too quick off the mark with the Constitution, had aimed too high, had asked too much of people and had set our sights too high."
"No, you have been one of the very few people to have understood that the opposite is the case."
"We were too slow and did not aim high enough. Our goals were not magnanimous enough and our visions were unconvincing and our compromises too lazy."
"That is why you call for the crisis to be solved not by slackening our pace nor by being weary, resigned and demagogic, but by taking a clear step forwards."
"Allow me to add just one proposal."
"If we could agree to incorporate this step that you propose into a rider to the Constitution, covering many fields including democracy, social powers and individual responsibility for security, then we need not destroy the constitutional process. Instead, we can show people a clear way forward and a means of progressing further towards a higher goal."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, it is indeed commendable that, with your latest paper and your speech in this House today, you have helped to bring this fatal period for reflection to an end, because – as many of my fellow MEPs have said, and rightly so – it is high time that there was at last further discussion of how Europe is to proceed."
"I personally share your vision of a federal United States of Europe."
"As a member of the Convention to draft the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and also of the Constitutional Convention, the extent to which this idea is really so much pie in the sky became clear to me, however, in the corresponding debates."
"Ideas about how far European integration should now be taken are extremely different, not only between the Member States but also between political forces, indeed even within the political groups, including my own."
"In view of all this, I had never expected, when the Constitutional Convention began, what great strides it would be possible to make in deepening integration and how much more it would be possible to achieve in terms of democracy, citizens’ rights and the strengthening of a polity based on social welfare."
"The Constitution constitutes huge progress for Europe and, at the same time, reflects the political consensus that has been achieved."
"A member of my own party very recently spoke of it contemptuously as old, unpalatable rubbish, but it really is nothing of the kind."
"Neither the progress made nor the consensus achieved should be put at risk."
"That, Mr Verhofstadt, is precisely why I do not share your concept of the eurozone states, nor Mr Sarkozy’s alternative concept of what he calls the pioneer group."
"In my view, both models are already unrealistic because, in the course of last year, two founder states quite obviously lost the title, ‘pioneer of Europe’."
"The fact that Commission President Barroso has still not understood the signs of the times is shown by his agenda, which is purportedly citizen-friendly but which, in my opinion, amounts to nothing other than a return to Nice."
"I am convinced that it is only as a social Europe that our continent will be equipped to face the future, and on this matter I share Mr Juncker’s opinion."
"In receiving the International Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen, an award on which I should like to congratulate him, Dr Juncker rightly pointed out that Europe would founder if, in the next few years, it did not succeed in becoming a social Europe, for example through having a basic minimum of employees’ rights, valid throughout Europe."
"It is a pity that you have said so little about this."
"Mr President, we are, today, debating with an honest advocate of a United States of Europe."
"He does not hide his goal."
"He does not deny the facts."
"He has even written a courageous, self-critical Laeken Declaration containing a critique of the EU as it currently exists, and one with which most critics of the EU would concur."
"Unfortunately, it was overlooked in the constitutional Convention, and that courage failed him when Belgium was to ratify the Constitution."
"That was the end of his desire to get closer to the people through openness and democracy."
"The views of the Belgians were not to be heard through a referendum."
"The people of Belgium were not to be given the opportunity to vote ‘no’ to the Constitution, like the linguistic cousins of the Flemings in the Netherlands or those of the Walloons in France."
"The United States of Europe – yes – but not by asking the people."
"Take heart, Mr Verhofstadt."
"Take your colleagues with you in burying this rejected Constitution."
"Organise direct elections to a new convention."
"Get proposals drawn up that can then be put to referendums in every country at the same time."
"Until then, open up all meetings where laws are adopted."
"Put every document on the Internet."
"Allow the national parliaments to vote on the annual legislation programme."
"Allow the Commissioners to appear in the European Committees of their national parliaments and thus to be in touch with their national democracies."
"Promise that you will never again give Belgium's support to a law that has not first achieved a majority in either the Belgian Parliament or the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the European Union today faces a fundamental choice: whether or not to take on an additional set of tasks, expand its authority, and ultimately collapse under the weight of too much business."
"In my opinion the rejected draft Constitutional Treaty offers this very prospect."
"Our limitations have recently made themselves painfully clear when dealing with conflicts of interest between Member States in the context of the northern gas pipeline project."
"The European Union was powerless not for lack of a constitution, but for lack of political will."
"There is, however, an alternative: let us concentrate on the specific matters that are already on the table, such as improving the operation of the common market and the euro zone and improving cooperation between countries on security and on internal affairs, and ultimately on cohesion policy."
"The shorter the list, the easier the public will find it to understand our aims."
"Mr Poettering, please refrain from blackmailing us with the choice between an energy policy with the Constitutional Treaty or none at all."
"Let us start discussions on what really does bind us, let us write these aims down and then implement them."
"This would provide a good basis for an amended treaty."
"Yet let us not do it by hastily and arrogantly incorporating each policy into procedures and institution."
"Let us do it without including tasks that are impossible to implement at Community level."
"Let us first find the basis and substance for a common policy, or in other words what actually binds us, because no procedures on earth are capable of creating a common position where no such substance exists."
"An outstanding performance, Mr Verhovstadt."
"If I were a judge in a figure-skating competition, I would give very good marks for artistic performance, but less on the technical aspect."
"You wondered and even asked a question as to why the citizens of Europe do not trust the European Union."
"I can give you the example of Slovakia and the new Member States: we had to meet very strict criteria for full membership."
"We have been full members for two years now, and you can see whether the ideals of the European Union have been fulfilled."
"Restrictions on free movement, transitional periods limit employment opportunities; the Services Directive has not been adopted, inadequate and incomplete access to health services, etcetera. Is it possible for one of the founding Member States, France, not to support the Constitutional Treaty, with Strasbourg being the seat of the European Parliament and the former French president, Valéry Giscard d´Estaing, chairing the Convention to draw up the constitutional treaty?"
"All of these are questions in which our citizens see a disparity between words and deeds."
"Have you thought about the real situation as regards meeting the targets of the Lisbon Strategy?"
"Mr. Prime Minister, I ask you, wake up!"
"We are already half-way through the period, and we should have had results by now."
"It is too late in the day to speak about what should have been done."
"At least say in your closing speech what needs to be done now, what needs to be done tomorrow, and what needs to be done in a month’s time."
"Mr President, I, in turn, should like to express my delight at this debate, which I hope will be the first of many, because I think that in debates with heads of government, Parliament can also do its bit to get things going."
"I rejoice at Mr Verhofstadt’s coming here to set the ball rolling, for he is indeed one of the people who made an active contribution during the period of reflection."
"I broadly support his twin-track approach, which amounts to continuing the ratification process while at the same time taking initiatives rather than resting on our laurels."
"I do not see eye to eye with him, though, when he claims that we can meanwhile indulge in unbridled enlargement."
"While I am not opposed to enlargement, I do fear that further enlargement without deepening the European Union will lead to something we do not want, namely a free-trade zone."
"What I do think is that we should try even harder to explain to our citizens that the right response to what scares them at present, namely the changes and globalisation, is not to withdraw into some sort of economic patriotism or nationalism, but that only a European response is a real response to globalisation; and that this also means that Europe must adjust to the new concept of globalisation and the information society, and we will only succeed if we join forces within Europe."
"Indeed, only as one Europe can we be a real global actor that defends our interests and values in this global world of tomorrow."
"Our citizens are, at present not yet aware of this; they still believe that they will manage by closing themselves off from the outside world."
"We must tell them that globalisation is irreversible, that it will happen without Europe if we do not take a tough line."
"We can play a very strong role in globalisation, provided Europe is strong."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, I should like, while thanking Mr Verhofstadt for his excellent and determined speech, to look again at two aspects."
"The first aspect is the time factor."
"Mr Verhofstadt emphasised the problem of the Lisbon process."
"We have no time to lose."
"Five years for the Community patent is stupid."
"Furthermore, I should like to say that the Heads of State or Government have a very great responsibility regarding the financial perspective with, for example, the research programme which has less money, in real terms, in 2007, 2008 and 2009 than in 2006."
"There is surely a basic contradiction there between talk and reality."
"I think that the method too – open coordination – has been shown to be inadequate."
"The instruments of Community policy, therefore, are not supported in the budget."
"Consequently, it is not possible to make a policy that is grounded in real circumstances."
"The second aspect on which I should like to elaborate, very briefly, of course, is the social aspect."
"We have spoken of the rejection of the Constitution."
"It is true, and you quite rightly made reference to it, that the social aspect was there 50 years ago: there was hope of social improvement after the war."
"Nowadays, people do not have that feeling."
"Therefore, one priority would be, in the same way that the Europe of monetary unity was created from the European currency snake, to create a European social snake that would make it possible to realise tangible achievements in this field too."
"Mr President, the Prime Minster said that we should try for the four-fifths of Member States before the European Council would be able to – or should – discuss the crisis."
"But the European Council could, and in my view should, discuss the crisis today."
"In June, the summit should set itself a rendezvous with a clear decision towards the end of 2007, to establish a fresh intergovernmental conference with the purpose of modifying and improving the Treaty."
"It should seek to ring-fence the first and second parts."
"In part three, it should focus on strengthening the economic governance of the Union, advancing the Lisbon Agenda and strengthening the autonomy of the eurozone."
"Secondly, it should seek to reform the European social model."
"Thirdly, it should aim to upgrade the combating of climate change to establish a good context for the reform of the common agricultural policy and the construction of a common energy policy."
"Fourthly, it should speak of the process and threshold of adhesion and flesh out the policy on neighbourhood, which we have in draft form."
"Finally, it should complete the revision of the financial system of the EU, to produce a fair, transparent and buoyant budget that will permit us to match financial resources to our policy objectives."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, I feel I must applaud your resoluteness."
"I just have time to comment on one point only: your two-track strategy."
"First of all, and I think Mrs Frassoni has already said this: ‘yes’ to the continuation of the ratification process."
"Having said that, the two tracks should intersect and intertwine."
"I mean that the provisions governing the institutions must be consistent with your political priorities."
"Thus, you will not get very far with the Eurogroup process if the decisions are not taken by a qualified majority in fiscal matters, at least on certain issues."
"You will not get very far either in matters of foreign policy and defence unless you have a budget that has been granted independent financing."
"In this respect, I shall make it clear that I have no problem with the European Army if its purpose is the prevention of conflicts."
"Therefore, Mr Verhofstadt, we must prepare ourselves to renegotiate the Constitutional Treaty on two or three specific points."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that the current provisions in the Treaty, concerning the flexibility clause and enhanced cooperation, are inadequate and that, consequently, from this point of view, especially if we wish to continue with enlargement, countries that wish to forge ahead should be allowed to do so."
"You say it in your book; you have not said it enough, in my opinion, in your speech but I am sure that you think it and, therefore, I support you in this."
"Mr President, this debate reminds me a little of a famous sketch by the British TV comedians Monty Python."
"In the sketch, a man returns to a pet shop in order to complain about a dead parrot."
"Despite the fact that the parrot is clearly dead, the salesman in the shop refuses to accept this and instead produces a series of bizarre excuses."
"The parrot can be compared with the EU Constitution, and the salesman with the political elite of the EU."
"It is time to realise that the parrot really is dead."
"Only then can the debate about the future of Europe be meaningful again."
"In actual fact, the voters of France and the Netherlands sent us a loud and clear message."
"They want more democracy and less control from the centre."
"They want less free market forces and more social responsibility."
"This, and not the Constitution, is the key to better cooperation in Europe."
"Mr President, it is the nation state that is the bearer of democracy in Europe."
"Democracy as a political system requires a demos, a people whose citizens recognise a strong sense of community with each other and who are therefore prepared to take an extensive degree of responsibility for one another."
"A demos has common cultural traditions and a common history."
"A demos has a common political arena in which debate can take place and where conflicts can be analysed and resolved by democratic means."
"A demos has a national identity which shapes the very soil from which democracy can grow and in which it can stand tall and survive trials and tribulations."
"Mr Verhofstadt is a typical representative of the euro-elite who believe that it is possible to replace national identities with a rapidly assembled European identity in which a flag, national anthem and national day can be quickly launched, pretty much like the new currency."
"By attempting to push through a political union that lacks legitimacy in the eyes of Europeans, the EU establishment risks creating grass-roots opposition to the whole integration project."
"Mr Verhofstadt scornfully calls the freedom for us Europeans to trade with one another, settle where we want, study where we want and invest where we want ‘just a free trade zone’."
"Freedom, however, is not ‘just’ anything."
"Rather, ‘Freedom is the best thing that can be sought the whole world over’, to quote an old Swedish folk song from the Middle Ages."
"I would like to remind you that if, with the aid of a constitution, we attempt to force on the Member States a policy that will always lack the support of the people, we will be heading for the collapse of the European Union."
"Mr President, nobody needs reminding of how important the planned accession of Bulgaria and Romania into our ranks will be to the development of the European Union."
"We must be mindful of the fact that this is a momentous occasion, particularly in geopolitical and cultural terms."
"Both the candidate countries are on the Balkan Peninsula, which has historically been known as Europe’s soft underbelly."
"The accession of Bulgaria will also mean the EU entering the field of eastern culture."
"The Community’s expansion in that direction should therefore be prudent and responsible."
"That is why I would like to warn against the recently-expressed reservations about the reforms in Romania and Bulgaria, which in my view are over the top."
"This is the only way in which ill-considered accusations against these countries regarding widespread corruption can be interpreted."
"Those who express such accusations should bear in mind that in Bulgaria and Romania, more than in any other European countries, corruption is a legacy of the Communist past."
"The post-Soviet structures, which remained untouched for many years, became a source of bribery and other criminal activity."
"We should also bear in mind that Europe itself is partly responsible for this state of affairs, by not giving sufficient support to de-Communisation and vetting movements."
"The European Union has come into being thanks to the integration of nations."
"However, this is only possible through a mutual understanding of their legacies and problems, because that is the only way in which a partnership can be built."
"Mr President, if ever I doubted the validity of my Euroscepticism, today I discovered that 45 turgid minutes of Eurofanaticism from the Prime Minister of Belgium was the perfect antidote."
"The speech demonstrated that the political elites’ claim to be listening to the people of Europe is as phoney as the latest suggestion of a cosmetic stunt of dropping the title ‘Constitution’."
"France and Holland emphatically rejected the Constitution, so we slapped a gagging order on the countries which it was feared might also say ‘No’."
"Though it was called a period of reflection, its effect was to stop votes in sceptical countries."
"However, where ratification was assured, it was pushed through, and every time there was such a meaningless exercise, Europhiles were on hand to jump up and make the crass assertion ‘You see! The Constitution is not dead!’."
"It is easy to win the game when you lock up the opposition in the changing room."
"The last eurobarometer poll showed the European project has never been less loved."
"With citizens seeking less Europe, this House and our guest today arrogantly demand more Europe, more EU competences, more majority voting, more centralisation, more and more and more!"
"Why do you not listen?"
"Stop digging!"
"Heed the clamour for more state rights, not centralisation; more local control, not ‘Brusselisation’."
"Face up to it: the goal of ever-closer, stultifying political union is simply unobtainable!"
"Mr President, Prime Minister, sadly I have to decline the generous request for solidarity on the Constitution, but I am glad that we can now have a serious debate on the future of Europe."
"Europe needs a debate and European leaders need to hear and understand what people are saying to them, especially following the meeting of Foreign Ministers at the weekend."
"Apparently no one at that meeting pronounced the Constitution dead."
"However, the Dutch Foreign Minister has said on a number of occasions that following the ‘no’ vote in his country’s referendum last year, that is in fact the position."
"Who is right?"
"We need to know."
"The Ministers agreed to let the discussion run for at least another year."
"I think that is a mistake."
"No one seriously believes that the Constitution can credibly be presented again to the peoples of France and the Netherlands, who have already spoken."
"That would only serve to fuel the sense among our peoples that the EU remains oblivious to their concerns and priorities."
"The whole point of the Laeken declaration in 2001 was that the EU needed to find ways of getting closer to its citizens and making the institutions more transparent and accountable."
"The Constitution sadly failed those basic tests."
"However, I am glad that the Foreign Ministers agreed that there would be no Constitutional cherry-picking while the debate goes on."
"Of course the future of the EU is a very important subject: the kind of Europe we want to live in is important for our countries and peoples."
"I have a very positive vision of a Europe of nation states working ever more closely together."
"I want to see the EU move on to a new agenda: a reforming agenda that tackles effectively the sense of alienation between the institutions of Brussels; a reforming agenda that works for fundamental economic reform through liberalisation and more open markets, and puts growth at the forefront of its priorities."
"I also want to see greater and more effective intergovernmental cooperation in tackling environmental challenges and fighting the scourge of terrorism."
"The great error of Europe’s leaders is to assume that none of the great challenges facing us can be met without a Constitution."
"I think that they can."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to wholeheartedly endorse the positive contribution made by Mr Verhofstadt, who, in considering both the short and long-term future of the Union, is swimming against the current."
"It is a praiseworthy initiative, in my view."
"Reality is hard."
"Cut-throat competition at Member-State level is taking the place of organising fair competition at corporate level."
"The Commission is rudderless and hardly ever tables fresh legislation."
"In its recent communication of last week, it pays hardly any attention to socio-economic aspects, despite the fact that people want jobs and social security."
"It is highly likely that the Council will extend the period of reflection, and to it and to the Commission, I would like to say that the period of reflection is too long."
"You can continue to reflect and what is more, I doubt whether everyone is thinking as hard as they make out to be, as I have not seen much in the way of results."
"I should like to urge you to reflect on the words of Romano Prodi."
"Would it not be easier to get out of the institutional crisis if we were to concentrate on the fundamental issue in hand, namely the rules of this House?"
"Would it not be an idea to ask our electorate to speak out about this in European elections?"
"Whilst the United States of Europe is a long-term vision, people’s socio-economic concerns require prompt answers today."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, I should like to thank the President for organising this debate and congratulate Mr Verhofstadt on the views he has expressed."
"Some of us are acquainted with his very pro-active approach, but at times like these – amidst growing euro-scepticism and pessimism – a positive take such as his is more than welcome."
"I am indebted to him for this."
"I am also grateful that this debate has happened at all, because it looks to me that both the Prime Minister’s speech and the speeches of a number of our fellow Members, including group chairmen, managed to lay bare the main areas of concern that we face."
"I would first of all like to mention the schizophrenia among Heads of Government, Heads of State and ministers who meet to take joint decisions on average once a month, in the case of ministers, and four times a year in the case of Heads of State or Government, without whose permission nothing can be done in Europe."
"After their meetings, they go home and act as if they have nothing to do with this whole European business, as a result of which, of course, there is, inevitably, huge distrust on the part of the public."
"As you said yourself, Prime Minister, if something has gone right, then they, and they alone, take the credit; if something went wrong, then Brussels is obviously to blame."
"This is what I would call schizophrenia."
"Many Members also mentioned masochism."
"So many Heads of Government, Heads of State or Members of this House are enormously eloquent in underlining the EU’s shortcomings, but never mention what it does right."
"In the final analysis, Mr Verhofstadt, I think you have shown the way forward in saying that we should look for ‘and/and’, rather than ‘either/or’ solutions."
"I think that that is the way we can leave the crisis behind."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr Verhofstadt, thank you for taking such a pro-active line."
"I agree with you that the period of reflection is likely to prove fruitless."
"We need more."
"We should continue the referendums, even though there is the real risk that at the end of the ride, we will not make the four-fifths majority."
"I welcome the idea of using specific projects as means of continuing to put Europe on the map."
"In fact, this Parliament has taken the lead in that respect by making Europe more social, rejecting the Port Directive and amending the Bolkestein Directive."
"I am, moreover, surprised that the day before yesterday, the Belgian Government abstained during the Council vote on this Bolkestein Directive."
"Take Europe further by means of specific projects?"
"We are all for it, Prime Minister, but we need funds, and we have settled on financial perspectives that are very tight, absolutely below par and that amount, in fact, to an abdication."
"That, Prime Minister, is where the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council all went wrong."
"We acted like , and that is something for which we will pay the price in time to come."
"– Mr President, if we really want to debate the future of Europe, we need to ask ourselves who we want to participate in this debate."
"If a debate is held of the citizens, the workers and their bodies, then there is no need for us to wonder why any constitution will be undemocratic."
"The European Union also needs to accept that the neoliberalisation doctrine is of no benefit to the citizens, that a foreign policy linked to ΝΑΤΟ rather than to the principles of the UN is not a just policy."
"Similarly, if the dialogue starts with the aim of demonstrating that everything is working fine, then the peoples will speak again as they did in the referenda."
"Finally, we need to avoid insistences that there should be a European Constitution by 2009, as the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs has also said."
"No strategy can dress up something that remains the same."
"– Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, Europe is a great ideal: it is both our history and our future."
"Europe is our culture, our values and our Western civilisation, which believes in freedom, tolerance, the importance of the individual, and peace, and which therefore cannot relinquish its Christian roots."
"That is why we must not think of the Union merely as a bureaucracy divorced from the people and an institution concerned only with laying down rules about countless petty issues."
"In order to involve people’s minds – that is the problem – we need a Europe that offers solutions to people’s most important demands, as provided for in the text of the Constitutional Treaty signed in Rome."
"To overcome the current crisis, the Union needs a treaty that brings Europe closer to its people."
"We therefore place great trust in the German Presidency to achieve a goal towards which we are all striving."
"Europe needs to become stronger within a context of vital transatlantic relations."
"It needs political unity in order to address a number of major challenges: first, the fight against terrorism, in order to build peace in the Middle East and the Balkans; second, growth and development by means of the Lisbon process, but without breaking certain rules to which science, too, must be subject, and the liberalisation of the services market as quickly as possible; third, the economic and commercial confrontation with China and India, two major emerging countries that are, however, preparing to form an alliance with each other; the fourth challenge is the energy question, not forgetting the nuclear option; the fifth is immigration and the African emergency; and the sixth is expansion of our borders, starting with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and then that of Croatia, without closing the door on other candidate countries."
"We shall only overcome these challenges if we succeed in transforming today’s Europe, which is too tied up in bureaucracy, into a Europe of the people, of policies and of values."
"Mr President, Mr De Gaulle said one should, and I quote, ‘go to the complex Orient with simple ideas’."
"I suggest that you apply this formula to the Constitution."
"I am French and I start from a premise that is probably obvious: The French will not vote again on the same text."
"Let us start from there."
"Let us go even to the end of the ratifications."
"Personally, I want that, it is a right for nations and it is a duty for leaders."
"It will probably result in a few more rejections but we shall take it to the end."
"That means that, whatever happens, some new thing will be needed – I say ‘thing’ to avoid words that cause annoyance."
"We go, therefore, to the end with as many ratification procedures as there are countries, that is to say not 25 but 27 with the Romanians and the Bulgarians, whom we are always forgetting because their accession is as good as ratified, as it is included in the Treaty."
"We go round all the countries, therefore, but that could begin all over again endlessly."
"Here, then, I agree with your idea: we have to scrap unanimity."
"We have to break down the barriers and to do that we have to rewrite Declaration 30 differently."
"In this way, if, when the time comes, for example, 22 out of 27 countries say ‘yes’ and 5 say ‘no’, the 5 who say ‘no’ either accept the majority rule or they stand down."
"Otherwise, we shall go round and round in circles, and from postponement to postponement and from reflection to reflection."
"Whatever happens, it will not be the same text and another ratification process will be needed, otherwise I wager we shall find ourselves here in the same situation year after year."
"– I should like to begin by congratulating you, Prime Minister, on your speech, which struck a rare note of both vision and realism."
"You touched on a number of points, and, though it would be useful, it would be impossible to discuss all of them."
"I shall speak about one, the Lisbon Strategy, which is the issue that over the past five years has left us most open to ridicule."
"The Lisbon Strategy is a delightful set of intentions, yet commits the cardinal sin of not being a Community strategy, as you correctly pointed out."
"That is a cardinal sin, but we have then gone on to commit the truly deadly sin of not rectifying it; in other words, we have failed to give the Commission the responsibility and the resources to make proposals on areas such as the internal market and the single currency."
"We still confuse intentions with workable, measurable objectives, and objectives with the activities needed to achieve those objectives."
"I know that you understand this kind of language, Prime Minister."
"If we continue with the rhetoric of the Lisbon Strategy, rather than practical measures, we might have good governance, good institutions and good ideas."
"We will not have jobs or satisfaction for our citizens."
"– Mr President, the Chairman of my group, Mr Schulz, said that he would like to see more Heads of Government like Mr Verhofstadt."
"I should like to continue with this theme and say that I should like, in particular, to see a Commission President with so much commitment to standing up for Europe’s future."
"I shall continue from where the previous speaker left off."
"In criticising the defective economic and social policy, he highlighted, among other things, the Lisbon Process and this open method of coordination."
"I believe that this method is a particularly good example of the principle of subsidiarity being misunderstood, as the Member States formally insist on their powers in these areas but are, in fact, unaware, or only partially aware, of what these specifically amount to."
"The consequence of all this is that the damage is taken to have been caused by the European Union, and the Member States are not seen as being responsible."
"We know that our shortcomings in terms of economic and social policy are not, unfortunately, all going to be solved by means of this Constitutional Treaty. These shortcomings were also the basis of our failure in the Convention, as we achieved almost nothing, or not very much, in this area."
"My question is now as follows: what solutions, other than the opportunities in the eurozone that have been pointed out, do you envisage whereby, in spite of holding on to this Constitutional Treaty, we can secure what is contained in the Treaty with a view nonetheless to making further progress in this area?"
"– Mr President, I greatly welcome the debate we are holding today, because we must be clear that over the past year we in Parliament have squandered the period of reflection that was originally announced."
"I also get the impression that Parliament has become entrenched in its previous positions, with supporters remaining supporters, and opponents remaining opponents."
"We have not sought any real ways out of the constitutional crisis facing Europe."
"In the meantime, expert bodies have put forward at least a dozen different solutions to the constitutional crisis."
"I would like to mention one of them in detail, because I would like all Members present to take note of it."
"It is the variant of the ‘small constitution’, or in other words the implementation of those provisions of the present document that are most constitutional in character, by which I mean the provisions of Sections One and Two, in a constitution."
"Those provisions that are more executive in nature would then be implemented by way of reforms of primary legislation and through the use of secondary legislative instruments."
"Given the fiasco of the referenda in France and the Netherlands, it appears that we should do all we can to defend the Constitutional Treaty."
"This is justified by the answers to the following three questions."
"Firstly, do we really want a more far-reaching European Union, or in other words do we want more Europe?"
"The answer to this question, at least in my political circles, is yes, we do want more Europe, because only deeper integration makes a stronger, more effective and more democratic EU possible."
"The second question is whether we want a constitution."
"Yes, we do want a constitution, because the constitution provides us with the chance of a stronger, more effective and more democratic EU."
"Finally, the third question is whether we want this particular Constitutional Treaty."
"Yes we do, but not at all costs."
"We have to accept political reality and be as flexible as possible and only put in place solutions that are attainable in the given situation."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, it is clear that we are building the future Europe for its citizens, and that they have to answer the question of what kind of Europe they want and within which borders."
"We were supposed to come up with the answers during the period of reflection, but this period has not been a success."
"There have been no national debates and no support from the European institutions, in particular the Council, which after the ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands adopted a wait-and-see attitude."
"Europe has fallen into lethargy, and for that reason I would like to ask you, Mr Verhofstadt, at the June session of the Council, to ask the leaders of those countries which have postponed the ratification process what they intend to do now and what their plans are."
"Please do not accept the answer that it is an internal affair, because it is not."
"Ratification of an international treaty is an obligation for the countries that have signed it."
"It is also a test of their credibility and of their capacity to cooperate in international relations."
"Finally I would like to point out that in my country, Poland, where the ratification process was postponed, the latest public opinion surveys show that almost 80% of the Polish population supports Europe, and that people want a larger Europe, a Europe built on the principles of equality and a Europe that is not only prosperous, but that is just and democratic and that displays solidarity."
"Mr President, this debate has been a clash of two pessimisms."
"On the one hand, there is the pessimism of the most enthusiastic Europeans, who sometimes speak as if the European Union were in terminal crisis; as if very little has been achieved over the last 50 years; as if it is just a free-trade area and that we still need to build a political Europe, as if what we have is somehow not political."
"On the other hand, there are the fears and the pessimisms of the anti-Europeans, who seem to think that we have already built not just a federal system, but a centralised superstate with everything being decided not just in this Parliament, but by the Commission."
"Neither fear is an accurate representation of reality."
"The reality is that the Union has a solid set of achievements to its credit, but with shortcomings."
"The Constitution was intended to address these shortcomings with sets of reforms that, although not very radical, would be useful."
"Surely it is right that we take the time to complete the period of reflection and try first to save the Constitution – or most of it – before calling for a two-speed Europe and going down that road."
"Tempting as it is to build Europe without France, it would surely be better to try to bring France on board first."
"– Mr Verhofstadt, I believe that today you have written the next chapter of your book , which I, like many others, read with great attention and pleasure."
"Because your book lacked a section about ‘what to do’ following its analysis of what we need, and today you have said it very clearly: to continue with the process of ratifying the European Constitution."
"Why continue with the process of ratifying the European Constitution?"
"So that we have more countries that have ratified it, of course, but also in order to make the period of reflection real."
"For what purpose?"
"In order to explain to the citizens what it will cost us not to have the Constitution or, to put it in positive terms, the added value that the European Constitution will provide."
"The time will come when we find a solution in order to unblock this constitutional crisis."
"It will be after the French and Dutch elections."
"I would say to you that, since the Constitution was drawn up amongst governments and parliaments within a Convention, this crisis must be resolved amongst governments and parliaments."
"I believe that that was one of the great conclusions of the Parliamentary Forum of 8 and 9 May, which had a very positive result."
"We must be orthodox in terms of the content of the Constitution, but heterodox in terms of the ultimate solution."
"I believe that, in this regard, we in this House agree with you."
"Mr President, I have two points and one question."
"My first point is that the Prime Minister is one of the best defenders of Europe."
"I was in Nice as a civil servant when he defended a stronger Europe, easier decision-making and qualified majority voting."
"He was able to hold the meeting hostage to the last minute and he is one of the few who actually defends a truly federal Europe today."
"There are not too many ‘federalists’ out there: there are many closet federalists, but not many real federalists any more."
"I really commend him and congratulate him on that."
"I am glad that some prime ministers are still European."
"My second point concerns the controversy about the name of the Constitution."
"I heard the debate with the Foreign Ministers and I disagree with those who wish to change the name."
"The name of a ‘Constitutional Treaty’ describes what it is perfectly: it has constitutional elements and it is an international treaty."
"That treaty’s name was conceived in Joschka Fischer’s speech in May 2000 – six years ago."
"What responsible parent, six years after christening a child, would go ahead and change its name?"
"It would lose its identity."
"So let us not try to hide things."
"Problems do not go away with the change of a name."
"Finally, the Prime Minister suggested that there should be a core group around the euro countries."
"Could he be more specific?"
"Mr President, I am happy that Estonia has been mentioned several times this afternoon, because the Estonian Parliament recently ratified the Constitutional Treaty and hopefully re-launched the process of ratification to reach the number 20."
"I must admit that, compared with when I was a member of the European Convention, I am much more convinced of closer cooperation between members of the European Union."
"It is very clear that a Europe of 500 million cannot rely on and cannot work on the basis of the Nice Treaty."
"I am absolutely in favour of Prime Minister Verhofstadt’s idea that we need courageous leadership, because without determination and clear convictions we cannot convince our voters to support this project."
"Therefore we need to stop speaking half-truths; we need to stop saying one thing in the European Council and then another thing at home; we need to stop thinking in practical terms about forthcoming elections."
"Our voters know when we are speaking half-truths and if we are not showing clear conviction."
"Finally, we must not isolate ourselves."
"We need transatlantic cooperation – the next item on the agenda this afternoon – to strengthen the project, and I will fully support that idea."
"."
"Mr President, straight away I must thank all those who have taken part in this debate."
"I shall begin with the question of Declaration 30 because this Declaration has quite a strange history."
"The principle of four fifths of Member States was already present in the original proposals that were presented by the Prodi Commission."
"It appeared there, however, in order to state that if four fifths of the Member States ratified the treaty, then we would go ahead, which was naturally unacceptable to certain members of the European Council."
"Subsequently, we, the Convention and then the Intergovernmental Conference, wanted to retain this concept of four fifths."
"How was the matter to be presented?"
"We could not say that if four fifths of the Member States ratified the Treaty, we would go ahead with it, because that would amount after all to abolishing the unanimity rule, which indeed will need to happen one day."
"The Americans did it in 1787 on the occasion of the Philadelphia Convention. It was a seizure of power by 9 out of the 13 States that existed at the time."
"What had to be done, therefore, in order to retain the four-fifths concept?"
"In the end the following wording was decided on: ‘the matter will be referred to the European Council’."
"This is what is stated in the Declaration annexed to the Treaty, while in reality the concept of four fifths has a very different origin since, in the beginning, there was no question of organising a debate within the European Council."
"The motive behind this concept, a motive which stems from the Convention and the proposals of the Prodi Commission, and ultimately was not taken up in the final text, neither by the Convention nor by the Intergovernmental Conference, was to find a solution to a particular situation."
"Who did they have in mind, then, in relation to this concept?"
"Certainly not the French, but rather that part of the Union that is on the side of Mr Kirkhope and others, a part anyway that is on the other side of the Channel."
"That is what they had in mind."
"They said: if everyone says ‘yes’ and the British say ‘no’, we shall still see each other within the European Council so that we can carry on."
"That was the motive behind the four fifths."
"Lo and behold, it is the wretched French who vote ‘no’, and present us with the problem of the application of the four fifths."
"In substance, I am in agreement: the ideal would be to have a system where unanimity disappeared and was replaced by something else, a European referendum or a four-fifths majority, for example."
"To achieve that, however, we should have to have referendums, popular consultations, and in the countries who voted ‘no’ as well."
"That is the reason why I am talking about a second track."
"You can do anything: continue with ratification, fine, I am asking for that; make use of the four fifths principle, fine; extend the period of reflection, fine; organise an Intergovernmental Conference as Mr Duff is asking, fine, but all that still means years and years of work."
"This work, between you and me, is going to be very interesting but it would really be a serious error not to do something else straightaway."
"We are going, therefore, to consider the four fifths, Declaration 30 and an Intergovernmental Conference; and we shall perhaps make this or that change to the draft Constitution, otherwise it will never be acceptable in the two countries that said ‘no’."
"All these things are obvious and constitute, indeed, the first track to be followed."
"It would be a gross error, however, not to open up straight away a second track that does not require amending the Treaty."
"Now, all the things I spoke about in my introduction, all the proposals that I made require no amendment to the Treaty."
"Another big advantage is that France and the Netherlands are already part of the Euro zone."
"There is no need for us to initiate a great debate to find out whether or not they wish to participate."
"The second aspect that I wish to emphasise regarding cooperation within the Euro zone is that it is an open cooperation, it is not a closed club, it is a reality that exists and which will grow with the entry of Slovenia by 1 January 2007 at the latest."
"I do not know whether the Ecofin Council has completed its scrutiny of the other countries, on the basis of the opinion of the Commission and the European Central Bank, but these countries will join nonetheless, maybe not in 2007, but then it will be 1 January 2008."
"It is therefore certain that this group will continue to grow."
"Why not move forward with it in real terms?"
"Because if the citizens said ‘no’ at the time of the referendum in France, it is because there is no socio-economic convergence and because there is no way to respond to their expectations at the social level."
"Consequently, we have to follow the two tracks and, if it is true that it would be a mistake to abandon ratification of the Constitution, it would be another grave mistake to straight away take the other track, that of the socio-economic governance that everyone wants."
"That is perhaps the most important conclusion that one can draw from the referendum in France and indeed also in the Netherlands."
"As someone, I think it was my predecessor, Jean-Luc Dehaene, said: I am not advocating enlargement now and not doing all the rest, I am advocating doing both at the same time."
"For it to be possible to do both at the same time, however, one must have the courage, again this year, or, at the latest, next year, to initiate socio-economic governance in the European Union."
"Otherwise, once again, for year after year, we shall be fighting, talking away endlessly about the Constitution, and consequently losing even more the support of the citizens of the European Union."
"Thank you very much, Prime Minister."
"This has certainly been an interesting debate."
"We thank you very much for dedicating all of your time and your intellect to the debate on the future of Europe."
"– The dominant forces in Parliament continue their fools’ crusade, promoting ad nauseam the inappropriately named European Constitution, which would strengthen federalism, neoliberalism and militarism in the EU."
"These forces and the interests that they represent – indeed, it is no coincidence that the chairman of the European employers’ association UNICE came to Parliament to reaffirm to some MEPs his support for the so-called Constitution – continue to peddle the line, against all the evidence, that the problem is one of form rather than content. That is to say, it is not a political problem of EU policy but a problem of communication and perception."
"In so doing, they are blinding themselves to reality."
"The resolution that they have put forward for the vote at the next plenary session of Parliament is indicative of their true objectives."
"In a display of contempt for the will expressed by the French and Dutch people, as well as other people who have not been allowed to express the same opinion, the dominant forces in Parliament have imposed a constitutional agreement and their own support for the European Constitution, by rejecting amendments and pressing ahead with ratifications in the countries that rejected the Treaty – with the use of Community funding – by the time of the next elections to Parliament in June 2009."
"In a word, unacceptable."
"The European Union has a clear idea of the future of its operation until the number of its Member States reaches 27."
"This is expected to be achieved on 1 January 2007."
"It has now become imperative that we find answers to the questions regarding a unified Europe, the existing unified will for development, and the Constitution."
"Where to now, Europe?"
"Are we going to achieve the vision of a federal European State, as advocated by Jacques Delors, or that of a looser alliance of states?"
"The questions and their answers, yet to be found, cannot prevent the will of the deciding majority to be taken into account in the decision-making process of the European Union."
"We cannot allow progress to be hindered by any one state!"
"However, this can only be achieved by the renewal of the institutional and decision-making system of the European Union, because the Union cannot be enlarged any further if it does not change the way it functions."
"Without high-standard legislation, a more efficient decision-making mechanism and a stronger role of Parliament, the European Union may not only lose its efficiency, but its ability to function, as well."
"The fact that the European Union has become stuck within its current legal framework reinforces the very reason why the citizens of two countries voted against the Constitution."
"The European Union is not just an economic project, but also a supranational institutional system that also serves solidarity and the protection of social values."
"There are many who miss the fact that this is not emphasised to a greater extent."
"We must make it clear to them that the implementation of this partly depends on the fate of the Constitution and on the efficiency of the European Union."
"Therefore, European Union legislation must be brought closer to people."
"We must present a unified and positive front to citizens, because the achievement of our goals requires a unified political will, and not only words!"
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo."
".– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council’s position is, and remains, unambiguous."
"All the international humanitarian standards and standards relating to human rights must be observed wherever in the world the fight against terrorism is conducted."
"There must be no areas in which the laws do not apply. On that we are agreed."
"In the Council, our common understanding is that Guantánamo remains a cause for serious concern."
"We declare our support for combating terrorism effectively, deploying all the legal means available to us."
"Terrorism is a threat to our order of values, built on the rule of law."
"We must, however, also be sure that, in fighting terrorism, we do not damage or call into question our procedures and institutions based on the rule of law."
"No one should occupy a space in which the law does not apply, and standards relating to human rights and humanitarian law must be observed in the fight against terrorism too."
"We in the EU have on many occasions discussed the subject of Guantánamo with the US administration."
"This dialogue with the United States is being continued."
"The legal advisers of the USA’s state department and of the EU’s equivalent services are discussing better ways of protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism, as the common search to improve the protection of human rights is important."
"We must also analyse whether there are any such things as perfect legal bases and whether – and, if so, in which area – there is a need to take action."
"For a country such as the United States, which declares its support for freedom, the rule of law and proper court proceedings, Guantánamo is an anomaly."
"In our view, the US Government should therefore take measures to close down the camp as quickly as possible."
"I should also like to add that the latest reports, according to which a considerable number of Guantánamo prisoners were less than 18 years old – children within the meaning of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child – when they were taken prisoner are naturally cause for particular concern and need to be carefully examined."
"Back under the British Presidency, the Council approached the United States and asked it to grant representatives of what are known as UN special procedures - including the Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak – unrestricted access to Guantánamo."
"Unfortunately, it was not possible for the UN representatives to visit Guantánamo under the normal conditions for special procedures."
"That is to say, they received no assurance of being able to speak with prisoners unsupervised."
"This same line was also taken by the United States when Members of the European Parliament visited Guantánamo on 22 May."
"We continue to insist, as I say, on access for the UN’s Special Rapporteur on Torture."
"However, the Council is also particularly concerned to defend or, as the case may be, further to strengthen the cohesion of the Euro-Atlantic Community in the context of combating terrorism."
"The Euro-Atlantic Community is one of the most successful partnerships the world has ever known."
"This community of values must also prove its worth specifically in the face of the challenge from international terrorism."
"That is why it was the concern both of the Austrian Presidency and of the Council to initiate the dialogue between experts in international law, to present the debate in objective terms and to strive for common positions corresponding to our system of values."
"We must be aware that, following the criminal terrorist attacks of September 2001, the United States saw itself forced, under extraordinary conditions, to react to the new challenges of global terrorism."
"Some of the measures taken were criticised by Europeans or regarded as being completely incompatible with our common system of values."
"Since then, the Americans have been seen to think again, and they have made a number of improvements to their original stance."
"In our view, the constructive dialogue with the United States, designed as it is to achieve certain goals, should help fix the future fight against terrorism more securely within the framework of the rule of law."
"."
"Madam President, I followed with great interest the visit of the Parliament’s delegation, headed by Mr Brok, to Guantánamo, and the motion for a resolution that is on the table today."
"The global fight against terrorism on an unprecedented scale has created new challenges for the protection of human rights."
"The European Commission constantly underlines that states must ensure full respect for human rights during the fight against terrorism, and this is at stake here."
"A number of Member States have voiced concern to the US Government about Guantánamo Bay."
"The Commission itself does not have any competence to intervene on behalf of the detainees held at there."
"However, we follow very closely all developments and we have noted President Bush’s recent statement that he would like to bring Guantánamo to an end."
"Hopefully the US Administration will go this way."
"The Commission underlines that all anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with both international humanitarian law and international human rights law."
"It is our firm belief that the Geneva Conventions apply to all persons captured on the field of battle."
"The Commission also takes the view that the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention against Torture apply to Guantánamo Bay."
"In this connection, we welcome the United States’ intention to adopt a new Army Field Manual for intelligence interrogation, which will hopefully ensure that interrogation techniques fully comply with the international prohibition on torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment."
"Moreover, in our view, every person who has been detained must enjoy a status under international law and is entitled not to be detained arbitrarily."
"A person must, in addition, receive due process and a fair trial."
"The Commission would also stress that no one should be subject to incommunicado detention and that the International Committee of the Red Cross must always be allowed access to detained persons wherever they may be."
"Finally, we have repeatedly made clear to the United States our opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases."
"The European Union has also made clear its support for the request of various United Nations Special Rapporteurs to visit Guantánamo Bay and to be able to interview detainees in private."
"The European Union has also raised this issue repeatedly with the United States and will continue to do so."
"It is vital that the international community seeks to reassert full adherence to international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards, in relation to the alleged Taliban and al-Qa’ida members in Guantánamo and elsewhere."
"It is only by ensuring respect for those values by all parties that real progress can be achieved."
"."
"Madam President, I am glad that we have an opportunity for debate with the Council and Commission on the Guantánamo Bay detention centre."
"Guantánamo has become, in publicity terms, an open sore for many people in relation to all that is negative about the so-called war on terrorism."
"Fighting terrorism and minimising the threat of terrorism is necessary but not easy and mistakes have been and continue to be made."
"Worryingly, the aspect of the struggle to combat terrorism that we are losing is the battle to win public support – the hearts and minds of large populations in the Arab world in particular."
"As a result, many moderate-thinking Muslims see certain efforts being made to combat terrorism as adding to the problem and fuelling fundamentalist thinking, rather than providing an effective solution."
"Guantánamo is in this category."
"I have called for and have signed a joint urgency motion, passed by all groups in February 2005, calling for the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention centre."
"That was a short, clear and balanced motion, basically stating three strong messages: firstly, it called for the closure of the detention centre and for fair trials for detainees consistent with international law and standards; secondly, it condemned the use of torture and ill-treatment and the need for conformity with international law in all detention centres; and thirdly, it stressed that contemporary terrorism continues to pose a threat to basic human rights and to our populations."
"A delegation of MEPs from various groups recently visited the Guantánamo Bay detention centre."
"In relation to our joint motion for a resolution, I believe that those MEPs that have just returned from Guantánamo should be given an opportunity to contribute to that motion and improve its accuracy, effectiveness and credibility."
"For that reason, I hope that other Groups will support my proposal tomorrow on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to postpone the vote on a resolution until the next Strasbourg session in June."
"A few weeks will give us an opportunity to produce a motion calling for and justifying the closure of Guantánamo Bay, in a form that can be supported by all of the main groups, with increased credibility in the build up to the EU-US Summit in late June."
"."
"Madam President, this is not the first time that we have given our opinion on Guantánamo; let us hope that it is the last time we have to do so."
"My group agrees with the appeals contained in the conclusions of the report by the United Nations Committee against Torture, published on 19 May."
"We call upon the US Government to stop detaining people in secret centres, either on their own territory or on territories under their jurisdiction or under their control."
"We call upon the US Government to recognise that detaining people under these conditions constitutes an act of torture or abuse in itself, which is prohibited under the conventions we have signed."
"Finally, we once again call upon the Bush Government to close the Guantánamo detention centre and to give the people held there a fair trial or release them immediately, ensuring that they are not sent to any country where they may be subject to torture, as has apparently happened in some cases."
"It is now the Council and the Commission’s turn."
"Commissioner, the European Union must comply with its guidelines on combating torture and the death penalty."
"You have the duty to raise this issue with the United States and to ask them to close the Guantánamo prison."
"The trans-Atlantic summit to be held in Vienna will offer an opportunity to put pressure on the US authorities."
"We Socialists want Guantánamo to be on the Vienna agenda."
"Furthermore, Europe must make its position very clear: in Europe people cannot be detained without charge, nor can people be illegally moved nor torture externalised."
"We will play no part in it."
"This Parliament will play no part in it."
"."
"Madam President, I welcome the Council and Commission statements."
"However, the Council must now put real pressure on the American Government at the EU-US Summit next month to close down Guantánamo Bay once and for all."
"It must either release prisoners if there is no evidence against them, or try them under international law."
"Anything else will be a travesty of justice."
"How many more reports do we have to read about gross violations of human rights?"
"The latest one from the Committee Against Torture makes the point again: that torture techniques, which should be abhorrent to any decent person, are still being used."
"We heard these allegations from my constituent Moazzam Begg, who was released last year, and we have heard them in successive reports."
"We also, as you quite rightly said, need to have answers about whether dozens of children have been incarcerated there, as has been alleged recently."
"The Council must be tough and not let the American Government off the hook."
"As far as Mr Coveney is concerned, I would say, on behalf of my group, that we would not like to see a postponement of this resolution."
"."
"Madam President, although the Council is against Guantanamo, it has also noticed some improvement."
"The Commission may have sound principles, to which I subscribe, but it really believes that we can take President Bush at his word when he says that the United States intends to close down Guantanamo Bay."
"Something you both seem to overlook is that a fresh development is underway, namely the need for new prisons to be built, including in Guantanamo Bay, which Mr Brok visited – and he may expand on this himself – but that strikes me as a development to which we must respond."
"What do you intend to do about it?"
"Will you only enter into fresh dialogue with the United States or will you start making demands for once, at a time when the United States wants something from us, such as passenger data, for example?"
"Will you make real demands?"
"We can also offer the United States a helping hand, for example, on behalf of the people who are now incarcerated and who will not be brought before a court."
"Indeed, even the American authorities have admitted that some of those behind bars are innocent."
"What will we do about this now?"
"Although the European Union is, of course, not responsible for Guantanamo, it could offer those people a solution, out of human compassion."
"I should like to quote you the example of the Uighurs, some of whom were detained and about whom even Mr Bush admitted that they were innocent, but they could not stay in the US, nor could they return to China where they would face torture."
"What should happen to those people?"
"The EU failed to offer a helping hand on that occasion."
"They are now in Albania and will probably still be extradited to China."
"This begs the question whether this exercise has been all that helpful for them."
"What are you prepared to do for a large group of people who are still held in Guantanamo Bay and who, apparently, cannot be brought before a court because there is no proof that they are guilty."
"Could the European Union not offer those people a helping hand, and possibly offer them asylum?"
"Finally, it is very easy to focus on Guantanamo Bay, which is a well-organised location with a limited number of prisoners, but people lacking any rights is, of course, also a common phenomenon in the rest of the world, because prisoners are increasingly being transported, also to other parts of Europe – as someone mentioned a moment ago – and I hope that the governments are prepared to consider what their own part, albeit passive, has been in this."
"Madam President, this Parliament has called for the closure of the Guantánamo detention centre on several occasions and we continue to call for it today."
"Human rights are being violated there, torture is the order of the day, and we have even discovered recently that 60 children have been unlawfully held in Guantánamo."
"Guantánamo is a place outside the law, where terrorists or suspected terrorists are detained and thus kept out of reach of normal judicial process."
"Guantánamo is a symbol of the victory of barbarity over the rule of law, but I have to tell Mrs Plassnik that Guantánamo is unfortunately not an anomaly: it is just the tip of the iceberg, because in recent times the idea has been to fight terrorism by using the same barbarous methods that terrorism uses, and that is leading to our defeat."
"If we think of how the war is feeding international terrorism, we will have a clear idea of what is happening at the moment."
"Terrorist attacks are the most obvious sign of the shift from the rule of law to the rules of the jungle."
"We must therefore reassert democratic rules; we must reassert the primacy of politics and uphold the rule of law."
"It has been decided instead to fight on the enemy’s home ground and to compete in denying human rights, in using military might to control the civilian population, in negating the cardinal principles of democracy, and in giving priority to security above all else."
"The pictures from Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib prison are emblematic of the victory and culture of terrorism over the rule of law; they are a clear sign of the defeat of those who often declare that they want to fight terrorism, not least because those pictures shown on television around the world are the staff of life for extremist fundamentalism, as are the secret prisons or the kidnappings carried out by CIA secret agents on European soil."
"We must not be accomplices or casual observers of such barbarity."
"I shall conclude by saying that the idea of using any means possible to defeat terrorism is a mistake."
"There is only one way to defeat terrorism: by safeguarding the rule of law."
"."
"Madam President, the US experienced its first serious terrorist attack on 9/11."
"Its response was entitled ‘A war on terrorism’ – a highly dubious military proposition."
"For decades, Britain experienced sustained terrorist attacks launched from the Irish mainland."
"Those terrorists were substantially funded by US citizens."
"The US Government was instrumental in forcing the British Government to capitulate in the face of that terrorist campaign."
"Now the US is at risk, a different double standard applies: the US Government believes that it has the right to disregard the Geneva Convention and all civilised standards and to kidnap, detain, abuse and torture terrorist suspects."
"Some of those suspects are British citizens."
"They may be completely innocent or they may be guilty."
"Who knows?"
"No evidence is produced, no trials take place."
"If they are real terrorists, then let them face justice and not languish in a detention camp that the Americans do not even dare to put within their own country."
"– Madam President, Mrs Plassnik, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, firstly, we should like to say that terrorism is contemptuous of human beings and that the United States has been hit appallingly by terrorism."
"That is a factor that must form the background to any criticism we make."
"We must appreciate that this is terrorism directed against our values and our legal system and that it raises concerns about the danger in which it places us."
"On the other hand, resistance to terrorism should not be to the detriment of our own values, for then terrorism will have won."
"For this reason, there has been a broad international debate, which has also led to changes."
"Following my visit, I am convinced that the situation and the images familiar to us from 2001 and 2002 no longer exist."
"Nor do I believe that direct physical torture is taking place, as presumably it had been doing, although I obviously have no proof of this."
"Moreover, the fact that great efforts are taking place within the United States, together with a debate designed to put an end to torture and the like is shown by, for example, the initiatives taken by Senator McCain."
"What we have here, then, is not typical behaviour towards America on the part of Europe but a debate being conducted in all our societies."
"On the other hand – and, on this matter, I agree completely with the Commissioner and Mrs Plassnik – human rights and international humanitarian law must be observed."
"Although our system of values does in fact entail the risk of a prisoner reoffending after he has been released, we should be giving up our freedom if we were to abandon that same system of values. is one of the basic principles of our civilisation."
"True enough: in the situation in which we now find ourselves, the risk is far smaller if prisoners who might otherwise join the ever growing ranks of new suicide bombers and so inspire further mobilisation are instead kept in prison."
"On the basis purely of an assessment of the risks involved, releasing people is probably not the right road to go down."
"As matters stand, however, people are kept in prison even if they are acquitted."
"If a prisoner is deemed to have been 80%, but still not 100%, debriefed, he is kept in jail."
"If a new concrete prison is built, this time devoid of windows, we have, to say the least, a problem."
"Although what we have here is not a war in the classical sense of the word, we must try, via the International Court of Justice and other international arrangements, to get to grips with this issue."
"I believe that too much is being expected of the Member States in this area."
"Madam President, speaking as the constituency MEP for a dozen former and existing Guantánamo Bay residents, I welcome that at last we are hearing a squeak of protest about Guantánamo Bay from EU Foreign Ministers."
"One press report of last weekend’s agreement to make a request to the US to close Guantánamo said: ‘Ministers agreed that Europe can no longer ignore the extensive international criticism of the camp’."
"It is not exactly ahead of the curve to take four and a half years to make only an informal request."
"As I understand it, we still have no formal declaration, no common position, and no joint action."
"However, we are grateful that Foreign Ministers have finally caught up with world opinion."
"I welcome the public statement here today by the President-in-Office calling for the camp to close."
"What we have heard today should have been heard over the last four years."
"The best way that EU Member States could launch the constructive goal-orientated dialogue with the US – which Mrs Plassnik called for and I agree we need – would be to help this Parliament establish the truth about the extraordinary rendition programme and European complicity in it."
"I hope that in your response, President-in-Office, you will say that you will help us establish that truth."
"The goal that we should seek jointly with the Americans is a return to full respect for international law, not a dilution of it."
"Madam President, when we discussed and adopted the urgent resolution on Guantánamo a few months ago, it marked a turning point in the debate and we condemned a practice which until then had been completely denied or simply ignored by the powers that be in Europe."
"The fight against terrorism – this has been said, I agree with it and I believe that the majority of us take the same view – cannot be an excuse to permit torture, kidnap and, even less, murder, which are taking place not just in Guantánamo, but in many other parts of the world."
"We must therefore continue to put pressure on the United States in every way we can in order to persuade them, on the one hand, to close Guantánamo, but also, on the other, to ensure that the almost 500 people in detention have the legal guarantees that they require."
"We must therefore point out once again – as Mr Valenciano Martínez-Orozco has also said – that prisoners must not be released in the knowledge that they are going to be sent to countries where they may be tortured."
"In many cases they cannot even return to their countries of residence because their residence permits have been withdrawn."
"I therefore believe that we must remind the Council that these measures must be taken seriously and that a proactive approach must be taken in order to guarantee that these people – I insist – not just have a fair trial, but also the human and judicial guarantees they deserve."
"– Europe’s main mission is to comply with and promote international law and the humanitarian principles that underpin it."
"This is yet another reason why the European project must succeed."
"The fight against terrorism must not undermine the system of personal guarantees that form the moral foundations of democracy and the rule of law."
"The biggest danger for democracy is the loss of the moral high ground and this is a further serious capitulation in the face of terrorism."
"Security guarantees must therefore uphold the fundamental values of human rights and must form part of the debate on these values."
"A securitarian policy gradually destroys the enlightened architecture of democratic policies and its potential to allow human dignity to flourish."
"Furthermore, the fight against terrorism is not only pursued through the mechanisms of criminal law."
"On a more fundamental level, it is pursued through the creation of a more balanced world order and the ambitious programme of a form of global justice."
"Consequently, Europe is the United States’ best partner if we are to achieve an order that will ensure that the principles of international law and the core values of civilisation are properly upheld."
"Against a backdrop such as this, what is needed is relentless commitment to dialogue. EU Member States must also take part in the Council of Europe’s process of reflection with a view to amending the Geneva Conventions."
"Terror suspects are not accorded legal status under those conventions, which is wrong."
"Guantánamo does not define the limits of law and politics, yet to define the limits of law and politics is a basic requirement of the principles of justice."
"This is the biggest victory of democracy over terrorism."
"To quote Simone de Beauvoir, ‘we must not allow our executioners to give us bad habits’."
"– Madam President, Mrs Plassnik, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Guantánamo has become a symbol of the removal of human rights and of procedures under the rule of law."
"It is easy for us Europeans to criticise the situation."
"We should not, however, just be drawing attention to states of affairs incompatible with human rights and the rule of law. Rather, we should be asking ourselves where our responsibility lies and in what ways we can help bring about a solution."
"Even people found by the Americans to be innocent are unable to return to their home countries."
"The United States, too, correctly rules out sending these people back to countries in which they would be in fear of torture or persecution."
"We must together answer the question of what should instead happen to these people."
"The fate of the people in Guantánamo concerns us all and should not leave us indifferent."
"Finally – and this is something that also ought to be emphasised today – European governments too have been involved in the extradition, and partly even in the interrogation, of detainees at Guantánamo Bay."
"That applies, for example, in the case of Murat Kurnaz."
"If we are seriously calling for Guantánamo Bay to be closed once and for all, we should transform our words into deeds."
"."
"Madam President, we in the Council shall continue, attentively and with a sense of our responsibilities, to pursue and deal with the subject of Guantánamo."
"That is because this subject is at the interface of a number of the European Union’s political priorities: on the one hand, the issue of the universal validity of human rights and of international humanitarian law, as well as the fight against the scourge of terrorism on the basis of the principles of the rule of law; on the other hand, however, good transatlantic relations, which are also affected by this subject."
"It goes without saying that these relations should be completely open and that controversial subjects should be addressed with certain goals in view."
"We shall undoubtedly continue with the policy we have pursued during the Austrian Presidency and also before that. I mentioned some of the key points in the introduction."
"We shall also address these subjects at the forthcoming summit on 22 June."
"Finally, I should like again to point out that, in all the investigations concerning suspected illegal flights and secret prisons, we in the Presidency have acted to ensure that cooperation with the investigative bodies has been as extensive as it possibly could be."
"We hope that it will be possible to conclude these investigations as soon as possible."
"."
"Madam President, President-in-Office, we all share a deep concern about the question of human rights, because human rights are a universal principle and have universal applications."
"I broadly agree with all the key elements mentioned here in the debate."
"On the one hand, acts of terrorism constitute a clear violation of basic fundamental rights; on the other hand, all anti-terrorist measures must comply with international legal standards of humanitarian and human rights law."
"Every person detained must be able to receive due process and a fair trial and there also has to be a strict ban on torture and ill-treatment in all circumstances."
"Therefore, we all feel that Guantánamo should be closed as soon as possible."
"It is also a matter of the credibility of the European Union in the Arab world."
"However, it must be said that we do not apply double standards."
"The European Union has a common position: last week, all 25 Member States clearly spoke out, and we have already raised the subject of Guantánamo with the US Administration on many occasions."
"As Mrs Plassnik said, dialogue will be continued on the basis of this common position."
"The matter will certainly be raised with our American partner at the forthcoming US-EU Summit, as well as the wider issue of the need to respect our common values in the fight against terror."
"It is in our common interest to find a rapid and common solution."
"To wind up the debate, seven motions for resolutions(1) have been tabled under Rule 103(2)/Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"– the report [2005/2056(INI)] (A6-0173/2006) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on improving EU-US relations in the framework of a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement and"
"– the report [2005/2082(INI)] (A6-0131/2006) by Mrs Mann, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on EU-US Transatlantic economic relations"
". – Madam President, Mrs Plassnik, Commissioners, I believe – partly for the reasons that we have previously discussed – that the transatlantic relationship is extraordinarily important."
"It is an issue concerned with the operation of NATO which, now as previously, is indispensable to Europe’s collective security."
"In the big issues concerning business and trade, there are conflicts but also agreements."
"This transatlantic community is also a community of values in spite of all the discussions we have regarding individual matters."
"That being said, matters are coming slightly unstuck."
"I found it remarkable that, a fortnight ago, when, at my request, the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Lawrow, visited the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he proposed that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia be extended next year and deeper institutional links be established between the Russian and EU institutions."
"The European Union has agreements with just about everyone in the world, just as the United States of America does."
"Only, there are no agreements between the United States and the European Union."
"This will have consequences at some point."
"When I consider the preparations for the summit in terms of this absence of agreements – preparations helped along by the sterling efforts of the Council and the Commission – I can see there again being discussions about many individual matters, on which there may or may not be agreement, but there being, however, no bigger picture or framework for the discussions to take place in: a framework, moreover, in which we might also be able to include the American Congress, for anyone familiar with American policy in the fields of trade, economics and foreign policy knows that speaking with the administration is only half the battle."
"For this reason, we should find contractual solutions that will enable us to convert the Transatlantic Declaration into a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement."
"Such an agreement would provide a framework – and our fellow Member, Mrs Mann, will later present this in much more detail in terms of economic policy – that will make it possible, even in the case of tensions and conflicts of interest, to reach agreements more quickly."
"For the reasons I have just mentioned, I consider this to be incredibly important."
"The fact is that, as the public are also aware, NATO can no longer cope with everything on its own. The aim is that, by 2015, it should be possible for a transatlantic market to arise that can also deal with all associated problems to do with social policy and with the need to secure the multilateral dimension."
"Let me not be misunderstood: a bilateral relationship should not destroy the multilateral approach of, for example, the WTO."
"What this arrangement could, however, do is draw us into a ‘community of actions’ to promote global and regional cooperation on the basis of common values. Underlying the arrangement would be a common basis of values and our joint interest in the arrangement."
"The Iran issue is the kind of issue I have in mind: one in relation to which we can only achieve something if we act together in order peacefully to prevent people from producing atomic bombs."
"We must also arrive at peaceful solutions in the Near and Middle East, where there is a cluster of common interests and values."
"This is something we can do only within the framework of this dialogue, which goes above and beyond the NATO dialogue. The currently still very sluggish Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue could be converted into a Transatlantic Assembly."
"These things may at present be pipe-dreams and fantasies, but I consider it necessary to proceed in this way in order to turn them into a reality."
"In order to bring such an arrangement into operation, the European Parliament should, as a first step, set up an early warning system in Washington, with a reciprocal arrangement also put in place, in order in this way to have our sights set on legislation at an early stage."
"The European Parliament’s rapporteurs should be able to speak with their opposite numbers in the American Congress in order to make progress with these matters."
"In that way, consensus might be achieved at the preparatory phase, and there would subsequently be no anger of the kind now given rise to by, for example, court judgments on past actions."
"I believe that we should bring our critical stance to bear."
"On many issues, including the International Court of Justice, climate change and Iraq, the United States has adopted attitudes for which we need to criticise the present US Government."
"Such criticism – directed towards a particular administration in individual cases and concerning specific matters – should not, however, cause the transatlantic gulf to become wider."
"For this reason, the Council, the Commission and the US administration should at last find the strength to go beyond the catch-as-catch-can approach and provide a broader and deeper basis for this alliance."
". – Madam President, greetings to all my fellow Members and, of course, to the Commission and the Council."
"As so often, I have the great pleasure of preparing the accompanying report on behalf of the Committee on International Trade and, in this, I am concentrating more on foreign trade and economic themes."
"As in the past, I also share the views of my fellow Member, Mr Brok."
"Like many of our fellow Members, we have worked together for many years, and we have also always received the considerable support of this House, for which I should expressly like to thank you."
"If we look at business and trade relations, then my report essentially contains one key idea."
"The Commission does, of course, share the view that we should proceed on the basis of how things really are."
"We already have a transatlantic market."
"It exists."
"It is just that we are often scarcely aware of it."
"We always talk about all the things we have to do, and we always focus completely on the trade barriers that exist. It is these trade barriers too with which the press concerns itself on a daily basis, but what frequently we no longer see at all are the positive things we have achieved."
"What this report says, therefore, is: let us for once just be aware of the way things really are."
"How much trade really goes on between the European Union and the United States?"
"What investments take place?"
"Another thing: what is the volume of trade done by enterprises established in both Europe and the United States?"
"As can be seen, the figure is huge."
"I do not want to bore you now with it, but it is astronomical."
"The number of jobs that depend on such trade is really extremely high."
"The figure for those that we know about on each side of the Atlantic – and there are very many more, because there is a lot of data we have not obtained – in itself amounts to EUR 7 million."
"Here is an example that I come up with again and again: that of our famous flagship, Airbus, on the European side and of Boeing on the American side."
"We are always so proud, with Europeans and Americans each believing the one to be a purely European business and the other a purely American one."
"Yet that is not the case."
"The two companies are 40% dependent on each other."
"This provides you with a good example."
"Go to MTU."
"I have had the great pleasure of looking at the operation in my own constituency."
"When, for example, repairs are being carried out – with the work benches, as it were, running parallel – you can see Airbus and Boeing planes each in their turn, now one and now the other."
"That is only one example, however."
"Building on an awareness of how things really are and proceeding on the basis of the New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 and of the economic agenda that we have had since 1998, which has been upheld at all the summits, in all the decisions of the European Parliament and in the Commission’s work programme and which was upheld and confirmed in the legislative dialogue that took place a couple of weeks ago in Vienna between our fellow Members and the Americans, we should therefore take a further step – not an earth-shattering step, but just a small one – and say: let us at long last remove the barriers that are causing problems."
"This is not, as many people outside believe, about removing barriers to create a free-trade zone – ATTAC has been stirring things up a bit in this case – but about removing technical barriers, as we have been doing for many years."
"In that way, we stick to our standards and to our precautionary principle, and we continue to maintain the rules of the internal market."
"The EU’s and the Member States’ sovereignty is not encroached upon."
"Nor is this a naïve proposal because we know that there will, of course, be further trade disputes."
"That is only natural and to be expected."
"What we have here are the two largest trade blocks."
"Obviously, there is a clash of interests."
"That is also the way it should be."
"The fact is, we have disputes in the EU too, but they do not send us into a panic every time they happen."
"Disputes are normal."
"Some of them we can solve within the framework of the world trade round. Many of them we cannot solve."
"The Hamon dispute is one that we have not been able to solve for many years, and we are paying for the fact."
"There are also problems on the American side."
"For example, the Americans have difficulty recognising non-pasteurised milk, which they see as a health problem."
"So what about their precautionary principle?"
"All right, that is just the way things are."
"Let us live with the situation."
"There are, however, many other barriers that we should remove."
"In this report, I am asking that we do just that."
"There is a point about which I still need, in a moment, to say something."
"I should expressly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee, all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, the Commission which, as always, has worked excellently with me and all my colleagues, and, also of course, the Council, the NGOs, the think tanks, the trade unions, the companies and those otherwise involved, as well as my own group."
"Some parts of my own group – I am referring to the group of the Greens – have some problems with the term ‘barrier-free’, because it always sounds as if it refers to a free-trade area."
"Hence, my proposal for tomorrow concerning split voting."
"I would propose that we simply remove such concepts and the figures referred to in connection with them."
"I hope that I shall obtain the House’s support in this connection."
"We can then all breathe a sigh of relief, and we shall have a sound basis on which to proceed."
"I hope that we shall then also obtain the House’s full support."
"Madam President, I know that you are nervous."
"Nonetheless, just two more points I have to mention."
"In the case of bioethanol, I should like to introduce a verbal addition."
"I forgot to include bioethanol and biodiesel."
"Therefore, I shall say tomorrow: and diesel."
"On this subject, too, I hope that I shall obtain your support."
"And that, in theory, is everything."
"Thank you."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union probably has no other partner in the world with which it has such close and intensive relations as the United States of America."
"It goes without saying, then, that it is a matter of central importance for every Presidency that a strong and well-functioning network of relations should be in place."
"In retrospect, 2005 saw the relationship characterised, on the whole, by positive developments."
"We have achieved considerable progress on a number of issues, and we are – as is often the case prior to policies are determined – engaging in dialogue in order to reach a convergence of opinions."
"Consider for instance the area of promotion of democracy, where we can take positive credit for our close cooperation during the presidential elections in Belarus."
"In the run-up to the elections we declared ourselves, over and over again, in favour of a free and fair electoral process."
"We called for the protection of the opposition and adopted parallel strategies in support of democratic forces."
"After the elections, which were neither free nor fair, we also agreed to impose travel restrictions and targeted financial sanctions on government members and other leading individuals."
"In the area of promotion of democracy, much the same holds true for Ukraine, where we are working together closely with the USA to consolidate democratic and market-economy structures."
"Another example of a very close and successful ongoing cooperation is the Western Balkans."
"In this case we are agreed on the necessary European or rather European-Atlantic perspective for the states of the Western Balkans."
"We are, in the Contact Group, working towards a common position for the final status talks on Kosovo."
"We affirm our commitment to a continuing international presence, and we are convinced that close cooperation on the basis of equal rights between the EU and NATO in the area of security policy is indispensable."
"A further example is the Middle East Peace Process, where we are continually working very closely together to coordinate our position within the framework of the Quartet and on the basis of the Road Map – now a topic of particular significance, given the elections and new governments in Israel and among the Palestinians as well."
"Perhaps you will allow me here to make a short comment on Iran."
"Tomorrow a meeting of foreign ministers takes place in Vienna, in which the EU three, Javier Solana, China, Russia and the USA will be taking part."
"The intention is that, at this meeting, an offer to Iran should be finalised, one that should make it possible for Iran to use atomic energy exclusively for peaceful purposes."
"At the same time there must be absolute certainty that Iran is using or rather developing nuclear energy for no other purpose."
"Today we heard with interest that my American counterpart Condoleezza Rice has spoken of the possibility, and I quote, ‘of newer and more positive relations between the USA and Iran’."
"We regard this as an important signal and hope that active American participation will bring us success in building a new cooperative relationship with Iran."
"This is where direct dialogue between Washington and Tehran is certainly of central significance."
"Stability and security, peace and prosperity are also the highest common goals of transatlantic cooperation with regard to Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"In the area of justice and internal affairs, it has been possible, during the Austrian Presidency, to involve the USA in the implementation of foreign policy strategy."
"A number of important challenges raise overlapping political questions in their various aspects, and they still deserve particular attention, for instance international humanitarian law, anti-terrorism and cooperation in crisis management."
"It should not go unmentioned that there are topics on which we have clear differences of opinion, and in this broad dialogue it does not go without being discussed."
"Guantánamo – about which we have just had a debate – is one of these issues."
"Nevertheless it is important in this context to mention that the dialogue of experts on international law, which was begun under our Presidency, serves the purpose of arriving together at positions which are in accordance with our common fundamental values."
"Other controversial themes which we keep on putting on the agenda of formal summits between the EU and the USA are the Visa Waiver Programme and the International Criminal Court."
"We share the same opinion on many multilateral questions and we work hand in hand, but the International Criminal Court is one of the points about which there are differences of opinion."
"We also take a critical view of the USA’s attempts to conclude agreements with third countries relating to Article 98 of the Rome Statute, since this runs counter to the International Criminal Court’s aim to have a universally valid jurisdiction."
"However, let me also mention a positive aspect in this context, that being the fact that the USA has permitted the prosecution of war crimes in Sudan."
"One important component to which reference was made earlier is economic relations."
"Given the vast degree of economic interconnection and mutual interdependence, the successful further development of our economic relations must be a matter of priority."
"We are each others’ most important trading partners."
"Two thirds of direct investment in the European Union comes from the USA, and reciprocal investments at present amount to EUR 1 500 billion."
"Mutual trade amounts to approximately EUR 1 billion per day."
"In view of our joint share of world production the European Union and the USA have a particular global responsibility, and so it is essential that we should cooperate closely in economic questions as well and strive together towards a progressive removal of trade barriers."
"I am sure that the Commission will go into this matter in even greater detail."
"Since the Spring Summit, we have achieved a great deal with the implementation of the jointly agreed working programme, for instance the first meeting of the Regulatory Cooperation Forum. This deals among other things with the reduction or rather the removal of trade barriers which arise because of different safety regulations for cars or other goods."
"Moreover, we are working on a common strategy for the protection of intellectual property rights."
"We welcome Parliament’s suggestions and recommendations, as expressed in the reports of your Members Mr Brok and Mrs Mann."
"The reports show us very clearly how hard we are all working together in a united effort, and also that improving transatlantic relations is just as much a matter of great importance for you as it is for the Council and the Commission."
"With this in mind, I would also like to mention that a meeting of the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue – an important component of our relations – recently took place in Vienna."
"Passing on to the specific question of the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement, discussed in the report, it seems to us that the time is not yet ripe for this, and so the Presidency recommends, in the first instance, continuing to build upon existing practical cooperation."
"The New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 continues to be the currently-applicable framework for our relations."
"Since we have received clear signals from the USA that it takes a somewhat cautious view of the prospect of further formalisation of relations, we have chosen to concentrate on content and concrete results and are now striving towards a more effective use of existing structures."
"The regular formal meetings of senior officials are well supplemented by a great many further contacts and agreements in all areas of common interest."
"They have made the political dialogue more strategic and at the same time more substantial."
"In many areas referred to in your House’s reports, we are already working closely together, and so there is a community of actions."
"The next Summit in June 2006 in Vienna is currently being prepared by the Council and the Commission."
"Our goal for the Summit is to maintain the recent dynamic in transatlantic relations."
"We also want to create new initiatives for further cooperation leading up to the next Summit, whereby a matter of particular concern to us is to communicate better the intensity, importance and usefulness of the transatlantic partnership to the Europeans as well."
"We have therefore decided to concentrate on a Summit statement that will look towards the future and be as concise and substantial as possible, and to supplement this with progress reports for political and economic areas."
"However, we will also state our future priorities at the Summit."
"These are among others a reinforced cooperation in the global promotion of peace, democracy and human rights, a new dialogue about energy security, the conclusion of an agreement on air traffic and concentrating on the implementation of intellectual property rights in third countries."
"Europe and the USA are bound together inseparably, not only historically, but also by common values."
"It is only together that we can meet global challenges."
"Our many common economic and political interests as well as our security interests outweigh the differences which can and must exist between partners."
"We are ultimately indispensable partners for each other, partners who have to bear a global responsibility together."
". Madam President, let me start with my perception of EU-US relations from the external relations perspective."
"Commissioner Mandelson will then complete the picture on the economic and trade relations."
"I shall focus, therefore, more on Mr Brok’s report."
"As this excellent report makes clear, the context of EU-US relations has changed enormously over the course of the last year."
"Following President Bush’s visit to Brussels and the 2005 summit, the tensions we experienced in 2003 and 2004 have been replaced by a new spirit of constructive engagement."
"We came out of the 2005 summit with eight declarations on a wide range of issues which guided our collaboration."
"The declaration on democracy promotion shows how far our cooperation on foreign policy has come."
"Even if there are differences from time to time – as we have just seen and the President-in-Office of the Council has just mentioned – we are now taking the initiative and being more proactive in our approach, rather than fire-fighting."
"Our activity to spread democratic principles, respect for human rights and the rule of law – which Mr Brok highlights in his motion for a resolution – can only go so far."
"Without the full commitment of the country concerned, democracy cannot be sustained."
"Nevertheless, when that commitment is there, our coordinated action makes a difference, for instance – as has already been mentioned – in Ukraine, where we supported the reform process; in Belarus, where our common stance against the lack of reform sent a clear message to the regime; and in the Middle East peace process, where coordination is essential and where it works quite well."
"I personally have been very closely involved in coordinating our position with the United States."
"The motion for a resolution mentions the need to better coordinate assistance."
"I am particularly pleased that the Quartet took up the EU’s proposal for a temporary international mechanism to channel contributions to the basic health and social needs of the Palestinian people."
"We are working on that basis and I hope that we will be ready by the end of the month."
"Before handing over to Mr Mandelson, let me mention four issues which are highlighted in the resolution."
"The first is energy."
"Both the EU and the US are faced with record high oil prices and increased dependence on foreign supplies of fossil fuels."
"According to current trends, the European Union will have to import 70% of its energy in 2030 compared to 50% today."
"The US is facing a similar problem."
"We therefore need to take a holistic approach in tackling this problem, including involving our major partners."
"At next month’s EU-US Summit, we intend to establish a strategic cooperation on energy, addressing the security of energy supply – including the diversification of supply routes, the enforcement of market rules, the protection of infrastructure, the promotion of alternative sources of energy, and, finally, energy sufficiency."
"The key is to increase predictability by creating the right market conditions and legal frameworks in both the producer and transit countries."
"This is the message we will bring to the EU-US Summit, but also to the G8 Summit and to other international partners."
"The second issue is visas."
"One of the Commission’s top priorities is to resolve the issue of the US’s non-reciprocal application of visa requirements."
"Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we will reach a solution soon, but we will continue to press for progress and will raise it again with President Bush at the summit."
"Last time, the issue was highlighted and we hoped that things would progress more quickly."
"In July 2006, we will issue a second report on visa reciprocity, which may examine the possibility of taking specific measures in response to any lack of progress."
"The third issue I wanted to tackle is China."
"As Mr Brok rightly points out in his resolution, we need to coordinate our approach to third countries, particularly China, effectively."
"We share the same approach: to help China move towards democracy and integrate fully into the world economy and the world market."
"Two years ago, we took steps to coordinate ourselves better by establishing the EU-US dialogue on East Asia."
"This has proved a very useful forum for discussing relations with China."
"Let me address the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement."
"I know that Mr Brok’s committee feels very strongly about this, and I fully support the desire to see transatlantic relations go from strength to strength."
"As you know, I have always been open to exploring the pros and cons of a contractual relationship with the United States."
"It is indeed strange that we do not have more formal relations with our most important partner."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, the question is whether a formal agreement would really bring much added value today to our relations."
"The most important thing is that the EU and the US work together for our common strategic cause."
"For this, we need political will, in particular, but also understanding towards each other."
"I feel that a treaty, for instance, would not have enabled us to bridge the differences which dogged our relations in 2003 and 2004, which were political in nature."
"At this moment there is no political appetite for such an agreement either in the US Administration or among Member States."
"However, this might change in the future."
"Should attitudes change or should it become clear that there is, after all, an institutional obstacle to closer cooperation, then the time might be right to go further."
"Let me end with a remark about the important role Parliament plays in transatlantic relations."
"As you know, I have always been an enthusiastic supporter of interparliamentary exchanges."
"I am convinced that these relations benefit greatly from the links between the European Parliament and the US Congress."
"I very much encourage you to continue to build these ties."
"I thank you for what has already been done in the legislators’ dialogue and what might be done before the summit."
"."
"Mr President, I want to thank Erika Mann for having shepherded this very impressive report through Parliament with her characteristic effectiveness, dedication and attention to detail; it is very timely."
"The fact that the very comprehensive report on transatlantic economic relations has the input of half a dozen committees of this Parliament, and that it would need at least the same number of Commissioners present to discuss all the issues that are covered in it, shows how deep and intricate the EU-US economic relationship is."
"That relationship effectively operates at two levels."
"On one level, steady leadership is required to promote a further convergence of our shared economic rules and regulatory frameworks – our companies, our jobs and our competitiveness demand this."
"At the other level, what happens in the rest of the world also depends on whether and how the EU and the US are able to react to events together."
"No political relationship in our time is of greater importance to the global economy than the Transatlantic Partnership."
"The response to the rise of China and India, the pressures of globalisation, the current challenges in the energy field, the way multilateral institutions function, climate change: all these depend on the ability of Europe and the United States to cooperate effectively together."
"Nowhere is this more apparent than in the continuing WTO negotiations."
"I am fortunate to have had a shared sense of purpose with my counterpart Rob Portman, and I look forward to continuing this with Susan Schwab, the new US Trade Representative – I hope she will be confirmed shortly by the Senate."
"It is no secret that I think the European Union and the United States need to bring our positions in the Doha round closer together."
"The warning bell is ringing on the DDA."
"The danger lights are flashing, because if the gaps are not closed in the coming weeks, we will face serious institutional, legislative and political obstacles to ending this round."
"The United States will shortly swing into election mode, trade authority is set to lapse, there are electoral constraints in other parts of the world too – a coming election in Brazil, for example."
"The window on the Doha round is closing rapidly."
"Europe is ready to negotiate further; we have indicated our flexibility, and no sector is out of bounds to us."
"We look to our partners to express the same sense of purpose and openness."
"Let me say a few words now on Erika Mann’s report itself."
"I am glad that it shows strong support for the work programmes adopted last November to implement the EU-US economic initiative."
"In the progress report which we will present to the next summit on 21 June, we will be able to list some good achievements."
"The EU-US action strategy for intellectual property rights enforcement in third countries will be endorsed."
"It will contain a number of concrete cooperation measures, especially between our customs services and embassies in selected third countries."
"On the high-level regulatory cooperation forum, too, I am satisfied that after two meetings in Brussels and Washington within a very short timeframe, we have now clearly established the forum as the place for EU and US regulators to exchange best practice."
"We hope very much that the benefits of increased cooperation will soon be felt by companies on both sides of the Atlantic."
"The signature of the long-awaited air services agreement, as well as the agreement on civil aviation safety, is now expected during the second half of the year."
"On the air services agreement, we will have to keep pushing the US Government to go ahead with the rule-making changes and resist protectionist pressure from Congress."
"Your help in this House will be most valuable to us in pursuing this goal."
"I welcome your continued interest in a more visionary and strategic approach – I happen to think that there is a place for vision in politics."
"I note your call for the 2006 EU-US Summit to design a new transatlantic partnership agreement that leads to the achievement of a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015."
"In my view, the EU-US economic initiative has shown that we are getting there, we are moving in that direction step by step."
"Probably the right approach is to advance steadily on issues of mutual interest and to show – for example in the areas of intellectual property rights and regulatory cooperation – concrete successes to our citizens."
"We have to earn our way in our acceptance of the approach that I know is supported in the report."
"I think this pragmatic approach will be assured of support because in reality there is no US enthusiasm – either in the Administration or in Congress – for any ‘bigger bang’ EU-US scheme."
"On issues like investment and public procurement, which you rightly identify as areas of enormous potential – and they do have very great potential indeed – the US has not so far shown any interest in tackling bilateral barriers."
"On the investment side, the Dubai Ports fallout requires careful handling."
"We have now at least established a contact group to address both old and new problems, and have proposed to the US government to include an investment paragraph in the summit declaration regarding the importance of an open transatlantic investment climate."
"This should send a strong message to the US Congress, which is currently debating the Shelby bill on the tightening of the Exon-Florio Statute."
"Again, your continued help on this, along with that of the US Congress, would be much appreciated."
"Finally I would like to point out that we have had a very good first half of the year clearing out some important EU-US trade disputes on Foreign Sales Corporations, on Byrd, on the telecoms sanctions – I hope we can keep up the momentum in other areas."
"I am looking at two other disputes particularly at the moment to see whether they are susceptible to early resolution."
"FSC and Byrd prove that the WTO dispute settlement system works and that the availability of WTO-compatible sanctions can be an efficient way of obtaining US implementation of WTO judgments."
"Given the good results of the WTO system, I do not see at this stage the need for the kind of formal bilateral trade dispute settlement mechanism which you propose in your report, but I do not want to reject the idea completely."
"Be assured that we will exhaust all our informal channels with the United States and try everything possible to avoid going down the expensive and time-consuming route to Geneva, whenever this is avoidable."
"In conclusion, let me say that the transatlantic relationship is one which is too often simply taken for granted."
"Especially at this time, what we need is renewed commitment in order to make it work better."
"I am grateful for your report, which has highlighted this need once again in a very timely way."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Mann on the excellent work she has done on this report."
"The report contains a goal that I would particularly like to emphasise, namely the goal of achieving a common transatlantic capital market by 2010, for this is a goal that, in turn, shows the way forward in other areas."
"We can today already see that the transatlantic economy is defined by, and functions as a result of, direct investments and the ongoing collaboration between industry and research that supports trade."
"It is the intensity of those investments and the quantity of acquisitions in both directions which form the basis for comprehensive trade across the Atlantic, but it is also important to achieve a high level of research and innovation."
"This must be the best way to face up to and contribute to globalisation and to help bring about a strong global economy, not just for ourselves but for the rest of the world too."
"The report also takes up a number of other issues, such as the importance of making it easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to become listed on the various stock markets, of facilitating and opening the way for company investments of equal size in both directions, of ensuring that reinsurers have the same opportunities and of ensuring that we achieve a common transatlantic capital market in the true meaning of the phrase."
"If we can achieve this, we will also be in a position to achieve other goals for cooperation across the Atlantic."
"."
"Mr President, Erika Mann’s report is proof not only of her skills as a rapporteur, but also of the underlying strength of transatlantic economic relations."
"On behalf of the Committee of Industry, I would like to make three very important points."
"Firstly, as the Commissioner mentioned, in the field of energy we need cooperation on efficiency sufficiency and on sustainability."
"Secondly, in relation to research – which is extremely important – our committee is now working with the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Equally important is the cooperation with the institutions in the US as well as with industry."
"Much can be done to facilitate more cooperation in this field."
"Thirdly, we have discussed the setting-up of a body to improve discussions between industries."
"We would like to set up something analogous to the very successful Iran-US claims tribunal, which, in a simple and elegant way, resolves thousands of disputes."
"We would like something similar in the future."
"Finally, I would also like to underline the importance of parliamentary exchanges to begin discussions and to bring success on these three extremely important topics."
"."
"Mr President, within the scope of transatlantic economic relations, it is important to recognise the role and specificities of the culture and education sectors."
"We are pleased, therefore, to note that the rapporteur has taken into account the entire opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education."
"The ‘cultural key’ can actually contribute towards strengthening our relationship and promoting mutual understanding between Europeans and Americans."
"Consequently, the establishment of a dialogue devoted to culture and education should encourage regular exchange of good practice and experience in fields such as the fight against piracy, the mobility of cultural players, or, again, the development of cultural tourism."
"Regarding education, this dialogue should focus on strengthening the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications but also on interchanges of researchers and of university teachers and students."
"We should mention, therefore, that the forthcoming renewal of the Cooperation programme between our two continents in the fields of higher education and vocational training will also be of great benefit."
"On the other hand, the specificity of the audiovisual sector entails transatlantic exchanges that respect Europe’s cultural and linguistic diversity."
"On this point, and in conclusion, we regret, nonetheless, that the United States did not choose to follow the Union and vote in favour of the Unesco Convention."
"Finally, I congratulate Mrs Mann for the quality of her work and careful listening."
"."
"Mr President, since mutual trust between the United States and the European Union has come under pressure in recent years, I should like to single out two things that need to be resolved in order for that trust to be rebuilt."
"We should not resign ourselves to the visa requirements which the United States imposes on some EU citizens."
"Commission President Barroso was right to urge the United States to lift the visa requirements for citizens from the ten new Member States."
"It is unfair, on principle, to use double standards such as these for EU citizens."
"In the coming weeks, the temporary committee of inquiry into alleged CIA camps will be discussing its draft interim report."
"There are indications that irregularities have occurred in the treatment of suspects, but so far, there is no hard evidence of this."
"This temporary committee will continue its activities in order to deliver convincing evidence, if possible."
"In that light, Parliament will, in the run-up to the Summit, need to insist on substantial cooperation."
"I should like to ask your support for paragraph 11 from the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which has been tabled as Amendment 34."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Mann for an excellent report and for her extremely close and constructive cooperation during the time we have spent working on it."
"The USA is in a class of its own as the most important trading partner we in Europe have, which is a fact we often forget."
"The focus in public debate is mostly on what few problems there are in our trade relations."
"There is talk of crisis and conflict between Europe and the USA."
"This can be the case occasionally in the political sphere, but from an economic perspective precisely the opposite is, in actual fact, the case."
"I might even dare to whisper that the trade between us has undergone a revolution."
"Today, the flow of trade between us is a fantastical EUR 1 billion per day."
"The deepest form of cross-border economic integration is mutual direct foreign investments."
"These have increased sharply and now stand at EUR 1.5 trillion."
"These are more than mere figures."
"Even if we do not think about it, the result is new opportunities for us in our everyday lives."
"The market that we have has, for example, created nearly seven million jobs in Europe."
"It gives us more and more services and better products."
"Transatlantic trade, moreover, forms a large part of the engine of the world economy."
"If our relationship shows signs of weakness, there are knock-on effects for the whole world."
"The trade between us is thus not an alternative to trade with poorer countries."
"On the contrary, it is, in fact, a precondition and something that makes us all, throughout the world, richer."
"We must not take it for granted."
"We must carry on our work and integrate our economies."
"I therefore hope that we, together with the USA, can realise the idea of a barrier-free transatlantic market by 2015."
"Yesterday, I received an e-mail from the left-wing antiglobalisation movement."
"They exhorted me and every other MEP to vote against this report."
"Their argument was that, if this report were voted through by a majority in Parliament, it would open the way for an accelerated process of increased free trade between the USA and Europe."
"I hope that they are right and, for exactly that reason, I and the Swedish Conservatives intend to vote, rather, in favour of the report and in favour of a transatlantic free trade area."
"."
"Mr President, thank you for the record amount of time you have allocated to me, as a result of which I shall be to the point and say first of all that my group supports Mr Brok’s report as well as the compromises we have struck in the Committee on Foreign Affairs;"
"I would like to express my appreciation for the work he has done since it is, I think, important that the two major groups more or less take the same line on such an important topic as our relationship with the United States."
"What is paramount, as far as we are concerned, is the fact that the United States and the European Union have many shared interests, not least in the economic area, and we cannot sufficiently stress the importance of those economic interests."
"Those also include the risks that these entail, considering the differences in financial policy of the EU countries and that of the United States."
"Certainly in that area, we must try to strengthen cooperation with them, and Mrs Mann’s report contains many initiatives to that effect which are, in my view, very valuable."
"There is, by the same token, no denying the fact that we see things differently in certain areas."
"That is something that is, in fact, very well demonstrated in Mr Brok’s report."
"We are both independent partners in the partnership."
"I also support the idea of creating a more contractual relationship and partnership, which opens up the possibility, in the event of problems, of being able to discuss those openly and honestly, not least at parliamentary level."
"My question is only whether the USA is prepared to recognise the European Union to such an extent that it is prepared to enter into such a contractual relationship."
"We must, in the coming years, try to develop fresh policy in a number of areas, including energy policy, given the energy problems we experience and where the US and the Europeans share a number of common interests."
"I am in favour of a deeper relationship and of our cooperation to be fleshed out at federal level."
"I could go on for hours about this important topic, but I will have to leave it there."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every partnership has its ups and downs, its strengths and weaknesses."
"The most important thing is that the basis is sound, and despite all the differences of opinion and all the frustration felt by America’s friends about some of the present administration’s policies, the basis here is sound."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council says, economic exchange is strong; people-to-people contacts are working, and politically too, numerous networks of intensive contacts have emerged from different dialogue formats and ad-hoc cooperation."
"Yet the mutual cooperation could still be improved: the New Transatlantic Agenda was well-constructed, but it has not become a genuine foundation and must be revitalised."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore supports the proposal put forward by Mr Brok in his report for a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement as well as Mrs Mann’s vision of a transatlantic market."
"Of course an agreement will add value only if it is filled with life, which means that the American side, too – especially in Congress – must demonstrate a real commitment to it."
"Given the current and long-term challenges that we face, progress here is absolutely necessary."
"As great democracies, we cannot afford not to fulfil our joint potential, and that is why a Partnership Agreement could be a step in the right direction, so let us take it!"
"I would like to add that I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Deputy President of the Commission, I will concentrate on Mr Brok’s report."
"Insofar as the report deals with the International Criminal Court or the question of food safety, we hope for clear speaking."
"I believe that it is important to ensure that the European position is taken into account in an appropriate way."
"In the context of the Transatlantic Partnership, which should enter into force in 2007, it is however an important fact that the present American administration has become a sort of lame duck, and so it is open to question whether it makes sense to conclude this sort of agreement with it."
"Finally I would like to discuss a point in connection with environmental policy, to which my group attaches particular importance."
"I would like to heartily recommend to all Members the new documentary by Al Gore; his film draws the attention of our American friends to the very, very important problem of global warming, which concerns us all and which should feature more prominently in the report, and I would like to quote Al Gore’s statement that:"
"‘I even believe that there is a chance that within the next two years even Bush and Cheney will be forced to change their position on this crisis.’"
"– Mr President, my group is in favour of strengthening trade activity with the USA, just as much as we support the extension of trade in goods with Africa, South America or Australia."
"However, in her report Mrs Mann calls, in her own words, for ‘a barrier-free transatlantic market’, and that is a free trade zone."
"Trade should not be an end in itself for the purpose of higher profit rates, but one of the instruments for ensuring that the population is supplied with goods and services, for creating jobs and promoting social development and prosperity."
"We should therefore first of all assess whether the potential partner complies with internationally agreed standards on the protection of social security, jobs, environment and human rights and whether or not the partner accepts the institutions created to safeguard these."
"Three brief examples: Firstly, there are fundamentally different opinions about GMOs and hormone-treated meat."
"The citizens of the European Union do not want these things."
"In the USA however it is absolutely legal to trade in them."
"Secondly, while public services and comprehensive social security systems are basic parts of political culture in the European Union, this is viewed differently in the USA."
"I ask you: How, in such an integrated economic area, can these things, which are of such importance to, and in the interests of, the public and the European Union, be preserved?"
"Thirdly, does it, or does it not, distort competition if the USA does not sign the Kyoto Protocol?"
"Of course it does, for they can then produce more cheaply to the detriment of the environment."
"As for the decisions of the WTO arbitration court on such things as cotton export subsidies, the USA simply ignores them."
"To conclude: this House recently adopted the Agnoletto report, which clearly states that the European Union should include a clause on human rights in all treaties with third countries."
"The USA makes war in Iraq in contravention of international law; it does not recognise the International Criminal Court; it holds prisoners of war in inhuman conditions in prisons like the one in Guantánamo Bay."
"I believe that this Parliament will lose all credibility whatsoever if it moves towards a free trade zone with the USA, without the USA having previously complied with internationally agreed standards and norms."
"."
"Mr President, as this House’s rapporteur on relations between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China, I welcome in my draft document the American proposal for a strategic dialogue with the EU about China’s peaceful rise."
"This, occurring as it does on a global scale, does, after all, give Europe and the USA an equal share of headaches, which are not restricted to trade conflicts or the enforcement of human rights in China."
"I therefore see paragraphs 8, 9 and 21 of the report by Mr Brok that we are considering as being a welcome helping hand, for they each promote a transatlantic approach to the relationship with China."
"This would, specifically, help diffuse the dangerous tension surrounding Taiwan, as well as move the Tibet issue forward."
"Only this morning, the Dalai Lama told me of his personal conviction that the Tibetan issue must, as a matter of urgency, be dealt with at transatlantic level."
"I think that we could, by combining transatlantic forces, persuade China to be a real stakeholder in the international system."
".Mr President, the plan for strengthening the desired cooperation with the United States has been outlined in an extremely well-balanced manner in the Brok and Mann reports."
"Free trade, legislative dialogue and closer cooperation on security and defence are naturally the main areas of action."
"I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs."
"I should now like to make a few brief political comments."
"If we in Europe want to avoid playing the role of junior partner, we cannot afford to fall further and further behind on economic and military matters."
"I must say that I am surprised at the complaints regarding American unilateralism, since our defence spending is two thirds that of America’s. I am concerned that Europe has only 25% of the USA’s mobile defence potential, and that we have an outdated structure of NATO bases in Europe, which in addition may be scaled down in favour of vague European projects."
"Europe will not be a global player if we lose our capability to create a strategic political partnership with the USA."
"We cannot replace the USA for some other, better partner in this partnership."
"There is only one alternative open to a Europe with a declining economy, ailing public finances and tragic demographic figures."
"That alternative is marginalisation and isolation on the edges of a world that is forging ahead, sometimes recklessly, and sometimes even with hostility to ourselves."
"Mr President, today we are debating one of the EU’s most important partners, and the challenge our relationship with that partner poses to us."
"In this Chamber we often hear strong words of criticism and condemnation of the USA and, much more rarely, appeals to refrain from making any judgments of our largest ally."
"We should reject both extremes."
"Europe needs the United States, and the United States needs Europe."
"I say this against a background of rapid growth in the role of Asia, as well as an increase in the demographic and political role of Latin America and Africa."
"Obsessive anti-Americanism is a disaster, but it is equally disastrous to be deprived of the right to ask our friends questions, for example to do with Guantanamo Bay."
"We must also patiently explain to Washington that if we are retreating, albeit slowly, from interventionism and protectionism in trade, America should do the same for the sake of balance."
"EU-US relations should in the near future take the form of a real partnership and a strategic alliance, but this will only happen if we do not succumb to the stereotype of ‘Europe the teacher’ on the one hand, and ‘Europe the American client’ on the other."
"– Mr President, I should like to express my warm congratulations both to Mr Brok and to Mrs Mann for the creative contributions to the dialogue which they have presented to us today."
"As shown by the relevant statistics, which I will not comment on due to lack of time, EU-US economic relations are characterised by symmetry and acute interdependence."
"Any crises which arise from time to time are, in my opinion, factors of the – so far – unresolved question of the management of this interdependence."
"This interdependence does not relate only to the past; it also relates to the new global economic and social challenges, including the so-called Millennium Goals."
"Meeting these global challenges depends on moving bilateral relations from the current level of pronouncements to a cohesive, transparent and stable institutional framework and a more harmonised bilateral regulatory environment."
"A transatlantic market without barriers is a feasible objective; it just needs to be based on a new and unified regulatory architecture."
"Enlargement and intensification of the areas of close cooperation between the European Union and the USA are expected to have a positive spillover effect on all the problems which constitute the challenges of the contemporary global agenda."
"I would refer, among other things, to the promotion of common principles and values, such as democracy, the rule of law, defence of fundamental rights and freedoms, taking a broader view of the global trade order, effective international environmental protection, combating terrorism and organised crime and establishing a new financial architecture."
"By contrast, breaking the cohesion in EU-US relations will exacerbate international uncertainty and will have adverse repercussions on global cooperation, peace, stability and security, both political and economic."
"The completion of negotiations at the Doha Round constitutes, as Commissioner Mandelson has also said, a test ground for this close relationship between the European Union and the USA."
"Mr President, we need to deepen both economic and political relations between the European Union and the USA, and to draw up a new transatlantic partnership agreement to take effect as of 2007."
"I would particularly like to stress the role of political dialogue between the European Parliament and the US Congress."
"Every EU-US summit should be preceded by a meeting of the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue, dealing with political, economic, cultural and social issues."
"The aim should be for the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue to become one of the most important platforms for EU foreign policy-making."
"The USA’s hegemonistic role at the start of the 21st century requires the EU to display autonomy and true partnership in transatlantic relations, as well as to ask questions openly and to search for a common political platform."
"The most pressing issues are still the need to convince the USA to take part in reforming the UN and to respect human rights and civil liberties in the fight against terror."
"These issues must be discussed at the next EU-US summit."
"I should also like to highlight the issue of visas."
"The European Union should not tolerate a situation in which the citizens of some Member States require a visa to stay in the USA."
"The relevant EU institutions should pose the question of lifting visa restrictions for the USA for all citizens of the European Union in their contacts with the US authorities."
"Mr President, both reports, especially Erika Mann’s, show the intensity of the relationship between the European Union and the United States, and, at the same time, highlight the long list of areas in which there might be difficulties and misunderstandings."
"It is a good time to underline how strong this relationship is and to what extent it goes far beyond the current administration and the problems with the specific administration and specific leadership, which some of us will not like."
"It is something that is deeper than that and it goes far beyond that."
"It goes beyond the strong political debate we might have."
"Precisely because the relationship is strong, it allows us to tell the truth to the other party."
"However, the relationship lacks a real new structure, a real new architecture."
"As is mentioned in the reports, we need a new architecture to protect this relationship, to protect it from external storms and to make it much more solid than it is now."
"This needs commitment from the Commission."
"We are not seeing this commitment in looking for this new architecture, and I think it is the Commission’s role to develop and to work towards that direction."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Erika Mann for all her work on this report and for her willingness and openness to at least consider other perspectives and views."
"However, I do still have some concerns about it."
"Firstly, there is at least a question mark over whether now is the right time, politically, to be advancing a policy of what is essentially a bilateral free trade area."
"We are in a time when the multilateral system is in crisis."
"We have therefore to consider what political message we are sending by doing that."
"Secondly, my concern is that by pursuing extremely controversial issues such as the liberalisation of investment, public procurement and services in a projected transatlantic free trade area, other countries could well perceive that as the EU and US setting the stage for transferring the negotiations over to the global level."
"As you know, they have been extremely highly contested in the WTO framework."
"Finally, on the issue of regulation and harmonisation, in spite of amendments and some nice rhetoric to the contrary, there is a risk that we will see a levelling down – rather than a levelling up – of hard-won environmental health and consumer standards."
"Mr President, in the context of the new Transatlantic Partnership Agreement, I would like to draw particular attention to the current controversy between the EU and the USA on the strategies and methods used in fighting global terrorism."
"The controversy has had the direct result of diminishing the effectiveness of both partners."
"Global terrorism is a new phenomenon whose extent is not yet fully known, but which has a wide reach and operational capabilities."
"It has even been compared with Communism, in that it threatens everyone."
"Instead of appointing some strange investigatory commission with no real powers, we ought to establish proper cooperation between the EU Member States and the United States, by which I also mean strengthening cooperation between their intelligence services."
"Clear principles, coordinated action and mutual trust are needed to fight terrorism, and thereby to provide real protection for human rights in the modern world."
"Mr President, although the draft resolution points out – and with good reason – the need for a stable institutional framework for transatlantic relations, I do believe that this debate should not just be about structures."
"It is, above all, important that there should be a willingness to work together on both sides of the ocean and to address together the problems that we face."
"As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned, we in this House have already devoted much attention – as indeed we should have done – to Guantánamo Bay and the CIA’s allegedly unlawful practices in Europe."
"It goes without saying that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within a strictly legal framework."
"It should also be said, though, that some groups here in this House are not as much interested in the rights of terrorists or alleged terrorists as they are in mainly indulging in basic anti-Americanism."
"If those groups were as active in denouncing the human rights violations in Cuba, for example, much more progress would have been made by now."
"We are talking here about people who have not only been charged with terrorism, but are also behind bars because of their political views."
"Mr President, transatlantic relations are essential if the United States and the European Union are to deal with their shared challenges successfully."
"Both of us are firmly committed to achieving a secure international order."
"To this end, combating terrorism effectively must be our priority."
"In the face of totalitarianism and lack of freedom, there is no option but to have a strong and solid alliance with our natural partners, the United States: that is the only alliance that has produced, and will continue to produce, results."
"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the United States’ Secretary of State’s announcement on Washington joining the multilateral negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme."
"If Teheran renounces uranium enrichment activities, Iran must completely and verifiably suspend all of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities."
"We need full cooperation, leaving aside the hypocritical demagoguery of facile anti-Americanism."
"The need to intensify relations with the United States and to establish an Association Agreement, as requested in the Brok report, is of crucial importance."
"We must enhance our relations, while maintaining a critical spirit, and explore new opportunities for greater joint and coordinated action at international level and greater integration of our markets, which will benefit our citizens."
"The European Union will be heading for failure if it sets itself up in opposition to the United States and does not look at them as its natural allies."
"This is necessary as a result of the values we share – democracy, respect for human rights and individual freedom and the promotion of peace and collective security."
"Furthermore, we hope that the next United States-European Union summit, to be held in June in Vienna, will provide a clear impetus for intensifying our relations in the economic field as well."
"The creation of an Atlantic area of prosperity is essential in order to ensure that our citizens continue to enjoy the economic well-being that Europe and the United States provide them with."
"– Mr President, the partnership between the USA and Europe is a difficult but necessary one."
"As President Barroso once said, it is necessary when speaking with the USA to be at the same eye level."
"Now, it makes little sense to demand of the USA that it should go down on its knees, just so that we can speak at the same eye level."
"We have to become stronger, we have to exploit our potential fully – economically, but clearly also in terms of foreign policy."
"On foreign policy I would like to mention two areas where I believe there have been a few very positive developments."
"The first is the Middle East question regarding financial support."
"I know, Commissioner, that you were very active behind the scenes so that we could come to a reasonable and pragmatic solution."
"I am very happy that Europe and the USA found a solution here."
"The second topic is Iran."
"I not only wish you a lot of luck, Mrs Plassnik, I also hope that you can do much work of persuasion here too. We must remain firm in this matter."
"However, the USA has to talk directly with Iran as well, as has just been announced."
"Above all, though, there is no place for military adventures."
"These are two areas in which I hope that we can speak with the USA as genuinely independent, self-confident partners."
"– Mr President, it is certain that had dear Mr Brok heard the last lecture of Chomsky, the greatest living philosopher, he would have written a different report."
"Chomsky said that the United States of America is dying from a lack of democracy and there is indeed a lack of democracy and intercourse."
"Allow me to prove it to you."
"Any American citizen can come to anywhere in Europe without a visa."
"Can any European citizen go to America without a visa?"
"Let me reply by reminding you that, when MEPs went to America to check CIA flights, American congressmen did not receive them."
"America has not signed the Kyoto Protocol and is poisoning the atmosphere."
"It does not come under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague; it merely sends judges."
"I ultimately refuse to accept Europe as the train whose steam engine is American and which has an American engine driver."
"That is our big mistake."
"We want a relationship on equal terms."
"They do not allow us to have a European army."
"We have ΝΑΤΟ with an American commander-in-chief."
"Even our stock exchanges follow the Dow Jones index."
"We do not have our own policy."
"We have American hegemony."
"We want a relationship on equal terms, not the suzerainty of the Americans, which is harming Europe's progress towards more democracy."
"Mr President, nobody has mentioned Galileo – the European Union’s direct competitor to the Americans’ GPS system – in which the Chinese have a 20% stake; a decision which has the potential to destabilise future arms production and threaten the maintenance of peace."
"Galileo is a hugely ambitious and expensive attempt by the EU to rival the US as a fully-fledged global and space power, why else duplicate GPS?"
"The EU has no legal right to set up its own space programme – that depended on ratification of the failed Constitution."
"However, such niceties are being ignored."
"The EU wants its own satellites to be a part of future military operations, and is not prepared to wait."
"Since all future battlefield weapons will be navigated by satellite, it is obvious that Europe will be helping China to rearm."
"With its commitments in Japan, Taiwan and south-east Asia, can the United States be anything other than wary of anyone complicit in rearming China?"
"Mr President, it is obvious that the United States and the European Union must strengthen their dialogue and their cooperation in the economic, commercial, regulatory or even the social domain by means of the promotion of decent work as trade unions on both sides of the Atlantic wish."
"The question, therefore, is not: ‘Should transatlantic relations be improved?’, but ‘How can they be improved?’."
"From this point of view, I do not think that the answer would necessarily be the creation of a barrier-free transatlantic marketplace by 2015."
"Are all the barriers to the transatlantic market undesirable?"
"No."
"Do we want to open up our market to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or to beef from cattle raised on hormones?"
"No."
"Therefore, I want the transatlantic agenda to be based on practical research of general European interest, and not on unconditional commitment to the doctrine of free trade as a goal in itself."
"I doubt also whether this is necessarily the right time to propose a bilateral initiative on such a scale when our American partner is threatening global macroeconomic stability by allowing its trade and budget deficits to slide while it is publicly calling into question the merits and principles of multilateralism, or opposing initiatives like the Kyoto Protocol or the International Criminal Tribunal."
"I should like Mrs Mann’s excellent report to be amended in light of this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel strengthened in my intention to address a range of issues at the approaching summit, issues that concern our common future including cooperation in order to promote democracy, human rights, freedom and prosperity, but also issues relating to the global challenges we face: climate change, the fight against terrorism, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and also the issue of energy security, which is increasingly occupying us on both sides of the Atlantic and which has been the subject of intensive work in the Council in this half-year period;"
"I have already referred to the air traffic agreement in my introduction. Regarding international questions it has been pointed out that in recent months progress has been achieved on a range of issues."
"Here we need to advance slowly and step by step."
"I would like to thank the Commission, too, for its close cooperation."
"I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs and all those who have also worked on this report and those who regularly take part in the debate on our transatlantic relations."
"These relations are central for the European Union and for us all, and so we must avoid adopting one-sided positions."
"What is needed, rather, is to discuss existing irritations and all unresolved questions as partners in a dialogue."
"These points must not, however, overshadow that which binds us together or that which is profound and resistant to strain: the shared community of values and the work on the world issues that are important to us."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for this excellent debate on a central and essential relationship that will indeed focus on how much further our cooperation can grow on foreign policy and democracy promotion, on increased cooperation in relation to energy, and on the enhancement of growth and competitiveness in our economies."
"Let me respond to a few question rather briefly."
"Indeed, we plan to sign a new agreement on higher education and vocational training, including launching an innovative transatlantic degree programme."
"As for tourism – which was also mentioned – exchanges would be facilitated by extending the visa waiver programme to all our Member States."
"As to the environment, we want to relaunch our dialogue with the US, notably by relaunching the high-level dialogue on the environment, including the issue of climate change."
"Our cooperation on energy will also touch on climate change issues from the standpoint of energy efficiency."
"However, our overall dialogue needs to be broader than this."
"For those who might not have been here at the beginning, I would like to come back to the questions of visa waiver and visa reciprocity."
"These are issues that we not only mention on a regular basis, but they are there in the dialogue, and will certainly be taken up again with President Bush."
"On passenger name records and the recent European Court of Justice judgment relating to the cases brought by the European Parliament, we respect the Court’s judgment and analysis and we will fully comply with it."
"We will cooperate with Parliament, the Council and with the national data protection authorities to ensure that the judgment is fully complied with."
"We have only four months to find a new legal basis, but I hope we will be able to cooperate in such a way that there will be no lowering of protection standards, no disruption to transatlantic air traffic, and that a high level of security will be maintained."
"Finally, we are looking forward to the successful setting-up of the Galileo satellite navigation system, where cooperation with third countries is necessary and useful, and where we hope that cooperation with the US will bring an additional benefit to our companies and citizens."
"We are very thankful to the two rapporteurs and for the engagement and commitment of Parliament."
"It will certainly give us more strength."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to add my thanks to the rapporteurs for two excellent reports and simply to make two points."
"The first is that for all the attention that is occasionally given to disagreements in trade matters between the United States and the European Union, it is worth bearing in mind that 98% of our trade is dispute-free."
"Where there are disputes, both sides move rapidly, not always with immediate success, but rapidly to resolve these amicably and quickly."
"That is something we should note and celebrate without being complacent."
"The second point I want to make is that Erika Mann’s report does not actually call for a single free trade area, so those who are opposing it are aiming at the wrong target."
"What the report calls for is a barrier-free area, a barrier-free transatlantic market between Europe and the United States."
"That is something that we can applaud and encourage."
"As I said earlier on, I do not think it will attract the support of some sort of ‘big-bang’ elaborate scheme."
"However, the fact is that this trade and investment relationship between us is worth a amount in terms of people’s jobs, their livelihoods, their futures."
"It is not so much tariffs, anymore, that stand in the way of growth in this relationship; it is non-tariff barriers, regulatory barriers, differences in standards and licensing and all the rest."
"There is a sort of bonfire of barriers to set alight."
"These are very noble and correct economic objectives for us to set our hands and our shoulders to."
"This is why I so heartily commend this report and will dedicate myself and my services to realising its spirit."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a. m."
"With respect to the next EU-US summit, I would like both to congratulate the rapporteurs, and to underline the need to improve relations between the two communities."
"Joint action is needed today in areas of common interest and shared values and threats, in order to lend a new, effective and representative dimension to our common policy and economic relations and to combine forces to face the threat of terrorism."
"Global problems require global and prompt action."
"The priorities of the UN summit in 2005 and the drafting of a plan of action against terrorism should become our goal and our motivation for cooperation, and should speed up reforms in the structures both of NATO and of the UN, with particular emphasis on the reform of the UN Security Council."
"The decline of the ‘enemy of the Western world’ in Eastern Europe, and disagreement between the Member States on intervention in Iraq, gives rise to a question posed frequently both in the USA and in Europe, namely whether NATO has any useful purpose any more."
"The threat of terrorism could provide a basis for the existence of the alliance, but this challenge requires the creation of new political and military structures and cooperation with regard to the EU’s foreign and security policy."
"Steps must be taken to draw up a common strategy on securing supplies of energy and raw materials by diversifying our supply sources, production and transportation, and to intensify political dialogue on renewable sources of energy."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, we read about this being Green Week, and the focus of this year’s Green Week is biodiversity loss."
"Last year it was climate change, and both climate change and biodiversity loss are the two greatest environmental challenges facing us."
"I rise to protest at the lack of time given to debate the issue of biodiversity loss during this part-session, as this is Green Week."
"As parliamentarians we should have acknowledged Green Week and the biodiversity loss focus by having a debate on that issue."
"We have the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive, the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, the structural funds, 18 000 Natura 2000 sites, plus a network, and yet we have no joined-up thinking in relation to this issue."
"We have invasive alien species here, over 40% of the EU’s species – both flora and fauna – are under threat, and yet we have no debate on this issue during a designated Green Week."
"I protest, and I would like you, Mr Vice-President, to pass on my protestations to the President of Parliament."
"– Mr President, I am glad indeed that Mrs Plassnik and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner are still here."
"Last weekend there were violent excesses against peaceful demonstrators in Moscow."
"I think it is most necessary that we as the European Union say that this should not be allowed to happen in a country that currently holds the chair in the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers."
"This issue concerns a strong partner of the European Union."
"We will be demonstrating on Friday afternoon in Brussels and in many other places in Europe against the violations of human rights committed against peaceful demonstrators."
"On the weekend after next in Warsaw, Gay Pride will take place, and I have heard statements from officials in Warsaw that there could be excesses here too and that anyone who participates must be prepared for the possibility of violence."
"I will march and fly the flag for the rights – guaranteed by Article 13 – of everyone in the European Union."
"I hope that many people will take part and say: there is no place for intolerance in the European Union."
"Let us fly the flag!"
"– From this Chamber, I should like to salute the Portuguese fishermen."
"On their national day, they are holding a massive day of protest, in which they are paralysing the fishing fleet in order to call for the adoption of measures needed to safeguard the present and the future of a sector that is vital not only for Portugal but also for the various EU Member States."
"The crisis that the fisheries sector has long endured, which is due to aspects such as the commercialisation of fisheries, namely how first sale prices are established, has been exacerbated by the dramatic rise in the price of fuel."
"This has led to the economic suffocation of the sector and has had deep-rooted social impact, in terms of reduced salaries and increased unemployment."
"Emergency measures must therefore be taken at Community level in order to ensure revenue for the sector and its workers, which is what the sector’s representatives have long been seeking."
"This is especially true given that there is a common fisheries policy."
"– Mr President, in Poland strikes by health workers and the tragic state of the health service are a threat not only to the health, but also to the life of my countrymen."
"As I have only a minute at my disposal, I would like to give just two examples of a liberal and destructive way of thinking which operates in terms of money and profit."
"Since 1989 more than 20 000 doctors have left Poland, and 1 500 specialist doctors left the country in the five months after accession to the EU."
"Every year we train 2 000 doctors, which means that for over 12 years we have been training doctors for other countries."
"On top of that, the insatiable and greedy foreign pharmaceutical corporations are consuming more than half of my country’s health budget."
"For this reason I appeal to the European Parliament to think about the treatment of healthcare services, about restricting the economic wilfulness of the pharmaceutical monopolies and about changing the way in which the medical profession and health care are seen so that their aim is the health and good of human beings, and not just financial gain and profit, particularly as strikes in health services are also taking place in many other EU Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the House’s attention to last week’s extension of the house arrest of the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi."
"This leader of the democratic opposition, who is also a Nobel Peace Prize holder, has been cut off from the outside world for 10 of the last 17 years."
"She was due to be released last week, but the military junta ruling Burma has announced that she still represents a threat to national security, and has extended her arrest."
"Today I would like to raise once again the matter of respect for human rights as a basic and fundamental principle of the European Communities."
"I propose that the President of the European Parliament send a special delegation to visit the leader of the Burmese opposition who has spent so many years in isolation, and express our support for her."
"Mr President, since the 1993 Copenhagen Declaration, the enforcement of minority rights has become one of the accession criteria."
"There is a great discrepancy between minority protection systems in the ten new and the fifteen old Member States."
"While all ten new Member States ratified the two legally binding minority protection documents of the Council of Europe, the Language Charter and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, three of the old Member States, namely France, Belgium and Greece, have not done so as yet."
"Old Member States ought to catch up with the new Member States in respect of minority protection."
"It is typical that regional and minority languages have been completely left out of the Mavrommatis report concerning multilingualism, recently adopted by the European Parliament."
"It is typical that the minority pages have been completely left out of the D Plan launched by the European Commission to regain the trust of European Union citizens, while every seventh European citizen speaks a minority language."
"Mr President, today the leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Schulz, insolently and arrogantly attacked members of the Polish Government and their right to take decisions that reflect the will of the majority of the Polish people."
"Mr Schulz’s lack of respect for democracy does not surprise me, as his political champions have been Karl Marx and Rosa Luxembourg."
"Mr Schulz, the most bloodthirsty form of totalitarianism emerged not in Poland, but in your country, where today neo-fascist organisations are growing in strength and taking to the streets."
"I would therefore ask you to deal with these demonstrations, which pose a real threat to Europe, rather than condemning the Polish Prime Minister for merely upholding the will of the majority of Poles who support family values and who do not support hedonistic, pornographic parades by gay activists."
"Poland has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe, and I do not believe that promoting homosexual relationships would help us."
"Unless, of course, you know of some way in which they can breed of which we are not aware."
"German domination of Europe is fortunately a thing of the past, so please, Mr Schulz, remember this once and for all, and keep your German aspirations well clear of Poland’s internal affairs."
"Mr President, I would like us in the European Parliament to acknowledge the real effects of the Russia-EU summit in Sochi, rather than the media impact."
"As far as one very specific matter is concerned, namely the implementation of the 1996 EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with regard to the ban on Polish meat imports, the Agreement is currently nothing more than a paper construct and window-dressing."
"How is it that there is effectively no solidarity within the European Union on this matter?"
"Many countries of the old EU are not troubled by the fact that while they happily trade with Moscow, other countries such as Poland are excluded from this trade."
"This matter will show in practice whether European solidarity is just a phrase on the lips of some politicians, or whether it exists in reality."
"At the moment, unfortunately, and I say this with pain and regret, it is nothing more than a phrase."
"I wish that the opposite were true."
"Last Sunday, I had an opportunity to be part of an ad hoc delegation from the European Parliament observing the presidential elections in Columbia."
"Following changes in the Constitution some years ago, for the first time in Columbia's history, President Álvaro Uribe Vélez was elected to a second four year term."
"The elections were, firstly, marked by the fact that only 45 per cent of Columbian citizens, who have the right to vote, used the opportunity to participate in the polls."
"However, as an election observer, I can assure the European Parliament that with the exception of a few errors and infringements, no fundamental violations were observed and the elections were democratic, free and fair."
"Mr President, I propose that the European Parliament congratulate the newly elected President of Columbia and also initiate greater aid for Columbia, above all, for the implementation of the Justice and Peace Law, which could solve the security problems in this country."
"Thank you very much for your suggestion."
"I think we shall do that."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the House’s attention to a grave problem that is currently emerging in some EU Member States, and which constitutes a threat to fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties."
"We in the European Parliament cannot idly stand by and watch as restrictions are imposed on democracy, on the right of European citizens to express their own opinions and on freedom of assembly."
"This threat is all the more menacing when representatives of governments consent to violations of citizens’ rights, as is unfortunately the case at present in my own country, Poland."
"We need to be alert to such situations and to react effectively in cases where a Member State violates basic principles that are a criterion for membership of the European Union."
"Violating citizen’s rights is not an internal affair of Member States."
"The response to such situations must not be silence, but immediate action."
"This is what all citizens of a democratic organisation such as the European Union expect of the European Council."
"Mr President, Cyprus possesses a small fleet of military defence helicopters, amongst them two French Gazelle helicopters."
"A year ago, the fuel indicator of one of these two helicopters was sent to a company called Vibro-Meter in the UK for repair."
"This was speedily carried out, but since then, the British Government has prevented the re-export of the repaired part back to Cyprus, stating that the UK has a defence equipment embargo on Cyprus."
"Cyprus, along with Britain, takes part in the common defence and security actions of the EU, including participation in EU peace missions, EU battle group formations and the European Defence Agency."
"How is it possible or even logical for one Member State – Britain – to have an arms embargo on another Member State – Cyprus?"
"This surely must be in gross violation of the principles on which our Union was founded."
"I request that you make representations to the British Government so that, in the interests of the unity of our European Union, this embargo is lifted immediately."
"Mr President, I quote from a recent article in the British Press: ‘Britain’s booming wine industry will be scuppered by EU regulations that want to prohibit growers in Britain, all of them unsubsidised, from planting any more vines if their sales continue to soar’."
"Growers – many of them in my region – have been calling on the Commission to increase the threshold or scrap it altogether."
"Just what is it about English wine that becomes so intimidating?"
"Is it that when tasted blind with French wines and others, English wines come out on top for taste, thus our competitors are simply jealous?"
"Or is it because there are regions in other EU countries producing hugely subsidised grapes that will never produce decent wine?"
"Or is it just that when the EU sees something successful, it has to interfere, regulate and destroy it?"
"Can you wonder why more and more folk want nothing to do with the EU when it destroys their livelihoods?"
"That concludes the item."
"The next item is the report (A6-0179/2006) by Mr Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade and poverty: designing trade policies to maximise trade’s contribution to poverty relief (2006/2031(INI))."
"– Madam President, first of all I would – of course – like to thank most warmly all those who have worked with me on producing my report."
"I would particularly like to mention Mrs Pribaz; of course I would also like to thank the colleagues on my committee, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Development who have helped enrich this report with very constructive amendments."
"The report contains initial suggestions as to how trade policies can and should be oriented in order to contribute to solving the problem of poverty."
"I am pleased that this text establishes very clearly that trade must proceed according to certain rules if it is to become a meaningful and effective instrument for combating poverty and developing prosperity."
"That is because trade, whether at a regional, national or international level, is not an end or value in itself, but rather a means of ensuring that people are provided with goods in order to satisfy their needs."
"In today’s world, provision for all people is not guaranteed, and the opportunities which trade brings are not divided fairly – neither geographically between States or regions, nor between individual actors in the market."
"One of the results of this unequal distribution is poverty, poverty which reproduces itself. This is a problem which exists above all in developing countries, but not only there."
"Evidently, the proverbial invisible hand of the market cannot even solve this problem within a developed economic area like the European Union."
"The more that politics edges away from organising the economic order and leaves it to liberal market forces to do as they wish, the more the goals of social cohesion move further away – all the more so since at the same time social rights, democratic participation and environmental protection are ignored and regional and local conditions and particularities are not sufficiently taken into account."
"On a global level, where existing differences in development and distribution are much more fundamental and serious, this situation appears several times more intensified."
"If the present policy of urgent and speedy liberalisation under pressure continues, then the Millennium Goal of halving the number of starving people by 2015 cannot be achieved."
"Politics has the task of creating basic conditions capable of producing social development that is peaceful, that avoids exclusion and that promotes prosperity."
"A policy that opens borders for the international market can be a part of this."
"Until now this has proven successful in countries where industrialisation could first of all take place under the protection of state measures, where an institutional framework was in place to regulate the distribution of social and economic wealth, where a sufficiently robust economic sector existed permitting flexible activity, and where the state was independent enough to support particular economic sectors against the opening up of the market."
"A high level of foreign debt and dependence on credit considerably restrict this competitiveness."
"In countries where these conditions did not exist, however, accelerated liberalisation has led to deindustrialisation, destruction of the environment and increasing dependency and has worsened the poverty of the inhabitants."
"I can only refer to just a few aspects of the report here."
"The chance to develop independently and to industrialise must be given to all countries, just as it was once given to today’s industrialised countries."
"This includes a country’s right to decide for itself when, how much and if at all it wants to open up its markets to goods and services."
"This is, by the way, already provided for in the rules of the WTO."
"Since the signing of the WTO agreements, the profits made by producers on the prices of raw and primary materials have continually sunk so low that in the South as well as the North more and more small and medium-sized firms will have to close."
"At the same time, the same rules mean that one-crop agriculture is promoted, which may bring enormous profits for agribusiness but which has disastrous consequences for the environment and for employment."
"This is an agriculture which ultimately destroys its own basis for existence."
"Instead of this, politics must do its utmost to ensure, through regulation as well as through financial support, that biological diversity is preserved by lasting forms of exploitation."
"Furthermore it is highly doubtful whether essential public services can be provided purely on the basis of market-economy structures to a sufficient extent that it could be said that the basic right to a dignified life is fulfilled."
"Here it is a question of simple but necessary things like access to high-quality drinking water, health, care, education and training."
"In areas where conditions do permit the liberalisation of market sectors, care should be taken that in doing so, international standards on the protection of social security, jobs and the environment are respected and held to be binding."
"These and many other important points are included in the report in front of you."
"I call upon the Commission and the Council to read the suggestions of this House and to take them into consideration when forming policies."
"."
"Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to continue the dialogue on trade issues with the European Parliament."
"Mr Markov’s contribution provides a wealth of information and policy prescriptions on how to tackle the crucial relationship between trade and poverty, both in our bilateral agreements and in multilateral negotiations."
"I share to a large extent the overall thrust of the report."
"As I have said on several occasions, I want to put trade at the service of development."
"Trade is the driver of economic growth and, in the right circumstances, it spreads prosperity, but it is not a panacea and does not automatically lead to poverty reduction."
"Trade liberalisation needs to be implemented gradually."
"It should take place within a stable and supportive domestic policy framework and, in some cases, will require flanking measures to help bring about the process of adjustment."
"We are already doing a lot of what the report recommends we should do."
"I shall give a number of concrete examples."
"Firstly, in trade negotiations, including in the DDA and EPAs, and as recommended by the report, the EU respects the right of developing countries to liberalise progressively and to maintain flexibilities for their sensitive sectors."
"Within the DDA, the EU is keen to see countries contributing according to their capacities and levels of development."
"This lies behind the idea of special and differentiated treatment."
"We are responding favourably to LDCs’ and developing countries’ interests in services, including as regards Mode 4 and in the sectors they have requested."
"Also, under GATT, we respect the freedom of countries to decide whether, and to what extent, they open up their service sector."
"We have not made any service requests to LDCs."
"We have set up a scheme to support ACP sugar producers in adjusting to changes following our sugar reform, and we are conscious of the need to address preference erosion."
"We actively promote regional integration and South-South trade, which the report rightly recognises as key to development, especially for marginalised countries."
"Beyond trade negotiations, in the area of building capacity, the EU – which is to say the Commission and Member States combined – provides more than 50% of the overall trade-related assistance funded worldwide."
"Commission-managed, trade-related assistance was around EUR 850 million a year in the period 2001-2004 and, on the basis of the pledge that President Barroso made at the last G8 Summit, this will rise to EUR 1 billion in 2007."
"We are actively engaged in the aid-for-trade debate taking place in the WTO."
"The Commission is also a pioneer in carrying out trade sustainability impact assessments – SIAs – to assess the potential impact of trade liberalisation on all three pillars of sustainable development."
"Since 1999, we have carried out these assessments on all the EU’s major trade negotiations, identifying areas where flanking measures may be needed."
"With respect to the recommendations of the report on labour standards and social rights, although labour is regrettably not part of the DDA, all our recent trade, bilateral and regional agreements recognise and promote social rights, including gender equality, child labour, forced labour and freedom of association."
"Moreover, through GSP+, we provide special incentives for developing countries that respect core labour rights."
"DG Trade is also funding an ILO pilot project on decent work indicators to predict and monitor the impact of trade on decent work."
"I was also pleased to see in the report a number of recommendations addressed to other players."
"The report calls on other developed countries and advanced developing countries to implement duty-free, quota-free schemes for LDCs, matching our own ‘Everything but Arms’."
"After agreeing on 97% coverage in Hong Kong, I would suggest, nonetheless, that the United States needs to engage fully on the implementation of that commitment."
"The report also calls on other WTO members to match the EU’s move in Hong Kong on export subsidies and to eliminate all forms of export support, including export credits and food aid."
"The report recommends substantial reductions of domestic subsidies by developed countries and a solution for cotton – again, key areas where we expect the United States to deliver."
"Since this is an open dialogue between us, I should like to raise a couple of points where the Commission’s views differ from the report."
"Aid for trade is an essential complement, but in no way a substitute, for a development-friendly outcome in the main negotiating areas of the DDA."
"The biggest gains for developing countries lie in the market access component of the round and, in particular, in the South-South dimension."
"With reference to the risk of fraudulent distortion of ‘Everything but Arms’, we should, of course, remain vigilant on triangular trade but, to our knowledge, only one case of abuse has been reported."
"As to the recommendation to exclude public services from negotiations, we do not consider it necessary to renegotiate the GATT to exclude public services."
"It is entirely up to WTO members to decide which sectors they wish to open."
"We have, for instance, made it clear that we do not wish to take additional commitments on health, education and audiovisual services."
"Let me once again thank all those who have contributed to this report for their political support and guidance, and for the constructive criticism and concrete suggestions for action contained in it and others like it."
"I remain committed to informing Parliament regularly and to listening to your views on major trade and development matters, as I have done to date and will continue to do in the future."
"– It is a well known fact that fair trade can be an effective means of reducing poverty."
"However, in the last 10 years, the proportion of world trade represented by the poorest countries, trading mostly in low added value products – agricultural raw materials and extracted natural resources, has decreased."
"In order to eradicate poverty, first of all, radical policy changes are needed in both industrialised and developing countries so that the structural causes of poverty are removed."
"To achieve this, it is not enough to put fair trade rules, bilateral and multilateral trade relations into practice and improve WTO rules, but we must also develop trade relations between developing countries, the South-South dimension."
"In the future, economic development will have a decisive influence on the reduction of poverty, especially investment in small and medium business, which provides the local market in developing countries with goods and services and creates higher added value, and offers opportunities for world trade."
"."
"Madam President, the history of trade in goods, both in primitive societies and in developed societies, shows that wherever such trade is based on fair rules it helps these societies survive and develop."
"There is no doubt on this score."
"In our group we believe that the free and fair trade for which the EU strives is also contributing at present to reducing poverty in many regions of the world."
"There are instances of failure, of course, but they are primarily due to the failure to implement fair rules rather than to the trade ."
"In our view, the overtones of the report drafted by Mr Markov appeared on first sight to be that free trade exacerbates poverty rather than reducing it."
"Our group rejected this position."
"However, after discussions and amendments to the report, it now sounds better, and, together with the proposed amendments that I believe will be adopted tomorrow, it will be acceptable to our group."
"It is also obvious that while trade is not the only way of reducing poverty, it can make a major contribution."
"In conclusion I would like to propose that we give free, and I repeat free, trade a chance, so that it can help to eliminate poverty."
"In English, that is ‘let us establish free and fair trade to make poverty history’."
". – Madam President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating Mr Markov on his important report and Commissioner Mandelson on the important speech he made a short while ago."
"No one can doubt that the development of international trade and the liberalisation of international trade have made a decisive contribution to reducing poverty and mitigating the inequalities between developed and developing countries."
"However, as Mr Mandelson quite rightly said, this is not a panacea."
"As the statistics from international organisations show, we need organised liberalisation, the liberalisation of international trade on the basis of rules and regulatory mechanisms."
"As the recent World Bank study showed, the anarchic liberalisation of international trade has resulted in an increase in poverty and the deconstruction of the productive fabric in the poorest countries of Africa."
"The same is also happening inside the European Union: there are areas which have been hit by unemployment, deindustrialisation and poverty."
"The European Union should, in my opinion, contribute to the democratisation and strengthening of the multilateral trade system through the reform of the World Trade Organisation for the benefit of the poorest countries."
"It should also support with consistency the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and contribute to the successful completion of the Doha Round negotiations within the framework of a balanced and mutually beneficial compromise."
"Finally, the European Union should continue to implement the important 'Everything but Arms' initiative."
"."
"Mr President, one of the most important achievements of the 20th century was the lifting of millions out of poverty."
"The emergence of China and India on the global trading scene played a huge role in this feat and they continue to lead the developing world by example."
"But the challenge is far from over."
"Even today, 49% of the population in LDCs still live on less than a dollar a day."
"By 2015, 471 million of them will be living in extreme poverty."
"Trade liberalisation is vital if we are to lift these people out of devastating poverty."
"But trade is not a magic bullet."
"The critical challenge is how to promote poverty reduction in a newly-liberalised open economy."
"The majority of LDCs are still galloping in the dark in this regard."
"Free trade is not the same as ."
"The fundamental priority must be for governments to implement macro-economic strategies that integrate trade in a way that effectively supports poverty reduction."
"We must help them to do this through increasing assistance and improving its effectiveness."
"This is not basic aid plunging the developing world into further debt: this is investment – investment in infrastructure, technology, human capital and the global trading system itself."
"Finally, in return, we will enjoy greater openness and competitiveness and the LDCs will benefit from greater capital accumulation and technological progress."
"These will form the engine of growth."
"International trade will be the fuel for that engine, and together we can accelerate towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals."
"."
"Mr President, I find myself very strongly in accord with those who have spoken in this short but important debate."
"Its themes have been those of free trade and fair trade."
"Those are the twin pillars that support our policy objectives."
"Whilst bilateral trade agreements have their place, it is multilateral trade negotiations in a multilateral framework for the international trading system that, in our view, are best able to bring equity and balance to the international trading system."
"That is why the Doha Development Agenda is so important."
"It has at its heart the ideal of free trade contributing to poverty reduction in the world."
"As somebody once said, the victory of ideals has to be organised and, as one of the speakers tonight said, we want to see an organised liberalisation of trade."
"We do not want to see a jungle in which the rules of that jungle operate to the detriment of developing countries and the poor in the world."
"That is what the Commission is pursuing on behalf of Member States and I strongly believe that this report will guide us in these continuing efforts to achieve trade justice in the world, which is why I welcome it so strongly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m."
"– Trade is a fundamental instrument in the current international context."
"Trade agreements among countries can ensure political stability and form a solid basis for more or less lasting diplomatic agreements."
"Increasingly, therefore, they are the main players in a world based essentially on economic principles."
"Trade thus provides an extremely important vehicle and opportunity for economic and social development, but it is also a weapon – largely in the hands of the developed countries – that needs to be used with care, since it can irreversibly determine the future of a country or a geographical area."
"It is therefore absolutely crucial for Western countries to make a conscious effort to ensure that current trade practices and new agreements help to narrow the gap between North and South, rather than widening it through procedures that take no account of national differences."
"While liberalisation is a global and now irreversible process that can bring well-being and wealth by creating new opportunities in developing countries, it must still be regulated according to the differing situations where it is to be carried out."
"It must also be backed up with specific measures to ensure that economic development keeps pace with, and does not outstrip, appropriate and necessary development in other basic sectors, such as health, education and social policies."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, of the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 [15763/3/2005 – C6-0087/2006 – 2004/0217(COD)]. Rapporteur: Erika Mann (A6-0171/2006)."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all my colleagues for their contribution to this text and for their efforts to find a solution."
"I am also grateful to the Council and to the Austrian Presidency, which have taken note of the views of Parliament and given priority to the regulation of medicinal products for paediatric use."
"Finally, Commissioner, I should like to thank your staff for their technical input and recommendations."
"I was extremely pleased to work with them."
"Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we shall be able to approve on second reading a regulation of vital importance for health in Europe."
"We were unanimous as to the goal, and our discussions enabled us to reach agreement on the operational aspects of this regulation."
"It seems inconceivable that, in 2006, our children do not have treatment tailored to their needs."
"However, this is the situation we have."
"Today, numerous medicinal products administered to children have not been developed specifically for them."
"Frequently, products used for the youngest children are the same as those prescribed for adults, with only the dose reduced – and with consequences that are sometimes catastrophic."
"A child’s metabolism is different from that of an adult."
"Children therefore need specific pharmaceutical forms, not only for better tolerance but also for greater effectiveness and safety."
"This European Regulation creates all the conditions for the development of paediatric medicines, notably by supporting innovation and research and by creating incentives for pharmaceutical laboratories, while at the same time requiring them to develop a paediatric form for every new drug and to make it available in all Member States."
"On a large number of points, the Council had already followed Parliament’s recommendations at first reading."
"I am thinking particularly of the system of incentives which extends by six months the Protection Certificate for all new paediatric indications."
"The Council had also accepted on first reading Parliament's request to avoid additional clinical trials being carried out on children where not absolutely necessary."
"On the eve of the second reading, only a few differences of opinion remained."
"A common position had to be found on technical details."
"We therefore reached an agreement between the three institutions, largely through application of the 'better regulation' principle."
"I am thinking in particular of the question of the independence of members of the Paediatric Committee and the issue of pharmacovigilance."
"Earlier legislation already included robust measures on these points."
"It is therefore more appropriate to refer to that legislation rather than create an accumulation of rules."
"This agreement was also helped by the Commission's response to our demands concerning the use of potentially dangerous substances in the outer covering of the medicinal product."
"We welcome the official declaration submitted to us and now, of course, await concrete results."
"There is one further point to which I should like to draw the Commission’s attention, namely the question of the period of time between the issue of a marketing authorisation and the availability of the medicinal product to patients."
"A directive exists on transparency, which establishes the deadlines for setting the price and for the reimbursement for medicines."
"The timing differences between Member States are too great."
"This is a situation which has negative consequences for patients."
"I have discussed this point with colleagues in all parliamentary groups and we should like to ask you what can be done to reduce these disparities."
"Finally, the Commission’s initial proposal states that all requests for an extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate resulting from a new paediatric indication must be lodged no later than two years prior to expiry of the certificate."
"I support that approach, but, above all, we must be pragmatic."
"By adopting this measure as it stands, we would stand the risk of depriving ourselves of medicinal products which, when this law entered into force, happened to be in this two-year period."
"Under the terms of this article, it would be impossible to conduct research in order to develop a paediatric indication."
"The transitional clause we are proposing, with the agreement of a majority of my colleagues, is intended to remedy this undesired effect."
"We are therefore requesting that, for five years, any application for an extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate as a result of a new paediatric indication may be lodged no later than six months before expiry of the certificate."
"After this period, the Commission’s initial proposal will apply."
"We should be grateful for your agreement on this point."
"To conclude, this text provides the opportunity to match words with actions in supporting European research; that is what we shall do tomorrow."
"A great debate is currently in progress to find the best way of promoting Europe to our fellow citizens."
"Europeans are not interested in grandiose rhetoric – they expect action."
"This regulation on paediatric medication is a concrete response to that expectation."
"This text is a good example of the added value of Europe in everyday life, as no Member State acting on its own would be able to promote such a policy on behalf of all children."
"."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, first of all, like to thank Mrs Grossetête, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and to congratulate her on her report."
"I also want to thank the members of the committee for supporting this proposal. I would also like to emphasise the committed work of the Austrian Presidency in connection with this matter."
"Thanks to the constructive cooperation between the three institutions we now have the opportunity to bring this legislative procedure to a close."
"We must be reticent about making new laws, but this proposal is necessary."
"In the European Union today, more than half of the medicinal products given to children have never been tested for this usage."
"The reason for this is that paediatric medicinal products frequently only have a tiny share of the market and clinical testing can be very expensive."
"In practice this means that a doctor who prescribes a medicinal product for a child does not always know if it works at all or whether it could have any side effects."
"With the new Regulation this problem will be solved in the interests of children. It creates incentives for first-class research in this field and promotes the development and licensing of high-quality, effective medicines for children."
"I would like to emphasise two items which were raised in this Parliament’s discussion. Firstly, the influence of the so-called Transparency Directive and, secondly, the treatment of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction."
"The European Parliament was quite right to point out the significance of the Transparency Directive. I agree with you wholeheartedly that the decisions of national authorities on the price of paediatric medicinal products and on the reimbursement of costs in connection with these must not lead to the availability of these products being delayed."
"Decisions about pricing policies and reimbursement of costs are the responsibilities of the Member States. However, the Commission cannot accept any deviation from the procedural rules laid down in the Transparency Directive."
"We have therefore intensified our efforts to scrutinise more thoroughly the proper execution of the Directive in all Member States and to ensure that it is more effectively enforced."
"Furthermore, I have established the Pharmaceutical Forum together with my colleague Mr Kyprianou. Working in partnership with Member States and concerned groups, this framework is intended to provide solutions to urgent questions relating to the medicinal products sector, including among other things aspects of price and reimbursement."
"The European Parliament has also raised the important question of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction."
"I share your judgment that we must be extremely careful in dealing with such dangerous substances in all areas."
"Nevertheless I believe that the amendments – which, together with this Regulation, aim at prohibiting the use of such substances as auxiliary agents in medicinal products in general – are problematic for two reasons."
"Firstly: the regulation on paediatric medicinal products can only regulate the auxiliary agents in medicines for children."
"Secondly, we cannot rule out the possibility that – precisely for certain important medicinal products – such auxiliary agents are indispensable."
"The Commission believes that a further thorough scientific analysis of these issues is necessary, before we decide on possible measures."
"The Commission therefore plans to ask the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for an opinion on the use of such substances as auxiliary agents in medicinal products for human use."
"This opinion will be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council."
"Within six months of the delivery of the opinion, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council about the measures that it plans to put in place."
"I have given a declaration to this effect to the Secretariat of the European Parliament so that the wording can be published and made accessible to all Members(1)."
"By way of conclusion, allow me to stress that this regulation is a good example of better lawmaking, one that does equal justice to the aims of safeguarding public health and promoting innovation."
"This is one of the Commission’s first legislative proposals that is based on a detailed impact assessment."
"The proposal will improve health protection for our children and it will simultaneously promote innovation and competitiveness in the European medicinal products industry."
"I am grateful for your support of this proposal."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Grossetête for having achieved a consensus between all groups as well as with the Council and the Commission."
"This is the culmination of a process which has, in my view, lasted six years."
"Six years ago we discussed the problem and possible solutions with experts in Strasbourg for the first time, and now we are at the end of the legislative procedure."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner and all those who have worked on this project, in particular however Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the shadow rapporteur of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who contributed a great deal and who unfortunately cannot be here today."
"I wish her a speedy recovery."
"This proposal contributes to the solution of a serious problem."
"I myself have worked as a doctor in a children’s clinic and I have found out what a drama it is for children, parents and doctors when many forms of medication necessary for the treatment of children are prohibited."
"I myself have had problems, but not as many problems as other colleagues and other families."
"In some of these families children have died, because medicinal products that lacked authorisation were not administered or because, for example, children suffering from HIV were given too weak a dosage, which caused the children to become resistant to the medication."
"That is why it is so good that we now have this regulation."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission have taken up the proposal to impose the MICE programme on off-patent medicines."
"At first reading I was not completely satisfied with the uniform period of six months. Even so, it is vital to make a start, and if we see that the six months are not appropriate for all cases, then perhaps we shall have to make further amendments."
"Now we just have to act quickly, and so I am very glad that Mrs Grossetête has persuaded the Council and the Commission to adopt Article 18."
"For if we had not managed this, then the first medicines would only have come onto the market on the basis of the incentive system in 2009 at the earliest."
"Now we shall be able to recognise positive effects immediately after the regulation is adopted, and that is important, because we have to act quickly in order to improve children’s health."
"."
"Madam President, I should first of all like to compliment and congratulate Mrs Grossetête."
"It is an important topic we are discussing this evening."
"Children take medicinal products; lots of them, relatively speaking."
"That is why it is so important that children are administered the right medicinal products, in the right dose and in the right form of administration."
"The Commission’s proposal is of major significance to children, parents and industry alike."
"That is why I find it so regrettable that today, Mrs Roth-Behrendt is unable to be present, for she went all-out for this legislation, and I would like to take this opportunity to wish her a speedy recovery."
"I have to say that our group was very divided on this proposal."
"Of course, everyone is agreed that medicinal products for paediatric use must be developed and that their manufacturers must be given reasonable compensation for research they carry out into them."
"This compensation could even be substantial, but for many of our group, the extension of the patent by another six months went a little too far."
"Enquiries I made at a renowned enterprise revealed that, in most cases, research into the use of medicinal products for paediatric use costs no less than EUR 8 million."
"When patents are extended by six months, profits increase into a multiple of this sum, namely to some EUR 200 to 300 million, which are hefty profits."
"Blockbusters command even higher amounts."
"It is, of course, also possible that the profits are a little lower in the case of medicinal products for rare diseases."
"That is why we have argued in favour of proportionality."
"We think that the reward should be in proportion to the costs incurred."
"That is a very simple and normal principle."
"The bill for medicinal products need not become unnecessarily steep and that is why – and that is also my final comment – we are looking forward with eager anticipation to the assessment and review of this directive, which will then make evident what the six months’ of patent extension have yielded, what the economic costs are and whether it causes detriment to the industry’s innovative strength."
"- Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, especially on her negotiation skills and on the constructive result that we have today."
"This regulation on the security of children’s medical products is a great success for patients in Europe."
"It is long overdue, and now it is important that it enter into force quickly."
"This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this helpful compromise, which makes an agreement with the Council at second reading possible."
"We have had lengthy and extensive debates in this House on the renewal of patents for research-conducting producers of medicines, and sometimes there was haggling over each individual month of renewal."
"Many colleagues have been quite upset about the possibility of additional profits for the pharmaceutical industry. This unspeakable debate is now finally over."
"This is, after all, about the security of medical products for children, which must be guaranteed."
"If the research-conducting producers of medicines require an additional incentive in order to develop their products, then they should get it."
"Finally, economic logic requires it too."
"If this incentive has the additional effect of strengthening European research and attracting research-conducting pharmaceutical businesses back to Europe, then this is positive."
"Madam President, the aim of the Parliament and Council regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use is to improve children’s health in Europe by developing specific medicinal products designed to help children combat disease."
"I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête for the excellent work she has done on this regulation."
"It is apparent that she has put in a great deal of effort, commitment and skill."
"Health, and particularly children’s health, is a priority in itself."
"When raising a sensitive issue such as medication for children, however, we should ask ourselves an honest question, namely whether it is possible to claim beyond doubt that prescribing adult medication to children is more ethical than involving children in controlled studies that are subject to stringent legislative provisions."
"This is a question we should all ask ourselves, and which should form the basis for further discussion."
"Unfortunately, we do not have much time for this at the moment."
"With regards to the regulation, however, I am definitely opposed to reducing the period during which a company can apply to extend sole marketing authorisation for the basic product from two years to six months."
"This proposal was voted on at first reading, when only 1% of votes cast in Parliament were in favour of it."
"The amendment was supported neither by the Council, nor by the Commission."
"I would like to express my regret that due to lack of support during the vote in May, no amendments were adopted to prevent abuse of the system of remuneration and incentives that are permissible under the provisions of the regulation under discussion."
"I am keen that companies should not accumulate preferential instruments and remuneration for conducting the same studies for the same product, which would lead to abuse on too many occasions."
"On the other hand, I do believe that it is important that producers of medicinal products be reimbursed for the costs incurred when carrying out trials of the use of medicines in children."
"Such compensation could take the form of patenting new means of administering medication or forms of a medicinal substance and of giving sole marketing rights for medicinal products for children."
"It is important here to stress that medicinal products used in adults should only be subject to investigation for their use in children where this is reasonable and necessary."
"Finally, I would like to express my full support for the establishment of a Paediatrics Research Committee made up of members with specialist knowledge and competence, and who are independent experts in their fields."
"I believe this to be a very positive solution."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the organisation of healthcare in the Member States is based upon solidarity through hospital networks, social security systems and mutual insurance schemes."
"The pharmaceutical industry, however, selects its patients on the basis of their resources – I am thinking of the diseases of poor countries – or on the basis of the numbers of patients involved."
"That is why we now have to legislate on the question of medicinal products for paediatric use."
"We welcome the fact that this report will be adopted tomorrow, as we all want children to have medication appropriate to their age and medical condition without delay."
"Having said that, I regret – and Mrs Grossetête has also pointed this out – that the two-year period for marketing a medicinal product has been maintained, and, moreover, I regret that the amendment intended to cut that period has not been supported."
"I also regret the long delay in obtaining an inventory of needs for paediatric treatments."
"These delays belie the declarations of urgency made here in Parliament."
"Finally, in relation to the provisions on risk management and pharmacovigilance, we must be careful to ensure they are properly implemented and, if necessary, be ready to amend our text."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"I am pleased with this proposal, because I am convinced that it will result in more medicinal products developed and tested specifically for children being launched onto the market."
"This is, above all, of great importance for young patients suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer or disorders of the immune system."
"We should, however, not lose sight of the ethical side of the matter, and must prevent children from being used as guinea pigs."
"That is why it is good that double testing is being cut out by the possibility of research already being done in third countries being valid."
"Since estimates show that 50 to 90% of the medicinal products that are currently being used in paediatrics are never specifically studied or approved for use in that age category, the negative and positive effects of their application are virtually unknown."
"It is therefore a good thing that European legislation should promote research into medicinal products that have been developed specifically for children and that we can thus put an end to this uncertainty."
"It is good that we have recognised the need to test children’s medicine specifically for children."
"Once this principle is established we must go further to refine testing."
"Childhood is not static."
"The biology of a baby is quite different from the biology of a teenager."
"We must also insist on periodic scientific reviews."
"The long-term effects on children must be studied not just to look at accumulative effect, as we do with adult medicines, but to look at the particular effect the medicine has at different stages of a child’s development and on the health of the young adult they become."
"Ritalin is the most widely prescribed drug for children in the US."
"Only now, after almost 20 years of use, have we realised the permanent damage Ritalin has done to the development of the cardiovascular system of the young adult the child user becomes."
"Thousands, even millions of adults will face adulthood with cardiovascular disease from a paediatric medicine tested for its effect on behaviour, not hearts."
"Scientific testing must be specific, in this case for children, and must be updated."
"Otherwise, we find out the bad news when it is too late."
"Considering the risks of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction, the Commission shall appoint the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products to formulate an opinion on the use of these categories of substance as auxiliary agents in medicinal products for human use; the legal basis for this is Article 5(3) and Article 57(1)(p) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency."
"The Commission shall forward the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use to the European Parliament and to the Council."
"Within six months of the delivery of the opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council about the measures that it plans to put in place following this opinion."
"The next item is the report (A6-0180/2006) by Mr Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) [COM(2005)0121 C6-0098/2005 2005/0050(COD)]."
"."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the European Parliament most sincerely for the strong support enjoyed by the Commission throughout this programme."
"Parliament’s extremely active participation and its amendments have made an essential contribution to the constructive development of the Commission’s proposal."
"The most recent economic growth and employment forecasts in Europe are altogether encouraging."
"Nevertheless, we should not lose sight of fundamental problems and weaknesses."
"In the newly formulated strategy for growth and employment of February 2005, the Commission clearly identifies the challenge."
"The Commission’s proposal, made in April of last year, for a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme should signal our willingness to follow up the analysis with the necessary effective steps to more growth and employment."
"We want to use this programme to establish a link between the means and the political ends."
"Innovation plays a key role here."
"By innovation, I should point out, we mean more than simply the commercialisation of research findings."
"Naturally we must ensure that research also produces marketable results, but innovation goes beyond that."
"Our goal must be to make better economic use of knowledge and the potential of the knowledge-based society as a whole."
"This means innovation in areas such as design, marketing and logistics as well as in business structures."
"The broad-based support for the CIP demonstrates our common awareness of what must be done to strengthen Europe’s competitiveness."
"The fact that today we are about to adopt the programme at first reading serves to highlight this all the more clearly."
"Furthermore, this is the first major Community programme to be adopted for the period of the new Financial Perspective."
"A clear signal of European Parliament support and a beacon for the Agenda and for growth and employment."
"The speed with which an agreement has been reached is due, above all, to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, his shadow rapporteur, Mrs Thomson, Mr Vakalis and Mr Turmes, who have accomplished much through truly positive and flexible cooperation with the presidency."
"The Commission has followed this process closely, and I should like to express my full support, on behalf of the Commission, of the supplemented proposal."
"We have come to the end of a road we have travelled together, and I believe it has been a successful journey."
"."
"Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, this is indeed a historic moment, since it would appear that this is the European Union’s first Framework Programme to be adopted at first reading."
"I should like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission for the excellent proposal without which, after all, this would not have been possible."
"I am, however, also grateful for the open nature of the negotiations, which involved four directorates-general."
"Special thanks go to the Austrian Presidency of the Council, which has truly embraced the cause of innovation and the aim of its adoption within the term of its incumbency."
"I should like to make particular mention of Josef Mandl and Matthias Martinek, who managed to dispel the reservations of several Member States."
"But my thanks, of course, also go to my fellow Members here in Parliament."
"I appreciated the trust and cooperation of Mr Vakalis, Mrs Thompson and Mr Turmes as well as the draftsmen of the opinions, especially Mr Langen."
"I should like to express my particular thanks to my fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets."
"Without their real commitment to obtaining the additional four billion, to upholding the blockade against the Council Decision, this programme could not have come into being in its current form, since a large part of the additional budget we in Parliament obtained has gone into innovation, into this CIP."
"My heartfelt thanks, especially to Mr Böge."
"So what has changed?"
"Where has the European Parliament been able to leave its mark?"
"Our very first priority was to place this programme at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"These are the main parties involved; they must be the ones to drive innovation in Europe, and we placed them in the foreground by removing many sometimes obviously bureaucratic obstructions, for instance through a new Vademecum."
"The Commission will publish a CIP handbook to enable applicants quickly and easily to gain information about the CIP and find the right way to obtain support."
"And then we introduced a new principle."
"For this, I am extremely grateful to all concerned."
"This is the principle of ‘no wrong entry’. There is no wrong door within the Commission for an SME."
"Anyone with a question will not be turned away but will be directed to the right place."
"This is a new principle and an important contribution to the simplification of procedure, an important step in cutting red tape, and I am confident that the Commission will ensure that detailed inquiries will always find the relevant, competent consultant."
"This programme has also allowed us to make a quantum leap for innovation, in that we have attempted to close the gap in the so-called ‘precede phase’, the period before a product or idea comes onto the market, by affiliating the programme with the seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"In our committees we are currently engaged in negotiations on the seventh Framework Programme for Research, and I have been in close collaboration with Mr Buzek, the rapporteur, who is also here today and will say a few words shortly, despite not actually being on the CIP speaking list."
"I am very glad that our cooperation went so well and that we were able to link the programmes so effectively."
"It must be said that this programme covers all the essential elements of the Lisbon Agenda, which I should prefer to call the Liverpool Agenda, because Liverpool FC were three-nil down at half-time in the Champions League final and still pulled through to win in the end."
"This is, after all, the very situation in which we now find ourselves."
"Nonetheless, the major issues, innovation, competitiveness and energy, are all covered by this programme."
"When we speak about innovation, we must be sure to define the word properly."
"Innovation is a name given to anything nowadays."
"All sorts of things are labelled ‘innovation’."
"But what is innovation?"
"Innovation is not invention."
"Invention has to do with research; invention is the process of putting money into knowledge, of investing in knowledge."
"But innovation is the opposite process – making money out of knowledge!"
"And it is precisely here that we Europeans have a major deficit; it is here that we need to make up for lost time."
"We have wonderful ideas."
"We just manage less and less often to convert these ideas into real products."
"The magnetic-levitation train that you all know, the Transrapid, was invented as early as 1934, and we still have not managed to realise it in Europe."
"The computer, invented by Konrad Zuse, is hardly produced in the European Union any more."
"Nuclear fission – perhaps not everyone’s favourite subject – came from the European Union."
"The Internet was basically invented in the European Union."
"It blossomed, or its use blossomed, elsewhere."
"Or that hot topic, MP3, a German invention, although 90% of sales are now made outwith the EU."
"This Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme creates scope not only for inventions but for their concrete application in Europe as well."
"This is the only way we can achieve the Lisbon objectives; it is the only way we can make progress."
"My sincere thanks once again to all concerned."
".Madam President, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for searching so cooperatively for solutions, especially considering the general need to reduce the size of the budget."
"This is an outstanding example of cooperation."
"And my particular thanks also go to the Commission, to Commissioner Verheugen, whose work on this programme has proved his dedication to promoting innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on which I am to report here for one minute, was adopted on 1 December 2005, before the framework resourcing plan."
"It follows that our wishes far outweighed the eventual achievements."
"We fell into line; we endorse the motions for less bureaucracy in the programmes, for more sharply focused support and for innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This has been recorded in the Chatzimarkakis report, and these motions will be vigorously supported by my colleagues on the Committee."
". – Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, my conviction led me to place the emphasis of my contribution on the 20 million or so small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that make up 98% of European businesses and that account for 70 million jobs. Many of these SMEs are the driving force behind innovation."
"SMEs also represent an invaluable asset that should not be neglected, as they offer a resource that is scarce and that Europe’s economy most needs, namely entrepreneurship, which is often practised in distinctly unfavourable conditions."
"I have put the case for simplifying the procedures."
"This is a crucial point given that in Europe there are 18 million businesses employing fewer than 10 people. These businesses have a great deal of difficulty in accessing information of this nature."
"With Parliament’s proposal aimed at creating a user’s manual, which will hopefully be adopted tomorrow, SMEs will have a clearer, simpler and more transparent framework on the rules of this programme."
"The members of the committee therefore voted in favour of this proposal."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) is to contribute to the EU’s capacity for innovation and its competitiveness, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, entirely in accordance with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy in terms of growth and jobs."
"I am pleased that the programme contains a broad definition of innovation, so that this definition also includes non-technological innovation."
"This ensures that the CIP also applies to enterprises in, for example, the adventure industry."
"Adding value occurs at all stages of the value chain, which means that innovation in distribution, marketing or management is just as important as innovation in production."
"In connection with the current debate about which direction Europe should take in its energy policy, it is a positive thing that we have been able to retain the environmental focus that has been a central element of the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme."
"One reason for this is that energy efficiency and renewable forms of energy are amongst the areas in which more innovation can make the biggest contribution to the competitiveness of the EU."
"A substantial challenge in relation to the CIP is to achieve the necessary synergy effects in relation to other programmes."
"I believe that it is essential to ensure sound coordination between the CIP, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, the programme for Life-Long Learning and, especially, the Structural Funds."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise the fact that I believe equality to be an important dimension within the CIP."
"If we are to increase the number of entrepreneurs in Europe then we must get more women to take on the challenge."
"We therefore have to remove the barriers that women face."
"I hope that the Commission will focus on the gender-specific dimension in relation to entrepreneurship, and it pleases me a great deal that the programme will provide the opportunity for microfinance, since precisely this form of financing is of particular advantage to women."
"– Madam President, the reply to the question as to whether or not I am satisfied with the final text which we shall vote on tomorrow is, yes I am."
"I am satisfied because, compared with the past, we have given priority to fast, simple procedures."
"We have placed small- and medium-sized enterprises at the centre of the programme."
"We have linked, in the best possible way, appropriations with the Structural Funds."
"We have linked, in the best possible way, research with innovation."
"We have included and we have emphasised the cross-border dimension of innovation and entrepreneurship."
"We have stressed the need for high quality services from small- and medium-sized business information and support centres."
"We have clarified and elucidated what the innovative actions are."
"We have focused on industrial and intellectual property rights."
"We have emphasised and promoted the importance of non-technological innovation, alongside technological innovation."
"I am satisfied because we have included an advisory body in the overall programme planning and implementation procedure."
"Its role, without getting involved in comitology, is twofold and very important."
"Firstly, because I hope that it will safeguard cohesion between sub-programmes, so that the CIP manages to operate in practice as one programme rather than three and, secondly, because it will safeguard the participation of innovation specialists and the sectors promoted by the programme."
"The answer to the question of whether or not I am satisfied with the development of competitiveness and innovation in Europe is no, compared with our international competitors."
"I am not satisfied, because it is important for us to improve, although that is not enough, because we need additional means, measures and actions at all levels, because we are not, for example, applying a bold public procurement policy to innovative small- and medium-sized businesses, because – unlike the USA – few of our businesses look on innovation as a worthwhile investment, because – generally speaking – we are lacking a culture of innovation and a culture of entrepreneurship."
"To conclude: the CIP is a good idea, a very good idea."
"However, innovation does not stop there."
"To close, I thank the Austrian Presidency and the Commission for their excellent cooperation, as a result of which the programme was approved on time."
"It could not have been more on time."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my colleague Mr Chatzimarkakis; tomorrow we will be voting in favour of competitiveness and innovation, and once again we will move a little closer towards the Lisbon Objective."
"We in our group support this proposal."
"It is short-sighted, however, that, just as we ought to be rapidly increasing levels of innovation, this budget is being cut."
"In many crucial areas our competitiveness is waning."
"A doctor’s assessment of the patient would be ‘weak, but not yet hopeless’."
"Investing in socially sustainable competitiveness will give us a chance to create a Europe where innovations flourish in a sustainable way."
"A European Institute of Technology could help us turn innovation into products."
"We nevertheless have to ensure that the founding of the EIT does not happen at the expense of the European Scientific Council."
"The Framework Programme stresses the need to support the work of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is there that a huge army of challengers – and employers – must be found."
"Mr President, my thanks to Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"The European Union is strong on scientific research, but not as strong on innovation."
"As rapporteur for the Seventh Framework Programme, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen on his new idea, namely the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme."
"I fully support this programme, as well as Mr Chatzimarkakis’ report."
"The programme guarantees the provision of industry funding for innovation, and will boost small and medium-sized enterprises in particular."
"The European Union cannot be successful in the technology race without such a programme to fill the gap between research and innovation, and this is both the basis of the Lisbon Strategy and the path to building a common European area for research and innovation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"It is of paramount importance for the Union to recognise the role played by SMEs in our economy."
"In this respect, I am glad to notice that SMEs are at the very heart of the strategy of the new Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme."
"As a matter of fact, if our aim is to bring further productivity, innovation capacity and sustainable growth for the Union, the emphasis should be put on the role of SMEs."
"In this respect, while reforming the programmes and the instruments for the next programming period, we should bring forward without distorting the markets the horizontal objectives of the Union such as gender equality, environmental protection, protection of the disabled, the sharing of best practice, the promotion of lasting quality employment and economic growth."
"In the end, it will be the citizens of the Union themselves within the framework of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy that will be the real beneficiaries of the EU-wide promotion of competitiveness and innovation."
"– The next item is the report by Mr Langen on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the enlargement of the euro zone [2006/2103(INI)] (A6-0191/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, we have before us the report on the enlargement of the euro zone."
"It is based on the Commission’s second report, which appraises the state of practical preparations and entry status of individual Member States."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to Commissioner Almunia for the clarity of his report and of his stance, and I make a point of saying this because a year ago, during the review of the Stability and Growth Pact, I was rather inclined to think of the Commission as too compliant."
"You have adopted a very clear position, and for that you have my wholehearted thanks."
"Following the debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and those conducted within political groups, as well as the agreements made amongst the groups, I am convinced that the Commission’s stance will be largely supported."
"The euro has been successful across the board, since it has ensured monetary stability both within the euro zone, with low rates of inflation, and in relation to outside currencies."
"This is only possible if we observe not only the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty but also the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Given that the two largest states of the euro zone, France and Germany, have remained in contravention of the stability pact for years on end without finding the necessary inner strength to enact essential reforms, it is imperative that we, in this current phase involving the entry of Member States with a derogation, fulfil the conditions of the Maastricht Treaty to the letter."
"We have twelve euro zone members and eleven states with a derogation;"
"Britain and Denmark have a special ‘opt-out’ status."
"That is something else again, and they can always reconsider what they want to do. All the others are compelled to accept the supervision of their budgetary and financial policies and the appraisal of their level of convergence."
"The Commission has done these things carefully and rigorously, and for this, too, I offer my most sincere thanks."
"The difference, which was not evident to all here in Parliament – even in discussions within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – is that, under the Regulations of 1997, both members of the euro zone and states with a derogation are subject to supervision of their budgetary and financial policies and to coordination of their economic policies."
"Within the euro zone this is achieved through stability programmes, while states with a derogation have convergence programmes."
"This is why, after lengthy debates, we have adopted a report which is strongly guided by the Maastricht Treaty in terms of entry criteria, which are as follows: price stability; a candidate for entry must have a rate of inflation no more than 1.5% higher than that of the three best EU Member States."
"As regards public finances, the level of debt must not exceed 60% of GDP, with a 3% ceiling for new debts."
"I sometimes get the impression that the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact are being misinterpreted."
"And then we have the adherence to ERM II for two years, interest-rate convergence, legislative compatibility, an independent central bank and economic convergence."
"I am convinced that premature introduction of the euro is detrimental to the Member States, since real convergence and financial, economic and monetary stability are essential when determining the ultimate exchange rate so that an accession candidate, having entered and no longer being able to devalue or revalue, does not default."
"We deliberated and agreed that countries would not be named, but that we wanted, on the other hand, to enter into discussions with the Commission and the European Central Bank on the setting of the rate of inflation, another area in which differences exist."
"The European Central Bank has defined a value close to 2% as price stability for the evaluation of its monetary policy, and we are keen to become fully involved in this dialogue."
"We decided, moreover, that we do not wish any one of the candidate countries to be given special rebates, but that we place great value on equal and proper treatment for all, be they new or old Members."
"We also do not wish the experience of the first accession phase, involving the entry of Greece on the basis of incomplete data and Italy before completion of two years’ compliance with the ERM fluctuation margins, to be taken as a precedent for the enlargement of the euro zone; we wish instead to encourage the Commission to be impartial and true to the Maastricht Treaty in the assessments it delivers."
"You will appreciate, Commissioner, that our wish is for greater transparency."
"I am grateful for the constructive cooperation of my fellow Members."
"In the end, I feel that the report we have developed and refined is a good one which will have the support of the vast majority of my colleagues here and which in turn emphatically endorses the Commissioner’s stance."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent report and all of the Members of Parliament, those in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular, for taking part in this discussion, which is of very great importance."
"It is important to look after all of the countries which do not yet belong to the eurozone but which wish to and which are obliged to join, because all of the Member States, except those with an opt-out clause the United Kingdom and Denmark have the right to belong to the eurozone, but also the obligation to join it and to prepare themselves for doing so."
"To this end, the aspects dealt with in the report that led to yours, on the preparations of the Member States that will join the eurozone over the coming years, are very important."
"I must tell you that, over the coming weeks, we are going to approve a new report, because from now on those reports will be published by the Commission every six months, rather than every year."
"They are preparations of a technical nature, which are very important in terms of keeping public opinion informed and trying to prevent the kind of abuse in the exchange between the national currency and the single currency that has happened in the past in certain cases."
"We are learning from past experiences in order to cooperate with the candidates to join the euro, in order to prevent that abuse and in order to convince the citizens that moving from their national currency to the euro has no direct relationship with price rises, which can easily be avoided."
"Of course, the candidates for joining the eurozone must prepare themselves for fulfilling the criteria laid down in the Treaty, since the Treaty of Maastricht."
"The debate has focussed more on this last aspect, because, as you know, a few weeks ago the Commission and the European Central Bank adopted convergence reports in response to the requests of Slovenia and Lithuania."
"In those reports, the Commission – and the European Central Bank – gave their interpretation of the application of the criteria laid down in the Treaty."
"I would insist that they are laid down in the Treaty, they are not defined by the European Commission artificially or on a whim."
"The criteria in the Treaty cannot be changed."
"Our obligation, therefore – and we have done this on other occasions and we will do so in the future – is to apply the Treaty and to apply it rigorously, since that is the only way to guarantee equal treatment for each and every Member State seeking to join the eurozone."
"The most obvious discussion relates to the inflation criterion."
"Mr Langen talked about the criterion of the European Central Bank for maintaining price stability."
"I must tell you that it is not the same: the European Central Bank’s objective of maintaining price stability in the eurozone below 2% inflation, but close to it, is one thing, but the Treaty’s inflation criterion, which states that candidates for joining the eurozone must have an average inflation rate over the last twelve months below the reference value, which is the inflation of the three best performing countries in terms of inflation, plus 1.5%, is quite another."
"This is laid down clearly in the Treaty."
"The Commission cannot alter the criteria in the Treaty; we have the duty to see them applied and that is what we have done."
"Since I have noted from certain comments in the report or in the amendments that the Commission is being asked for transparency in the way the Treaty is interpreted and applied, I am at Parliament’s service, not just to explain the convergence reports on Slovenia and Lithuania in detail, but also, if you wish, to provide the additional documentation on which the convergence report adopted by the Commission on 16 May is based."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always endorsed and promoted the enlargement of the European Union and has always said that this enlargement, including accession to the euro zone, must move forward without further delay."
"That has always been our policy, and it still is our policy."
"In addition, it has been the policy of the Group of the European People’s Party throughout recent years to fight for a strong euro in line with the Maastricht criteria and accompanied by strict adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"For this reason there have been extensive discussions with the Commission in recent years whenever the large countries were involved – France, Italy and Germany."
"We will therefore continue this policy in pursuit of a stable euro and so would like to assure the Commission of our unequivocal support for the clear stance it has taken on the question of our future approach to enlargement of the euro zone."
"Let me say once again that we are very clearly in favour of new Member States entering the euro zone; this must, however, take place in accordance with particular criteria; we have a certain amount of tradition and rigour to uphold in this respect."
"So, once again, our heartfelt thanks to the Commission."
"At the same time, however, I would like to encourage the Commission to be more assertive the Member States when it comes to data."
"It has the support of Parliament."
"I also encourage the Member States to grant the Commission more rights in relation to the verification of data pertaining to potential entry."
"I say this because Parliament will ask the Commission whether it can vouch for the data on which it bases its recommendation."
"It must therefore be given greater access to information, and this requires the Member States to be more cooperative."
"."
"Mr President, the Treaty on European Union states that the accession of new Member States to the euro zone is their right and obligation, as Commissioner Almunia just said."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully supports this notion."
"The conditions for joining the euro zone are enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty in the form of so-called ‘nominal convergence criteria’."
"These criteria must be fulfilled in order to join the common currency area, and fulfilment of them is sufficient in order to do so. However, there have been attempts to impose additional conditions on the new Member States, such as ‘real convergence’, or the ‘euro zone absorption capacity’, which has not been defined in detail."
"These criteria do not exist in the Maastricht Treaty, and so they cannot be applied."
"There must be no double standards when it comes to new and old Member States."
"If we fully agree that the provisions of the Treaty must be respected, we should abide by the rule that we are bound by the Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty."
"I would also like to point out that the convergence criteria give rise to a whole series of reasonable doubts as regards economic factors and interpretation."
"These problems became glaringly obvious in the recent convergence reports on Lithuania and Slovenia."
"The definition of price stability that the European Commission and the European Central Bank used in their reports assessing fulfilment of the inflation criteria was contrary to the definition of price stability that the ECB applies in its monetary policy."
"Other aspects of the assessment are also dubious."
"This is not a minor matter, because on the basis of the assessment Lithuania was not given a positive recommendation by the Commission for joining the euro zone."
"This situation gives cause for concern, because the European Commission’s decisions must be reliable and should not give rise to doubts concerning partisanship or lack of objectivity."
"The rules used when assessing individual Member States must be clear, and the decision-making process must be totally transparent."
"Mr President, the convergence criteria formulated 15 years ago, when the Member States still had national currencies and separate monetary policies, should be adapted to the current situation, in which the new Member States are joining an existing common currency area."
"This requires appropriate amendments to the relevant provisions of Article 121 of the Treaty and the Protocol to the Treaty."
"I ask for a debate to be opened on this matter."
"."
"I am very sorry that discussion of the problems regarding the expansion of Euro zone was given very little attention."
"Now those problems will have to be solved during the actual process of expansion, and the Commission is not ready for this."
"But we do not think we should blame one another."
"From our experience of reforms, we know that satisfactory results can also be achieved in such a way; we simply have to react quickly to the changing situation."
"Therefore, I would like European institutions to react quickly to the changing situation."
"It is obvious, that preparation for the introduction of the Euro involves substantial expenditure; therefore, the assessment of candidate countries must be carried out not half a year before introducing the Euro, but much earlier, perhaps in a few stages."
"I also agree with the opinion that we must review the calculation methodology of the Maastricht inflation criteria."
"After all, we reviewed the Stability and Growth Pact methodology without any difficulties."
"I trust that this was not because a large country requested it."
"The voice of small countries must also be heard."
"As for my third point, all the Commission's assessments must be submitted to Parliament because decisions in the European Union must not be taken without democratic control."
"The European Union is based on democratic rules."
"."
"Mr President, it is impossible to disagree with many conclusions expressed in the report."
"What objections could be made to an obligation to rigorously observe the Treaty’s conditions?"
"This is just as it should be, and personally I am in favour of this position."
"If this approach had been consistently adopted, however, then the history of the euro zone’s creation would have been significantly different, and it is even possible that the number of states that are currently members of the euro zone would differ."
"A third of the current members of the euro zone joined it whilst in breach of one or other of the criteria."
"In reality, the admission criteria were only used as reference points, and political decisions were the real deciding force."
"This is not surprising, since in many cases the economic foundation of the criteria is very questionable."
"Thus, for example, the permissible inflation level was also set by reference to countries that are not in the euro zone and, most paradoxical of all, the best inflation indicators differ from the European Central Bank’s vision concerning the best level of price stability in the euro zone."
"The demand for countries to achieve exchange rate stability together with the inflation indicators makes this criterion even more contradictory."
"The European Central Bank does not even claim to bring this about in the euro zone."
"Concerns expressed in the report concerning potential problems with the applicant countries following accession to the euro zone cannot be attributed to the small, flexible economies of, for example, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which are also open economies and have since the beginning of the 1990s had experience of exchange rates fixed over the long term."
"If Lithuania, with its trifling divergence from the inflation criterion, is not accepted into the euro zone, then that is obviously a political decision."
"I would support the report if it were truly focused on the improvement of the admission criteria in the future."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case."
"Rather, what we can detect in the report is the theme of the notorious Polish plumber."
"– Although I am not from Lithuania, in the context of the matter under discussion, I would like to comment on the matter of Lithuania’s joining the euro zone."
"For a number of years now the country has achieved good economic results which would be a cause for jubilation in the vast majority of euro zone countries."
"Lithuania has achieved robust long-term economic growth approaching 10% of the GDP."
"For a long time, and with a great deal to spare, it has also met the Maastricht criteria for the public spending deficit, for public sector debt and long-term interest rates, unlike most of the euro zone countries."
"In only one criterion did the country exceed the 2.6% reference level by one tenth of a percent in the last evaluation period, although it had met the target for several years before that."
"My friends, joining the euro zone should not be like an athletics event, where a one-tenth measure decides on whether you qualify or not."
"The postponement of Lithuania’s entry is an insensitive decision."
"It will be a cold shower for future candidates."
"Although this item on the agenda does not involve the discharge of a legislative role, the rapporteur’s task has not been an easy one."
"I should, therefore, like to congratulate Mr Langen on a job well done and on gaining such convincing support in the committee."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the report clearly defines the relationship with the citizens of the European Union, that is, with the consumers, which is necessary if there is to be a successful transition to the single currency in the accession countries."
"We are all aware of the importance of the Euro project for European integration and how important it is that all parties in the process of Eurozone enlargement retain their credibility."
"This also means that we have to follow the criteria which have been set in a consistent manner, and that we must not the change the rules of the game halfway through."
"I am happy that in the eyes of the European Commission and the European Central Bank Slovenia has passed a challenging test, namely that it has met all the requirements for entry to the Eurozone."
"Of course, I would be happier still if the requirements for the expansion of the Eurozone had been met by more new Member States."
"I say this in the belief that the further enlargement of the Eurozone is important for the political development of the European Union and also if it is to play a more powerful role in a globalised world."
"Mr President, in congratulating Slovenia, I would like to remind you that Lithuania has met all of the Maastricht criteria for five consecutive years, except for a one-month period during which inflation exceeded the criteria by a small margin."
"However, it was exactly at that time that the Commission rushed to make a negative recommendation."
"The day after the Commission’s conclusion, it emerged from the latest data that Lithuania did in fact meet the Maastricht criteria."
"Yesterday, the President of the Ecofin group, Mr Juncker, said that Lithuania was warned not to apply for the euro because of its probable rejection. Unfortunately, this demonstrates the Commission’s preconceptions based on suspicion and prognosis."
"It seems that Vilnius was punished for not following Brussels’ advice and, ironically, because it met the criteria for five exemplary years."
"Of all the eurozone countries, only Finland can be proud about meeting the same targets."
"The situation could be restored."
"I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment in which the Commission is ‘to review its evaluation of Lithuania’."
"I also invite the initiation of a broader discussion on the legitimacy and application of the present convergence criteria in the enlarged EU."
"– The report on the expansion of the Euro zone being debated is uncommonly unprofessional and meaningless."
"It lists known truths."
"In Point 1, requirements like the independent Central Bank and the conformity of the legislative system with the Maastricht Agreement are mistakenly included among the Maastricht criteria."
"The goal named in Points 4 and 5 – the stability of the Euro zone – needs clarification about what stability is, when not one of the 12 Euro zone members managed to meet all criteria at the time of accession and continue to infringe them to this day, especially the inflation and non-excessive budget deficit indicators, and what damage can expansion do?"
"Discrimination against Euro zone candidate countries is obvious when double standards are applied."
"An indicator stability requirement, not made previously, must now be fulfilled prior to expansion, irrespective of the fact that today's economic and political situation is different from that which existed 15 years ago when the Euro zone was created."
"I urge the Commission and the Council to take the EU's economic and political realities into account, to improve the Maastricht criteria and implement them in all Member States and continue the expansion of the Euro zone."
"Mr President, in taking the floor in this debate I would like to draw attention to the following issues."
"Firstly, the report quite clearly states that new Member States must meet all the Maastricht criteria before they can join the euro zone."
"At the same time it passes over the fact that when the euro was introduced, many old Member States did not meet these criteria."
"Once again the political signal being sent out is that some are more equal than others in the EU."
"Secondly, since the introduction of the euro in 2002, at least five countries, including the largest – Germany, France and Italy – have not complied with the most important criteria, and have been unable to keep their budget deficits and public debt under control."
"In some of these countries, public debt greatly exceeds 60% of GDP, which means they will have to restrict it for many years to come."
"Despite this the continued membership of these countries in the monetary and currency union not only continues unquestioned, but nobody is making any particular effort to force these countries to change the current state of affairs."
"The recent amendments to the Stability and Growth Pact which benefited Germany and France are glaring examples of this."
"Thirdly, and in view of this situation, the rejection of Lithuania’s application to join the euro zone as of 1 January 2007, merely because it exceeded the inflation indicator by 0.1%, may at the very least cause confusion and bodes no good for the debate on enlargement of the euro zone to include all the new Member States, or on the accession to this zone of the United Kingdom, Denmark or Sweden."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all of the Members who have spoken during the debate."
"I would like to thank them for their contributions, regardless of whether they agree with the Commission’s views on the issues that we are discussing today."
"I would like to say four things: firstly, that the Commission is, of course, in favour of enlarging the eurozone."
"There is no other option: the Member States have that right and obligation, and we respect that right and demand compliance with that obligation."
"We do so regardless of whether those who are to join the eurozone over the coming years are new or old Member States – a distinction which we believe belongs in the past – or whether they be large or small, rich or not so rich."
"We are not going to come up with any new conditions, Mr Rosati: we are applying the Treaty, the whole Treaty, and nothing but the Treaty."
"That is the only way to ensure that everybody is treated equally, and I do not imagine – and I am sure that none of you wishes to do so – that anybody in this House would ask the Commission not to fulfil its duty as guardian of the Treaty and not to apply the Treaty equally to each and every Member State."
"Can the Treaty be modified?"
"Of course."
"This afternoon I have had the opportunity to attend the debate at which Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke about the future Constitution, the necessary changes and the future of Europe."
"Of course the Treaty can be changed, and it will be changed eventually."
"But for now we have to apply the existing Treaty, and you know, just as I do, that it is not for the Commission to change the Treaty."
"What does the Treaty say about the inflation criterion, which has been discussed in the debate?"
"It says that the reference value consists of the average inflation of the three best performing Member States in terms of inflation."
"It does not say ‘members of the eurozone’."
"It clearly says ‘Member States’: all of them, including those with an opt-out clause; we cannot exclude any Member State from the calculation of the three best performing Member States in terms of inflation."
"And we must add 1.5% to that average of the three: that is the reference value."
"Something quite different is the figure defined by the European Central Bank, independently, as an objective within the context of its mandate, which is to ensure price stability."
"It is not the same, and there is no reason why it should be, and in this debate we must not confuse the European Central Bank’s inflation objective with the reference value of the Treaty's inflation criterion."
"They are completely different things."
"The Treaty's inflation criterion says something else though: it also says that the inflation of the Member State in question must be sustainable."
"Some of you talk about a small difference, and it is true."
"In the inflation criterion, however, in addition to the difference, in addition to the comparison between the inflation of the Member State and the reference value, the Treaty states that we must analyse whether or not the inflation of the Member State in question is sustainable."
"We cannot ignore the Treaty, and we are not going to."
"We are going to explain it over and over again, because rigorously analysing the criteria is not in the interest of the Sates currently in the eurozone, but of the Member State that is a candidate to join the eurozone; because, if we do not do so, that State will have to suffer the consequences once the decision to join the euro is irreversible."
"References to the past are not of any use to me, therefore."
"If things were not done perfectly in the past, then somebody is paying for the consequences today."
"Let us learn from experience, since that is what rational and reasonable politicians should do."
"We apply the Treaty, but we apply all aspects of it, not just the bits that are in our interest, and when applying it, we learn from our experience, within the margin for interpretation permitted by the Treaty."
"With regard to Lithuania, I am not going to deny the obvious, of course: its economic results are magnificent."
"The efforts it has made to improve its economic situation are extraordinary."
"We all want Lithuania to fulfil all of the Treaty’s criteria as soon as possible."
"Today it has been able to fulfil all of them but one; let us hope that it overcomes that difference very soon."
"As soon as it does so, I will be looking forward to receiving a request from Lithuania which is its right pursuant to the Treaty so that I can issue a favourable opinion on behalf of the Commission."
"But please do not ask the Commission to say anything in the convergence reports that goes against a rational, clear and transparent application of the Treaty."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"– When the press announces that Otmar Issing is leaving the European Central Bank (ECB), but that the monetarist legacy will live on, it is merely confirming our view that monetarist guidelines continue to prevail and to guide the EU’s economic and social policy, regardless of who is in charge of the ECB."
"As we know, and the Langen report confirms this, joining the euro requires ‘total compliance with the Maastricht criteria’, which implies meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, and observing the guidelines of the European Central Bank, the European monetary authority whose decisions have an impact throughout economic life."
"The report expressly states that ‘Euro changeover should not be tackled and projected as simply a technical change in currency but as a major conversion with significant economic, monetary and social effects’."
"It highlights Parliament’s maximalist approach, which is that the budgetary cycle at national level needs to be synchronised and based on the same prerogatives, namely the loss of monetary, and in turn fiscal, sovereignty."
"Unfortunately, in Portugal we are very familiar with this situation and its effects, as confirmed by the recent spring 2006-2007 economic forecasts."
"The loss of monetary sovereignty has ramifications for the real convergence of economies, serving the economic groups, directly or indirectly."
"Hence our opposition to this report."
"In September 2003 there was a referendum in which the people of Sweden were given the opportunity to decide whether Sweden should introduce the euro as its currency."
"The verdict, not surprisingly, was a loud and clear ‘no’."
"It is now two years since ten new Member States joined the EU."
"The state of opinion in those countries in relation to the euro varies from country to country."
"Replacing a currency is, however, an incredibly important and serious matter."
"It is not just a question of changing coins and notes, but also of giving up a part of your independence."
"By extension, you lose the ability to control your own economic development."
"The June List believes that the people must be consulted when decisions of this importance, such as in relation to a new draft Constitution or the euro, are to be taken."
"For the sake of democracy, it would be best if referendums were arranged – if that is what the people want – in those countries intending to introduce the euro as legal tender."
"The result of these referendums must then be respected, just like the people of Sweden’s ‘no’ to the euro."
"The next item is the report by Mr Grech on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on Parliament’s estimates for 2007 [2006/2022(BUD)] (A6-0188/2006)."
". Mr President, 2007, the first year of the new financial perspective, will be a year of spending consolidation in Parliament’s budget estimates for the coming year."
"Through this stocktaking exercise and consolidation process, we must strengthen what is proving to be efficient, and shed, or at least reduce, activities which do not add value."
"In this type of scenario, the implementation of activity-based budgeting commands greater importance."
"The report, moreover, stresses the fact that the budget should reflect actual budgetary needs."
"This explains why it is necessary for the retention or otherwise of the self-imposed ceiling of 20% to be evaluated thoroughly."
"We need to carry out a cost-benefit analysis to examine what serves Parliament’s best interests, including its financial independence now and in the future, when the Members’ Statute amounting to circa EUR 100 million per annum comes into force in 2009."
"This budgetary approach translates into more effective, transparent and analytical estimates, which leads me to another key issue in the report: the acquisition of parliamentary buildings."
"In this respect, and considering the recent events regarding the purchase of the WIC and SDM buildings in Strasbourg, we have no hesitation in putting into reserve the EUR 50 million intended for the purchase of those premises."
"It would be inadvisable to release these funds until the outstanding and unclear issues surrounding those premises have been satisfactorily clarified."
"We do not wish to underestimate the positive financial impact of our acquisition policy."
"We have repeatedly commented on the substantial savings this policy has created over the years."
"Nevertheless, it would be prudent to consider re-examining the overall acquisition policy of Parliament’s buildings, including the information offices in the various Member States."
"The report also addresses the issues relating to the visitors’ programme and information policy."
"Regrettably, no decision has been taken on the EUR 5 million allocated to improving the visitors’ programme."
"This situation is untenable and Members expect the Bureau to take a decision prior to first reading."
"In 2006 Parliament decided to invest in three major information projects, which included the building of a new visitors’ centre, audiovisual facilities and web television."
"In this respect, the administration has put forward for our consideration funds amounting to EUR 25 million to implement these projects in 2007."
"In principle we agree that more needs to be done to improve connectivity between the citizens and the new institutions that represent them."
"However, more precise and detailed information regarding political oversight, organisation, cost structure and programme contents have to be submitted before releasing all, or some, of these funds from the reserve."
"Bearing in mind the existing budgetary constraints, we are not as yet convinced that the request for an additional 74 posts is justified, especially at a time when we are advocating spending consolidation."
"Under these circumstances, the respective appropriation has been put in reserve until detailed information justifying this request is available prior to first reading."
"On another level, it is to be noted that EUR 48 million are being allocated for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"In the event of a postponement, the financial impact of circa 24 million should be deducted from the 2007 budget."
"Another important area we have focused upon in our report is that of the assistance and facilities available to Members."
"In this regard, the administration will be conducting a quality survey on the service being given to Members."
"We feel confident that the stocktaking process on the raising the game exercise, together with the survey’s conclusions, should go a long way towards improving this important aspect."
"In our report we have also referred to a number of other priorities that we have to address, such as training, recruitment related to enlargement, the assistants’ statute, security and contracts relating to external supplies."
"Regrettably, I do not have the time to address all these points, but we certainly cannot ignore them."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues, shadow rapporteurs, coordinators and members of the Committee on Budgets for their cooperation and constructive participation in drawing up this report with the common goal of improving the performance, quality and accountability of Parliament’s operation."
"."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Grech; he has done an excellent job, and the level of cooperation has been very agreeable."
"It has been a pleasant experience collaborating on this project."
"I would nevertheless like to make a few observations."
"First, it has always been said that we are spending 20% more than in the previous year."
"There may not be any principle at work here."
"The principle may just be that we are giving careful consideration to what needs we have and how we can use taxpayers’ money sparingly."
"Then there are the budget headings, and especially information policy."
"Last year we decided by a clear majority that we would add EUR five million for groups of visitors."
"Members of Parliament are expecting this EUR five million to be used, but it has not."
"This seems somewhat frustrating."
"Why does Parliament decide things in general if they are not put into practice?"
"I hope that Parliament’s President will ensure that Parliament’s will is implemented with regard to this matter and that the EUR five million will be spent."
"Then the desire was expressed to start having web television, although no decisions have been taken on this."
"In my opinion, the Committee has quite rightly made it a condition that there should be long-term financial plans for it: consideration of what it will cost next year, in five years’ time and even over a longer period of time, so that we know where we are going and how the administration will work."
"Before that happens, no decisions can be made."
"I would further like to mention one detail connected with the children’s nursery."
"Parliament has abandoned the idea of a nursery here and has bought a splendid house: a nice setting for the children but totally in the wrong place."
"The nursery ought to have been in this building or close by."
"How we behave as an employer is important."
"We should set an example, and I am disappointed with the Social Democrats, who do not care about families with children, who put people down, and who seem contemptuous of families with children."
"We vote in favour of the sports centre, money for web television and for many other comforts, but we do not care about families with children."
"I hope that this issue will be raised again."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work on this report."
"I applaud Louis Grech on the emphasis on improving the effective use of the funds."
"For this reason, I strongly support the introduction of activity-based budgeting."
"I have been asking for this system to be adopted by the Parliament for the last five years, as it provides an opportunity to demonstrate greater transparency."
"I have been disappointed, however, by the reluctance of the administration to introduce such a system and I think it is about time we did so."
"Therefore, I would ask the Secretary-General to take this issue up very seriously and see what progress we can make on that front."
"The second issue I want to raise is the annual question of the car service."
"I do not go along with what is in the report, namely to increase the support of additional funds for the chauffeur service for the Members."
"I support the amendment that the Verts/ALE Group has put forward, which is to look at the service and see how we can improve it without increasing the funds."
"We do not need to start increasing funds, especially when we have taxi reimbursement available for Members."
"On information and communication, we cannot stress enough the need for results that are essential for us to connect with the citizens."
"I thoroughly support the suggestions of having web TV and an improved visitors’ centre."
"Mr President, I would also very much like to thank Mr Grech for his constructive and thorough work on Parliament’s Budget for 2007."
"We are dealing here with a budget of just under EUR 1.4 billion, and there are three points to which I would like to draw attention."
"The first of these is that nearly half of the expenditure is caused by the geographical spread of Parliament’s activities and the fact that we work in many languages. These are conditions that are very specific to the European Parliament but also conditions that we are not, ourselves, in control of."
"Secondly, I wish to emphasise the need constantly to reprioritise and to bring about greater efficiency, particularly with regard to staffing policy, where redeployment is required."
"I would like to draw attention to the need to have better facilities for Members, so that they are able to work more efficiently, and to make information policy more effective, in which connection there is a need carefully to assess the contributions of the national information offices."
"A third point that I would like to raise is the matter of the purchase of buildings in Strasbourg."
"There has clearly been a lot of public blustering about this issue, and it would be entirely unacceptable if it should turn out that the location of Parliament in Strasbourg has been a money machine for the city."
"So we are forced, for the time being, to put the purchase of buildings on hold."
"Personally, I would prefer it if Parliament were able to content itself with being located in Brussels, so that we could work effectively on this issue too."
"Mr President, I am speaking in the expectation of being allowed the same length of time as the previous speakers, to whom you were very generous."
"What you present us with here is really an extremely sad situation."
"Yet again, the report shows that the budget is to be raised by another 4.2% and that another 250 new posts are to be established."
"This makes what you are doing here an expression of organised irresponsibility."
"It is clear that a group of people have hijacked the European project, and I am, regrettably, convinced that those who acquiesce once again will go down in history as benighted squanderers."
"If you took this report, translated it into all the official languages and gave it to the men and women of Europe to read, they would be horrified; they would say, ‘What are you thinking? We do not have that any more; we cannot afford that any more!"
"Even half of that would be too much.’"
"And everybody here knows that, but they do not act accordingly."
"It reminds me very much of the late Soviet Union, where every year they would talk about new record harvests and new maximisations and efficiency gains."
"What we have here is a disgrace and is unworthy of the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) [(COM(2005)0467 C6-0311/2005 2005/0203 (COD)] (A6-0168/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular to Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, and to the other committees involved, for all the valuable comments on and amendments to the Commission’s proposal concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"I am very glad that the European Parliament shares the Commission’s view on the importance of intercultural dialogue and the priority it should be given in the European Union."
"The Commission welcomes the majority of the amendments."
"The Commission is particularly sensitive to the call for strong cooperation with civil society and to the emphasis on the role of education."
"We also applaud the emphasis on the contribution of different cultures and expressions of diversity to the heritage of the Member States, as well as to European identity."
"We are very much in favour of ensuring continuity with the European Year of Equal Opportunities For All in 2007."
"The Commission is also in favour of a reference – preferably in a recital – to the fact that intercultural dialogue embraces dimensions related to religions and beliefs."
"However, the Commission would like to express some concerns relating to a couple of the amendments."
"Firstly, we cannot subscribe to limiting the resources for the communication and information campaign to EUR 2 million."
"Experience gained from previous European Years shows that these campaigns are crucial for achieving the awareness-raising objectives, and evaluation reports have always pointed to scarcity of resources as an issue in this respect."
"The Commission could show some flexibility vis-à-vis its original proposal of a EUR 4.5 million budget, but certainly not on such a drastic cut."
"Another financial issue is the level of co-financing of the actions at national level, which an amendment proposes to increase to up to 80%."
"As already stated, due to the limited budget of the Year, this change would significantly reduce the number of events that could be co-financed, as well as the commitment of partners at national level."
"The original proposal for 50% cofinancing is the standard formula which has been retained for all previous European Years."
"A number of amendments introduce a discrepancy between the geographical scope of the Year, which is limited to the European Union, and some new objectives and actions to be carried out with respect to third countries."
"The Commission proposed to concentrate the specific instrument on the Year of Intercultural Dialogue within the European Union, while committing itself to developing a parallel effort for the dialogue in, and with, third countries on the basis of external relations instruments."
"Some amendments include problematic references to several very concrete actions."
"The Commission is of the opinion that the Year should be a bottom-up process, where projects and initiatives come from our partners, in particular from civil society."
"Given the limited number of initiatives which can be supported, the introduction of references to precise actions within the legal basis would hamper the creativity of our partners and lead to implementation difficulties."
"Last, but not least, the Commission understands and appreciates the will of the European Parliament to be closely associated with the process."
"Unfortunately, it cannot support the amendment suggesting the participation of representatives of the European Parliament in the Advisory Committee."
"Comitology is a highly codified matter."
"It is our wish to adhere to the existing rules."
"Thank you for your attention."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for setting out the Commission’s views so clearly."
"First of all, I should like to thank my fellow Members who have assisted me in this task, all the committees which have submitted amendments and everyone who has given me advice."
"The Commission’s initial proposal was undoubtedly extremely wide-ranging, somewhat opaque and rather long-winded, but its aim was to be general in nature."
"The question Parliament has to consider is: can we express aspirations and launch an initiative for intercultural dialogue without extending the subject in advance to the issues that really interest us, and also without discussing thorny issues such as inter-faith dialogue?"
"We sought to clarify a number of things in our text."
"Firstly, reference is made in Article 2 to the European Union’s common values."
"In adhering to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we make it sufficiently clear that our common basis and the one we have all accepted is the one which guarantees non-discrimination between the sexes and equality of opportunity in all its aspects."
"It is unnecessary to keep repeating it."
"There is also the issue of extending the action beyond 2008, and stimulating dialogue across the large range of initiatives already underway in Community programmes."
"There is no doubt that education will be of vital importance here, not to mention the involvement of civil society; cooperation with all parts of civil society is essential."
"It is obvious that the media will have a major role to play and we must use the opportunity of the large-scale gatherings and emblematic events planned for 2008 to combat, in particular, the trafficking of human beings and enforced prostitution."
"It is also necessary to include other international organisations, such as the Council of Europe and Unesco."
"That does not mean that intra-European dialogue must not occupy centre stage, merely that we must take into account the joint actions already launched by Unesco."
"On this point, I would draw attention to the vote on cultural diversity, when the 25 spoke with a single voice."
"On another point: the Internet portal will have to be developed and, when the Commission says that it cannot agree with a lower budget for communication and information, I would ask the Commissioner if the overall budget could not be increased."
"Our Committee on Culture and Education has already pointed out to him that a budget of EUR 10 million is extremely small to achieve the objectives set for this year."
"We know that culture is always the poor relation in budgetary terms."
"In these circumstances, your comment that you would like to revert to the initial budget is unsatisfactory."
"We would ask you to make a further effort in terms of the overall budget, so that we can increase the amount devoted to communication and information."
"In relation to the dialogue with the religious world, I have to point out, here, Mr President, that only yesterday the President of the Council and the President of the Commission launched a debate with the representatives of religious communities on the issue of fundamental rights and mutual respect."
"Despite that, Parliament is asked to refer to that aspect only in the recitals, whereas in my view Parliament must also be ready to engage in that dialogue."
"We can no longer keep such taboos in our society."
"We must move forward and tackle the difficult issues."
"Religions and their rejection are a key factor in the process of social identification, integration and exclusion."
"I would emphasise, with the support of my colleagues, the importance of this aspect of intercultural dialogue in the broader sense."
"Finally, Mr President, we must not overlook the fact that concrete actions will undoubtedly be a way of stimulating attention."
"Why not create a dialogue prize in Parliament, like the Sakharov prize for human rights?"
"Why not organise an intercultural forum in Parliament to round off the year, thereby giving Parliament the visibility it merits on these issues?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the importance she attached to our collaboration."
"The European project derives its richness from the cultural diversity of its Member States."
"Thus, intercultural dialogue is now, more than ever, a process to be encouraged."
"The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will provide the opportunity."
"To achieve this, I envisage a two-way communication."
"European citizens must be able to gain access to the cultures of other European and non-European countries, particularly their neighbours."
"In parallel there is a need to increase awareness among the rest of the world of the cultures and values of the Union, in order to foster mutual understanding."
"Similarly, intercultural dialogue has to be a driving force for the social integration of immigrants."
"As shadow rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the European Year in 2007, I would emphasise the importance of cohesion and consistency in the actions to be undertaken in 2007 in support of universal equality of opportunity, and would also stress the importance of cohesion in the initiatives forming part of the 2008 cultural dialogue, as these two years complement one another."
"I would also invite the Commission and the parties involved – in particular civil society, as the Commissioner has said – to take the opportunity of the major events planned for 2008, such as the football World Cup or the Olympic Games, to make the public, and especially the target group of young people, more aware of the importance of intercultural dialogue."
".Mr President, the idea that 2008 should become the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue emerged in connection with the EU’s enlargement to include 10 new Member States, which have added cultural, linguistic and religious diversity to the Community."
"This initiative is entirely appropriate to the challenges faced by Europe today, and it fully addresses the need for multi-level dialogue with a view to building mutual understanding based on respect and tolerance."
"Unfortunately, this noble idea has not been backed up by an appropriate budget."
"EUR 10 million divided by 27 countries, with no additional support from the Member States, will not pay for any high-profile or truly valuable cultural events."
"We should, however, hope that with the appropriate use of other programmes intended to fund cultural actions, and by involving representatives of civil society, non-governmental and religious organisations, schools, universities and especially the media, we will be able to join forces to achieve the ambitious aims for 2008 despite the modest and nominal budget."
"This would serve to make it a dialogue, rather than a money-saving cultural monologue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur and draftsmen, because their work has highlighted all the aspects and possibilities of the Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"This initiative is directly interconnected with all the internal and external challenges of the European Union."
"Indeed, maintaining and strengthening the multicultural aspect of Europe is a decisive factor for its integration."
"At the same time, a dialogue of cultures and citizens from around the world – because it is the citizens who are the vehicle for the culture – is needed for peace and equilibrium."
"The tradition of the European Union and our development goals are such that we need an open society of dialogue seeking common values with the citizens of other countries in our Member States in order to achieve mutual understanding, mutual respect and less discrimination."
"On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to stress the importance of our working within this framework in order to combat the discrimination suffered by women and to encourage their participation in all activities and initiatives relating to intercultural dialogue."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my honourable colleague, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, for her outstanding work."
"Without wishing to cause offence to the Commissioner, I would like to say that she has very much enlivened what was originally a rather administrative proposal."
"But the Commission’s proposals always do leave room for improvement."
"The European Parliament is a democratic forum in which political debate relates to the lives, everyday existence and concerns of the people."
"The geographical area of the European Union has not only seen the construction of cathedrals but was also the scene of the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as well as the birthplace of the rule of law and of the welfare state."
"The EU has a common cultural heritage and respects cultural diversity."
"That is why I wish to stress most emphatically that interreligious dialogue must be a major part of intercultural dialogue."
"If we want to promote intercultural dialogue, as we should, but fail to mention interreligious dialogue, then we are betraying it."
"We should see it not as a hindrance, but as a challenge, or even an opportunity to better our mutual understanding and to live together in harmony."
"Given the current grappling with Islam, now is not the time for us to be ignorant of our roots, to deny and to disown them."
"We have our backs to the wall in this respect."
"We should speak confidently; only then can we enter into dialogue."
"Education must also play an essential part in the action, on the European level as well as nationally and regionally."
"Civic education and initiatives designed to promote understanding of others in their diversity are a contribution to constructive and effective dialogue."
"Educational institutions in particular must play a role in this European Year."
"The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue also presents the opportunity to distribute teaching and learning materials on the various cultures."
"Intercultural dialogue is extremely important politically; it is, however, only meaningful once it includes interreligious dialogue and education."
"Only then can it bear fruit, and only there lies the soul of such dialogue."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges for her work on this report."
"Tomorrow we will approve the report on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008), an initiative that will undoubtedly promote dialogue amongst all cultures and people of different origins residing in the European Union."
"2008 will contribute to integration and cohesion within our societies, as well as peaceful governance throughout the international community."
"The aim is to make it possible to turn this diversity into an opportunity for everybody."
"The States and all competent levels of administration should promote educational policies based on values and respect for the diversity and equality of people, eradicating the prejudices that are often the cause of distrust and xenophobic attitudes."
"A firm and responsible approach is therefore required, aimed at promoting knowledge, cooperation, respect and mutual understanding."
"This dialogue, however, must be based on the conviction that culture is made up of a whole range of very diverse values and traditions – including religious traditions – and respect for all cultural sensitivities and all religious beliefs, and I believe that the latter are a private matter for each individual."
"This programme is clearly directed towards the members of the European Union, but, as I have said, in view of its importance in terms of world governance, it should complement the only world-level project for promoting intercultural dialogue that exists within the framework of the United Nations: the Alliance of Civilisations."
"As you know, it was an initiative of the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and the Turkish Prime Minister, and it currently has the support of the United Nations as a whole."
"I am convinced that, when this programme is applied, this complementarity will become clear, because in reality the two programmes must work together."
". – The implementation of the programme for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will help to achieve the fundamental obligation of the European Union – to enable Member State cultures to flourish and highlight Europe's common cultural heritage."
"As far as Lithuanian culture is concerned, I could give many examples which would interest every curious European."
"I will mention just two – cross crafting and the song festival traditions of the Baltic States, both included in UNESCO's cultural heritage list."
"This project is also important because of demographic changes in Europe."
"As a result of emigration, we already have whole communities of Lithuanians in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain."
"These communities are quite closed."
"The cause – a lack of information and opportunities to become acquainted with the traditions and cultural differences of these countries."
"I believe that every state must create conditions for residents to get to know the rich cultural heritage of the whole of Europe and common European values."
"This experience is essential if we want to strengthen active and open European citizenship."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, for her work and for the way in which she performed it, by holding a dialogue with several Members and considering the different points of view."
"It has been a very good experience from which we have all benefited."
"It is important to recognise cultural diversity in Europe – within each Member State, each society, each region and each nation – in order to achieve unity with diversity."
"That is our European point of view."
"We can only build European citizenship if we recognise this diversity and if everyone agrees on the same common project for Europe."
"On religion and intercultural dialogue, we should understand that the recognition of religious values can only come through intercultural dialogue."
"Cultural diversity includes religious diversity, which must therefore form part of that dialogue."
"."
"Mr President, intercultural dialogue is only possible when cultural diversity is defended and promoted, and when we regard European culture as the totality of its different cultures, different nations and different environments."
"Attempts to create a so-called ‘European culture’ as a universal and uniform culture for all will bring more losses than benefits."
"The desire to eliminate the languages of nations which are smaller and thereby weaker within the European Union from the list of official languages and from legal communication, including business communication, is extremely detrimental to cultural dialogue."
"A particular aversion to the Slavonic languages and cultures can be observed."
"Evidence of this can be seen for example in the voting in the European Parliament on the report on the promotion of multilingualism and language learning."
"It is often forgotten that languages and traditional culture are the mainstay on which national cultures survive and develop."
"There is a chronic lack of funding for protection of this wealth in the European Union."
"Funds are however available for large projects and for professional cultural events, whose scope sometimes even extends beyond Europe."
"In order to initiate a lasting cultural dialogue, equal opportunities and cultural partnership need to be maintained."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Year of Intercultural Dialogue is intended to help to foster harmony in the multicultural societies of the EU Member States."
"I would therefore have expected the proposal to place a major emphasis on involving the citizens in such dialogue."
"The way in which the project budget has been structured, however, does not suggest that that is the case."
"A total of EUR 10 million has been allocated, and structured on the basis of three types of action, according to level: points A) and B) at Community level together account for around EUR 7.5 million, or 75% of the budget, whereas point C) for actions at national level, provided they offer added European value, will only receive EUR 2.5 million."
"The sums awarded per State amount to EUR 100 000, that is to say, only 1% of the project budget will be earmarked for each State."
"The way in which the budget of this project has been structured would strongly indicate that the oft-proclaimed and highly ambitious ‘main aim of the project, to promote dialogue among all cultures and among everyone living in the European Union,’ will be difficult, if not impossible to fulfil."
"The reason for this is simple – a lack of financial resources to establish wide-ranging dialogue between people at national and at bilateral and multilateral international levels."
"Such contact could contribute most to the development of mutual respect, understanding and admiration on the basis of cultural understanding."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for this debate."
"It is rather late, but it is a very important debate."
"I think we all agree on the importance of the intercultural dialogue. I would agree, as usual, that the Commission’s proposals have been improved by the work of rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs in Parliament and we can be proud of this."
"Regarding the budget, even if we were to invest the entire budget that the Community has for this purpose, it would not be enough."
"The issue is not about money, it is more about the idea, and we should push for financing for this to come from other sources as well."
"It should not be seen that such action is financed only by the Community budget."
"We are putting forward as much money as we can afford."
"I agree that the amount could be larger, but this is the amount of money set aside for this purpose."
"At the same time, once again I would like to defend the budget that we have allocated for communication and information purposes."
"This is a crucial element."
"What is most important is not so much co-financing, despite that being an important issue, but rather providing information and guiding the process with the Member States involved."
"I would therefore ask for your understanding with regard to the amount we attribute."
"It is not because we do not value this, but because the budget is limited and the Community should not finance 100% of all the actions that the Union is proposing."
"Other sources should also be used."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Mr Vidal-Quadras on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on energy efficiency (Green Paper) [2005/2210(INI)] (A6-0160/2006)."
". – Mr President, tomorrow this House will vote on the report on energy efficiency for which I have been rapporteur."
"This report comes at an extremely appropriate time."
"Following last January’s energy crisis, the constant rise in the price of a barrel of crude, amongst other factors, has reopened an in-depth debate on the lack of a common energy policy within the Union, the vulnerability of our supply system, the worrying increase in protectionist attitudes and the need to substantially improve our habits, as well as the efficiency of our consumption."
"We have had to face extreme situations in order for the citizens and the governments to become aware once again of the seriousness of the situation we are in."
"Let us hope that the measures required to resolve these problems are taken once and for all."
"I believe that the great majority of Members of this Parliament agree with me that, in terms of reducing our dependence on external sources and combating climate change, energy efficiency is the quickest and least expensive approach and has the greatest potential for creating employment and economic growth."
"Furthermore, promoting energy efficiency fits perfectly well within the Lisbon Agenda, which is so in need of revitalisation."
"This report is also intended to remind the Member States that, if the different directives in force are complied with, the Union could achieve 50% of its energy saving objectives, as well as the majority of its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, without the need to take any new measures."
"I believe that it is important to emphasise this message because the great majority of the agreements amongst the Member States from the last Spring Council relate to compliance with existing obligations."
"We are often accused of producing endless legislative texts that are difficult to transpose, but that view is usually a poor excuse from national governments that have not been diligent in their compliance with the Community legislation."
"The report that we will approve tomorrow also includes recommendations that are worth highlighting here: the need for massive investment in improvements to infrastructures – given that we suffer an average 12% loss in transmission networks, with losses of up to 20% in certain Member States; the completion of the internal energy market; greater investment in research, development and innovation in the field of more efficient technologies; the introduction of stricter requirements for domestic appliances and tighter controls of products available on the European market that do not conform to minimum standards; efficiency criteria in relations with developing countries; and strengthened dialogue with the main energy-producing countries."
"Last but not least, several parts of the document stress the importance of the public sector, including the European institutions, setting a positive example in the incorporation of energy efficiency measures, through the design of public buildings, the renewal of vehicle fleets and the inclusion of energy efficiency criteria for public contracts."
"I believe that this document makes many useful suggestions for the Commission in drawing up the action plan."
"We are counting on Commissioner Piebalgs, who always listens so carefully to Parliament’s views, to incorporate them into his final version."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation during the drawing up of this report, which I hope will receive as large a majority tomorrow as it did in the vote in committee."
"This is the ideal time to take some courageous steps in the right direction, since we have on our side both the good will of the Member States and the will and interest of the citizens."
"We must not miss this great opportunity."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras on his excellent report."
"This report demonstrates why high energy efficiency needs to be on the agenda of the European Union."
"Constantly increasing energy efficiency levels is the most important viable long-term policy in order to achieve a sustainable, competitive and secure energy policy for Europe."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission is already in line with most of the calls from Parliament."
"Indeed, we will integrate your considerations into our forthcoming Action Plan on Energy Efficiency, together with the results of the public hearing."
"I expect the action plan to be adopted just after the summer break."
"In addition, these considerations will be part of the Commission’s work in the broader context."
"I note the call on the Commission to be consistent with existing legislation."
"I agree."
"The action plan will build on existing legislation, and will focus on practical measures."
"I also agree with your request for regular updates on the state of implementation of the directives dealing with energy efficiency."
"Proper implementation and enforcement will determine the success of any EU policy."
"This will, therefore, be the first priority in our action plan."
"You rightly point out that in these times of high energy prices, the 9% consumption reduction target over nine years in the directive on end-use efficiency and energy services may well be on the low side."
"On this issue, I would like to mention the following: the Commission is launching a comprehensive study on the energy efficiency potential in the different Member States."
"This study will give a clear overview of national potentials and the Commission will compare this with the ambition levels in the Member States."
"In this way, we hope to increase the ambition levels of the Member States."
"In relation to financial issues, we work with international financing institutions to integrate energy efficiency into their lending strategy."
"The refurbishment of existing buildings, with an emphasis on social housing, is already part of the European Regional Development Fund in the new programming period."
"However, it is up to the Member States to ensure that they use this possibility."
"I agree that fiscal measures can be a very effective instrument to further energy efficiency."
"Regarding financial incentives to speed up market transformation, the Commission is considering a number of options in the impact assessment report on the action plan."
"I agree that public authorities should lead by example, in particular through their public procurement policy."
"They can make a substantial difference towards market transformation."
"We will closely follow how Member States integrate energy efficiency requirements into public procurement guidelines, as they are required to do under the Energy Services Directives."
"In this respect, I also agree with your call for more public information and education, and this will make up the third part of our action plan – behavioural changes."
"I will comment briefly on minimum efficiency standards for energy-using products, as well as labelling."
"The dynamic setting of minimum efficiency standards is embedded in the Eco-design Directive."
"At the same time, we need to ensure predictability for investment planning by the industry."
"As regards labelling, this will also be looked at in the action plan in connection with awareness-raising."
"I am encouraged by your call on the Commission and the Member States to deploy more initiatives to increase energy efficiency in transport."
"All options should be seriously considered."
"The Commission will soon be coming forward with a mid-term review of the transport policy, and transport will also be one of the areas for action in the Energy Efficiency Action Plan."
"On external relations, I agree that energy efficiency should be – in fact, it already is – a part of our relations with both energy suppliers and with the consuming regions."
"Dialogues on this issue are being held with Russia, OPEC, the United States, China, Japan and India."
"However, there is room for more action, both to make full use of the competitive advantage that we already have through existing technologies, but also because it is important in fighting climate change and ensuring security of supply."
"I think there is complete agreement between your report and our work, and I would ask you to continue your strong support for our work in the energy efficiency field."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs once again for this excellent report."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy savings help reduce Europe’s dependence on an essential resource, contribute towards sustainable development and, by preventing waste, increase competitiveness."
"These are hugely important, topical objectives, as the rapporteur and the Commissioner both pointed out."
"Given that there appears to be convergence on objectives, the biggest problem that we face is how to convert those objectives into practice and how to change wasteful practices and habits."
"The text that we are about to adopt is an important step in this direction."
"As draftsman, I wish to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work and for his cooperation in accepting a large number of amendments, three of which I should like to highlight: Firstly, the liberalisation of the energy markets must be matched by the quality of the regulation."
"Secondly, the harmonisation of standards must be carried out at international level."
"Thirdly, fiscal differences are specified that will lead to more efficient practices."
"Lastly, I feel that to ensure consistency of policy, there should be a way of guaranteeing that the Structural and Cohesion Funds lead to recovery and energy saving, especially in cities, which should go hand in hand with the recovery and streamlining of transport systems."
"I wish to bring these four suggestions to the fore."
"Mr President, as a result of the Brussels Summit in March this year, the European Union now has its own energy policy."
"The adoption of the joint strategy is a milestone, because we can only control our overwhelming energy problems with joint efforts."
"However, rather than ensuring a larger and even more wasteful usage, the focal point of the new strategy should be a more economical, more efficient and more intensive energy utilisation."
"This is the foundation of our competitiveness, and it is also supported by ecological considerations and even by the interest of consumers."
"Therefore, I am also pleased that following my proposal, the document tabled before us also includes, among other things, assistance for the modernisation of energy utilisation in prefabricated housing, which is a significant problem throughout Europe, including Hungary."
"I believe that the encouragement given to companies providing services related to energy efficiency is a very significant step, because this is a market-conforming and innovative solution."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent work."
"I also thank the rapporteur for having supported almost all the proposals I had made as the competent draftsman of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Mr President, in one minute I should just like to emphasise two points."
"We have tried to state that we must be more determined in regarding transport efficiency as the nucleus of a strategy to integrate our policies on competitiveness, sustainability and energy security."
"I therefore hope, Commissioner, that you will actually do what you have said, and we shall watch that you do so."
"Secondly, we have to acknowledge that the average efficiency of road transport conversion chains is surprisingly low, and a step change is needed."
"This represents an enormous potential saving if we take it as the main criterion for defining product quality and as a prerequisite for introducing hydrogen converters in the future."
"Of course, research and development are our hope, but we have to start straight away by doing what is possible, based on proven technologies that already exist and on the possibilities for systems-wide integration."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague the rapporteur Mr Vidal-Quadras for all his hard work in producing this report."
"However, I would also like to commiserate with him because some of our colleagues have displayed a lack of efficiency in their rather profligate use of words in pursuit of the worthy aims of this report."
"In having too many words, there is a risk of losing focus on what we wish to achieve."
"However, I would like to congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras very much on the splendid set of amendments which he has produced with the other shadow rapporteurs in compromise."
"It is wonderful to see so much text being cut out of a report, and I support him strongly."
"We need realism in pursuit of our aims for efficiency."
"Efficiency is essential; the issue is how we achieve it and how soon we can achieve it."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks first of all to the rapporteur, Mr Vidal-Quadras, both for the report itself and for our close cooperation."
"From this very comprehensive committee report I would like to pick up only a few points of particular importance to my group."
"Firstly, the recognition that the prescribed target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 must be amended upwards."
"The Commission’s target is based on an oil price of 25-30 dollars per barrel."
"I need hardly stress that this assumption is far removed from any current and future reality."
"This means that we can expect energy-efficiency measures to be far more cost-effective."
"In this context, the report also establishes how cost-efficiency is to be assessed."
"Its assessment should take into account such factors as rising energy prices, reduced dependence on energy imports, the protection of the climate and of the environment, the security of energy supplies, innovation and the effects of energy saving in the medium and long term."
"Alongside ambitious targets we need ambitious energy-efficiency action plans."
"I am referring not only to the Commission’s European action plan but also to national action plans."
"We really must make these action plans the heart of a much-needed energy-efficiency offensive, meaning that we need good, intensive PR, practicable and effective proposals and differentiated energy-efficiency scenarios."
"."
"Mr President, this is a report brimming with recommendations, but I want to make just one point."
"We must not be under-ambitious on energy efficiency."
"We are dealing with an evolving set of circumstances, and the technology is developing so fast that last years’ top energy-efficient appliance becomes next year’s rather mediocre model."
"But even more significantly, the economic calculation is changing almost daily."
"As Mrs Rothe said, when the Commission published its Green Paper it based its target of 20% energy saving by 2020 on an oil price of USD 30 a barrel, but by the time the report passed through the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), oil prices stood at USD 70 a barrel."
"It will not be very long before Member States bring forward their national energy efficiency action plans."
"As you said Commissioner, 1% a year now seems far too low a target to be aiming for."
"I welcome very much the comments you made to that effect."
"I hope that the Commission will take a strong line and ensure that those national action plans are ambitious both in scope and in implementation, given what is now realistically and viably achievable."
"."
"Mr President, that is enough talk: let us act."
"Let us have mandatory targets above 20% and strengthen legislation, above all as regards transport, but also electricity."
"Let us take the opportunity to relaunch combined heat and power – that should be our answer to energy security."
"However, all this can only happen if there is institutional capacity-building."
"As long as there are more people in the Commission working for Euratom and on nuclear power then on energy efficiency, then there will be more talk than action."
"Commissioner, we will judge you on this."
"You promised us more staff to work on energy efficiency."
"You have not delivered on your promises and will not be able to do so without more staff."
"We need these staff because we need Commission officials to go outside Brussels and build a new partnership."
"Energy efficiency is about a new culture, and we must therefore get national, regional and local governments on board, as well as industry, NGOs and the citizens."
"How can you achieve this with just a handful of officials in the Commission?"
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, our group obviously takes a positive view of improved energy efficiency."
"On the Committee we voted in favour of the numerous amendments made to Mr Vidal-Quadras’s report."
"The end result is acceptable to us, working on the principle that the forest is more important than the trees."
"The Union lacks a transport energy efficiency policy."
"I welcomed the Commissioner’s promise to produce a document on energy efficiency in transport in the near future."
"Possible areas where savings can be made mostly relate to different buildings and their heating and air-conditioning needs."
"Improved energy efficiency in buildings will call for new investment and new technology, but there are no alternatives to it."
"When Finland was part of Russia, the tsarist authorities taught the Finns discipline by sending our fellow countrymen to Siberia."
"This worked on the principle that Siberia teaches you a lesson."
"From the point of view of energy efficiency, rising energy prices are the EU’s Siberia."
"Expensive energy teaches you a lesson."
"What does it teach you?"
"It teaches you to save energy."
"In this report we aspire to big savings, and the message to the Commission is a long one, but it is crystal clear."
"Mr President, the matter under discussion relates to the efficient use of energy which, once obtained from primary sources, may be converted into useful work or into another form of energy, or used inefficiently in open-ended systems."
"Examples of these include the large industrial steam power plants, whose end efficiency is at best 30-40%, less 10% for power transmission costs."
"How, then, can energy be more efficiently used to save these 20-30%?"
"In the first place, we need to invest in upgrading heat insulation in buildings and in modernising the way heat is produced and supplied to them, as well as in waste heat recovery systems."
"Secondly, we need to invest in the decommissioning of old, small-scale, outmoded local heating plants and to connect housing estates, particularly in the new Member States where such estates exist in large cities, to heating networks powered by modern, co-generating heat-and-power stations of optimum capacity."
"This will enable the simultaneous generation of electricity for local consumers without transmission losses."
"In order for these technologies to bear rapid fruit, however, financial priority will need to be accorded to access to EU funding for these projects, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour, I shall begin with a story about a driver who asks the price of a drop of petrol at a petrol station."
"On hearing that a drop of petrol costs nothing, he asks for a full tank."
"It is indeed the case that one can save a great deal drop by drop, perhaps even in financial terms."
"We certainly have before us an array of measures and proposals that could help bring about greater energy efficiency."
"My analogy was an attempt to illustrate that the potential solutions are all relative and clearly not simple."
"In my opinion, the most important is to boost science and research."
"I therefore believe that unless we back up our good intentions and rhetoric with adequate financial resources for research and development – and at the moment this is clearly not the case – our goal of raising energy efficiency may be no more than wishful thinking."
"A case in point is the Galileo project."
"Unless we provide this project with adequate funding, we will not achieve higher energy efficiency in future in an area such as transport, which is unquestionably one of the highest consumers of energy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras on the broad consensus achieved and the skill he has shown during the process of drawing up this report."
"We all agree that Europe is faced with the effects of climate change, the rising crude prices and the tension with Russia over the supply of gas."
"Nevertheless, Europe’s political response to our energy vulnerability is perhaps not yet up to the challenges we are facing."
"Over recent years we have been prioritising the creation of the European energy market."
"Nevertheless, reality shows that it is essential to move towards a common energy policy and that it is essential that the Member States are committed to moving decisively towards that objective."
"Furthermore, greater financial commitment to research and development in the field of energy is essential, specifically with a view to increasing efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport."
"In any event, one of the crucial approaches is to improve energy efficiency, which could lead to the saving of an enormous amount of energy in Europe."
"Furthermore, the citizens can play an important role in this in their daily lives, but we will need a global approach, because this objective will affect all of the European policies as a whole."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur again for an excellent report."
"We touched upon the very important issue of the Commission’s role and whether the Commission is delivering."
"I do not believe that it is the role of the Commission to have millions of inspectors checking that everyone has switched off their lights!"
"The role of the Commission is to give the political imperative, to provide the instruments for Member States and to raise public awareness, and we are delivering on that."
"We are coping excellently in this respect, because energy efficiency is definitely the first priority in the whole energy society in the European Union and each year we are improving, but we should like to improve even more."
"The perception that was mentioned is wrong, because the Commission is delivering strongly on this."
"Let me turn to the issue of staff and the relocation of staff."
"The Commission must fulfil Treaty obligations."
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties."
"The Treaties should be fulfilled and to do this the Commission must have enough staff for all areas."
"Therefore, it is not possible to move civil servants from one area to another as if by some miracle."
"As far as energy efficiency is concerned, there have been changes to the structure of DG-TREN."
"We have a unit for energy efficiency and another for renewable energies."
"The number of staff has been increased and will be increased in accordance with the provisions in the annual budget."
"That is part of the budget-making procedure."
"I cannot accept this argument."
"The Commission is doing what it can and is delivering on it."
"The report is excellent and will provide us with better opportunities to use the potential of the European Union."
"Perhaps we could be more ambitious than 20%, but we must now concentrate on seeing that is fulfilled."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Energy savings imply a reduction of energy; energy efficiency means doing more with less."
"After the world was awakened by the enormous rise in the cost of oil which ultimately translated into rises in our petrol and diesel costs and unbearable surcharges in our electricity bills – as happened in my own country Malta – we have all started to focus on the energy savings – alternative energies such as wind farms at sea, as is being proposed in Malta – and energy efficiency."
"Energy efficiency can be addressed to numerous aspects of our everyday life."
"For instance: buildings – the potential in efficiency in the building sector is of utmost importance; appliances – electric appliances such as ovens, air conditioners, kettles, toasters, etc. are becoming more efficient; transport – research and development have made cars more efficient in energy consumption."
"But unfortunately, the more energy-efficient cars are, the more expensive they usually become."
"Consequently, the main problem lies in the implementation of this report if adopted."
"How are you going to encourage consumers to make capital investments, to change or purchase more energy-efficient building materials, cars or appliances?"
"The only way is motivation of a fiscal nature such as tax credits, reduced VAT, reduced licence payments, etc."
"– The recent crisis in the distribution of Russian natural gas supplies has revealed just how dependent Europe is on imported energy sources, and the problem is expected to become appreciably worse in the coming years."
"Containing the European Union’s energy demand could prove to be an important factor in solving the problem."
"Such a step could lead to greater economic efficiency, generate a trend towards more jobs and help make European industry more competitive, all of which are in line with the aims of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In addition to setting new targets, we must look at the legislation that already exists: if the Member States had adopted it in full, we would by now already be halfway towards the Union’s target of a 20% energy saving by 2010."
"The report proposes that the energy efficiency goals be incorporated into other sectoral policies, such as tax, transport or cohesion policy."
"I believe that the funds intended for the European Union’s regional policy should also be used to finance interregional and cross-border projects, to allow for the transfer of expertise to Member States and regions that do not have enough of a technological background to implement greater energy efficiency."
"The next item is the report by Mr Sonik on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on prohibitions on certain sexual offenders [14207/2004 C6-0244/2004 2004/0818(CNS)] (A6-0068/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, Belgium’s initiative from 2004 is a response to the series of sex offences committed by Michel Fourniret."
"The Fourniret case showed that there is nothing to stop a person who is convicted in one Member State for such crimes subsequently moving to another Member State and getting a job there where they have continuous contact with children."
"The present framework decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children, as provided for in the framework decision of 2003, aims to close this loophole."
"The aim of the proposal is to ensure that prohibitions on working with children ordered by a court in connection with convictions for sexual offences or child pornography offences are applicable not only in the country where they are imposed, but in any other EU Member State to which the person covered by the prohibition moves."
"The proposed framework decision will implement the following solutions:"
"- it requires Member States where the convicted person is resident to recognise a prohibition issued in another Member State and to enforce that prohibition within their own territory;"
"- it introduces an obligation to enter all prohibitions imposed on convicted child sex offenders on a register of convicted persons, including prohibitions issued in other Member States;"
"- it provides for an obligation whereby another Member State must be informed of a prohibition when other information from the register of convicted persons is forwarded in accordance with international and EU regulations on legal assistance in criminal matters;"
"- it imposes an obligation on a Member State whose register of convicted persons is consulted for the criminal record of a particular person to apply in all such cases for information from the register of convicted persons of the Member State of which the person is a national."
"The proposed amendments to the draft framework decision will, in particular, contribute firstly to broadening the definition of a prohibition to include prohibitions on any activity of any nature in public or private institutions engaged in supervising or working with children."
"The aim here is to ensure that such prohibitions apply not only to teachers or supervisors working with children, but also to ancillary staff working in the same institutions."
"In the second place, it is to extend the protection of EU citizens by obliging Member States to enter prohibitions imposed in non-EU Member States on the register of convicted persons, and to regulate dual citizenship cases."
"Finally, I must underline that the proposed framework decision is an example of the practical implementation of the conclusions of the 1999 Tampere European Council, where it was established that the mutual exchange of information about sentencing in criminal matters should become a cornerstone of judicial collaboration within the European Union."
"We should bear in mind that there are no ideal solutions, but I am convinced that the effective implementation of this decision will greatly contribute to the safety of our children."
"This document, however, must not represent an end to the fight against paedophilia."
"The Member States need to go further in implementing and enforcing legislation on occupational prohibitions."
"Every employing institution should therefore introduce requirements for screening every person for child sex offences."
"Mr President, I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for his work."
"I can say in advance that generally the Commission agrees with all initiatives that aim at strengthening our firm, no-tolerance fight against paedophile activities at a European level."
"These are horrible crimes which, unfortunately, are increasing on a weekly basis in Europe."
"Members of this Parliament are probably aware that Europol carries out major investigations every week to smash paedophile rings operating inside the European Union."
"The Internet has been a boon to those who commit such crimes against children."
"As you may know, there are about 200 000 – I repeat, 200 000 – paedophilia sites available on the web."
"The extent of the problem means that information has to be shared."
"As you know, last December the Commission put forward a general initiative to promote the sharing of information on criminal convictions."
"It is a general provision that does not specifically deal with prohibition measures precisely for those found guilty of sex acts involving children."
"Thus the measure proposed by Belgium, to which the rapporteur referred, is a measure that supplements the general provision regarding information on criminal convictions; it is a measure that we can endorse concerning a very specific sector."
"I believe that the main thrust of the European Union’s action to cut down on and then eliminate sex crimes against children for good should be based on strong preventive action and operational cooperation."
"Knowing what prohibition measures will result from a criminal conviction and being able to apply them in all Member States will ensure that cases like the Fourniret affair, for instance, can never happen again."
"It will also ensure that those who still think that such crimes can be committed will not only be severely punished but also prevented from travelling and committing such crimes more easily in another European Union country."
"The rapporteur deserves the Commission’s congratulations and support for this initiative."
"."
"To begin with, I would like to thank Mr Sonik for his well prepared report."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs analysed the legal side of this report and, after submitting a few amendments, approved the report."
"It was truly abnormal that a citizen convicted of abuse in one EU state, including sexual abuse against children, could again find work in children’s education institutions in another EU state, despite the fact that in its judgment the court had forbidden the citizen from doing so."
"The report makes provision that information on such individuals will, in accordance with compulsory procedures, be passed to all EU states, which will add it to the appropriate register."
"Therefore, such a child rapist will no longer be able to work in children’s education institutions and harm children again."
"I would urge my colleagues to approve the report and trust that all EU states will ensure that this new rule is introduced as a matter of urgency."
"After all, child welfare is the most important thing."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to say ‘good morning’ to all those who have stayed here for so long."
"It goes without saying that I am in full agreement with all previous speakers as regards the regrettably dire necessity of excluding from certain professions those convicted of crimes of indecency."
"That being so, whilst the circumstances that triggered this motion are sad, Belgium deserves credit for having tabled it for a framework decision."
"As the convict in question was able to return to paid employment in Belgium and took advantage of the situation, we must do everything we can to avoid this sort of thing happening again."
"There are, however, major differences between national laws in the area of removal from employment, which can be accomplished by means of criminal law, civil law or administrative arrangements."
"The motion does not provide fresh funds for exchanging information."
"Are the existing funds to exchange data from the criminal records sufficient to allow bans from employment that are brought about via a different legal form to be notified?"
"Mutual notification of disbarments from employment also means that the Member States will enforce a ban when that has been issued in a different Member State."
"Is this a first step towards obtaining mutual recognition in the area of professional bans?"
"What I should like to be told is whether this motion can be implemented without the need for additional funds."
"Mr President, Commissioner, given the late hour I will make just a few short remarks on the subject."
"Banning sex offenders from relevant jobs on a Europe-wide basis in order to prevent them reoffending in child-care or youth work, for example, is undoubtedly important."
"To date, however, therapeutic methods have perhaps been geared almost exclusively towards convicted sex offenders, neglecting the possibilities of preventive therapy."
"Improvements in police methods of prevention with regard to known sex offenders are surely also needed, as is more restricted recourse to early release from prison."
"Police cooperation and the sharing of information in this area also need to be improved, in my opinion, and we might even consider following the American example of making information on these offenders generally accessible."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 1 June 2006."
"Following the Presidency-in-Office of the Council’s request to the Conference of Presidents, the latter decided, at its meeting on 8 June, to organise a plenary sitting."
"I would emphasise that this will be a plenary sitting in the full sense of the word, not a Conference of Presidents open to all Members, which will take place on Tuesday of next week, 20 June, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m."
"At that plenary sitting, the President-in-Office of the Council, Chancellor Schüssel, will report on the last meeting and on his Presidency, and I therefore hope that an appropriate number of Members will attend that sitting in order to hear this important statement."
"The only item on the agenda will be the Council and Commission statements on the results of the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006."
"Mr President, I believe that, when deciding on this sitting, the Conference of Presidents did not take account of the fact that the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly would be meeting in Vienna on the same day and that 78 Members of this House will not therefore be able to attend one of the two events: either the extraordinary sitting being scheduled or the plenary sitting of the Joint Assembly, which we are obliged to attend."
"I find it regrettable, to say the least, that account has not been taken of this situation, because 78 is more than 10% of the Members of this House."
"Thank you, Mr Martínez."
"The clash is regrettable, but it is not regrettable that no thought has been given to it, because, in fact, thought has been given to it."
"– Mr President, I would just like to ask whether I have understood this correctly: are we talking here about an extraordinary plenary session?"
"That is just utter nonsense."
"A long time ago, we introduced the practice of having a Conference of Presidents that was open to Members."
"Surely that is what is required."
"Is that so or is it not?"
"Anything else would be nonsensical."
"We do not need a plenary session."
"Mr Posselt, that is not a point of order, but rather an opinion."
"It is a very respectable opinion, but it cannot be taken into account."
"The Conference of Presidents, which is the body that schedules plenary sittings, has discussed the issue and has taken a decision."
"I appreciate that there are all sorts of different opinions in this Chamber."
"Those who wish to applaud it can do so, and those who want to reject it can reject it, but do not express your personal opinions in the form of points of order."
"The Conference of Presidents has taken account of the clash that Mr Martínez has mentioned."
"Sometimes we cannot harmonise all agendas."
"The alternative would have been to schedule a Conference of Presidents open to all Members."
"The effect would have been exactly the same, because the Members present in Vienna would still not have been able to take part."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Despite the issues that have been raised, the plenary sitting will take place on 20 June at 11 a.m."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the June part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 May 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendment has been proposed."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that no resolution on Bulgaria and Romania be voted on this week."
"Mr Brok has the floor in order to explain this request."
"– Mr President, after the Commission had presented its report for the sixteenth time, we said that we did not want a resolution in advance."
"Now, since it turns out that - according to the report - the Commission’s final proposals will be made in October at the earliest, then it is in October too, and not before then, that this House should express its opinion on the basis of this report."
"Neither in the Committees nor in most of the groups has the question been debated; since it was obviously only discussed for the first time on Thursday by the Conference of Presidents, and so to decide upon it now does not seem to me to be appropriate, given the significance of this topic."
"Parliament should attend to such a major issue with great seriousness, in order, later on, to be able to welcome both of these countries into our midst in the appropriate manner."
"I would therefore like to ask you to delete this item from the agenda."
"– Mr President, I am very surprised at the accusation that Mr Brok has laid at our door."
"We cannot just renounce a right that we have earned through struggle."
"We absolutely have to make a statement."
"I am very surprised at this change."
"Of course I must take note of it, becoming cleverer is also a good democratic right."
"However, we stand by our opinion that there should be a resolution."
"As for the result of the vote, we shall have to see."
"In any case, we believe that it certainly does make sense to state our opinion before a session of the Council, our opinion being that we are endeavouring to do everything we can to ensure that accession takes place on 1 January 2007."
"(1)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance, which, as always, exceed the time available."
"The President will try to make it possible for all of the Members to speak and, to this end, I would ask you to cooperate and not to exceed the allotted time."
"As you know, I shall give priority to those Members who have not spoken during the last two sittings."
"Mr President, last week some families were massacred as they picnicked on a beach in Gaza."
"Massacred, there is no other word for it."
"It seems that, this session there is an abundance of interesting subjects, to the point where it is not even possible to talk about this subject, let alone make it an urgent topic."
"I should like to say to you that if this was a blunder, it is of such magnitude that it deserves an independent enquiry."
"If it was not a blunder, but a deliberate act, then it is a crime that deserves to be tried by international courts."
"I want our Parliament to take it up."
"In 1987, the first intifada was started by a less serious incident."
"This time, considering the current state of tension in Palestine, it amounts to actual provocation."
"Mr President, when President Bush comes to Europe on 21 June for the EU-US Summit, I urge you to do all you can to ensure that Guantánamo is top of the agenda."
"After four years of incarceration in a legal limbo, three men detained there took their own lives over the weekend."
"The US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for described these suicides crassly and disrespectfully as a ‘good public relations move’."
"The European Union, the United Nations, human rights groups around the world, have demanded that Guantánamo be closed."
"From President Bush we need to know how and when."
"The Supreme Court in the United States will rule at the end of the month on whether military commissions are a legal way to try prisoners."
"I urge that everything the Union can do to bring pressure on President Bush be done to ensure that the camp is closed, so that people can be given proper trials if there are legitimate charges against them."
"– Allow me to take this opportunity to express my profound concern over the efforts of the new Dutch political party, the Charity, Freedom and Diversity Party, which aims as part of its programme to legalise zoophilia and paedophilia."
"I would like to join the majority of the Dutch public in their criticism of this initiative and to call on the Dutch Government, European Parliament and other relevant European institutions, including Interpol, to take the measures necessary to thwart criminal activities such as these which target children and teenagers."
"These disgusting, perverted and criminal plans, which far exceed what is natural and dignified, or even the slightest suggestion that they might be implemented, must not be tolerated and must be unequivocally criminalised."
"The human rights that we so often refer to in other circumstances are being seriously jeopardised by this type of child abuse."
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention and the attention of this House to the very worrying news that is reaching us from Iran, particularly concerning the suppression of a demonstration by women activists who have joined forces to demand recognition of their basic rights, among many other things. These rights include the elimination of polygamy, equal rights in divorce cases, equal rights for women called to testify in a court of law and, lastly, the granting of temporary employment contracts, which currently offer very unfavourable conditions for women."
"This demonstration has led to the arrest of one person and to the interrogation by the police of many other demonstrators."
"I therefore hope that you, Mr President, and this Parliament will not wish to leave these women on their own just when they are demonstrating to gain recognition for rights that are considered completely normal in any other part of the world."
"– Mr President, today we are debating whether or not the first chapter with Turkey will be closed."
"I wonder how it will be possible to avoid a crisis between the European Union and Ankara, which is obviously determined to continue its unflinching policy."
"In other words, it is demonstrating an unacceptable stand in its foreign policy, given that, on the one hand, it is talking with the European Union and, on the other hand, it is bringing down the fighter planes of a Member State, with the result that we are mourning the dead."
"Similarly, on the one hand it is closing legislation chapters with the Union while, on the other hand, it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus as a Member State, with the result that its ports and airports are closed to Cyprus."
"Finally, there remains the most important chapter of all: human rights."
"What does Turkey have to show here?"
"Almost nothing."
"Murderous attacks on courts, bombings with lives lost every week and repression of minorities."
"We therefore need to examine seriously the framework within which negotiations are being conducted with Turkey."
"We cannot give it absolution purely and simply because it is a strategic partner, for example on energy issues."
"This sort of stand suits the few and not the many citizens who expect transparency from the Union."
"Mr President, the dangers posed to traditional British liberties by the European Arrest Warrant are demonstrated by the case of my constituent, Malcolm Cubin."
"Mr Cubin is one of three divers threatened with extradition to Spain on charges of damaging Spanish heritage and stealing artefacts from a wreck."
"Mr Cubin maintains that those are trumped-up charges and that no evidence has been produced to substantiate them."
"It used to be that evidence had to be submitted to a British court before a British citizen could be extradited."
"The crime in question had to be recognised as such and a proper legal system had to be recognised in the country requesting extradition."
"All those safeguards are now gone and, providing the extradition form has been filled out correctly, a British citizen can be shipped off with as little ceremony as posting a parcel."
"The British Government should refuse to allow Mr Cubin and his colleagues to be extradited until proper evidence has been produced and it is satisfied there will be a fair hearing."
"Mr President, Poland is one of the EU’s main producers of frozen strawberries."
"Since 2004 the financial situation of producers has been deteriorating, and a proposal has been made for anti-dumping measures to be taken against suppliers from third countries."
"The report of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of May 2005 on simplifying the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables mentioned among other things the advisability of fast-track procedures for fruit."
"Last year a proposal to take protective measures with regard to the strawberry market was made, but no decision has been forthcoming."
"Tens of thousands of producers have started to grow strawberries in expectation of the decision."
"This production will be expensive because of the low temperatures and flooding in many fields this year, while the lack of protection for the market will lead to mass bankruptcies among growers."
"Bureaucratic processes may be all very well in situations of stable production, but not in a competitive global market, where important decisions often need to be taken quickly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 14 June this week is the 65th anniversary of a brutal criminal act and the most unimaginable violation of human rights in Europe."
"In Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania over 30 000 completely innocent children, old people, women and men were treacherously herded into cattle trucks to be deported to the Siberian death camps."
"I am proud of the Latvian people, which pulled through the painful years of occupation and always did everything they could to enable us to be proud of how we live today."
"I do not want Europe’s sympathy; what I want is for European society to understand the misery caused by Soviet totalitarian Communism to Latvia and to Europe as a whole."
"On 14 June, I and my colleagues Mr Kelam and Mr Landsbergis are presenting to the European Parliament a memorial plaque in memory of the victims of Soviet totalitarian Communism, dedicated to the 65th anniversary of the 1941 mass deportations in the Baltic States."
"You are all most welcome to attend at this time of commemoration at 4 p.m. on Wednesday."
"Mr Borrell, Parliament’s President, has also been officially invited to honour the deportees and to receive the plaque in their memory."
"– Last week, eastern Slovakia was hit by dangerous flooding in several river basins."
"Floods such as these have become extremely common over the past few years – flash floods caused by heavy rain in a particular area."
"The European Union is seeking to help deal with the aftermath of floods and other disasters through allocations from the Solidarity Fund; however, a limit has been imposed of approximately 0.6% of the affected country’s GDP or at EUR 3 billion, which in many instances is an excessive amount, despite the extensive losses."
"I would be very much in favour of revising this limit downwards."
"Floods are natural phenomena that need to be anticipated and the effects prevented."
"I am pleased that in this session we are going to debate a flood assessment and management report shedding new light on how the implications of this global phenomenon ought to be tackled, especially with regard to prevention."
"Mr President, the 1945 Potsdam Conference decided the expatriation of the ethnic German population living in the territory of Hungary, Poland and the former Czechoslovakia."
"Starting from 19 January 1946, 135 000 Germans had to leave Hungary – all of those who had stated in 1939 that their mother tongue was German."
"Almost half of them came from my constituency, and had to leave their home at the end of May and the beginning of June 1946."
"Sixty years later, we are now remembering these forced expatriations in soul-stirring and touching commemorative events held in various locations."
"I would now like to pass on the central message given during these commemorations."
"Today, our most important task is to guarantee that events like those that took place sixty years ago will never happen again."
"One of the greatest human and political accomplishments of 21st-century Europe has been the creation of a common area of freedom and peace, where forced expatriations have been replaced by the free movement of people."
"The most important result is peace between European Union Member States, which forms the basis of all further results."
"Forced prostitution is a serious problem for Europe."
"I am disturbed by the article that appeared in the 8 July edition of the German magazine ‘Der Spiegel’."
"Although the article recognised the violence and criminality of the environment surrounding prostitution, it made allegations about which I would like to hear a clear response from Commissioner Frattini, German Minister of Justice Zypries and Europol."
"The article presented biased claims that an estimated 40 000 prostitutes from Eastern Europe have been brought to Germany cannot be confirmed."
"Moreover, the tone of the article cast doubt on the fact that the World Cup has led to an increase in forced prostitution in Germany."
"A Europol investigation, data from the European Council and the temporary brothel towns shown on German television can leave no doubt in anyone’s mind that a problem exists."
"I encourage Commissioner Frattini to treat with the utmost seriousness the promise he made last Thursday – to ensure that a thorough overview of forced prostitution during the Football World Cup is prepared."
"I therefore await precise information and if necessary the refuting of baseless claims."
"– Mr President, a month ago I attended a three-nation meeting on the subject of the waters of the River Evros."
"It was attended by Greeks, Bulgarians and Turks."
"With pride I told them that the European Union is sensitive to environmental issues, unlike large countries such as the USA, China, India and so on."
"A Turkish parliamentarian took the floor and pointed out that the Danube is the main cause of the contamination of the Black Sea, together with other rivers that empty into it."
"It also appears, apart from the Black Sea, in the Sea of Marmara and even reaches as far as the Aegean."
"Having studied the matter, I have to say, first of all, that the Danube is a river which passes through a great many countries in the European Union and many non-Community countries, as well as two countries, Bulgaria and Romania, which are going to accede."
"In times gone by it was a means of communication which played an important role in transport, trade, agriculture and fisheries; however, with the passage of time, industrial and urban waste is continuously killing this river."
"What must we do with the Danube and with other rivers of the European Union in order to revive them?"
"– Mr President, 2006 is the European Year of Workers' Mobility."
"Within the framework of the success of the Lisbon Strategy, the actions programmed aim to change the attitude of Europeans to the possibility of living in the European Union and looking on it as a single market, of trying to acquire the means that give them the right to move from one job to another and from one Member State to another for a specific period of time or for more permanent establishment."
"Why, however, have the measures programmed since 2000 been of limited success?"
"The policies of the Member States do not converge in promoting quality education."
"European citizens are not being told that 45% of future jobs will go to university graduates, 40% will go to people who have completed secondary school and that only 15% of jobs will go to people who have completed compulsory education and that this compulsory education does not reduce the percentage of those who abandon it."
"Adults are not participating satisfactorily in lifelong learning programmes."
"Only those who work illegally have achieved mobility."
"For the rest it is a utopia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the energy conflict between Ukraine and Russia at the beginning of this year, we began discussions on a common EU energy policy."
"The three most important bulwarks of the future policy have been named: a common energy market, diversification of energy resources and climate change policy."
"A common energy market will guarantee the security of energy supply, competitive prices and accessibility for consumers."
"What is the real situation though?"
"In striving to create a common market, the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas, which advises the European Commission, has decided to establish four regional energy market projects: North-East, North, South and South-East."
"Not one of these includes the four Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland."
"Will we, the four states, be forced to establish a separate natural gas market?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, how can we talk of Europe, its enlargement and solidarity?"
"Does such a Europe have a secure future and opportunities to compete in a global economy?"
"– Mr President, when I recently heard the Austrian Chancellor Mr Schüssel rightly say that one day all Member States of the European Union would vote on the European Constitution, the saying ‘better late than never’ came to mind."
"I am hoping that what he meant were referendums, rather than voting by national parliaments."
"I would note that in this House there are a number of Members who have been saying right from the start, or in other words for two years, that these referendums should be held on the same day."
"Unfortunately, where accepting the Constitution is concerned, there can be no doubt that the visit to Poland of Commissioner Wallström, who is present in the Chamber today, has not helped, as she reiterated that she is unable to imagine a situation where the preamble to the Constitution would mention Christian values."
"In my view compromise, which is the whole idea of the European Union, is not a word in the Commissioner’s vocabulary."
"Mr President, over the past weeks, the European Commission ordered on-site inspections at several significant energy companies."
"The aim of these inspections is to ascertain the implementation of competition principles on the European gas and energy market."
"There are two main reasons for publishing the results of the inspections as soon as possible."
"Firstly, ensuring undistorted competition on the energy market is vital for the future competitiveness of the European processing industry and the welfare of European households."
"Secondly, in parallel with the action taken by the Commission, a debate was started here in Parliament about the possible creation of a single European energy policy, and the findings of the inspections seem to be indispensable to this work."
"Therefore, using this forum, as well, I ask the Commission to inform Parliament and the public of the findings, as soon as possible after the completion of the inspections."
"Mr President, when a bad atmosphere exists in the Union, closer attention should be paid to the sort of image it is presenting of itself in the Member States."
"Last autumn the European Union brought an action against Finland concerning the hunting of wolves."
"The Commission claims that the wolf is not protected effectively enough in Finland, even though the number of wolves has almost trebled in 10 years."
"At the start of the year, Finland announced a wolf management plan, but the case continues."
"The European Union is more unpopular than ever in Finland and news like this tends to lay the subject of integration open to ridicule."
"Directives must be complied with, but it is not forbidden to use our brains."
"There are certain matters which it is easier to assess locally, and the hunting of wolves is one of them."
"– Mr President, I shall take advantage of the presence of the vice-presidents of the Commission, Mrs Wallström and Mr Frattini, to raise the subject of youth criminality in the European Union, youth criminality that is presenting a worryingly upward trend."
"Of course, the words of psychologists, sociologists and economists are contributing to the development of the criminal instincts of young people. The reproduction of scenes of violence through audiovisual broadcasts, especially via interactive electronic games, also contributes."
"I believe that we have a duty to promote an established and effective strategy for preventing and combating the phenomenon of youth criminality."
"We have a duty to combine individual sectoral actions into a systematic organised policy, a policy that will incorporate the systematic promotion of mental and social health at school in cooperation with parents and the school community, with the specific objective of developing programmes to control youth violence."
"Mr President, last week Poland saw a great many peaceful demonstrations supporting freedom of opinion, the rights of minorities and tolerance."
"The participants were of different age groups and genders and held different views."
"This is proof that Polish society is a mature civil society and that it cherishes the fundamental values of the European Union such as freedom, democracy, freedom of opinion and equality."
"I would like to thank all fellow Members who supported these initiatives and measures."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Schulz, who took part in the conference ‘Poland in the European Union: the Left-Wing Alternative’."
"In particular, I would like to support his proposal that you, Mr President, invite the Polish President Lech Kaczyński to this House to tell us about his vision of the European Union and about respect for European values in Poland."
"Mr President, the current round of WTO negotiations is witnessing a steady erosion of the EU policy that has always been committed to ensuring food security for EU citizens."
"Concurrently, there is the stringent and indeed very necessary requirement for EU-produced food to meet exceptionally high standards."
"When the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU was established, part of its mission statement was to contribute towards the maintenance of confidence in the safety of food offered to the EU consumer."
"A recent study conducted in Brazil by the Irish Farmers’ Association revealed totally inadequate foot and mouth disease controls, nonexistent traceability, widespread environmental degradation and social exploitation."
"Why, in view of those facts and the fact that the United States, Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand do not accept fresh beef imports from Brazil, do the EU and the Food and Veterinary Office continue to approve such imports?"
"We need to ensure food security for EU citizens and we need the assurance of quality and traceability of imports, consistent with the standards required of EU producers."
"Mr President, two weeks ago, the police in Sweden carried out a fifty-man raid in order to shut down a website that facilitated file-sharing."
"A large number of servers were confiscated in a string of different companies that had nothing to do with the activity in question, and operations in these small businesses were shut down."
"In addition, a number of people were forced to give DNA samples on the grounds of being suspected of committing what is a very minor crime."
"Even more serious is the fact that a political opponent of the music industry – and it was the music industry that had forced this raid to occur – had his website taken offline in the middle of our election campaign and was thus unable fully to participate in the open debate by advocating a liberal form of legislation in respect of file-sharing for private use where there is no intent to make a profit."
"In the past, the music industry has always attempted to put a stop to every technical development, such as cassettes, digital music players and writable CDs."
"It has always been wrong – all of these new inventions have always led to increased sales."
"It is therefore regrettable if the police are assisting in stifling the debate."
"– Following reports of illegal acts carried out against Portuguese workers in several European Union Member States, I went with other Members of the European Parliament to Arendonk in Belgium, near the Dutch border, on 4 June, to a meeting with Portuguese people working in those two countries."
"They told us about a number of problems and cases of discrimination, specifically by agencies providing temporary and seasonal work, especially in the flower greenhouses in the Netherlands and in farming, including strawberry-picking, in Belgium."
"I ask you, Mr President, once again to call on the Commission and the governments of the two Member States to provide the necessary checks and controls to guarantee equal rights and compliance with legislation, particularly the directives on worker information and registration, and to fight any kind of discrimination, such as that which continues to occur against Portuguese workers in several European Union Member States."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a recent meeting with the President, Mr Borrell Fontelles, and the Secretary General, Mr Priestley, we agreed, as did many in this House, that elimination of the obstacles and prejudices which result in the exclusion of and discrimination against people with disabilities is being achieved by managing dissimilarities."
"In 2003, an accessibility control was carried out at the European Parliament."
"We can broaden the progress achieved during the application of the conclusions of that control."
"Let us also use and support the employee code and the code of good practice for the employment of people with disabilities."
"Let us support from the point of view of time and infrastructures the voluntary team of workers at the European Parliament which deals with disabilities."
"More importantly, however, as regards the objectives we have set for the employment of people with disabilities, we need to ask for numbers and answer these questions:"
"- how many people with disabilities are working in the services of the European Parliament?"
"- what percentage of the total number of workers does this number represent?"
"We also need to support the European Parliament in its efforts to comply with its obligations as an employer under the principle of equal opportunities."
"I call on you to play a leading role."
"Mr President, a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats called into question the democratic guarantees for a fair trial in Spain."
"On the contrary, I believe that Spain should be seen as a model in terms of the defence of the rights of defendants, and that is something that cannot be said of certain other countries."
"Specifically, as Mr Watson has said, we are very concerned about what is happening in Guantánamo, and I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the fact that Mr Emilio González, President Bush’s spokesman on immigration and citizenship, stated, in my city, Oviedo, of which I have been mayor, that Guantánamo is a model in terms of human rights; that is something that we cannot tolerate and I believe that the European Union cannot look the other way, as a previous generation did in the case of the holocaust."
"Mr President, every summer forest fires bring devastation to the environment and tragedy to our citizens."
"This is especially so in the southern Member States where high temperatures, strong winds and inaccessible terrain make fire-fighting extremely difficult."
"Prevention is, undoubtedly, of the utmost importance."
"In Cyprus, hundreds of forest fires occur every summer."
"Many are caused when overhead cables come into contact along power lines which cross forests."
"Last week I witnessed the outbreak of such a fire in my home region."
"This could easily be prevented simply by having overhead cables rubber coated, and yet such a simple and relatively inexpensive measure is not universally applied in many forest areas of southern Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you bring this matter to the attention of the Commission, and request that before the summer recess a statement be made in relation to the implementation of forest fire prevention measures in the Member States."
"Mr President, I should like to bring to the attention of the House that a second poultry processing industry has closed down in my constituency in the last two weeks, with the loss of 300 to 400 jobs."
"That comes after a loss of 600 jobs in a small place like Northern Ireland."
"When I enquired about the reason for this, I was told in no uncertain terms that it was mainly because of cheap imports from Thailand and Brazil."
"We have serious questions to ask ourselves in Europe."
"I believe very strongly that there must be strict standards for food and how chickens are produced."
"Europe cannot and must not stand by and allow our producers to be forced out of the market."
"We need clear labelling to show where food is produced."
"We must give the consumer the choice."
"Let us at least give our farmers, our producers, half a chance to solve this problem."
"– Mr President, huge deposits of gold, silver and copper are thought to exist beneath various glaciers on the border between Chile and Argentina."
"Unemployment in the surrounding region is very high, and the people live almost exclusively from farming."
"Several firms are now proceeding to mine these mineral resources in a way that gives great cause for concern."
"Substances containing arsenic are being used, and some glaciers are to be partly removed and rebuilt in new locations, which I find very hard to envisage."
"Environmental agencies fear harmful effects – especially due to arsenic – on the Huasco valley, in which 70 000 smallholders cultivate crops using irrigation."
"Environmental groups and the inhabitants of the region have protested against this, but the Chilean Government’s regrettable response to them has been to give the go-ahead for the mining to commence."
"In doing so, it knowingly accepts that the ecological balance of the region will be destroyed."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to give its attention to this problematic project and to submit proposals as to how its abandonment might be brought about."
"Mr President, in the report of 7 June by Dick Marty of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, it says among other things that in Poland there were secret prisons in which alleged terrorists were held on the orders of the CIA."
"The author of the report, however, does not give any evidence to support this."
"Poland is attacked as a committed ally of the United States, and indirectly for its adherence to traditional values and opposition to European uniformity."
"The aim of basing these accusations on premises rather than evidence is to discredit Poland in the international arena."
"Senator Marty spoke before Parliament’s Temporary Committee and yet the Committee’s draft report makes no mention of Poland, and its activity to date has not brought any new facts into the investigation."
"Mr President, I rise to make a plea on behalf of one of my constituents in the Shetland Isles in Scotland, against the inhumane actions of the United Kingdom Government."
"Sakchai Makow is a new Scot and a new Shetlander."
"He is originally from Thailand but grew up in the Shetlands."
"He speaks little Thai and has no friends or family left in Thailand."
"In 2004 he committed the serious crime of wilful fire-raising."
"He went to jail, served his time, repaid his debt to society and was welcomed back into the Shetland community with open arms."
"Following a dawn raid, in which he was snatched from his home in Shetland, he is now in a high-security English jail under threat of deportation."
"This is largely because the United Kingdom Home Office is making a poorly-advised bid to crack down on alleged illegal immigrants with criminal records, mainly in order to look tough for the tabloid media, based in South-East England."
"I consider that Sakchai Makow’s human rights have been infringed solely to play to an agenda which is unhealthy, undemocratic and, dare I say it, un-European."
"I will be raising these breaches of human rights with the EU authorities and hope that you, Mr President, as a friend of Scotland and of human rights, will support us."
"Sakchai is a new Scot and a new Shetlander."
"A London-based minister should not be able to throw him out of the country just to look tough."
"Mr President, I would like, with the approval of the members of all political groups from my constituency, Wielkopolska, to remind you that this month is the 50th anniversary of the Poznan workers’ uprising against the totalitarian regime that ruled the country at that time."
"The uprising was violently suppressed at the cost of almost 100 lives."
"This happened in June 1956."
"This uprising by the workers of Poznan may not have marked the end of the totalitarian regime, or even the beginning of the end. It was, however, the end of the beginning of the totalitarian regimes in Central and Eastern Europe."
"I would like today to remember these events and to pay homage to those who took part in them, and in particular to those who died in them."
"Mr President, as the last speaker, may I take the opportunity to use my minute to pay tribute to you for the way you organise the one-minute speeches, in the sense that you try to bring in as many Members as possible and those who have not spoken recently."
"However, your efforts are slightly undermined by the large number of people who put down their names to speak and then fail to turn up."
"Perhaps you could ask the relevant parliamentary committee to look into this, to look at the Rules of Procedure and perhaps draw an analogy with Question Time – when a Member does not turn up for Question Time, he or she loses the right to table another question for a certain period."
"Perhaps that would encourage more discipline."
"Perhaps, too, we might actually put this item on Parliament’s agenda."
"People in the gallery, or people watching us on the web-streaming, must be very puzzled as to what we are doing at the moment, because it is not on the agenda."
"They must wonder which debate we are actually on. Perhaps that should be rectified and this item put where it belongs: on the agenda."
"Thank you very much, Mr Corbett."
"I believe that you have made some very good suggestions."
"We shall try to apply them, because they seem to make very good sense, as always."
"I am sorry that I cannot carry on giving the floor to certain Members who have spoken during previous sittings, but we cannot keep the Commissioners waiting any longer."
"– The next item is the report by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year March 2004 – December 2005 [2005/2135(INI)] (A6-0178/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, when I was made first vice-chairman of the Petitions Committee, colleagues said to me that it would be rather like being the gate-keeper of a cemetery: I would see a lot going in, but not much coming out."
"I am pleased to report, especially during last year’s activities, that we have seen a lot going in and a great deal more coming out."
"A cemetery it certainly is not; it is alive and kicking and due to get livelier."
"It is probably one of the most important committees in the House."
"Some would say that, as first vice-chairman, I say that; but I honestly believe it to be true."
"It is the direct interface between the institution and the citizens – citizens often seeking redress for problems that arise at Member State level."
"I am also pleased to say that we work in close conjunction with the Commission."
"We are a solution-based committee."
"People bring us problems and we try to work quickly and effectively."
"At Member State level, the importance of the committee representing Parliament is not always recognised."
"One of my recommendations would certainly be for greater attendance by Member State representatives when we are dealing with issues that are germane to them."
"The report is a lengthy one and that is primarily due to the fact that we have enlargement; there has been greater engagement with this committee."
"The petitions process and the work of the committee have played an influential role in bringing pressure to bear on Member States to ensure that EU laws are satisfactorily transposed and implemented."
"Importantly, it also highlights the plight of EU citizens whose rights are diminished."
"The introduction of the e-petitions system has proved a useful tool for Members, assistants and group staff and allows us all to keep an eye on developments on ongoing petitions."
"I mention some key points in my report."
"Without going into too much detail I should like to highlight just two areas where the committee has managed to be influential, although not totally so."
"The cases in point are the so-called ‘Valencian Land Grab Law’ (LRAU), Ms Fourtou’s report, which we adopted in December 2005; and one of my reports on the confiscation of cars by the Greek authorities, which we adopted earlier this year."
"Those examples are good illustrations to show the best and the worst of the system."
"Yes, we have brought about resolution in some of the cases with the Greek confiscation of the cars, but I have to say that, sadly, the situation in Valencia is still grave, and requires further monitoring."
"I make several recommendations in my report, including increasing the membership of the committee to approximately the same membership as other committees; and speeding up our processes in the way in which we work with the Commission to ensure close cooperation and effective working methods."
"I want to pay particular tribute to the Commission staff, who often come to the committee, wait for a long time and then sincerely and effectively deal with the issues before them."
"We cannot thank them enough."
"The work of the Commission staff is not always fully recognised."
"I feel it is important that we have clear rules, however, on the admissibility of petitions, especially for the future, in order to ensure that all citizens can have recourse to the petitions process but that the system is not abused."
"I have tabled only one plenary amendment to the report, on behalf of the Socialist Group, which underlines that in principle the petitions process is aimed at European citizens and reinforces the view that in principle the petitions process should be a service that is targeted at EU citizens who do not have other means of recourse to action by the European Parliament."
"MEPs, as citizens, can avail themselves of that right, but nonetheless they have other parliamentary processes at their disposal."
"I hope that other groups can support the aim of this amendment."
"I should also like to pay tribute to the Petitions Committee secretariat and their tireless support for the Members’ work and our work."
"As with other committee secretariats which I have worked with, the Petitions Committee secretariat provides high-quality assistance to us all."
"To put it simply, we would not be able to do the work without them."
"So I should like to finish by once again paying tribute to all members of the secretariat."
"I look forward to hearing the comments of the House."
"I should also like to thank the chairman of my committee, Mr Libicki, for all his work and the support that he gives me and others."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for a clear and useful report."
"His story about the cemetery keeper reminds me of a university rector who compared his job to being a cemetery keeper."
"He said: ‘I have a lot of people under me and nobody listening.’"
"The petitions offer a kaleidoscopic view of the concerns of many citizens today."
"They cover a wide range of policy areas, they cover practically all the Member States and they cover a broad cross-section of civil society, from the individual citizen right up to the multinational NGOs."
"Your rapporteur is right to underline the importance of all the work represented by the thousand or more petitions you receive every year."
"There is no doubt that the Committee on Petitions offers citizens an important conduit for their feedback on European acts and policies."
"It thus contributes to a strengthening of democratic control over Community legislation and its implementation at EU, national, regional and local level."
"I should like to pick up on three aspects in the report and resolution."
"The rapporteur was very kind and forthcoming towards the Commission, so I do not want to raise any conflicts here."
"Much is made in the report of the coexistence of the petitions procedure on the one hand and, on the other hand, the Commission’s complaints procedures, sometimes leading to infringement proceedings."
"Where there is coexistence, or even overlap, it is natural to make comparisons."
"I think that we should avoid getting into a discussion about the relative merits of petitions and complaints procedures."
"Each procedure has its own legal basis and its own specificity and I believe that each of our institutions does well to preserve that, while respecting the needs of the other."
"In simple language, both procedures ultimately serve to ensure that EU law is applied to the benefit of the citizens."
"However, infringements are about the Commission and the Member State."
"The petitions procedure concerns the individual and their parliament."
"So each procedure is different in nature."
"That is not to say that we will not continue to strive for even better cooperation: the Commission remains, as always, at the disposal of the committee."
"That brings me to the second point."
"As you know, the Commission has already agreed to devote more attention to petitions concerning infringement proceedings in its annual report on the application of Community law."
"It is, furthermore, important to remember that the amount of information given to the Committee on Petitions already exceeds that which is required by our interinstitutional agreement."
"This is important for transparency."
"The motion for a resolution argues that the Commission does not act with sufficient speed and vigour in some cases where a petition and an infringement procedure are running in parallel."
"It therefore suggests that these procedures need to be better coordinated."
"Let me just say one thing about that."
"It is only natural that the petitioner with a grievance may be in need of urgent redress, but let us remember that the ideal timescale of the individual petition will almost inevitably be shorter than the timescale of an infringement proceeding, which by definition takes a certain amount of time."
"We have, amongst other things, a duty of collaboration with the Member States, which necessarily implies a multi-stage process."
"Let us avoid raising unrealistic hopes in cases of overlapping."
"For the individual citizen, the successful outcome of an infringement procedure is not necessarily and automatically the ultimate and only thing to aim for."
"A successful outcome to an infringement procedure might not even directly entail the precise redress that the petitioner is seeking."
"We have several examples of that."
"The petitions procedure and the infringement procedure have different and distinct objectives, functions and roles."
"Thus the efficiency of the Commission’s complaints process cannot be formally linked to petitions."
"Instead, let each of us, the Commission and Parliament, aim to ensure that our respective procedures – petitions and infringements – are fit for their respective purposes and let us continue our fruitful cooperation and strengthen that as much as possible."
"I shall refrain from commenting on some other details relating to processes and procedures."
"Let me conclude by signalling my openness to the general message of this report: that petitions are important for democracy and for citizens."
"The Commission is prepared to do as much as possible to improve our cooperation."
"– Mr President, I congratulate my honourable friend Mr Cashman on the report which he is presenting to the European Parliament, because the exercise of the right to petition by European citizens must be considered a basic means of strengthening awareness of European nationality."
"The Commissioner presented in great detail the views of the European Commission for the part of the report which concerns the Commission."
"It is true that European citizens use both charges to the Commission – as the Commission's 22nd report on the control of the application of Community law shows – and petitions to the European Parliament as a means of strengthening their wish to see Community law applied."
"On the one hand, we wish European citizens to be conscientious judges of the common ; on the other hand, however, we do not give them the possibility of having the same treatment both from the Commission and from Parliament's Committee on Petitions given that, as is clearly understandable from Mr Cashman's report, their officially elected representatives cannot check petitions from the first stage."
"Transparency is also missing in the decisions of the European Commission, the presence of the Council is missing and we support the view expressed in the report that the method and procedure for receiving and examining petitions need to be changed, so that European citizens feel that their petition really is being examined without party political or other criteria by a secretariat which remains neutral and does not interfere in the work of the MEPs."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome Mr Cashman’s report, which is as good as we expected it would be."
"The European Union is facing a malaise in citizens’ confidence."
"The strongest message was the rejection of the Constitution a year ago."
"The message that citizens are sending is clear."
"They demand more transparency and more openness from us."
"They want politicians and institutions to show more interest in problems that affect citizens personally."
"It is clear that various consultation exercises that have been undertaken at European level have had some effect: we are hearing the message now, but we should also listen."
"In order to do that, more resources must be provided for the various bodies that have the most direct contact with citizens and, without excluding any other body, personally I would start with the Committee on Petitions."
"As Mr Cashman’s report makes clear, the role of that committee is very significant in bringing citizens’ concerns and problems to the attention of European institutions."
"But as well as Parliament providing more resources for the Committee on Petitions, other institutions, especially the Commission, must provide more resources for reducing delays in responding to citizens."
"I therefore particularly support paragraphs 20 to 23 of the report and I hope that there can be a debate in all the political groups, as well as in the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, on how to reinforce our work to assist citizens."
"Parliament should give that high priority during the second half of the parliamentary term."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman on his extensive and tough report."
"I would also like to welcome the supportive and reinforcing manner in which he addresses some of the items we have already addressed in the report on the monitoring of Community law."
"It is quite clear that petitions reveal a lot of feedback from our citizens, and there are two themes I would like to pick out from the report."
"One is better quality and more citizen-inspired legislation, and the second is better redress mechanisms."
"There is a common thread running through both of these, and that is the need for more information at national level: information about EU law and policy, information about how to enforce it, about how to access justice."
"Too often on the committee we see citizens who have been ping-ponged back and forth between various institutions and ombudsman’s courts, not knowing which way to turn."
"We have to bring an end to this."
"Then the other item: clearer citizen-inspired legislation."
"A few weeks ago we in this Parliament supported an idea of having citizens’ summaries at the beginning of each piece of European legislation."
"Last week some of us were in Helsinki for meetings with the Finnish Justice Ministry."
"Finland already uses citizens’ summaries or executive summaries."
"Their guide on this says that every bill should outline the objective of the proposed legislation."
"Its main contents should be drafted in plain language, avoiding legal terms, avoiding professional jargon, avoiding references to other legislation, and no more than one page in length."
"If our legislation were properly addressed to our citizens in this way, in plain language, well, we might have rather fewer petitions!"
"."
"Mr President, I do not always praise reports when I take the floor, because often there is nothing praiseworthy about them."
"However I take my hat off with the greatest respect to Mr Cashman’s report, and wish that all reports presented to the House could be like this."
"It is clear, precise and says what we demand and what we expect."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, as well as thanking the rapporteur I would like additionally to thank the Vice-Chairmen of our committee, as well as the very active members of the committee who are currently present in the Chamber, for their great efforts in carrying out their tasks."
"I would of course also like to join the expressions of gratitude to the secretariat, which does such a good job of preparing our work."
"Mr President, our committee was set up in order to bring the European institutions closer to ordinary citizens, and this is something it is doing."
"That is also why our work reflects all those problems that most affect the daily lives of citizens of the European Union, for example the environment, land planning, which is a problem to which reference has already been made, professional qualifications, insurance and a whole range of issues relating to the dishonesty of insurance companies."
"Mr President, the work of our committee also reflects fundamental principles of the European Union such as democracy and freedom of speech."
"I would like here in particular to underline what Mr Cashman said in points 18 and 22, and ask the European Commission to appoint a high-ranking official to work with us."
"This is extremely important."
"We work very well with the European Commission, of that there is no doubt, but it would be helpful to have a high-ranking official to collaborate with us and to observe our activities on a daily basis."
"Another point which Mr Cashman mentioned in his report, and one which I would like to emphasise strongly, is that our committee is very important for the very reason that it works directly with ordinary citizens."
"The number of its members should be increased, as Mr Cashman has already said."
"Mr President, when trying to convince their electorate of the importance of the role of Parliament, many MEPs must have heard the resigned reply: ‘Brussels is too far from here!’."
"Unfortunately, this opinion is also reflected in the statistics that show decreasing vote participation rates in EP elections, cycle after cycle."
"‘Brussels is too far from here!’ I also heard these words from forty Hungarian fire-fighters, who came all the way to Brussels about one year ago, travelling by coach for three days, to submit their petition in person, in the Parliament building."
"Brussels was far for them, too, but only geographically."
"They spoke with confidence, hoping that their petition concerning the regulation of their working hours would be successful."
"Their petition was among the first petitions received from new Member States."
"However, the report tabled before us shows that the number of such petitions is very low, which leads to the conclusion that further efforts are required to inform citizens of new Member States."
"Still, we are not aiming to increase the number of petitions just for the sake of it."
"Our aim is to ensure that the right of petition is embedded in European consciousness, both in old and new Member States."
"The Cashman report correctly points out that this would be useful to the operation of the European Union, because petitions constitute a valuable source of information on the implementation of European laws, bringing to light the deficiencies of the enforcement process, as seen by the everyday European citizen."
"The practice of the past eighteen months also indicates that there have been numerous petitions in the area of environmental protection, social security or even the internal market, which may be of assistance in perfecting certain European Union directives."
"In the hope that this process will continue, I thank Mr Cashman for his work, and naturally, I support the adoption of the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman on his report and I support the recommendations that he is proposing in order to increase the efficiency of our Committee on Petitions."
"I would like to add a couple of comments."
"Firstly, I regret that many Members of this House are unaware of the work done by our Committee on Petitions, only taking notice of it on the odd occasion when it is dealing with a complaint involving their region."
"Its work, however, is a fundamental mechanism in relations between Parliament and the citizens."
"The confidence of the citizens, not just in this House and in their representatives here, but in the European Union in general, often depends on the efficiency of that mechanism."
"That is why I am calling upon the Members of this Parliament to take more interest in our Committee on Petitions, since it is theirs."
"My second observation is also about seeking greater efficiency, in this case in order to prevent what I believe to be a misuse of that Committee."
"This is the main platform available to European citizens and citizens’ associations for communicating their complaints regarding alleged infringements of Community legislation to Parliament."
"Members, on the other hand, are provided by this House's Rules of Procedure with various ways to act in such cases."
"It therefore seems to me to be anomalous that Members of this Parliament can register complaints that are then dealt with in the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions."
"I do not question our right as citizens to address complaints to Parliament, but the practice seems to me to be politically incorrect and is sometimes used for the purposes of agitation."
"It seems to me to be ethically unacceptable for Members to register a petition and then to pass judgment on it themselves in the Committee on Petitions."
"Furthermore, this situation seems dubious on a legal level."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are therefore presenting an amendment which I hope the House will support and which recommends that Members leave it to citizens to initiate such procedures, while we ourselves go through other channels provided for in the Rules of Procedure."
"I shall end by congratulating the Members working in the Bureau of the Committee on Petitions and the excellent officials working for Parliament and for the political groups who, on a daily basis, make it possible for us to make progress with our work."
"Over many months I have witnessed the work they have done during the extremely long procedure, which fortunately is now resolved, to allow the Don Quijote airport project in my province of Ciudad Real, in Spain, to go ahead."
"Furthermore, from my involvement in that debate, I was able to see the Committee on Petitions operating efficiently to ensure that the work of our Parliament contributed to things being done properly."
"– Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Martínez was referring to Baroness Ludford, who was making a proposal like that the other day."
"I would like to thank Mr Cashman for the work he has done, but, with the greatest of respect for that work, I must say that our delegation entirely disagrees with what appears in the explanatory statement, because, although the motion for a resolution makes no direct reference to the Valencian Community, you have decided to have a dig at it."
"Since it has been mentioned, I shall tell you what the situation is: the Valencian Community is a model of ordered and coherent growth and a model of sustainable development, despite the negative image of a region destroying its territory that both the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the government of Mr Rodríguez Zapatero are trying to communicate to the institutions of the European Union and to Spanish society."
"Neither must we forget the smear campaign being carried out by Spanish public television, giving biased and partial information about urban development in the Valencian Community."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, yes."
"The Valencian Community has some of Europe’s most advanced legislation in the field of town planning and protection of the natural environment, and evidence of this is the fact that the Valencian Community has 19 natural parks, 31 municipal protected sites and 4 protected areas."
"Furthermore, the territory protected by the during this term in office exceeds the area of the territory reclassified for building by 2 500% – you heard me right, 2 500% – demonstrating that the Valencian Government promotes the protection of the natural and urban environment and that its town-planning is sustainable and of high quality."
"In fact, the area of protected natural spaces in the Valencian Community is nine times greater than it was eight years ago, since in 1995 the area protected amounted to 3%, while it currently exceeds 29%."
"The Valencian Community is therefore seventeen points above the European average in terms of area protected."
"That Community has more protected area than countries such as Denmark, Greece, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden, and I shall not bore you with the percentages for each country."
"We must therefore remember that the Valencian Government of the People’s Party modernised the LRAU, approved by the Socialist Government in the Generalitat, thereby completing the Valencian town and land-planning legislation, in accordance with Community legislation and taking on board the recommendations of the European Parliament and the European Commission at all times."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one year after the 'no' of the French and Dutch to the Constitutional Treaty, we are going though a period of confusion as to how we can bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"However, Europe means precisely its citizens; it means precisely its institutions."
"For its citizens, Europe means the institutions, except that the institutions often give the impression that they are working a long way from the world."
"If the Union is defending the rights of its citizens, this must be perceptible in their everyday life."
"The right to petition is one of the most important means for everyone to feel active within the European construct."
"The right to petition is one of the most important tools in highlighting a social and people-orientated Europe."
"The establishment of our committee and the European Ombudsman are steps which were made because we have recognised our imperfections and weaknesses."
"We must make more use of these facilities for communication with the citizens."
"Our rapporteur quite rightly calls for the Committee on Petitions to be strengthened both at the level of the secretariat and at the level of political staff."
"Indeed, we must inform the citizens better of our existence and, in all events, the Commission and the Council or the Member States must stop fearing further cooperation with us."
"They should know that highlighting problems by resolving them creates credibility. In other words, it creates citizens who are gradually won over to the European idea, all those who are against transparency or who do not want Europe or who are eurosceptics."
"Congratulations Michael."
"– Mr President, I simply wished to say to Mr Iturgaiz that we are not here to hold a Spanish debate on national or regional television stations and that we have 15 000 petitions from citizens from all parts of Europe."
"I would, however, like to focus on Mr Cashman's report and congratulate him warmly on it and on his many intelligent conclusions."
"I would also like to join him in thanking our administrators and the secretariat of the Commission and I entirely support his call for more resources, for greater representation of the Committee on Petitions in Parliament – since there are Members who wish to take part in it but who cannot do so because of its limited number of members – and an improvement in the cooperation with the Commission."
"I would like to raise three questions or concerns that have occurred to me as a result of the immense vivacity and liveliness of the debate in this Committee, which is fascinating."
"Firstly, perhaps the need from now on to analyse how admissibility can move on from the purely bureaucratic to the political field, as happens in other institutions, such as the Council of Europe."
"Secondly, I would also like to say that the time periods involved and the Commission’s unacceptable delays in telling us its opinion and, above all, in making decisions, sometimes lead to considerable losses."
"I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Wallström for her willingness to improve this situation in the future and to prevent delays."
"In some cases these delays have given me the impression that, when it comes to communicating their decisions, other institutions, such as the Commission and even the Ombudsman, rather than cooperating, have used the members of the Committee on Petitions."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo has repeated tonight in this House the claim made by a former minister of the Valencian Government – namely that I am waging a campaign with others against the Valencian Government without any evidence."
"I must say at once and with all due seriousness that I take these allegations, which are aimed at undermining my integrity and reputation, very seriously indeed."
"I will defend my reputation and my integrity to the hilt."
"I say to those who are making these allegations that if they believe I am waging a campaign without any evidence, can they please put their case and put it swiftly."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members for their kind words, which complement a tough report nicely."
"Mrs Wallis summed up excellently what this is ultimately about."
"It is about better quality laws and better redress."
"May I say that we have taken a leaf from Finland’s book and I have proposed as part of the Internal Action Plan on Communication that we should start to produce a layman’s summary for every proposal brought forward by the Commission."
"We are working hard on this and I want to see it become a reality before I leave the Commission."
"We should be able to explain in one page, in simple, accessible language what we want to do and what our proposals are."
"We promise to work more intensively with the Ombudsman, the Committee on Petitions and the European Parliament in making sure that our procedures are improved where necessary."
"I will end by saying that the Commission joins with you in admiring the work of the Committee on Petition’s secretariat."
"Thank you very much for this discussion."
"Mr President, it would appear that Mr Cashman’s persecution complex knows no bounds."
"I did not refer to you directly in my speech, Mr Cashman, but to my group’s disagreement with a part of your report’s explanatory statement."
"Naturally, we Members can, of course, talk about the explanatory statement that you have included in the report that you have presented."
"I am therefore confining my remarks to what you said in your explanatory statement, and it is that alone to which I referred."
"Your issues with other ministers, directors, etc., are your problem, Mr Cashman, as you know."
"I would emphasise that I am simply talking about the text that you have presented, in particular the report’s explanatory statement."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the oral question to the Commission on forced prostitution during the 2006 football World Cup by Anna Záborská, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality (O-0054/2006 – B6-0221/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, forced prostitution nowadays forms an integral part of the sex industry at global level."
"That is why we have decided to question the European Commission again by putting to it the oral question that has been passed to you."
"Furthermore, I should like to emphasise three points."
"The first is a matter of semantics."
"Speaking of forced prostitution is a euphemism."
"This expression conveys the idea that there is such a thing as voluntary prostitution among women who like to be exploited and to sell their bodies."
"These words, however, conceal the reality."
"Even if it is decriminalised, prostitution, whether forced or not, remains a crime against women and against humanity as a whole."
"Forced prostitution deserves to be openly condemned."
"Mr Blatter, the president of FIFA, has not understood this, any more than other influential men and women."
"Why did they not support condemnation of forced prostitution during the football World Cup?"
"By contrast, I must emphasise the excellent collaboration demonstrated by the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"Overcoming political divisions, our collective collaboration has been inspired by the profoundly human feeling that no woman should be exploited."
"Together, I must emphasise this, we gave a clear signal at the time of the demonstrations on 8 March, thanks to the ‘Red Card for Forced Prostitution’ campaign."
"I invite all of you, Commissioners, representatives of the Council and Members of the European Parliament, to show a red card to all those who encourage forced prostitution by their silence, by failing to take action or by their direct or indirect involvement."
"Next, since the trafficking of women, like the sex industry, is a global phenomenon we have to fight against it on a global scale."
"I should like to mention particularly the remarkable work accomplished by our elder sister, the Council of Europe, which has set us an example."
"Indeed, the Council of Europe Convention on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings was adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 3 May 2005."
"All governments should sign this convention and ratify it."
"Women forced into prostitution will emerge victorious when Member States and the institutions of the European Union collaborate effectively with the Council of Europe."
"Thirdly, our oral question invites us to grant additional funds for the development of equality for all, while preserving the respective roles of men and women so as not to create a rift between them."
"Who, however, is saying anything about the man, who is the client, the consumer, and the one who demands prostitution?"
"We cannot fight against forced prostitution and the trafficking of women without understanding what is going on in the relationship between the prostitute and the client, without thinking about the demand for prostitution or without analysing men’s motives."
"In truth, the prostitution of poor women would be impossible without rich men."
"The fight against prostitution needs more than simply social condemnation or legal penalties for clients, because paying a prostitute arises from the culture of domination and benefits from virtually general acceptance, and from hypocritical and willing tolerance."
"Consequently, ladies and gentlemen, the phenomenon of forced prostitution throws light on a fundamental issue that is close to my heart as a woman who stands up for women who are forced into prostitution, but also as the Chairman of the relevant Committee in this Parliament."
"Respect for otherness will never be achieved as long as men remain unconvinced that improving the condition of women leads to an improvement in the well-being of society as a whole."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is necessary today to mention in this House the initiatives that the Commission, and I myself in person, have worked on during the past few months."
"I should like to thank Mrs Záborská, who has spoken about the existence of a more general problem: namely the need for European action aimed at dismantling the network of trafficking of women and children for the primary purpose of sexual exploitation."
"In my opinion this is a modern form of slavery that Europe can neither tolerate nor, still less, ignore."
"We are facing a medium- and long-term problem."
"I hope that in the course of 2006 we can draw up a plan aimed, as some European women deputies have requested, at assessing the impact of demand for prostitution on the volume of people-trafficking for sexual purposes."
"I am personally convinced that the greater the demand from clients, the more encouragement is indirectly given to people-trafficking for sexual exploitation."
"We do not have precise data, but we are ready to initiate a plan which we shall naturally refer to this Parliament."
"I should like to give you an idea of the list of concrete initiatives in connection with the World Cup championship in Germany."
"In the first place, I have supported – together with the Commission and Mr Barroso – all the information campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the grave danger of an increase in people-trafficking for sexual purposes in connection with the World Cup."
"In this connection, I had the pleasure a few days ago in Brussels of meeting a delegation headed by Mrs Gurmai. We received the results of a petition promoted by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who were very successful in collecting many thousands of signatures."
"Subsequently we contacted the German authorities, so as to obtain their support for prevention and information campaigns in Germany."
"In particular, I had requested something further: that specific, positive information concerning prevention should be posted on the International Football Federation’s website."
"You also know that a few days ago the group of independent experts on people-trafficking deposited the report that we had requested."
"It is a report published on 2 June 2006 which analyses the risk of increased people-trafficking for sexual purposes, with specific reference to the World Cup."
"This report is of course available to Parliament."
"As you will know, we had also asked Europol to draw up a report on this issue."
"Europol has produced an analytical document, aimed at police and investigating authorities, with the purpose of strengthening the practical arrangements for coordination between police authorities."
"I can tell you – without going into details, given the time pressures – that this document confirms the hypothesis that there is an increase in forced prostitution and trafficking in conjunction with the world football championships."
"As some people feared, the likelihood that a large number of young girls will become victims of trafficking during the World Cup is thus confirmed."
"Going back, therefore, to the question tabled before the beginning of this debate, I do not share the conclusion reached by an authoritative German periodical that this sporting event is unconnected with any increase in instances of sexual exploitation."
"Such an increase may be, and indeed is, expected: thus the matter is certainly not irrelevant."
"The German authorities, in particular the Federal Ministry of the Interior and the ministries of the , have responded to our requests."
"We have discussed them on two occasions in the Council of Ministers of the Interior and instructions have been given for more thorough border checks."
"We have been informed that gangs of traffickers have organised a network for trafficking young girls mainly from those countries on the eastern borders of the European Union."
"In this connection I reaffirm that border checks must be made stricter."
"In addition, instructions have been issued at our request concerning the need to protect victims of sexual exploitation, with a view to the application of the special assistance programmes."
"This is a case of treating people not as illegal immigrants, but rather as victims of a modern form of slavery who must therefore be protected."
"We have also given our support to setting up two multilingual telephone helplines, already operational, that have been entrusted to two German NGOs that are well-known in Germany."
"We are aware of the problem caused by the lack of a single Europe-wide telephone number, but such a project would require the agreement of all the telephone companies in all Member States."
"This is an initiative that we shall be able to implement in the medium term, just as we are implementing a European freephone emergency number for children."
"Furthermore, we have also supported, in cooperation with the German authorities, an information campaign sponsored by the German Women’s Council, which you know well."
"We have decided together to organise a workshop, which will be run by the European Commission and the German authorities immediately after the World Cup; its remit will be to prepare a document covering all the positive and negative experiences of this period and to draw up a sort of manual to be used in all international sporting events."
"I should also like to say a few words about the role of Europol and Eurojust."
"We have encouraged the Member States to cooperate to a greater extent with these two organisations."
"As you will know, Europol has in recent weeks carried out some outstanding work."
"It reported to the latest meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Interior, held last week in Luxembourg, and the director of Europol has confirmed that the cooperative network of police forces has derived considerable benefit from the encouragement given by Member States to national police forces."
"In conclusion, I should like to report that we have forwarded a request, formulated in accordance with the Plan of Action, to the network of the EU Member States’ consulates in the countries of origin."
"We have requested that periodic meetings at consulate level should be organised in each country of origin in order to improve the pre-emptive identification of potential victims of trafficking and thus to help them to avoid becoming victims."
"We shall prepare a report on this request by the end of 2006."
"That is a summary of the list of initiatives that have so far been adopted."
". – () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"You, Commissioner, have told us many things and listed them for us, and we could actually even say that we have already achieved a great deal to address the concerns discussed and presented here."
"It was on 17 January 2006 that we adopted Mrs Prets’ report on ‘Strategies to prevent the trafficking of women and children who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation’; in March 2006 we adopted an oral question with a resolution on forced prostitution during international sporting events, and furthermore, on 8 March of this year, we organised the ‘red card to forced prostitution’ campaign in this House."
"However, we still just keep on going."
"All these projects contain very practical proposals for combating forced prostitution."
"At the moment the football World Cup is taking place in Germany."
"We know that during such events there is a spectacular increase in the demand for sexual services, and that before and during them there is an increase in the incidence of criminal activities such as human trafficking and forced prostitution."
"As early as March I asked, in this House, that, on the one hand, information be provided on the ground, in the countries from which most women are taken, with, on the other, in the country in which the event takes place, good information and public relations work, raising awareness among potential clients, a 24-hour multilingual telephone hotline and the guarantee that those who call it will subsequently be offered care and support by the police, emergency services and women’s refuges."
"While, on the one hand, the football World Cup has now begun, there was also an ice hockey World Cup – perhaps a slightly smaller event, but certainly with the same problems."
"Today we need to ask – and I want to thank Mrs Záborská for having formulated this question for us – in what ways this offer is being accepted."
"That is what we now have to focus on."
"The World Cup is now on, and the free telephone hotline - after initial teething problems – will now be in place until 31 July."
"However, we must draw conclusions from these projects that can be applied to future big events."
"We have to learn from any problems and find the right approach."
"I want to ask all of us and you too, Commissioner, to make this happen."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, you have reported many positive things, but even so I would like to express a few doubts."
"Firstly I would like to say that it is not enough to pin the problem only onto the football World Cup and onto Germany."
"We have used the World Cup in order to bring a taboo subject to the attention of the public, simply because football is such a big event."
"There is no other event so spectacular and with such a large audience as the football World Cup."
"Forced prostitution takes place alongside all big events, and not only sports events."
"As we know, the incidence of prostitution also increases here in Strasbourg when this House is in session here, and that too needs to be said in order that everything should not be blamed on sport."
"Despite this I support the project and I am pleased that the World Cup has made it possible for us to bring this issue into the public eye."
"If FIFA has perhaps misunderstood this and feels itself under attack, then I regret this, since it could have supported us brilliantly with many great football players and stars, and made the fans more aware of these related issues."
"This does not mean that FIFA is responsible for the problem, but it could have helped us, and, I think, should have been obliged to do so."
"Commissioner, you spoke about the telephone helpline."
"Back on Women’s Day you told us that there would be a single number, translated into many languages and available 24 hours a day."
"I ask you: Is it really available 24 hours a day?"
"Regrettably there is no single number."
"Now women, victims or even clients who have the courage to try to get help, or who want to report something, now have to note down three different numbers, or rather they have to dial different numbers."
"I do not regard that as being particularly helpful, and I would ask you to pursue this matter further, especially in the future."
"You have talked about enhanced cooperation with Europol."
"The question is, however: whether Europol itself has been strengthened, for, if we are making increased demands on Europol, then the officials there must be equipped accordingly - otherwise they will be overburdened and once again there will be no proper outcome."
"I would like to ask you to look into this as well."
"It is no use just saying that you are participating: we need results too."
"This activity should be coordinated with our work together with Interpol, and I am glad that the German authorities – the embassies, consulates and so on – are participating in this too."
"Perhaps after the World Cup we can draw up a summary, showing how the emergency calls have been responded to, from which countries of origin most of the victims come and, above all, what has been done to take care of the victims."
"These are questions that must be asked after the World Cup."
"I have one further question: How much of the action plan – presented by the Council and with which you are involved – has been implemented by now, by June?"
"A large part of it should already have been completed, and the rest should be taken care of by the end of the year."
"I wish us all much success, and: Let us show forced prostitution the red card!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Frattini, I am glad that you have adopted this initiative by the European Parliament against human trafficking and forced prostitution."
"However, like the previous speaker, I am of the opinion that this must not be some passing fad."
"This must be the starting whistle for more projects going beyond the World Cup, not only for sports events, but for all big events in general."
"Your speech was full of fine sentiments, but I find it regrettable that it took a great deal of external pressure to get the telephone hotline started, and even then with different numbers and limited availability."
"When all is said and done, we need a hotline like this to be permanent."
"It would also be important to have a European day against human trafficking."
"I regard it as a serious omission in April that the justice ministers did not call for the immediate implementation of the EU directive on victim protection and of the European Convention against human trafficking."
"That too must remain a central issue."
"What are we offering these women apart from the hotline?"
"Only by offering assistance that goes beyond the hotline can we contribute to helping affected women and children."
"I am very pleased that this debate regarding the World Cup has also become a debate about prostitution in society, for we must become aware that the annual sex industry profits of USD 5 –7 billion exceed all military budgets."
"This must be a rallying call for us to take action against the sexual exploitation of women and against all forced prostitution, but we also need more debate about best practice in comparison with other Member States."
"There are good opportunities to do this."
"We need officials with special responsibility for combating human trafficking and the like, and this is where we have to set a shining example."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as a result of the hearing that was arranged by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and that took place on 8 March, representatives of the Commission made a number of promises in relation to measures to prevent the detestable trade in sex slaves."
"Today, we are forced to observe that not many of these promises have actually been fulfilled."
"At a time when the players are in the thick of the action at the football World Cup, business is also booming for brothels."
"Women and children are being brought into the EU from other parts of the world in order to be exploited sexually."
"The UN estimates that four million people are transported within or between countries every year in order to be exploited sexually."
"They are shipped around, and bought and sold for consumption by people traffickers, sex tourists, porn producers and what are called ordinary men."
"Young women from poor backgrounds are ensnared by promises of work, material support and a better life."
"They then have their ID papers taken, are kept locked up, rarely know where in the world they are, hear only foreign tongues, are beaten, threatened and, above all, made to make their bodies available in whatever ways their customers may conceivably desire."
"Together with the trafficking of weapons and drugs, prostitution is one of the most profitable activities in the EU."
"There is only one way of putting a stop to this trade, and that is by reducing the demand for sexual services."
"Reducing this demand means drawing attention to, and criminalising, the buyer, that is to say the customer."
"No customers means no demand."
"If we can achieve that, then we will have taken the decisive steps towards putting an end to this horrific trade."
"The links between the legalisation of prostitution and the increase in the number of victims of trafficking must be properly investigated."
"It makes no difference to someone buying sex where a prostitute comes from or under what conditions she carries out her work."
"Instead, in his mind, she is reduced to a body that can be bought."
"Women in the sex trade are victims of men’s violence against women."
"I am not making any ethical judgments about prostitution."
"These are entirely political issues."
"No one should have to prostitute themselves."
"A 1999 study showed, for example, that 80% of women in Dutch brothels were victims of the sex slave trade."
"In the German brothel industry, nine out of ten prostitutes are from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union."
"Since prostitution was legalised in the Netherlands there has been explosive growth in the child sex trade. In 1999 there were 4 000 child prostitutes."
"By 2001 this number had risen to 15 000. I quote both of these figures from the organisation Children’s Rights ()."
"Let the football World Cup in Germany be historic, not just for what happens on the pitch, but above all for the fact that we finally get to grips with these issues."
"Let this World Cup be remembered as a sporting event that took the decisive steps towards putting an end to the sex slave trade."
"Mr President, I would like to start with a few words about trains."
"On the first day of the World Cup, the train I took from Cologne to Gelsenkirchen took 2 hours 15 minutes instead of the normal 59 minutes, while the train from Brussels to Cologne was delayed by 30 minutes."
"This gave me time to think about Franz Beckenbauer, the head of the World Cup organising committee, who quite recently unceremoniously dismissed the question of enforced prostitution during the World Cup championship with some off-hand comments."
"I also remembered Karl-Heinz Rummenigge’s reaction during a recent public hearing on football before the European Parliament, held on 3 May."
"When asked by one of our female MEPs to comment on enforced prostitution, this once famous German footballer – a great footballer – laughed dismissively."
"That is not the attitude we expect from people who are models for many football fans."
"It is sometimes calls from people like them, rather than politicians, that can achieve a lot more, provided some of them grow into the role one would wish for them."
"The problem we are talking about is a real one."
"Let us be honest: it is not one we can eradicate entirely, but we can control it and we can fight it."
"It is not an issue we should wave aside."
"Our voice is and should be the voice of moral pressure, but the more Mr Beckenbauer and Mr Rummenigge derisively shrug off the issue, the more we need to make our voice heard."
"The voice of the European Parliament, a voice transcending all political divisions, is indispensable in this matter."
"Mr President, since Commissioner Frattini has stated quite clearly that there is evidence of the trade in women and children, along with forced prostitution, increasing during this football World Cup, it is not, then, just a problem on paper but also a major problem in real terms, and it is positively disturbing that this should still occur in our western society in 2006."
"It is therefore right and proper that there has been so much political commotion recently and that not only Parliament, but also the Commission and the Council of Ministers are concerning themselves with this problem."
"Where football is concerned, in the Netherlands, we tend to say: no words but deeds, and that is a message I should also like to send to Commissioner Frattini and the Member States."
"I am pleased that you have indicated that real progress is being made in a number of areas."
"Where, however, border control on the east is concerned, you are taking a very long-term view, for example where hotlines are concerned and also when it comes to gaining an insight into the problem and the criminal networks feeding it."
"Whilst I very much appreciate your efforts, I am also critical, because Europol should not only be concerned with analysis and you should not only urge the Member States to increase their level of cooperation with Europol."
"Now, though, there should also be a Europol presence in Germany, and it should be applying its knowledge and expertise to help the German police."
"All the German police is required to do now is simply to check the licences of prostitutes, because it will then become obvious which prostitutes do not have those licences and are therefore forced into this profession."
"I detect in your statement a lack of cooperation on the part of the Member States, and that is a serious matter, since I realise that you rely on information from them."
"I look forward with a great deal of interest to your assessment at the end of this World Cup and I hope that we, along with you, in this respect too, can bring more pressure to bear on the Member States and encourage them to roll up their sleeves and do something about this."
"Mr President, human trafficking is one of the world’s most profitable crimes."
"International criminal gangs are abusing the most vulnerable women and using them as sex slaves."
"From past experience – for example in Athens, during the Olympics – we have seen that international sporting events cause an increase in human trafficking."
"Last Thursday, on the eve of the World Cup, several colleagues and I came to see you, Commissioner, to discuss this problem and present two petitions."
"As president of the Party of European Socialist Women, we launched a petition to call for action to prevent trafficking, particularly in the context of the World Cup."
"We collected more than 23 000 signatures in two months."
"The largest trade unions in Denmark joined us and handed over a petition with 80 000 signatures."
"There is a mismatch between the recent high level of public awareness and media attention, which is an extremely positive development, and, on the other hand, the widespread denial – for example, in several mainstream German newspapers and other groups in German society – of the link between the World Cup and an increase in trafficking and enforced prostitution."
"For example, in last Thursday there was a report denying this link, as you mentioned, Commissioner."
"It is significant that you do not agree, but I urge you to respond or to ask a German Government representative to do so."
"It is essential that somebody of your standing should refute those denials."
"Europe will have assessed the situation and identified a very serious problem."
"After the World Cup, to ensure accountability, there needs to be an assessment of the scale of the problem in Germany during the World Cup, as well as an assessment of the measures taken."
"Beyond the World Cup, there is a need for a real debate across Europe on tackling the root causes of trafficking for sexual exploitation."
"That means looking at how to reduce the demand for prostitution."
"Could the Commission also ensure that the EU reaches the target laid out in the Prets report to reduce trafficking in women and children by 50% in the next ten years."
"We have succeeded in raising the profile of this modern form of human slavery and henceforth it is up to the political agenda, but we need concrete action on the ground from governments and the Commission to get to the root of the problem."
"Mr President, there are clear links between trafficking and large sporting events, and it is sad that such exciting and positive events are linked to such an evil trade."
"This time the sporting event is being held here in the European Union."
"We must act, and we must do more than we are doing at the moment."
"We need further answers from the Commission about the measures actually being taken and about what lessons can be learned for the future."
"I fear that not enough is being done at this World Cup to stop this abhorrent trade, although I know the German authorities are trying their best, and I appreciate that."
"It is almost certain that, as I speak, many victims of trafficking are working as slaves, far from the view of the television cameras."
"They are victims, as you quite rightly said, Commissioner, and must be treated as such, not as criminals."
"Commissioner, I hope the hotlines you mentioned have been set up and are working."
"I too would have liked to see a single free-phone hotline, similar to the child hotline."
"I hope there are enough safe havens for victims to go to, and would like you to indicate whether you feel enough have been set up in Germany."
"I hope also that the victims will not be returned to their country of origin only to be retrafficked, because we know that this has happened in the past."
"I am very pleased that, as you mentioned, there has been cooperation with Europol."
"However, we need to know more about what measures the Commission is taking, along with Europol, to combat trafficking in relation to the World Cup."
"We also need to know what the full extent of trafficking is at this World Cup."
"After the event is over we need a full report and I would like to hear from you what sort of report that will be."
"We must learn for the future."
"We are not talking here about prostitutes who have decided, for whatever reasons, that they want to be prostitutes – we are talking about the slave trade, and we must not confuse the two."
"It is right that we should speak about these issues, but we must make sure that footballers, fans and organisations – and I had sincerely hoped that FIFA would join with us – try and stamp out this slave trade, because that is what it is and we are not talking about prostitution in general."
"We must make sure that the World Cup is remembered for the right reasons, and not for fostering a slave trade."
"– As we have reported, the promotion of prostitution is a veritable assault on human rights, and it has taken on an even higher profile with the building of an enormous brothel next to the German World Cup facilities."
"Several women’s organisations and tens of thousands of people have signed a petition declaring that buying sex is not a sport, but a form of sexual and physical exploitation of women, in which their bodies are regarded as merchandise that can be bought and sold."
"Moreover, we are aware that such behaviour runs counter to the international rules of sport, which must promote equality, mutual respect and non-discrimination."
"It is essential that the sexual exploitation and trafficking of women be repudiated and that every measure be adopted to stop the promotion of prostitution and the trafficking that is generally associated with it, since it is actually a genuine form of slavery, as has already been stated here."
"From what we have heard here, however, we cannot conclude that all the measures required in such a situation have been adopted, including making the most of the high profile of this event to strike at the causes, which remain beyond this football championship."
"We therefore emphasise that, at the same time as fighting the traffic in women and the criminal networks that run it, it is essential to promote equal rights and dignity for women."
"That also involves the creation of jobs with rights and guaranteed access to high-quality public services, particularly in the areas of health, education, housing and justice, so that we can succeed in reducing poverty and social exclusion and thus tackle the main factors that force women into prostitution, whether they are citizens of EU Member States or of third countries, where there is great poverty."
"Furthermore, it also involves the need for us to pay greater attention to promoting the dignity of women in social communications, in advertising, in the family, and in fighting all forms of discrimination and violence of which they are still victims."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we propose that you start prioritising all these issues to protect the rights of women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, it is widely known that in Germany prostitution is legal and regulated by law."
"Experience, nevertheless, indicates that legal prostitution poses no obstacle to trafficking in the victims of forced prostitution in this market."
"Experts estimate that as many as 30-40 000 prostitutes may be coming to the World Cup events, and there are justifiable concerns that among them there will be a large number of victims of human trafficking or, as several speakers have described them before me, victims of modern slavery."
"Therefore, the question addressed to the Commission is extremely topical."
"What is being done to ensure the application of the principles of human rights, focusing on victims of human trafficking and entrenched in international instruments, be it UN conventions or those of the Council of Europe and their protocols?"
"Europol has arrived at the clear conclusion that victims’ testimonies are the only reliable source of information."
"Commissioner, I would also like to get an answer to my question as to whether the German authorities are going to treat these victims as illegal immigrants and expel them instead of giving them the protection they are entitled to under international law."
"This is what makes it difficult to expose those who traffic in human beings while making billions in income."
"Commissioner, I am delighted that you have emphasised the important role of demand."
"It is generally known that without demand, this business would not flourish."
"I am convinced that your attitude to this issue will help break though the barrier represented by the generally tolerant attitude to such demand."
"(Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, apart from your valued personal commitment, what we have heard is insufficient."
"In my opinion, Europe needs to adopt two interconnected approaches in order to persevere with this matter."
"The aim of the first approach must be to break up the vicious triangle linking victims, traffickers and clients."
"This would certainly require a concrete and binding programme of action: an example of true European cooperation which, as you have said, can exist only in the medium or long term."
"We shall listen attentively to whatever future course you may suggest to us, bearing in mind that this problem will certainly not go away once the World Cup championship is over."
"Nevertheless, we must enlist the participation of European citizens in hard-hitting, high-visibility campaigns that have major symbolic significance, so that your wishes in this matter become a political priority for all of us. In this way we shall affirm the idea of a true European people and construct a concept of supranational citizenship."
"It has to be admitted that this second feature is missing from the Commission’s leadership."
"Steps have been taken by the political parties with the campaign of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and by Parliament itself; but the Commission has done nothing."
"The opportunity could have been taken to create a space for self-representation of the Community ethos that we are trying to construct, which provides the ethical framework for our European public space."
"Europe is not present at the World Cup championship. That weakens the very communication plan that the Commission has proposed with great ceremony: that is to say, Plan D."
"I should be concerned to think that the Commission had in fact made no attempts to use its imagination and commitment, thinking that it would be unseemly to spoil the party – a party that involves so many economic and advertising interests. Perhaps the Commission thinks that the party should not be used to make millions of spectators understand the need to apply the framework law that provides for the indictment of those who coerce individuals into prostitution."
"If that were the case I should be concerned; but I hope that things are not as I have described."
"Commissioner, I hope that you will help us in this matter and also make some symbolic gestures. For example, you too could hold up the red card before going to support your team and mine."
"– Mr President, a week ago, Frankfurt on Main – which is where I come from – welcomed hundreds of thousands of football fans from all over the world with an impressive optical and acoustic event, the SkyArena, with larger-than-life images of top football players and fans, scenes of jubilation and mourning, fairness and fouls being projected onto the walls of eleven multi-storey buildings."
"During the World Cup in Germany, it is intended that millions of people will be given the feeling that they are the guests of friends."
"These great events can give rise to many positive emotions, but also to a number of negative developments, and that is where the fun stops."
"On 28 April, during the EU Conference of Interior Ministers, Commissioner Frattini was quite right to stress that Germany is prepared to combat this forced prostitution."
"Despite isolated criticism and some threats of boycotting, we are well-armed: reinforced border controls, a massively extended witness protection programme for the victims, a federal bureau for gathering information – 160 officials are working round the clock, and the Federal Government has spent EUR 2 million on the prevention campaign."
"In May police raids were carried out in red light districts, with, among other things, 700 brothels being inspected, and checks carried on flats and on almost 2 000 individuals."
"Nevertheless, the measures taken by the Member States and the Commission are not sufficient – on this point I agree with the previous speakers – since this is about the prevention of suffering, humiliation and blackmail."
"The motion submitted by Mrs Záborská for a resolution of this House points out that, as regards forced prostitution during international sporting events, FIFA has no reason whatsoever to feel insulted."
"We demand campaigns that are comprehensible, that can enlighten potential victims and effectively intimidate the criminals; and as for the Europe-wide telephone project, this hotline, so far there has only been one announcement: ‘This number is currently unavailable’."
"This will not do."
"Europol and Eurojust must both be in a position to do something about this issue."
"This is certainly a question of available staff, but it also requires financial support."
"Let us do what my fellow Members have already done, and do what is necessary by showing this exploitation the red card."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for months we have had some extraordinary information relating to the football World Cup."
"Forty thousand women were expected to be brought from Eastern Europe and North Africa for the purposes of sexual exploitation and, furthermore, in the cities hosting matches large premises were being prepared that would be able to accommodate many clients at a time."
"The women expected largely lived in extreme poverty in their countries of origin and had been recruited by deception and false promises of a better life that they were never going to see."
"On 17 January, this Parliament asked for appropriate measures to be taken to prevent the trafficking of women into forced prostitution."
"Furthermore, on 13 March, this House called upon the media and sports stars to help in the fight against the sexual exploitation of women and in promoting a change of mindset, in accordance with sport’s values of solidarity."
"Many women’s organisations are carrying out campaigns to increase awareness amongst the citizens."
"We have listened to what you have to say, Commissioner, we support and applaud your initiatives, but they must not be one-off measures."
"What has happened to the plan adopted to prevent and combat people trafficking?"
"We in the institutions must fight hard because it is intolerable that a genuine slave market should be put together in this day and age, right in the heart of Europe."
"Big sporting events must no longer be wonderful business opportunities for traffickers in women and for pimps."
"We must achieve a common position, in order to prevent the least-developed countries from being used as a source of women to be exploited in the rich countries of the European Union."
"It is therefore urgent to create a common legal framework for the whole of the European Union and it is essential to create more effective cooperation between countries of origin, transit and destination, because we are dealing with a criminal phenomenon of immense proportions whose networks are usually linked to organised crime."
"In order to make progress, Commissioner, we must make more resources available and also turn the fight against the trafficking of women into a priority within the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, today we are discussing enforced prostitution and child abuse on the occasion of the World Cup football championship being held in Germany."
"It would be disingenuous to give the impression that this phenomenon has suddenly appeared on such a huge scale in Germany of all places, and on the occasion of the World Cup in particular."
"Enforced prostitution and sexual abuse of children have been around for many, many years, indeed for decades, during major sporting events, and not just during sporting events."
"They accompany every great event, regardless of whether it takes place in a European country or on other continents, in the USA, Asia or Australia."
"The issue of sexual coercion is well defined, and we have legal instruments to combat it."
"However, the problem is using these instruments, and for this reason, Commissioner, I felt that something was missing when you spoke about the issue as some sort of statistical problem."
"Analyses have been carried out by Europol and other organisations which are qualified to do so, and reports have been drawn up."
"Important though this may be, it is action that is required."
"I would like to draw your attention to just one question: the governmental authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as many other countries, have of course done a great deal to counteract this problem."
"Yet the real enforced prostitution and child sex abuse take place in quiet streets, behind drawn curtains."
"If we do not get citizens to collaborate with us, if there is nobody to whom those who have been sexually abused can turn – because the victims often have no passports, no money and no means of contact with the outside world, and can only reach the police station or a helpline to say what is happening to them via a private individual – we will not achieve very much simply through organisational measures, which only have a limited reach within society."
"I hope that the excellent organisation of the World Cup by our German colleagues, for which we will undoubtedly congratulate them when it has finished, will also be an opportunity to congratulate them on combating this particular phenomenon."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, I wonder if you have ever opened a European newspaper and browsed the last page, for that is where you will often find small ads, complete with telephone numbers, for young ladies by the names of Lolita, Tina and Francesca, who are girls of Polish, Bulgarian and Ukrainian origin."
"What is missing, though, is a general, multi-lingual helpline which Lolita can ring if she is forced into prostitution."
"It is high time such a number was made readily available."
"The World Cup has kicked off, as you may have noticed."
"So has the systematic exploitation of women who are forced into prostitution, although this has not yet been given the attention it deserves."
"Commissioner Frattini, I look to you, as a fair referee, to produce the red card and put an end to this major infringement, not in injury time, but right now."
"I will shortly be travelling to Germany, where the World Cup is being played for, in order to campaign against racism in football, but you may rely upon it that I will also keep my ears to the ground so as to find out what is happening to tackle forced prostitution."
"Commissioner Frattini, it is not enough to worry about the morals of the day."
"What do you intend to do on a practical level in order to help the women and girls who are being humiliated, raped, exploited and abused during the World Cup?"
"Your analyses bear out the impression that this is happening on a large scale."
"If you come up with proper action to help these girls in a real sense, then you can rely on my support."
"I wish you all the best!"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you will remember, the question of forced prostitution during the World Cup was debated at the initiative of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on 8 March, International Women's Day."
"The debate was held not only for symbolic and anniversary reasons; it was a political choice by our committee to sound once again the alarm bell for principles, security and the protection of human rights, women's dignity and the image of Europe in the eyes of its citizens and in the eyes of the citizens of the entire world."
"Today we endorse the initiative by Mrs Záborská to debate the matter once again during the course of these sports activities following accusations of incidents of forced prostitution in Germany."
"Today we are expressing once again our deep concern about the spread of this disgusting phenomenon."
"We are also expressing our concern about the efficacy of our policies."
"I am delighted, Commissioner, that you share our positions on the extent of this phenomenon and on the need to combat it with every preventive and repressive measure in the host country and in the countries of origin."
"Recently, a delegation from our committee visited Athens and discussed with the competent government agencies and parliamentary colleagues the need for transnational cooperation, the need to apply laws and the need to train police and court officers."
"We realised the importance of protecting the victims and raising the awareness of society."
"I have paid close attention to the plans which you explained, Commissioner, about studying the phenomenon and the specific measures which you mentioned, as we also discussed on 8 March."
"However, the specific situation which has arisen in Germany constitutes an opportunity for us to check how aware we are and how determined we are to become effective, both the political agencies and society, by which I mean society in the Member States and the European community."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I fear that you have confined yourself – and that we have confined ourselves – to statements, descriptions, studies and more remote, future policies on the taking of fundamental decisions on combating forced prostitution gangs."
"Even in your references to the work of the German Government, which truly is an achievement today, these days, you did not clarify how the national local authorities should work in order to dismantle or combat these gangs at once and not with cross-border cooperation now that the goods have left the factory gate."
"FIFA, on the other hand, is doing nothing, while it could have informed supporters and national teams months ago, it could have run an information campaign for the people who follow these matches and FIFA knows it."
"Why?"
"Because FIFΑ may consider that forced prostitution is bad advertising for these football matches."
"We as the European Union did not even manage to convince an organisation like FIFΑ of this."
"On the other hand, the European Union has, if you like, a strong communications policy, but you, Mr Frattini, did not over these months apply a major, resounding communications strategy with TV spots during the matches being held, in cooperation with the advertising companies, in cooperation with FIFA itself, with the result that these red cards are the only communications policy, the policy which is community policy against forced prostitution."
"I therefore consider, Mr Frattini, that we left the German Government without help."
"It is fighting a huge fight with no means of communication."
"Above all, however, I fear that we shall confine ourselves to studies, we shall abandon the victims and we shall say that the operation was a success but the patient died and every day, women and children will die behind locked doors."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, buying sex is not a sport."
"Football and sex do not go hand in hand."
"The European Union must call on Angela Merkel’s German government to combat the organised trafficking of women for the purposes of prostitution during the World Cup."
"Sex workers, whom Germany considers perfectly legal, and who normally receive many clients a day, will not be able to satisfactorily meet the extra demand of potential clients there will be from the millions of male World Cup spectators."
"What, therefore, could be more natural than for the sex industry to import some 45 000 women from Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America in order to satisfy the wishes of these gentlemen?"
"It is not a matter of going against German laws, but of putting an end to this openly organised trafficking of women."
"The trafficking of women constitutes a violation of the fundamental rights of the individual and, in particular, of the right to dignity and respect for physical and mental integrity and of the right not to be subjected to violence."
"Governments must ensure protection and respect for the rights of individuals who are victims of trafficking and, in particular women and young girls who are forced into prostitution."
"Therefore, we must concentrate more on the traffickers and their networks of organised crime which exploit these women, and not on the women themselves."
"This sexual exploitation must cease and appropriate and effective measures must be put in place against this mafia of sex."
"I am especially delighted by the petition launched by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE) to put a stop to this organised prostitution and this iniquitous treatment of thousands of women."
"I am very much in support of this initiative and strongly condemn the organised trafficking of women, which turns them into commodities."
"In this context, Commissioner, are you going to take into account some of our proposals, such as the launch of a prevention campaign targeting potential victims and informing them of the dangers and risks of recruitment into these networks, or the installation of a direct multilingual telephone line backed up by a vast publicity campaign?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with you that people-trafficking is a modern form of slavery."
"Unfortunately public opinion, for psychological and cultural reasons, underestimates the seriousness of people-trafficking for the purposes of prostitution compared with, for example, trafficking in drugs or money-laundering."
"Yet this trafficking is even more hateful and must be fought with greater force and effectiveness."
"We have proposed certain effective instruments, such as the institution of a European telephone hot line."
"We know that it is very difficult to secure the agreement of all the telephone companies; but we beg you to persevere, since this is an effective instrument."
"By the same token, we ask for a harmonised system for data collection, with common definitions, indicators, measures and methods."
"Lastly, we need clear strategies focused on objectives."
"The presence of widespread instances of illegal prostitution within Europe’s borders, for example, should not be seen merely as an infringement of the immigration laws but also as an alarm signalling the strength of organised crime."
"It is for this reason that the issue of people-trafficking should be kept separate from that of immigration and brought back into the question of organised crime."
"We must, furthermore, act not only on the supply side, by repressing the traffickers, but also on the demand side, by actively discouraging clients and promoting campaigns to sensitise public opinion."
"We cannot allow people to say, ‘But know nothing about it’."
"If we allow the problem to be ignored, we shall be talking not of sexual liberation but of criminal oppression."
"If clients are aware of the situation, they are to be blamed from the standpoint not of bourgeois respectability or moralism but of civic responsibility and objective complicity with the people-trafficking racket."
"Finally, it is important to enlist the help of the NGOs in breaking up the network of complicity and dependency."
"They are truly the best possible interlocutors with the victims of people-trafficking."
"Their role is often undervalued and they are also thwarted at times by the institutional authorities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my homeland, Estonia, has the shameful distinction of occupying third place in the European Union in terms of the number of prostitutes per 1 000 residents, and is only surpassed by Germany and Austria."
"According to a television survey organised in March, viewers overwhelmingly considered the proliferation of prostitution to be Estonia’s number one image problem."
"I feel that we have posed this question too timidly."
"The difference between forced prostitution and prostitution is very small."
"According to some figures, 95% of prostitution is forced prostitution."
"Estonian data indicate that two-thirds of prostitutes have considered suicide."
"80% suffer from chronic depression."
"This does not give the impression that these individuals have freely chosen this occupation, but rather that they are slaves."
"I have personally done all that I can to reduce the demand for prostitution."
"I actively participated in the signature campaign organised by the women of the PSE."
"In just a few hours in the small town of Pärnu, Estonia, we gathered hundreds of signatures against forced prostitution."
"The population of Pärnu, from babies to the very elderly, is 40 000."
"The same number of women were forcibly transported to Germany from Eastern Europe for the Football World Cup."
"Commissioner Frattini – I call upon you to come before us after the World Cup and give us an overview of what exactly happened in Germany."
"I would like an answer to the question of how, as you say, you plan to reduce the demand for prostitution in the European Union."
"Are you able, and do you intend to go as far as Sweden, and demand that Member States punish those who purchase sex?"
"This is what is actually needed in order to reduce demand."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who have spoken in the debate."
"I agree with most of the observations that I have heard."
"First and foremost, we are faced on the occasion of the World Cup championship not with a tragic emergency situation but with a modern form of slavery that unfortunately will continue to strike at hundreds of thousands and probably millions of young women."
"It is therefore clear that we should not confine our deliberations to the World Cup."
"Precisely for this reason, as I have already disclosed, we shall organise a workshop immediately after the World Cup. In the course of this workshop we shall bring together all the experiences of this month and draw conclusions to be included in a document that will serve for all other sporting events of this type, and also for cultural and political events."
"For example, the German police authorities encountered an increase in forced prostitution at the time of Expo in Hanover some years ago."
"There has been much discussion of telephone helplines."
"Given the urgency of providing an answer and indeed because we consider that NGOs should play a part in this project, we are thinking of entrusting the management of two multilingual helplines, which are already in operation, to Solvodi, an NGO that is especially well-known in Germany. They have promised 24-hour cover during this period."
"Let me add that the Commission also intends to give financial support to the European helplines for women, as we have done for the protection of children who are victims of violence."
"Unfortunately it has not been possible to provide funds for this project from the 2006 budget, but I think that we shall be able to effect it under the 2007 budget."
"Since this is a medium-term measure, I have instructed my office to look into a legally viable formula that would also allow us to allocate funding for young women who are victims of sexual exploitation."
"Much has also been said about communication and information."
"I entirely agree with Mrs Vincenzi’s recommendation that we must spoil the party if necessary, and accordingly avoid remaining silent when there are hard-hitting messages to be delivered."
"I must admit that we have had little time and that I have needed to concentrate institutionally on activities of prevention and rapid reaction, which must clearly be accompanied by information campaigns."
"Here again I am willing to make a financial contribution towards information campaigns."
"Furthermore, as I have already noted, we have activated for the first time the network of Member States’ consulates in the countries of origin, since we consider that it is precisely in those countries that information campaigns aimed at potential victims must be more forceful and more widespread."
"I entirely agree on the need to separate the concept of people-trafficking and trafficking for sexual purposes from the immigration question, given that they are entirely different issues."
"You are aware that we are monitoring the implementation of the European regulations now in force, in the first instance the Framework Decision. These regulations must be adopted by the Member States; they keep the issues of people-trafficking and immigration completely separate."
"The victims are victims, not illegal immigrants. They therefore have the right to benefit from those assistance programmes already provided by certain Member States for those persons who report that they have been victims of exploitation or, still worse, of forced trafficking for sexual purposes."
"I also share Mrs Breyer’s call for long-term initiatives, such as a European day for the fight against people-trafficking, and I hope that by the middle of next year we shall have fixed a date for this."
"As I have already said, I support the idea of reducing demand."
"Nevertheless, in order to establish the impact on trafficking of the demand for prostitution it is essential to carry out analyses, although someone expressed the contrary view."
"We started work together on this proposal at the beginning of this year and I can tell you that we have acquired a great deal of new information."
"Today we know fairly precisely which are the trafficking routes and the main countries of origin; we have also identified the Member States used as routes by the minibuses that take small groups of girls to Germany."
"I can also tell you that, although the police forces’ data are difficult to explain, hundreds of checks have been carried out in recent months – not only in Germany but also in many transit countries, such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Thanks to these checks, persons guilty of trafficking young women have been stopped and arrested."
"By these means and thanks to the cooperation between police forces, we have managed to reduce the potential impact to a percentage that we are not yet in a position to specify, because the hundreds of individuals subjected to checks and detained were heading for Germany."
"I should therefore like to express my appreciation for the conduct of the German authorities."
"Mrs Batzeli has asked how the German authorities operate on the ground."
"I can confirm that they operate well, both at Federal and at level."
"When you have the opportunity to read the final report after the end of the World Cup championship, you will learn something that we too are gradually discovering: namely that the checks have been tightened up and that many cases have been detected where false declarations of the purpose of a short-term stay, for example to work in a bar or carry out domestic work, in fact conceal victims of sexual exploitation."
"The victims have been identified and the perpetrators have probably been arrested."
"In conclusion, I reaffirm the need to strike at the root of these cases."
"There exists a European Action Plan, supported by you in December 2005, which we must now implement, starting from the standpoint of the inviolable nature of every person’s rights and human dignity."
"It is on this basis that we shall be working during the coming months."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0146/2006), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position established by the Council (12062/1/2005 C6-0055/2006 2003/0210(COD)) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution (Rapporteur: Mrs Klaß)."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just as we cannot live without air, we cannot live without water either."
"Water is literally a very profound substance, and we must take care lest we perish in its depths."
"I was reminded of this by the discussion about the common position on the groundwater directive over the past few days."
"The report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety contains 43 amendments as a recommendation for second reading in Parliament."
"It was adopted by 50 votes to none with one abstention."
"Only four additional amendments have been submitted."
"I take this convincing vote as an unequivocal mandate for negotiations between Parliament and the Council."
"I hope that today’s debate will help to confirm this vote, so that the European Parliament can enter into the conciliation procedure with a strong platform and a clear mandate."
"For this reason, as your rapporteur, I propose that we vote on a package."
"I am opposed to all the amendments that were tabled with 37 signatures."
"They do not reflect the views of my own group."
"Sadly, the Council has not proved flexible enough to pave the way for an agreement with Parliament at this second reading."
"The conciliation procedure will now give us the opportunity to make further improvements to the common position that has been set before us. Improvements are desperately needed in some areas."
"The wording of the legal provisions must be formulated more precisely wherever it is still vague and open to interpretation."
"In addition, concepts referred to in the text must be defined."
"Inherent geogenically determined levels of pollutants must be taken into account when the status of groundwater is assessed."
"This will create the necessary flexibility to allow for differing circumstances in the Member States."
"The deterioration of groundwater caused by new pollutant discharges must be prevented by means of clear criteria for the reversal of adverse trends."
"The national threshold values must be set on the basis of toxicological and ecotoxicological criteria."
"These are the only criteria we have, and a study conducted by the European Commission has confirmed that this approach is actually feasible."
"A revision clause must be inserted in order to ensure that the effectiveness of the directive can be verified and that its provisions can be improved if need be."
"It is particularly important to me as your rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on preventive protection of groundwater."
"We have been campaigning for this for many years here, for prevention is better than cure."
"This truth is nowhere more evident than in respect of groundwater."
"It can take years and even decades before discharged pollutants are identifiable in groundwater after seeping through the soil."
"It takes just as long before enacted measures or the self-purifying properties of groundwater can eliminate damage once it has occurred."
"If the purification of groundwater is at all possible, it is an enormously expensive process, a point that is rightly emphasised by many of my honourable colleagues, especially those from the United Kingdom."
"In Austria and in my own country of Germany, between 80 and 100% of drinking water is obtained from groundwater."
"As we have just read, this is even the case in parts of Britain."
"This is precisely the reason why we must ensure that our groundwater which is still pure remains so for future generations."
"The groundwater ecosystem as such must be protected."
"Many telephone calls from fellow Members and numerous opinions from associations, as well as some motions for separate votes, all testify to a high degree of uncertainty."
"Given the difficult and highly technical subject matter and the scope of the regulatory provisions of the Water Framework Directive, this is hardly surprising really."
"The fact remains, however, that we need not entirely reinvent the wheel."
"This groundwater directive is a daughter to the Water Framework Directive of 2000, which already regulates many pertinent matters."
"Nevertheless, we must make its message clear and unequivocal."
"For this reason I eagerly await the message you will convey, Commissioner Dimas, on the comment about the Nitrates Directive and the reference to the latter."
"These provisions are extremely important to the European farmers who are affected by them."
"‘Water instead of diamonds’ was the heading of an article that appeared last week in the financial section of a major daily newspaper in Germany."
"Slowly but surely, clean water is becoming a scarce and valuable commodity, as rare as diamonds."
"The demand for clean water will continue to rise in the coming decades."
"The last hundred years have already seen consumption increase twice as fast as the population and as the real value of economic output."
"Investments in water-management enterprises are recommended."
"Today and in tomorrow’s vote we should pave the way for our groundwater to remain an elixir of life and a precious diamond for future generations."
"Mr President, first my thanks to the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, for the excellent work they have done within the framework of the second reading of this proposal."
"I absolutely agree that clean water is more important and more valuable than diamonds."
"There is unquestionably a need for there to be an effective system of protecting the quality of groundwater as a natural resource, in order to meet the need for drinking water, for industry and for agriculture."
"Groundwater is also of great environmental value."
"It is a fundamental component in the water cycle and, consequently, must be protected, including in respect of the surface waters and terrestrial ecosystems with which it is connected."
"The proposed framework directive complements the Water Framework Directive."
"Firstly, it lays down clear criteria for evaluating the good chemical status of groundwater and for identifying and reversing trends in the deterioration of the quality of groundwater."
"Secondly, it imposes the application of measures to prevent or limit the immediate ingress of dangerous substances into groundwater."
"At first reading, the Commission accepted many of the 89 amendments approved by the European Parliament, given that they clarified and improved the text, while at the same time remaining consistent with the structure of the original proposal and the Commission's more general approach."
"The common position now incorporates 54 of Parliament's amendments in either letter or spirit."
"Before the common position was finalised, the scope and potential for applying Community standards to the quality of groundwater and, more importantly, the question of nitrates in connection with the Nitrates Directive were discussed."
"In this instance, the Commission considers that the Nitrates Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the present directive pursue the same objectives as regards the prevention and limitation of contamination from nitrates."
"In general, the Commission considers that the common position improves the provisions concerning the definition of threshold values for groundwater and the corresponding compliance regime."
"Similarly, the common position simplifies the criteria for identifying and reversing pollution trends and clarifies the measures that need to be taken in order to prevent and limit the ingress of contaminants."
"I hope that we shall manage to complete the legislative procedure as quickly as possible, because we really do need this new directive, thanks to which the evaluation of the environmental objectives of the Water Framework Directive will be made on the basis of clear qualitative criteria and measures to protect groundwater."
"Mr President, the Commissioner and our excellent rapporteur have both referred to the need for this measure: the crying shame that the Commission has just referred to; the precious resource that my colleague Mrs Klaß referred to – a resource that once polluted can take decades to recover."
"Therefore we are bringing a measure which is aimed to prevent that and to protect the groundwater which, as Mrs Klaß says, in parts of some countries provides a high proportion of drinking water."
"She is right, in the work she has done, not only to distinguish between the different geological backgrounds in different parts of Europe so as to show that there is not one single solution to these problems, but also to highlight areas where there are comparable problems and ways we can find to cope with them."
"There are two keys."
"One is to ensure that we have consistency with other directives, in particular the Water Framework Directive."
"The Nitrates Directive has also been mentioned, and there are others – the daughter directives."
"The second is to clarify even now – and I fear it will have to come at conciliation – some of the issues: for example, in Amendment 22, the use of the words ‘aim to’."
"To achieve the absolute may be impossible, but ‘aiming to’ means nothing, and is ambiguous as it could refer either to a sort of lip service or to a genuine attempt."
"I am sure we need a stronger term, short of the impossible; and the current text in the groundwater directive which talks of ‘taking all the appropriate measures deemed necessary to prevent’, may be the answer."
"But we also need to ensure that the French and the English texts are the same."
"At the moment the English text says ‘stop’ and the French text says ‘try to prevent’."
"These are the sort of issues that we shall need to look at as we take this forward."
"However, in the meantime, I congratulate our rapporteur and welcome the move by the Commission to improve this particular precious asset."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her work, which I believe has greatly improved this proposal."
"I believe that we all appreciate the importance of protecting groundwater and that this must be one of the main objectives of European legislation, with a view to resolving the current pollution situation and preventing any such problems in the future."
"The pollution of groundwater leads to situations that are difficult and costly to put right."
"Collecting this groundwater in order to use it as drinking water is very important throughout Europe and increasing its protection is therefore a fundamental objective of any protection legislation, not just for water, but also for human health and for the quality of life of the citizens."
"We must therefore bear in mind that, since there are very limited possibilities for purifying an aquifer, control and prevention are essential, with a view to preventing polluting substances from reaching this groundwater."
"I would emphasise that groundwater is the European Union’s most sensitive and important resource and, in particular, it is the main source for the public supply of drinking water."
"Furthermore, I believe that, in order to guarantee the same protection of groundwater, Member States sharing water masses should coordinate their activities in terms of establishing threshold values and identifying the main dangerous substances."
"Finally, I hope that plenary will approve the amendments we approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and that the Council will take good note of them, since their intention is to increase the quality requirements and to promote prevention, with a view to preventing further dumping of pollutants."
"."
"Mr President, one of the Commissioner’s officials spoke to the Environment Committee recently."
"In response to one of my colleagues, he said that target values are no use at all."
"We have to have limit values; otherwise the Member States do nothing."
"Aspirations are just a figment of Brussels’ imagination."
"Nothing comes of them once people get back to their national capitals."
"I think that is the impression many Members have; the impression that words are not being acted upon."
"It is increasingly difficult to secure proper compliance with environmental legislation from Member States."
"I hope that is something the Commission will be raising on a regular and frequent basis in the Environment Council – naming and shaming."
"Looking at the record, and I know the Commission has that in mind all the time."
"I remember that when we discussed the Water Framework Directive, this Parliament’s amendments helped give that piece of legislation real teeth."
"We imposed legal requirements upon Member States."
"As a result, major impetus was given to trying to resolve some of the problems in certain States."
"Others, judging by some of the recent figures I have seen, are trying their best to circumvent the requirements imposed on them."
"When we look at this particular legislation, Amendment 22 is the motivation behind many of our concerns."
"We were seeking to delete the words ‘aim to’ because we want to close the loophole."
"We no longer trust ministers to deliver what they say when they come to Brussels."
"We want legally binding requirements imposed on them, however difficult the enforcement machinery may be."
"It has been suggested that this is unnecessary: there are linguistic interpretations, or we misunderstand the difficulties."
"But I think it is very clear what Members want: we want words to be followed by action."
"I spent some of last week trying to fend off the alleged concerns of the pesticides industry – manufacturers of plant protection products – that this legislation, as amended by Parliament, would lead to the complete banning of pesticides."
"It struck me as rather odd."
"I always thought pesticides were intended to kill pests, not to get into groundwater, and, if applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, they should not get into groundwater."
"So I do not see that we have a problem there."
"The important thing for all of us, and for the farming interests too, is to recognise that we all have an interest in preserving groundwater and the soil structure for the long term."
"Bad farmers might have difficulty in meeting some of the requirements of this kind of legislation, but we are on the side of the good farmers and the environment, not the bad farmers, and that is as it should be."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is proclaiming today how important water is to us."
"We are therefore all in agreement in this House that the question is precisely how we intend to protect groundwater."
"We know from the European Environment Agency that 87% of groundwater already contains excessive nitrate concentrations."
"In Germany, groundwater can contain one to seven times the permitted level of nitrates, especially in areas where large-scale livestock farming takes place."
"In the body, nitrates are converted into toxic nitrites, which increase the risk of cancer and can lead to life-threatening cyanosis, especially in infants."
"We must surely all agree that we cannot continue to allow exceptions."
"That is another point at issue in this vote."
"We certainly shall not vote for exceptions to the ceiling of 50 milligrams of nitrates per litre of groundwater, since such exceptions are likely to result in widespread contamination."
"We really must emphasise strongly today that we have no intention of permitting exceptions and that we attach great importance to the preservation of the precautionary principle, for we know that treating contaminated water is ten times more expensive than applying the precautionary principle."
"We must vote accordingly."
"Forty per cent of groundwater in Europe is already polluted."
"That must be a warning signal to us, deterring us from any notion of enshrining the right, in exceptional cases, to engage in the bad practices that are still prevalent in many Member States and to exceed the prescribed limits."
"That is not an option."
"We must put a stop to the daily contamination of groundwater and, above all, we must put an end to the excessive discharges of nitrogen by industrial agriculture, as the previous speaker indicated."
"The pesticides industry will be doing itself a disservice if it does not take a lively interest in the pursuit of these aims."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my political group agrees that groundwater constitutes the most vulnerable ecosystem, the most important source of water for human consumption and also a basic part of other ecosystems, such as rivers and lakes."
"Over 2/3 of drinking water comes from reserves of groundwater and a great deal of damage has already been done."
"The quality of groundwater has deteriorated greatly and this deterioration has affected the environment and public health and the economy."
"More than half of all groundwater, according to specialist scientists, has already been polluted and any fundamental prospect of cleaning it up would be extremely time-consuming and extremely expensive; hence, we need to act promptly, because a great many consumers, our fellow European citizens, have now lost their confidence in tap water, preferring bottled water, which sometimes costs up to one thousand times more."
"Apart from this, we do not have enough information on the connection between the development of the animal ecosystem and the use of groundwater, which means that we do not know the damage that contamination of the groundwater is doing to the animal ecosystem."
"My political group considers that the directive we are debating on the protection of groundwater constitutes the most important legislative tool for maintaining clean groundwater in Europe."
"We therefore need a strong directive and not a simple declaration of good intentions, as contained in the extremely inadequate common position of the Council."
"That is why my political group would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, on a job well done, although this does not mean that in the stage of the debate and the procedure up to second reading there were not also points with which we disagreed."
"However, we have a satisfactory compromise and we have also come very close to the Commission."
"What is needed is for the Council to agree at long last, because if we leave it to the discretion of the Member States to prevent the contamination of groundwater from dangerous substances, we shall set this issue a long way behind existing legislative texts whereas, on the contrary, we need to push forward, to deal effectively with serious pollution from nitrates and to become more effective in our prevention policy."
"My political group therefore wants a legally binding text, which is clear and has strict consequences for those who infringe it, based on prevention and on continual control by the European Commission."
"To deny this common responsibility towards European citizens and consumers would be a dangerous mistake."
"."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome this proposed directive, the intention of which is to ensure that groundwater quality is monitored and evaluated across Europe in a harmonised way."
"It sets out an inherently flexible approach to establishing quality criteria, taking account of local characteristics and allowing for further improvements."
"I welcome the measures established in the directive, which lays down mandatory criteria for assessing the chemical status of groundwater and for identifying trends in the pollution of groundwater bodies, while also introducing measures for protecting groundwater from indirect pollution."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the directive should be made more ambitious and effective."
"In many parts of the European Union and Ireland where there are no rivers or lakes, or these are polluted, groundwater is often the only source of fresh water."
"We are fortunate in my country to have fresh water resources, and must ensure that future generations have access to the same quality and supply of that water."
"As we develop, pressure on that resource has increased and will continue to do so. Groundwater is a resource that we need to protect because once it is polluted it cannot be used for many years."
"This generation – or any other for that matter – has no right to destroy or deplete such a rare and precious resource."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to say a word of thanks to Mrs Klaß for the work she has done in expertly piloting this dossier through second reading."
"The fact that her report has received unanimous approval in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety demonstrates that she has taken a line with which many can identify."
"We cannot do other than conclude that the common position adopted by the Council last year is out of synch with the line this Parliament took at first reading."
"Particularly with regard to the definition of decline, this common position could do with some further sharpening-up."
"Fortunately, tomorrow, we will be adopting many amendments which will considerably improve the common position."
"One that springs to mind is Amendment 30, which concerns the harmonisation of measuring methods."
"We know that certain Member States achieve excellent results because they over-adjust their measurements."
"Amendment 30 will in any event mean that those methods are monitored, which is a welcome development."
"In the Netherlands too, groundwater is used for extracting drinking water."
"It is also a back-up supply for future generations."
"Since pollution destroys resources, it must be avoided at all costs."
"I should like to ask for your support for Amendment 44, which was tabled by my group colleague, Mr Bonde."
"An identical amendment was accepted in respect of the fluorine gas directive, and eventually ended up being incorporated into it."
"Should you feel that this amendment goes too far, I would urge you to support Amendment 37 in any case."
"I am still left with a question for Commissioner Dimas. He claimed that the objectives of the nitrate directive and this groundwater directive are the same."
"My question is then whether it would be necessary for this nitrate directive to continue to exist alongside this groundwater directive in future."
"I look forward to his response."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank my fellow MEP, Mrs Klaß, for her report because I agree that the current legislation on ground water protection is vague in setting quality and quantity standards."
"We are all aware that in many parts of the European Union the quality of water is inadequate."
"I think it is important to focus on prevention; however, we also need to attend to cleaning ground water sources where they have already been polluted."
"I believe that the Member States have been given too much leeway in setting water quality standards."
"Experience indicates that enforcing compliance by Member States, especially where environmental policy issues are concerned, is often time-consuming and occasionally necessitates proceedings at the European Court of Justice."
"As ground water recognises no borders, it would be more efficient if the Member States had a uniform framework regulating the chemical state and quality of water instead of each country having their own standards."
"Since ground water travels slowly below the Earth’s surface, human activities impact on the quality of this water in no small measure."
"Mismanagement of landfills, the existence of illegal landfills often containing very dangerous waste, industrial and agricultural activities or inadequate sewerage systems all endanger the quality of ground water and subsequently the state of health of the population."
"Adopting binding European legislation by setting ground water quality standards appears to be the easiest solution."
"At the same time, it would be necessary to track the implementation of this legislation by means of effective monitoring by the European Environment Agency."
"Slovakia, too, is facing major problems in supplying drinking water to the public."
"Approximately half of the country is supplied from ground water sources; the rest relies on surface water."
"This is where significant pollution occurs, as this part of the country lacks a completed sewerage system."
"With inadequate or non-existent sewerage systems in some areas, especially in eastern Slovakia, it is fair to say that people there are drinking impure water."
"Such water is often the cause of high morbidity due to gastrointestinal and infectious diseases."
"In fact, funds that would be better used to complete sewerage systems are being wasted on expensive treatments and vaccination."
"Mr President, life would not be possible without good-quality groundwater."
"Unfortunately, until now this issue has not been viewed with the seriousness it calls for."
"The directive now to be reformed, which covers the EU area, makes it possible to do more about the emissions that threaten the quality of groundwater."
"With this directive we must be able to ensure that intentionally or unintentionally harmful substances cannot get into groundwater."
"Prevention is therefore of the essence."
"Using European legislation we need to guarantee standards of protection that are as high as possible."
"Related to this is the fact that, for historical reasons and owing to natural conditions, there are different sources of emissions in the various Member States."
"For this reason it is only sensible that the Member States should be involved in producing lists of pollutants."
"When this is done, we will be able robustly to address the problem of those sources of emissions that are significant in each region."
"Resources should be allocated effectively in order that groundwater quality can improve everywhere in Europe and, furthermore, that the high quality that results can be preserved and maintained."
"Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking Mrs Klaß for her efforts."
"I particularly appreciated that whenever I wanted to see her, she was always available, even if we did not always see eye to eye."
"Everyone is, of course – as has been said many times – in favour of clean groundwater."
"There is an expression in Dutch that says: prevention is better than cure."
"If that is the shape of things to come, then we can only applaud this."
"I share Mr Blokland's view that it is vital that we should include in the compromise something about measuring methods."
"What matters most to me is that those measuring methods will not be the same across the entire European Union."
"They will need to be different on a sandy soil from what they are on clay and may need to be different in a short growing season than in a long one."
"Something that still causes me concern at the moment, and I have tabled amendments to that effect – and I do not always quote Mr Blokland, but he did raise the same subject this evening – is the relationship with other, existing legislation."
"The nitrate directive springs to mind, in particular."
"Is there the risk that Brussels will keep on piling one law on top of another without knowing what they are doing?"
"According to the Nitrate Directive, 1.7 large cattle unit may be kept per hectare."
"According to the Groundwater Directive, groundwater should not contain more than 50 milligrammes of nitrate."
"Imagine the following situation arises. A farmer keeps five cows per hectare and the nitrate content of his groundwater is 30 milligrammes."
"He is not complying with the Nitrate Directive, but he is with the Groundwater Directive."
"Which directive will prevail in that case? This sort of duplication in legislation requires a clear response."
"Hence my amendment that, when a progress report is issued, which it will be, then the Commission should give it its due attention."
"Although I can hardly imagine that someone should be opposed to this, I heard the rapporteur say that she is."
"I find this not only astonishing, but also regrettable, since all I am asking for is a better assessment in order to avoid duplication in legislation."
"This also applies to the discharge of manure, for that matter, for which legislation is already in place."
"We must avoid the average European citizen getting the impression that we are fabricating some sort of bureaucratic monster over which he has no control but which he has to obey unquestioningly."
"We in the Netherlands learned a great deal when we voted on the European Constitution more than a year ago."
"One of the arguments was clear: we do not want this bureaucratic monster in Brussels, and I am a little concerned that we, with this duplication in legislation, run a considerable risk of ending up with one after all."
"Hence my amendments."
"Mr President, groundwater has been a central issue for the environmental movement right since the movement began in the 1970s."
"We warned that both industry and agriculture were endangering this precious resource."
"‘Prophets of doom’ they shouted at us, ‘it will take at least 30 years’."
"Well, thank you very much indeed."
"In many places things went much quicker than that, but in some Member States we have, however, been able to keep the groundwater clean and to avoid having the dubious permits sought by all those who, instead of clean water, talked of healthy water with an in-built allowance for what humans and animals can tolerate."
"The attacks on our clean water continue."
"We have had a more or less serviceable Groundwater Directive, which allowed the Member States to preserve the requirement for clean water."
"Then we got a really good Water Framework Directive – a directive that has been a credit to the EU."
"What happens, however?"
"The agriculture lobby is now attempting to demolish the Water Framework Directive by the ugly tactic of weakening it wherever possible, as we see with the proposal for the new Groundwater Directive."
"Fortunately, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to repair the demolition work."
"It is now absolutely critical that its emendations be adopted."
"The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) has pointed out that 87% of European agricultural land is more polluted than the current guidelines recommend."
"In May, the EEB sent us a letter containing a powerful recommendation to support the reinstatement proposal on which we will be voting on Wednesday."
"At issue, in particular, are Amendment 22, part 1 and Amendments 24, 26 and 38, all of which are aimed at clarifying the regulations, and also Amendments 36, 42 and 43, which remove the absurd exemptions from the directive applying to agriculture – exemptions that would be an outright disgrace in terms both of the groundwater and of the reputation of the EU."
"If these amendments are not adopted, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will never be able to support proposals that undermine what we already have."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by adding my voice to the chorus of voices thanking the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work."
"If one compares the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with the common position of the Council, there is an enormous difference in quality in respect of environmental content."
"The common position of the Council reminds me a little of a Swiss cheese that is full of holes."
"The Member States will be able, to some extent, to do whatever they want with these holes – or chose to do nothing at all in certain areas."
"This is, in my view, entirely unacceptable."
"In the committee, there was a grand unanimity – 50 members voted in favour of the proposals and none voted against."
"This ought to give Mrs Klaß a very strong position, which I am certain she will make the best possible use of during the negotiations with the Council of Ministers."
"What is most important is the position of agriculture and that it should not be given a special status whereby it is exempted from the obligations otherwise applying."
"Most important of all is the issue of discharges of nitrates."
"Discharges of nitrates from agriculture are today perhaps the most serious source of groundwater pollution."
"In large parts of the EU, we have problems with levels of nitrates in the groundwater that are directly hazardous to health."
"Clearly, this means that we must act on what is the main problem, in this case the discharges from agriculture."
"As far as we are concerned, this is the absolutely critical issue."
"A reduction in the discharges of nitrates from agriculture would be excellent for the groundwater, but it would also have other positive effects."
"At present, nitrate discharges are also an important cause of the eutrophication of lakes, seas and other bodies of water."
"As we improve the situation for the groundwater we can also, at the same time, do something for other large-scale environmental problems."
"This will become clear, for example, in the case of the Baltic Sea, where we have great problems with eutrophication as a result of emissions from agriculture."
"In the light of all this, I should like to recommend that we vote in favour of the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and that we play tough in the conciliation with the Council of Ministers."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise a few points about groundwater which we have to keep in mind, even at this stage."
"The distinction between groundwater and surface water is not always clear."
"Water is not neatly compartmentalised in every location, so where these sources of water are linked, where they mingle, polluted surface water will pollute groundwater and vice versa."
"The pollution of ground and surface water is a concern in my constituency of Munster, particularly in view of environmental disasters like the deserted tailings pond in Silvermines, County Tipperary, the red mud and salt lake ponds which get bigger every day at Aughinish, an alumina extraction factory in Limerick, and Kilworth, North Cork, where liquid toxic waste is dumped in trenches and left to seep into the earth."
"Another concern is that Irish governments have systematically polluted surface and groundwater for the past 40 years in the water fluoridation programme, with the daily addition of hexafluorosilic acid, a bio-accumulating toxin."
"But there is another issue that we should take seriously."
"In this proposed directive, we deal with quality standards and pollutant levels in groundwater."
"However, we seem to waive sensible levels if the pollutant occurs naturally in groundwater."
"No matter how much of the pollutant is in the water, we seem to want to call that the baseline, the acceptable level."
"This will not work."
"Just because something is natural, it does not necessarily mean it is healthy."
"This mistake was made in India in 1970s and 1980s, in attempting to solve water shortages."
"International development funds were spent boring a large number of deep wells."
"The wells supplied a lot of water, but babies in the vicinity of many of those wells were born with congenital bone malformations."
"Skeletal diseases began to afflict the children and the adult populations too."
"Many of the wells had to be closed."
"The water was natural, but that did not make it safe."
"It had a significant content of fluoride that had no time to filter through the layers of mineral rock, which would have bound the fluoride to stabilising minerals like calcium, making them less toxic and less absorbable."
"A hundred years ago, people thought that water that was highly, if naturally, radioactive, was good and flocked to spas to drink and bathe in it."
"At first it made them feel wonderful, then it made them ill and then it killed them."
"Is it not possible that, theoretically, an industry with a particular type of toxic discharge could choose to locate itself in an area that had naturally polluted but natural groundwater?"
"We should consistently base our acceptable levels of polluting substances on what is acceptable, that is, what is safe and non-polluting and what is healthy if the water is to be drunk."
"Mr President, may I offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Klass for her fine work."
"I can enthusiastically endorse 99% of her report."
"I should also like to come back to what Mr Mulder said about our requiring comparable standards in Europe, not necessarily standards like those in Germany or the Netherlands but standards which ensure that comparable rules apply to all clay soils and to all sandy soils."
"When I hear my honourable colleagues, however – some of whom have already decamped again – I am quite astonished to note that the Nitrates Directive evidently has not yet been transposed in their respective countries, otherwise they would not be raising such a hue and cry."
"If their governments had transposed the Nitrates Directive – and I say this as one of the few farmers in this House who is still running a real farm – this situation could not arise."
"In the fields of Europe today, farmers can only use as much fertiliser as their crops will actually absorb."
"We can therefore conduct this debate again with those who really know the ropes and who do not believe it is enough simply to impose standards."
"It is certainly not enough."
"That is why the link with the Nitrates Directive is badly needed as a basis for intervention."
"The Commission had no option but to present a good proposal of this type, because as a farmer you can only influence what you yourself actually do in your own fields."
"With the best will in the world, you cannot influence the deposits that result from geogenic processes rather than your own agricultural activity; try as you might, the best you can hope for is that trends will be reversed over many decades, perhaps in 50 to 100 years."
"This is why I believe that the combination of a nitrates directive and a groundwater directive must be preserved, and I shall campaign actively for that."
"Moreover, my fellow campaigners are not confined to those who always champion the cause of clean air."
"The desire for pure air, water and soil were the crucial reasons for the decision I took 17 years ago to go to Brussels rather than stand for election to my national parliament."
"It was for this, Mrs Auken, that I fought with a will alongside your brother, who was Minister for the Environment at that time, and we managed to secure progress in many areas."
"He was involved, as you know, in the negotiation of the Nitrates Directive."
"Mr President, I should like to associate myself with the numerous congratulations offered to the rapporteur for her good work."
"With this report and the unanimous backing it has received from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have a good basis for drawing the fangs from the common position."
"Our vote tomorrow must send a clear signal on health and the environment, while our amendments, which are very likely to be adopted tomorrow, strengthen Article 6, thereby making it a clear sign of intent to protect the environment more effectively."
"May I also stress that it is essential to avoid any exceptions."
"The common position provides for an exception for pollutants from diffuse sources."
"It is important that the amendment relating to this provision should be adopted."
"Such an exception would complicate the monitoring of diffuse sources and lead to legal uncertainty."
"One of the keys to the protection of our groundwater is a set of uniform European standards for the main pollutants."
"Only with such standards can distortions of competition and environmental dumping be prevented."
"The ceiling for nitrates should be set at 50 milligrams, and there must be no exceptions for agricultural activity, which is primarily responsible for the pollution of groundwater in many parts of Europe."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendments formulated to this effect."
"Mr President, I add my congratulations to Mrs Klaß on her excellent report."
"On the subject of the protection of groundwater, there has undoubtedly been a profound difference of understanding and the consequent will to act between Parliament, on the one hand, and the Commission and the Council, on the other."
"It has been obvious for all to see that both the Commission’s proposal and the Council’s common position fall short of the remit issued in Article 17 of the Groundwater Framework Directive of 2000."
"This is both sad and disturbing and causes, not unexpectedly, many questions to be asked in relation to the reasons behind this apparent lack of determination demonstrated by the aforementioned institutions."
"Why do the Commission and the Council not wish to have in place such groundwater protection requirements, which will safeguard the maintenance of groundwater in the most natural state possible?"
"Why do they not try to achieve through this legislation a level of groundwater quality which is of good drinking water standard?"
"Why is there no clear distinction made between such fundamentally important aspects as prevention and restoration?"
"Furthermore, why are so many significant matters, such as the assessment of the chemical studies of groundwater and the definition of the criteria for the reversal of rising concentration of pollutants, left to the discretion of the Member State, knowing full well that the action of some of these states will be wholly insufficient to combat the alarming rise of groundwater chemical pollution?"
"Only the Commission and the Council know the answers to these and many other related questions."
"An educated guess, however, would be that the influence of some Member States’ governments has been exceptionally powerful and overwhelming, because these states just do not have the will to improve the quality of their groundwater."
"An attempt is made in this report to transform the common position into a worthwhile piece of legislation, including areas such as the incorporation of the emissions-related approach, ensuring the clarity of the concepts employed, and dissolving the confusion caused by the hazy relationship between the various objectives in connection with the Nitrates Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Daughter Directive."
"Let us hope that, at the end of the day, legislation will be produced which will be both effective and ensure that the principle of comprehensive preventive groundwater protection is implemented."
"Mr President, I should like to add my voice to the thanks that have been expressed to Mrs Klass, who has set out a very ambitious stall in pursuit of this important aim, despite having to swim against a fairly strong tide, of course, from within our own ranks."
"I had, however, expected a more ambitious proposal from the Commission and the Council and in particular a clearer, more targeted and more enforceable common position."
"I do not believe that this common position of the Council does justice to Article 17 of the Water Framework Directive. Why?"
"Because it ignores the fact that groundwater is an ecosystem in its own right. Moreover, the requirements it makes regarding the protection of groundwater are not geared to the conservation of groundwater in the most natural state possible."
"Let us bear in mind that people throughout most of the territory of Europe obtain their drinking water from groundwater reserves and that this water can still be extracted fresh from the source without any treatment."
"That is how it must stay, and indeed there is even a need to improve the situation."
"Another main point of criticism is that the Member States are given wide discretionary powers, particularly with regard to the assessment of the chemical status of groundwater, to the specification of criteria for the reversal of growth in pollutant concentrations and to the definition of a starting point for the reversal of this trend."
"This naturally rules out the uniform implementation of the provisions of both the Water Framework Directive and the present daughter directive – with regard to the trend reversal, for example – from the outset."
"If the Member States already have to provide a full description of every substance as part of the measuring process – which is an extremely good requirement, in my view – we must surely see to it that Community or simply national quality standards are defined."
"Sampling procedures must be improved, and the wording of the instrument as a whole must be tightened in order to close loopholes that the Member States might exploit and to ensure that the whole directive is not watered down."
"Mr President, I welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur."
"This is a very important piece of legislation for us all."
"Pollution does not respect borders and the same goes for groundwater pollutants."
"I tabled some amendments at first reading and have the same considerations at second reading too."
"I support all mandatory measures and instruments for Member State cooperation on shared groundwater bodies."
"In Hungary, 90% of all drinking water comes from groundwater, so without Community-level limit values, drinking water standards can hardly be attained."
"Generally speaking, international cooperation helps to ensure compliance with drinking water limit values."
"In the age of global climate change, drinking water is one of the most important endangered natural resources."
"We have to do our best to ensure the good quality of our drinking water."
"This is really a Community-level issue."
"The nitrate trigger values proposed in the Nitrates Directive should be taken over as mandatory in the groundwater directive."
"We Hungarians, both here in Parliament and in the Council, support strict legislation on this matter."
"Mr President, when we talk about treasures hidden in the ground, these days everybody thinks of oil, natural gas or rare minerals, although we also have a more fundamental treasure: groundwater."
"In many countries, including Hungary, groundwater provides most of the drinking water, almost 90% of it."
"Therefore, it is important to protect this treasure from pollution, and this is only possible within the framework of cooperation between countries, because groundwater bodies do not take into account country borders."
"Also, the natural processes affecting the composition of groundwater extend over several decades, which means that pollution will not only affect us, but future generations, as well."
"Therefore it is important to create a strict law setting several definite limit values, which – let us admit it honestly – has only been partially successful, due to resistance from a few Member States."
"All is not lost yet, however."
"This is why I support the proposals regarding the specification of a separate nitrate limit value, and for the same reason I believe that we cannot exempt agriculture, either, because the exemption of agriculture would undermine the efficiency of the Directive."
"Obviously, the strict measures I advocate do not mean that we should forget about the different natural characteristics of each country."
"Just as clean natural waters can be a rare treasure of a country, natural pollution is also a characteristic that we must accept, especially when there is nothing we can do about it."
"There is no point in burdening such areas with regulations that cannot be complied with, and which pose unjustified restrictions on human activity."
"‘Sanus per aquam’ (health through water) is a very relevant Roman saying."
"Let us do everything in our power to ensure that it stays true."
"Thank you very much, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Klaß, the rapporteur, on her excellent work."
"Mr President, the safeguarding of groundwater from pollution is a good improvement to the Water Framework Directive."
"If one takes into consideration the geographical, or rather geological differences on the European continent, this is not a unifying document, but is nevertheless a step towards the protection of a significant and increasingly important natural resource."
"Against this positive background, it is surprising how some Member States can permit themselves complete ignorance concerning the agreements that have been reached."
"Half a year ago I presented to Parliament a report prepared by the Estonian Nature Protection Foundation on the pollution of groundwater with sulphates and the waste associated with the mining of oil shale, which is very important in the Estonian energy industry."
"The initiative originated from Claude Turmes, who in one of his speeches called for third sector reports to be represented alongside those presented by governments."
"Essentially, this is about the wasteful use of a natural resource; that is, the subsidising of energy production at the expense of the natural environment and the inhabitants of the region surrounding the mining area."
"This water is not reflected in the price of electricity, which distorts the energy market, also making the implementation of renewable energy sources more difficult."
"The price of bottled groundwater is at least one thousand times more expensive than the water that comes from the waterworks of European cities."
"Thus pollution is in this case also a straightforward economic mistake."
"My question, of which my colleagues have already spoken here, is whether the Commission has sufficient authority to bring this waste under control?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Klaß for a job well done."
"She cites as the main sources of water pollution incorrect farming methods, the lack of high-quality infrastructure, drainage networks and water treatment plants in rural areas, along with lignite and coal mines and the flow of highly salinated water."
"Undoubtedly the directive as drafted by the rapporteur will make a significant contribution to improving water quality in the European Union."
"The use of organic fertiliser in farming is a major question."
"In many farms fertiliser is applied after the harvest has been taken in, the land is ploughed, the soil remains covered in snow until spring, and the soluble nitrogen and phosphorus compounds penetrate deep into the soil, ultimately polluting the groundwater."
"Protecting groundwater therefore requires changes in farming and forestry methods which could reduce income in these sectors, which is why the introduction of a system for providing special aid should be considered when drawing up rural development plans under the reformed common agricultural policy."
"The main problem in protecting groundwater is, however, our way of thinking."
"Who cares about something that cannot be seen and is hidden deep underground?"
"Educational activities should therefore constitute an important element in implementing the principles set out in the directive."
"Bringing about such a revolution in the way society thinks requires active efforts."
"European initiatives such as INTERREG III could become perfect tools for achieving such goals."
"An example of a project that has been implemented in a Polish city is the MAGIC project for managing underground water resources on sites affected by industrial pollution."
"Its aim is to involve various social groups, and young people and businesses as well as local authorities."
"These activities may fall outside the provisions of the directive on groundwater protection, but they do help to achieve its fundamental objectives."
"Mr President, chemical pollution of groundwater has been happening for years, but with the development of the chemical industry the problem has got significantly worse."
"Subterranean waters migrate, and it will be difficult to achieve positive results in their preservation without changes in regions of other EU Member States, both near and more distant."
"For that reason I would like to raise one of many important issues."
"The proposal for a directive proposes upper limits for pesticide content."
"However, in addition to the pesticides used for current production, there are tens of thousands of tons of old pesticides stored in individual countries, the majority of them poorly protected – if at all – from the effects of rainfall, wind and humans who continue to use these combinations of various pesticides to protect their plants."
"It may appear that the quantity of pesticides used on the surface is falling, but we know that there are also large quantities in groundwater."
"If we want to protect groundwater, and therefore our health, we can, and indeed must, find the funding to deactivate and eliminate such stores of pesticides."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks to Mrs Klass for her good work in connection with both readings of this draft directive."
"I wish her well in maintaining her resilient stance."
"We are largely in agreement in committee on the thrust of our aims, as you know, and we shall defend them resolutely against the Council and the Commission."
"The groundwater directive is ultimately about prevention and rehabilitation, and I personally find the preventive approach more appealing."
"It goes without saying that all the people of Europe should have access to groundwater of sufficiently high quality."
"What should groundwater comprise apart from water?"
"Nothing, in my view, apart from naturally occurring minerals and dissolved substances."
"The quality of water is not the same throughout Europe."
"On geological grounds alone, that could never be the case, nor is it desirable or necessary, but at the end of the day we want high-quality water with no adverse impact on public health to be available to all Europeans."
"Up to 80% of drinking water is obtained from groundwater in various countries, such as Germany and Austria and much of southern England."
"The availability of pure groundwater will be a determinant factor in future corporate location decisions."
"Failure to protect water and to keep it clean from the outset means accepting a wide range of extra expenses and long-term contamination of water resources."
"I believe the proposed directive is consistent with the Water Framework Directive and the Nitrates Directive, as is only right and proper."
"For nitrates and pesticides, however, we have no need to make any further exceptions, since, as Mr Florenz also said, responsible farmers are able to live with the existing limits."
"I support the draft directive."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"No one here disputes the need to protect and improve groundwater, because it is an important source of drinking water."
"We all know how dreadful it is to drink contaminated water."
"Our record in transposing environmental directives is not good."
"Many people this evening have mentioned the Nitrates Directive, which dates back to 1991."
"There are still many Member States, including Ireland, which are struggling to implement it."
"Has the Commission asked itself why this directive is proving so problematic?"
"I would also ask the Commission to outline, perhaps tonight, who is and who is not implementing it, with specific emphasis on the Irish situation."
"I have two questions on the Groundwater Directive, concerning Amendments 36 and 43, which remove the provision clarifying the relationship between the Nitrates Directive and the Groundwater Directive where there is an overlap."
"If these amendments are adopted, I believe we may be left with two different regimes operating simultaneously for nitrates from agricultural sources."
"Perhaps the Commission could clarify this issue."
"Given that we have such a poor record in implementing the Nitrates Directive, having two different regimes dealing with nitrates is not a good idea and may even prove unworkable."
"Tackling environmental problems requires education and information campaigns aimed at all sectors: farmers, industrialists and homeowners."
"The agriculture problem debated this evening and referred to so frequently arose because, in the past, farmers followed the advice of experts who encouraged the increased use of inputs with scant awareness of the environmental impact that advice would have."
"Ironically, some of that advice was supported through EU and Member State funding."
"We now need a sustained campaign to promote greater environmental awareness, including a campaign to highlight the importance of keeping groundwater unpolluted and the possible means of achieving this."
"I look forward to the Commission clarifying the important relationship between the three directives: the water framework, nitrates and groundwater directives."
"Mr President, allow me to summarise the Commission's views on certain vital issues raised by Parliament."
"The amendments relating to the definition of the deterioration in groundwater and regulations for nitrates are exceptionally important."
"Amendments 12, 18 and 23 propose provisions for maintaining the status quo as regards the quality of groundwater."
"At the same time, the aim is to prohibit any adverse changes in concentrations of pollutants in groundwater."
"I endorse the rapporteur's comment that vigilance is required in order to prevent any deterioration in the quality of groundwater."
"Nonetheless, the concern that the new directive possibly leaves a margin for additional pollution is addressed through the demand in Article 5 for any important upward trends in concentrations of pollutants to be identified and reversed."
"In addition, maintaining the status quo is not in keeping with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, in accordance with which the quality of groundwater must be managed so as to prevent any deterioration."
"As such, the above amendments cannot be accepted."
"As regards regulations on nitrates, the Commission can accept Amendment 36 proposing that the reference to the Nitrates Directive be deleted."
"The Commission considers that this reference is unnecessary if account is taken of the relevant provisions of the Water Framework Directive."
"As regards programmes of measures to reverse trends in concentrations of nitrates of agricultural origin, it should be noted that the relevant provisions of the Nitrates Directive still cover these programmes, in which case there is no need for them to also be included in this directive, which is why the Commission can accept Amendment 43."
"I should like to repeat here that the Nitrates Directive, the Water Framework Directive and this directive have the same objectives as regards the prevention and limitation of contamination from nitrates."
"Similarly, there are no material differences as regards their legally binding nature and the measures required or the various deadlines."
"Furthermore, the Nitrates Directive is still important, given that the European Union's water policy aims to address pollution at source."
"However, it must be incorporated into the general administrative structure of the Water Framework Directive."
"Certain other amendments are acceptable, such as the references to the common agricultural policy, the storage and recovery of groundwater and research."
"Similarly, the new definitions of the terms 'background concentration' and 'baseline concentration' and the corresponding references are acceptable."
"On the other hand, the Commission cannot agree with Amendment 15, the objective of which is to base standards for groundwater on human and ecotoxicological criteria, given that this issue is dealt with adequately in the Drinking Water Directive."
"Similarly, Amendments 24, 25, 28 and 29 concern matters already covered by the Water Framework Directive and consequently cannot be accepted."
"To close, may I say that the Commission accepts 9 amendments in full and another 19 in principle or in part."
"Nonetheless, 19 amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission."
"I shall file a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments with Parliament's secretariat(1)."
"I should also like to again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, on her excellent work."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to put a supplementary question to the Commissioner."
"Did I hear correctly just now that the Commission can accept Amendments 36 and 43?"
"That is precisely what we have been discussing from such diametrically opposed positions here."
"Perhaps the translation has confused the issue somewhat."
"Could you explain what you said, Commissioner?"
"I should be delighted if you could accept these amendments too, because they relate, of course, to the mutual compatibility of the directives."
"What I heard seemed to be open to interpretation, and a few explanatory words would be welcome."
"We have accepted those amendments."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon."
"I am pleased to say that there are 28 amendments which the Commission can accept fully, in part, or in principle."
"These are amendments: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 31, 36, 37, 38, 40, 43, and 47."
"The amendments which the Commission cannot accept are numbers: 4, 12, 15, 18, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45 and 46."
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0081/2006) by Frieda Brepoels, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (12064/2/2005 – C6-0054/2006 – 2004/0175(COD))."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, environmental policy is without a doubt one of the EU’s biggest successes, and Community legislation is essential in order to tackle the major environmental challenges Europe is facing."
"Better access to spatial information is of key importance if we want to involve the public more in the implementation of environmental policy at all administrative levels."
"As you know, we want to use INSPIRE to set up an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe in which the exchange and sharing of data between governments is paramount."
"It also wants to be, of course, the driving force behind collating new relevant environmental information and eventually, it will also be an instrument to make environmental policy more efficient and effective across the borders."
"Existing data infrastructures and existing environmental information in the Member States will, after all, be better harmonised and also made intelligible at EU level."
"This proposal has its sights on both information that is required to monitor the state of the environment and information improving that state."
"In my view, all policy decisions that impact on the environment, either directly or indirectly, stand to benefit from this."
"Allow me to give you a few examples."
"In order to protect the citizens against floods – and that is something that Mr Seeber as rapporteur will be able to confirm in a moment – the standardisation and exchange of data on river basins, water courses and risks are invaluable."
"We will also be able to monitor and be prepared for forest fires, like those we have seen in southern Europe, provided we have data on soil types, vegetation, humidity levels and wind direction."
"Similarly, on the basis of data on migration of fish shoals, the warmth of the water and pollution, a better balance can be struck between the needs of the fishing industry on the one hand and the continued existence of certain fish species on the other."
"Finally, in the context of bird flu, for example, as we are experiencing it, or not yet, hopefully, our joint reaction could be even more efficient if data on poultry farms, wild fauna and migratory birds across the borders were to be made available."
"In a number of other major European projects, such as GMIS, too, the added value is considerable, since INSPIRE can be the supplier of data that is needed to set up, within GMIS, an operational global information system for monitoring the environment and safety."
"Enough, though, about INSPIRE’s importance and added value for those who were still in any doubt about this."
"I should like to say a few words about the procedure, because about a year ago, we approved the report at first reading almost unanimously in this Chamber."
"At the end of the Luxembourg Presidency, the Council reached political agreement and the common position followed in January of this year."
"In the report at second reading, as we are discussing it today, the Commission on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety once again emphasised a few elements which we regard as very important but which were scrapped in the common position."
"Let me list the most important ones for you."
"To us, the search services and consultation services for the public are vital and should, in principle, be free."
"Downloading for free is not an issue."
"It is possible, but not compulsory."
"The possibility to build in click licences remains, and for the sake of clarity: the sale of, for example, maps or atlases remains unaffected."
"Parliament is also opposed to endless analyses and additional feasibility studies so as not to overwhelm INSPIRE in advance."
"Also, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Safety takes the view that intellectual property rights on the part of government bodies cannot be an argument for refusing access to environmental data."
"When data is exchanged between government services, compensation or licences are not ruled out."
"The proposal even provides for the fact that the financial viability of government bodies should be of concern to the Member States."
"Along with my fellow shadow rapporteurs, whom I would like to thank warmly for the very constructive cooperation in this very difficult and very technical dossier, I therefore regret that we failed to reach agreement with the Council at second reading."
"Despite this, an open and honest dialogue in the general interest should be possible, even during a conciliation procedure, and I think that this report is an excellent starting point."
"I would once again like to thank the Committee and all fellow Members for their support."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, on her excellent work on the proposal being debated."
"The formulation of correct policies, from bird 'flu, which you mentioned, to floods, depends on the existence of good information."
"Environmental policy at European Union level or at national level depends in particular on spatial information or, in other words, on information which can be placed geographically on a map."
"All other sectors also depend on similar, high quality information."
"Agricultural and regional policy, for example, rely in particular on the existence of spatial information."
"The formulation of our policies is hampered by the fact that spatial information is often isolated in systems which are not easily accessible."
"Similarly, in certain instances, data are classified in such a way that it is impossible to combine them with other sources, with the result that the evaluations needed in order to formulate policies cannot be carried out."
"The proposed INSPIRE directive aims to address the problems in question by improving the accessibility and interoperability of the spatial information systems kept by the public authorities of the Member States."
"In this way, the potential offered by modern technology as regards access to the information we need can be developed in the best possible way."
"Collating the individual experiences of the Member States is in this case a clear example of the added value of the proposed directive at European Union level."
"At first reading, the Commission accepted most of the amendments proposed by Parliament."
"Unfortunately, the Commission was not in a position to accept the Council's common position, given that it considerably weakened elements of the Commission proposal."
"The most basic issues are as follows: the degree to which the public will have electronic access to spatial information, the removal of barriers to common use of spatial information between public authorities and the comitology procedure for the introduction of implementing rules."
"It is with satisfaction that I find that, for the most part, the issues in question have been addressed thanks to the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"These amendments reflect satisfactorily the initial spirit and objectives of the proposal."
"Consequently, the package of amendments constitutes a good basis on which to proceed to the compromise procedure with the Council."
"Given that many of the Member States continue to have reservations as regards basic issues, it is clear that they will demand concessions on both sides."
"I should like to assure you that the Commission will make every possible effort to facilitate the achievement of an agreement to the satisfaction of all sides."
"Mr President, I would like to thank in particular Mrs Brepoels, the rapporteur, for all the excellent work she has done in listening to the various views and concerns, trying to find a way through on what is essentially a theme we all support, that is, greater access to information for the public and people who need to know, initially with the environmental theme in mind, and then going on, as the Commissioner has indicated, to agriculture, transport and so on."
"There is a problem, as he has indicated, and I think that like the last measure this will have to be resolved in conciliation, but there are one or two concerns which still need to be recognised and addressed."
"Certainly, as Mrs Brepoels knows well – in fact she is probably tired of hearing about it – there is concern, particularly on the part of the Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom, which has a very long tradition of map-making and geographical plotting."
"It is concerned because of the inability to charge for services."
"That is possible, but if it happens it might end up in a rather long queue for taxpayers’ support, as opposed to being able to recover at least some of its costs, as it has been doing over generations."
"That is a concern we have to recognise and try to meet."
"My second point, perhaps a more serious concern, is the concern that comes from defence sources."
"If you were to allow unrestricted access to discovery metadata, it would be possible to identify trends in areas that are being surveyed, for example, to provide information about naval patrol routes, allowing anyone who intends to commit terrorist attacks or any other maritime crime to track, intercept or avoid naval vessels."
"Again it is an issue."
"It needs addressing and if we can get these things under control, then I am sure we have a measure here which we can all welcome and move forward with."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Brepoels for her work and also express my gratitude in view of the efforts to reach a compromise with the Council at this second reading."
"I have absolutely no doubt about the usefulness of this proposal as a fundamental tool for drawing up, applying, monitoring and evaluating environmental policies at all levels and policies or activities which directly or indirectly affect the environment."
"Furthermore, I believe that it is appropriate to base this Community infrastructure on the spatial data infrastructures established and managed by the Member States, in full application of the principle of subsidiarity, particularly when the Member States have several levels of public administration – as is often the case."
"There is no question that the exchange of data amongst public authorities represents the key added value of INSPIRE."
"That must be the principle governing the provisions of Article 17."
"In any event, I would like to stress that, in the event that in the end costs are involved, those costs should be reasonable."
"I also believe that it is crucial that it has been designed as an instrument for providing public information."
"In this regard, we hope that INSPIRE complements public sector information and the Directives on access to environmental information adopted in application of the Aarhus Convention, which we approved recently, and that it deal with a series of issues not provided for in those Directives, such as the sharing of data amongst public authorities and issues of interoperability."
"This instrument must serve to exploit as far as possible the benefits and possibilities that the globalisation of data and services offers to governments, to private enterprise, to universities, to society as a whole and, most importantly, to the citizens."
"I believe that it is important because it brings us up to date with something that is already common as a result of the Internet and the information that it provides."
"I therefore hope that this Directive will be promoted most firmly by all sectors and levels of administration and that, in conciliation, we can finally achieve a good instrument that can fulfil all of these objectives."
"– Mr President, of course the sharing of information is a laudable goal, but there are specific issues."
"Mr Bowis has already referred to one of them as it relates to the United Kingdom."
"I should like to focus on that for a moment."
"The Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom is highly developed and sophisticated."
"Indeed, in my constituency in Northern Ireland, we have our own service, which also shares that world-leading status."
"It has been built up by investment in the most technologically-developed equipment available and by nurturing a skill base over many years."
"As a result, there is a valuable intellectual property right attached to the innovative spatial data that has been collected."
"It seems to me that the common position of the Council on the INSPIRE Directive largely recognises and protects those realities."
"However, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of this House apparently wants to mount a smash-and-grab raid, so that what has been built up expensively over decades is made available to all, at no cost."
"I am not opposed to the sharing of information and data across Europe, but it must come with a price attached when it has cost so much to acquire."
"Information exchange of that nature must be on the basis of trade, not a handout."
"The fact that data has a monetary worth is the key to future progress and future development."
"Therefore I very strongly feel that the better position is the common position and that the committee’s amendments are taking us backwards in a direction that will have the effect of damaging what has been built up and has been so good, for example, in the Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom."
"We do not want to threaten the financial sustainability of spatial data collection in the UK or elsewhere."
"That, I fear, would be the consequence of some of these amendments."
"Mr President, may I also thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and particularly for the commitment she has put into this report."
"Listening to various honourable Members, one has the impression that their countries should never have acceded to this Union, because everything is evidently better where they live, and the Union makes nothing but mistakes."
"I nevertheless believe that a common policy on the environment is something that benefits all European countries – even those that already have exemplary arrangements – because environmental problems simply do not stop at national borders."
"This instrument, which we have gratefully received from the Commission and which our honourable colleague has dealt with so well, is further evidence that we need European provisions."
"The fact is that we need common spatial information, especially for environmental purposes, in order to support the development of accessibility standards and, as far as possible, to create a geodata structure that functions effectively throughout the EU."
"There is, however, a need to establish where responsibilities lie: who generates the information, who is responsible for maintaining and updating it, and whose property it is."
"It is imperative that we build up this metadata and disseminate it widely."
"At the same time, there are some problems we must address, such as liability issues."
"If we pass on very detailed data, most of which is municipal data, by which I mean information compiled by local authorities, we must always ensure that we also communicate the conditions of use."
"We must also take into account that the local authorities will suffer some loss of income."
"As envisaged in the report, it should be permissible to levy charges for the transmission of data."
"It would also be logical for the decision on the amount of the charge to be taken by the authority compiling the data."
"Another problem is that the data we generate should be as homogeneous as possible, and this will entail a degree of harmonisation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like you to allow me to congratulate my honourable friend on the efforts which she made on the report in question and the results so far."
"Indeed, the time has come throughout Europe for us to seriously address the question of the lack of infrastructures and records of spatial information available, especially on environmental and public health issues, for starting a new effort as the basis for a series of services to citizens, high-level services available to everyone, without limitations and, most importantly, available to the public services and to other agencies with the facility for access from the Internet."
"We have a common objective: to break away from the philosophy of concealing information, to understand that we have to gain from the common and free provision of spatial information."
"The public agencies will be able to find information more easily and, of course, the citizens will be able to access sensitive data, so as to formulate an opinion and be able to participate in real consultation procedures."
"Finally, we need to highlight the particular lack of infrastructure in numerous Member States, something for which specific measures will probably be needed that we will have to take into account in any proposals relating to the INSPIRE directive."
"Mr President, many of the proposed amendments relate to basic issues in the common position."
"Amendments 13 and 14 concern the implementing rules that will need to be approved under the comitology procedure."
"These amendments avoid complicated procedures for approving rules and safeguard their uniform application in all the Member States."
"The Commission is therefore in a position to accept the amendments in question in full."
"Amendments 18 to 22 relate to public access to data and reflect the initial intention of the Commission's proposal."
"These amendments are acceptable in full, with the exception of Amendment 21, which is acceptable in principle."
"The intention of Amendment 21 is to replace the initial provision, on the basis of which free public access to information is safeguarded, and this is a position that the Commission can support."
"Nonetheless, there are – as I said earlier – certain categories of data which it is financially difficult for information providers to provide free of charge."
"Consequently, the final wording of this specific paragraph must cover these specific cases."
"Amendments 23 to 27 relate to exchanges of information between public authorities and are acceptable in full, with the exception of Amendment 24, which is acceptable in part."
"The first part of Amendment 24 is indeed of decisive importance, because is ensures that charges and licences will be made and issued by public information providers in keeping with the general obligation to exchange information."
"The second part of Amendment 24 concerns the amount of the charges made, which does not necessarily apply in all cases."
"Many of the other amendments restore the intentions of the initial proposal as regards less important issues or are amendments relating, for example, to the organisation of the coordinating structures in the Member States."
"All these are acceptable to the Commission in full or in principle or in part, with the exception of Amendment 15, which relates to the participation of the interested parties in preparatory discussions for the adoption of implementing rules."
"Amendment 15 is unacceptable, because it deletes a useful clarification contained in the Council text."
"I shall subsequently forward a full list of the Commission's positions on Parliament's amendments(1) and I would like once again to thank the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments in their entirety: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36."
"The following amendments are acceptable in part or in principle: 4, 8, 12, 21 and 24."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 15."
"The next item is the report (A6-0182/2006) by Mr Seeber, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment and management of floods [COM(2006)0015 C6-0020/2006 2006/0005(COD)]."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the excellent report which they have drafted at first reading."
"Floods are natural disasters and, as such, cannot be completely prevented."
"However, much can be done to limit the disastrous consequences which floods often have for the health and life of man, economic activity and property and the environment in Europe."
"In short, an ambitious and cohesive approach to flood risk management is needed throughout the territory of the European Union."
"This will safeguard for the citizens and for businesses a feasible and commonly acceptable level of protection."
"In addition, as the repercussions of climate change are becoming more and more apparent, floods throughout Europe are expected to become more extreme and unpredictable."
"This is another reason for taking action which will safeguard adequate and suitable flood risk management measures which will be reviewed on a regular basis so that they can be adapted to climate change."
"Fortunately, we did not start from zero."
"Following a series of extreme floods in the past, numerous Member States and regions have already made significant progress in flood management."
"The Commission obviously intends to ensure that the application of the directive is based on efforts already made and not to repeat or overlap with them."
"On this basis and following extensive consultations with the interested parties, the Commission tabled its proposal, which contains the following main points: preliminary evaluation of the flood risk, in order to identify the areas at high risk (with the possible repercussions of climate change on future floods being taken into account), flood risk maps, on which citizens and planning authorities can see the possible extent of floods and the damage which they may cause to man, businesses and the environment and cross-border coordination for catchment basins and coastlines which cross more than one country."
"The proposal requires flood maps to be prepared by 2013 and flood risk management plans to be prepared by 2015 for all catchment basins and coastlines found to be exposed to a high risk of flood."
"Finally, it should be noted that the proposal for a directive on flood risk management is closely linked to the framework directive on water resources approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2000."
"This directive established a new policy for water resources, a policy that introduces the principle of integrated management of river catchment basins."
"This approach does not simply incorporate in a single framework all the policies relating to the quality and quantity of water resources, it also safeguards cross-border coordination of catchment basins and coastlines which cross more than one Member State or even third countries."
"The principle of integrated management of catchment basins also constitutes an important element for flood risk management policies."
"Indeed, floods must be managed by regional and central governments in such a way as to reduce the risk of floods both at river estuaries and sources."
"That is why, as I said earlier, the principle of integrated management of catchment basins links this directive with the framework directive on water resources."
"It should further be emphasised that floods can indirectly cause damage and pollution from dangerous substances, with catastrophic repercussions on ecosystems and drinking water."
"Similarly, the construction of major flood defence works may prove to be harmful to water resources, reserves of water resources and sensitive ecosystems."
"Consequently, the link with the framework directive on water resources is very important."
"Finally, the proposal for a directive sets great store by subsidiarity and flexibility, so that the Member States will have the facility to find the most suitable solution for each area."
"Mr President, at this juncture I should like to express my special thanks to Commissioner Dimas and in particular to his staff and to the shadow rapporteur for their excellent cooperation in the drafting of this report."
"I believe that floods are truly a major environmental issue; we need only turn on our television sets to realise that they are happening more and more frequently."
"From 1998 to 2004 we had more than a hundred cases of serious flooding, especially on the banks of the Rivers Danube and Elbe in 2002."
"These floods cost 700 lives, half a million people lost their homes, and the cost of the damage came to about 25 billion euros."
"We had huge floods again last year, my home area being one of those directly affected, and so I believe that it makes good sense to consider at the European level what can be done to combat them."
"In particular, there is sound scientific evidence that the frequency and, more especially, the intensity of heavy rainfall have been increased by several factors connected with human activity."
"I am thinking, for example, of headlong urbanisation, particularly in high-risk areas."
"There are urban developments in critical areas, we build streets there, we alter the course of rivers and, sad to say, we allow ill-conceived building projects in overflow areas on river banks."
"Then there is deforestation, which means among other things that forestry can no longer perform its protective function."
"Intensive agriculture, which can impair the porosity of upper soil layers, encroachment on riverside meadows and flood plains, building developments on pasture land, etc., all contribute to soil erosion and increase the risk of severe flooding."
"For these reasons I very much welcomed the Commission’s proposal to present its flood action programme following the floods of 2000."
"Then came the Commission’s communication on flood management, and after that the Environment Ministers invited the Commission to present this proposal for a directive."
"Reference has already been made to the Water Framework Directive."
"Let me remind you that Article 1 of the framework directive proclaims the purpose of not only safeguarding and improving the aquatic environment but also of mitigating the effects of floods."
"I therefore believe that this initiative from the Commission is taking us in the right direction."
"The European regulatory framework is absolutely essential, especially in view of the fact that water bodies and watercourses do not respect national borders, and not even the best of national strategies can guarantee success."
"Thankfully we do have Member States, such as Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, and Austria too, that have undoubtedly made a good deal of progress already."
"But their efforts are thwarted by the fact that most strategies are purely national in character."
"If we do create this European regulatory framework, however, we must still place special emphasis on the subsidiarity principle."
"This is why I took particular care to address this issue again in my report."
"I explicitly mentioned it in several places because I believe that the Member States themselves are essentially responsible for determining the level of protection they intend to afford their citizens and that they should act independently, especially with regard to their choice of safeguards."
"In this respect, I feel it is especially important that the report takes the level of regulatory detail into account, that we do not go too far into detailed regulation at the European level and above all that we remain aware of another danger connected with the committee procedure, namely that of prescribing to the Member States rules formulated in a way which makes them politically undesirable."
"We should also take care to ensure that the Member States can implement the directive with the least possible administrative and technical input."
"Previous work should be protected; in other words, full account will be taken of the efforts Member States have already made to combat flooding."
"There is therefore no way in which parallel European rules can be used to compel Member States whose work on flood defences is already far advanced to implement a different set of measures, even though their own existing system already works perfectly."
"Associated with this is the need for close synchronisation with the Water Framework Directive, so that everything in the daughter directive lies within the scope of its parent directive."
"The principle of solidarity is also important."
"This means that no Member State should take any action that harms any other Member State."
"The principle that the premier-league nations should always consult those in the lower division is extremely important, in my view."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Seeber for his very effective work on this important report."
"What we have now is a proposed directive, which is strong enough to offer people protection without duplicating the work done by other authorities, particularly at the regional and the local levels and which is also good for the environment."
"I was particularly interested in this proposal because some years ago a region in Wales suffered very serious flooding, and that highlighted the inadequate measures then in place to prevent or to cope with such a natural disaster."
"Much of the suffering and disruption created could have been avoided."
"With the increasing effects of climate change on our environment, it is essential for us to have a coordinated and well thought-out approach to flooding, which is increasing in both frequency and intensity in the EU."
"Of course, we do not want to prevent all flooding."
"Floods are a natural phenomenon and they are important for maintaining the ecological functioning of an ecosystem."
"But we need sustainable flood risk management and relevant policies and financial mechanisms to deliver that."
"With flood levels increasing, dykes, dams and other infrastructure measures are failing to provide protection, so these need to be assessed in a comprehensive way."
"Cost recovery measures also need to be introduced, making economics work for the environment."
"We have to promote measures that work with nature in managing floods, not against it, and must understand, for example, that areas currently with no flood risk may be of huge flood mitigation value in the future, and include them in the maps and plans."
"Finally, in order for this directive to be effective and enforceable and to reduce bureaucracy, it should fully respect the Water Framework Directive, and I would ask colleagues to support the amendments I have put forward for my group, which would ensure the compatibility of the two."
"Mr President, may I too express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, for his work."
"There can be no doubt that we must do something to prevent these flood disasters."
"In my opinion, however, we could also achieve adequate flood protection in Europe without a directive on the assessment and management of floods."
"That is my firm conviction."
"The Commission, as we all know, originally announced a communication, not a directive."
"We as politicians have a duty, now more than ever, to avoid unnecessary red tape in the form of European directives."
"For this reason I actually believe that we can achieve the same ends by other means, such as enhanced cooperation."
"One thing must, in any case, be clear: if we have to adopt a directive, it must take account of the Member States’ previous efforts."
"This is the protection of previous work to which the rapporteur also referred."
"If the aim of a new directive is already being pursued by Member States with the aid of appropriate measures, we in the European institutions should respect that."
"It is therefore absolutely imperative that consideration be given to efforts which Member States are already making."
"If Member States have already compiled flood maps for particular areas or in cases where a risk assessment has already been carried out, such work should not be devalued by directives, and there must be no obligation on these states to compile new maps or carry out new risk assessments."
"That would create too much bureaucracy, which is something we must and will combat."
"For this reason, may I ask the House to support Amendment 71 in tomorrow’s plenary vote."
"This amendment, which was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, provides, among other things, for the Member States to opt against compiling flood-risk management plans if they already possess plans with which the aims of the directive can be effectively pursued."
"That is subsidiarity; that is flexibility."
"I would have liked to see more of that kind of flexibility, however."
"Local stakeholders should be able to decide, for example, which scale is most suitable for the mapping of each part of the river for the purposes of preventive flood management."
"That is one of the reasons why I am actually opposed in principle to a directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report and thank the Commission for presenting this directive."
"Together with Mr Seeber and other fellow Members, I visited some of the countries most affected by the flooding and we were able to observe the damage caused by the 2005 floods ."
"During our visit to Germany and Austria we listened to the people’s concerns, gathered suggestions from the regional authorities and observed examples of good practice in flood risk prevention and management."
"This contact with people on the ground was a very useful experience for us in drawing up our reports."
"Natural disasters are tending to recur with increasing frequency and with growing intensity."
"They are no longer events that happen once a century; now they recur every four years or every other year and their consequences are increasingly tragic."
"In Central Europe, for instance, in Bavaria, there was very severe flooding in 1999, 2002 and 2005."
"Already this year as well, thousands of people have had to abandon their homes and many factories have had to stop work, not only in Germany but also in other countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria."
"Some Member State governments have even declared a state of emergency in various regions, and there have already been victims to mourn."
"Natural disasters regularly leave a trail of destruction and death."
"Cities flooded, houses destroyed, millions and millions of euros’ worth of damage, and severe social and environmental problems are some of the obvious consequences of flooding."
"According to the World Health Organization, natural disasters kill hundreds of people every year."
"Mr Dimas said that we should be ambitious."
"Well, let us be ambitious in preventing disasters and creative in finding answers to questions like: What can we do to stop a natural phenomenon from turning into a disaster?"
"What can we do to prevent all the loss of human life, the ecological disasters and the social and economic problems that result from natural disasters?"
"The United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said in this respect that we have to move on from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention, and there is proof that prevention brings results."
"If we compare the flooding in Bavaria in 2002 and 2005, we see that in 2002 there were hundreds of victims and considerable damage, whereas in 2005, even though the flooding was five times worse, there was 30% less damage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, flooding is a disaster scenario that threatens many areas of Europe year after year."
"In the last few years alone, floods in Europe have cost hundreds of human lives, made hundreds of thousands of people homeless and caused billions’ worth of damage."
"Experts say that the likelihood of recurring floods is set to increase still further in future years."
"In the summer of 2002, many riverside areas in Central Europe were flooded."
"I myself come from Saxony, a region that was particularly hard hit by those floods, and many of you will no doubt recall the pictures of our flooded capital, Dresden."
"In the aftermath, my region, like many of the flood-stricken countries, was engaged not only in reconstructing and restoring the destroyed infrastructure but also in devising sound strategies for the long-term avoidance and management of floods in the affected areas."
"There were loud calls for European assistance at that time."
"The solidarity fund was set up even before a specific European directive was drafted."
"I would not question in principle the need for Community legal provisions and action plans, since most of Europe’s river basins are divided between two or more countries, and purely national strategies are sometimes inappropriate."
"In its proposal for a directive on the assessment and management of floods, the Commission has produced a great deal of unnecessary red tape."
"I should like to focus on two specific points."
"Firstly, the draft directive clearly infringes the subsidiarity principle, particularly in Articles 7 and 9."
"The idea that the Member States should have to compile flood-risk maps and management plans for parts of river basins is unacceptable."
"We should only make European rules for matters that need to be regulated on a European scale."
"The directive should concentrate on river basins straddling national borders."
"Secondly, little or no consideration is given to existing plans and measures."
"In many Member States there are already adequate arrangements for national water bodies and watercourses."
"The very countries that have suffered from flooding in the past now possess very good strategies and plans which take account of both the European flood-protection objectives and specific local conditions."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendment establishing a new Article 16a, which would recognise the Member States’ previous work inasmuch as it coincides with the aims of the directive."
"Countries must be given the necessary leeway in this respect, for our failure to introduce a healthy dose of flexibility would make transposition a hugely expensive business for those very countries that have already done a great deal of work in developing efficient strategies."
"The draft must be adjusted accordingly."
"We say yes to European flood prevention but no to infringement of the subsidiarity principle and to unnecessary red tape."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Seeber on his work. My congratulations to him."
"In this House today we have described underground sources of water as a key natural resource."
"We have to protect them against contamination."
"Now, conversely, we are discussing ways of protecting ourselves against the destructive effects of water as an element, or in other words against floods."
"Here I must emphasise the need for close cooperation on this among the Member States and countries outside the European Union."
"Obviously we cannot disregard the principles of subsidiarity and flexibility."
"I do think, however, that some standardisation both as regards legislation and the principles governing crisis management in the event of floods, and as regards ensuring full compatibility of life-saving equipment, is necessary."
"This will make rapid and coordinated help possible, which is very important in the basins of rivers that flow through more than one country."
"The rapporteur rightly puts great emphasis on avoiding floods and the need for protection and an early-warning system."
"In addition, the inhabitants of threatened areas need to be properly prepared, both through education in schools and by smoothly functioning civil defence systems."
"In Poland, where this year we experienced flood damage both in the Podkarpackie region and in Malopolska, the Volunteer Fire Brigade have played a very important role in rescue operations for many years, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank them publicly for that."
"I would like to add my voice to those who regard the careless use of farmland as having a negative effect on the threat of floods, along with the careless felling of forests, the siting of residential areas in flood plains and so on. We should note that only a proportion of natural disasters, including floods, are caused by natural forces beyond human control."
"However, a significant number of these disasters, which often cause loss of life, injuries and huge material damage, are the result of human irresponsibility or indifference."
"Let us therefore be wise before the event and minimise our losses."
"The directive we are now debating aims to help with this, and let us hope it will be effective."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as one who lives in a country that is largely below sea level, my particular interest in the discussion of this directive will come as no surprise to you."
"I myself live six metres below sea level."
"In recent years, we have witnessed the disastrous impact floods can have."
"My country, that is not called ‘Nether Lands’ without reason, has been flooded several times."
"I therefore welcome a directive that should lead to better protection against floods."
"The proposal submitted by the Commission to Parliament does, however, contain a few elements that I find difficult to support."
"As far as I am concerned, this directive should first and foremost stipulate that Member States are not allowed to take measures that lead to major risks downstream."
"Much of the damage caused by floods appears to be the result of human intervention, such as canalisation, the development of water meadows, deforestation of hillsides, and suchlike. Specific measures can help prevent this damage."
"This will give the residents of the lowlands a basic sense of security."
"Hence my support for Amendments 61 and 62."
"Secondly, this directive should not specifically aim to reduce the risks."
"After all, this would be a gargantuan task in certain countries that already boast high levels of protection."
"In general, whilst I can say that I will be backing the changes that were made in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, my group deemed some five amendments necessary, of which Amendment 78 is the most important."
"Indeed, the Commission proposal for Article 9 can be interpreted in such a way that not only the plans, but also the implementation of the measures contained in those plans must be assessed by the Commission."
"That means that infringement procedures can be instituted against Member States for the non-implementation of those concrete measures."
"Not only does this lead to a totally different situation, for that has never been laid down in any directive, but this could also mean that Member States will make only very unambitious plans."
"I would like to find out from Commissioner Dimas what his view is on this, for this is a very fundamental point for me."
"I would like to finish off by thanking Mr Seeber for his excellent report."
"Mr President, the directives of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment and management of floods relate to phenomena that have been known for centuries."
"The flow of water changes as a result of the regulation of rivers, farming, the felling and disappearance of forests, and therefore training on how to react in the event of floods is needed to limit the effects and the threats."
"In places where dykes, embankments and polders have been built and there are no obstructions to the flow of water, far less damage was suffered during the ‘flood of the century’."
"Their roads were not destroyed, because they have large culverts and high bridges."
"The programmes for counteracting floods at the level of catchment areas within municipalities, districts and regions of the European Union need to be carried out with a great deal of imagination and make use of existing experience."
"The directives support all these activities."
"I would like to thank Mr Seeber for his work."
"Mr President, this directive of the European Parliament is an important step towards the safety of the whole of Europe."
"In July 1997 Poland suffered the worst floods seen in 200 years, which covered 2% of the country’s territory."
"This cataclysm had a huge economic, social and moral cost, with 55 deaths and the destruction of hundreds of thousands of homes, factories, water treatment plants, schools and historical buildings."
"The losses caused by the floods were estimated at PLN 13 billion, or in other words approximately EUR 3 billion."
"The floods later affected other European countries."
"The proposal for a directive emphasises that the plan’s main priority is the protection of human life."
"Between 1997 and 2005 more than 700 people died as a result of floods in Europe."
"To this is added the economic cost of flooded farms, costs associated with damage to transport networks and the environmental cost of chemical contamination, the flooding of landfill sites and soil erosion."
"This directive contains specific actions aimed at minimising the damage caused by floods, but we should also remember the ecological and environmental impact they have."
"The post-flood renovation carried out in many parts of the European Union led to significant and irrecoverable losses of river fauna and forests."
"Hydraulic engineering works were carried out using methods that led to a permanent imbalance in river and forest ecosystems."
"For this reason we need to pay serious attention to the methods of flood reconstruction so that they preserve, rather than destroy, the ecological balance."
"Mr President, first of all, my compliments to Mr Seeber."
"I think he has presented an excellent report, the broad outlines of which we will endorse."
"To millions of people in Europe, floods are a reality, and a scary one at that."
"In recent years, the Danube, Rhine and Meuse have all burst their banks, with devastating effects."
"An increasing number of people are faced with floods."
"The development of water meadows has intensified and river basins have been shortened."
"Water levels may well be rising as a result of climate change."
"It is because most rivers are international that it is essential that this problem be tackled at international level."
"Appreciative though I am of the Commission proposal, I do have two comments to make about it."
"First of all, the way in which this issue is to be tackled internationally is left too vague."
"The only stipulation is that problems must not be passed on."
"That is in fact too little in my view, for the question is, of course: what is meant by ‘pass on’?"
"That is why the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is asking for more flesh to be put on the idea of cooperation between Member States."
"We should be guided by the river’s natural course, which, in the case of many rivers and in many places, no longer exists, of course."
"The principle is clear, though: anyone who shortens or cuts off the river must compensate for it on their own territory, so that water is not rushed to countries that are downstream."
"That is simply a question of good neighbourhood policy, and that is why I am asking you to support Amendment 82."
"My second comment is about subsidiarity."
"Europe should not concern itself with more than is strictly necessary."
"There is every reason for this."
"Democracy should be as close to the citizen as possible, and that is why the PSE Group is asking us in Amendment 81 to abandon the application of planning and report obligations to rivers that run within the territory of a Member State, provided that this Member State guarantees the level of protection that is described in the directive on high water levels."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Seeber for the work he has carried out."
"I should like to emphasise the added value that this document will bring to the Union, in that it concerns global events that presuppose global action."
"Action at Union level cannot be confined to those river basins that encompass several countries, since the problem relates to all river basins."
"To confront this problem, we must make use of good practice in land surveying and in long-term precautionary measures, principally through land maintenance."
"In this connection I should also like to emphasise the added value that this sort of approach can contribute in the organisation of a satellite monitoring service for our territory. Such a service is absolutely essential, not least to give civil protection forces a framework for joint intervention; they will also need to intervene outside the borders of the Member States."
"In my view, there is no need for an excessively large bureaucracy to be able to respond effectively to such problems; what is rather needed is the capacity to supply examples and good practice aimed at guaranteeing the highest possible levels of prevention and of capacity for intervention."
"I should also like to refer back to the document about cartography tabled by Mrs Brepoels."
"To be able to intervene we must have georeferenced maps at our disposal."
"In a situation where maps are available in electronic format and on GPS receivers, it is absurd that obstacles are raised in order to sell paper maps."
"Mr President, the document we are discussing today is undoubtedly necessary, as it addresses the issue of assessing the threat of flooding and flood management."
"This is all the more important because floods are and will continue to be the most frequent natural disaster due to climate change, and also because of the possibility of flooding as a result of neighbouring countries releasing water from their reservoirs."
"A belated reaction, or no reaction, may lead to swollen rivers overflowing and causing an environmental risk and material losses, and even claiming human lives."
"Heavy rainfall can also cause rivers to flood, in particular in parts of Central and Northern Europe covering several different countries."
"As it stands, however, the directive gives the impression that floods will be a predictable and controllable phenomenon within the European Union, because a group of experts will manage them."
"Yet it does not address the issue of flooding in peripheral regions."
"Poland’s eastern border is also the border between the European Union and Belarus and Ukraine, which runs along the River Bug."
"It is hard to imagine coordinated rescue efforts between Poland and Belarus, for example, or cooperation within river basins between the relevant authorities."
"It is even more difficult to link all strategies and financial mechanisms, particularly those falling under the cohesion policy, which aims to eliminate or minimise the threats of flooding by way of rational policy measures."
"On the western banks of the River Bug, EU experts, local authorities and disaster management groups armed with maps of threatened areas and legal instruments, as well as financial analyses, may be able to ensure that any floods are kept under control with little loss."
"However, several metres further away, in the territory of Belarus or Ukraine, just across the EU border, the flooding of human settlements and factories could be quite severe, entirely uncontrolled and lead to environmental damage."
"The above scenario obviously ignores the laws of nature, because natural disasters, which undoubtedly include floods, do not recognise political borders."
"The directive should have paid greater attention to the areas bordering third countries, as is the case with Poland and Ukraine or Belarus."
"Such areas run a real risk of loss of human life and economic losses, as well as environmental pollution in both my country and other bordering states."
"What is naturally needed is flexibility, particularly in the case of the regulations implemented in the Member States, and the reduction of excessive red tape."
"Mr President, I join those who have praised the excellent and conscientious work of Mr Seeber."
"Each year, the Danube and Tisza transport 120 billion cubic metres of water through Hungary, which makes us per-capita leaders in Europe."
"Unfortunately, due to climate changes and human interventions, we must defend ourselves against floods several times a year, as we are doing right now, or as we did in April this year, over a distance of 1 500 kilometres."
"Each time we incur defence costs in the region of one hundred million euros, and if a dam bursts, the damages reach billions of euros."
"It is time we realised that we cannot fight nature, because we can never have a lasting victory."
"We need to change our approach, and this is what the concept of sustainable development is about."
"It is high time that this change of approach transformed our flood defence strategies."
"This must be based on a complex programme that places equal importance on flood defence, rural development and environmental protection priorities."
"Water-preserving water management that uses techniques that are close to nature must be given priority."
"In this respect, we must encourage land use changes along rivers, and land management in flood plains."
"The creation of water controlling systems based on the retention of excess water brought by floods should be supported with EU agricultural environment management assistance."
"Within flood plain management, it would be worth supporting decentralised renewable energy production based on the biomass created on flood plains."
"The infrastructure problems of the affected areas should be solved with integrated area and rural development programmes, with particular attention given to the refurbishment and maintenance of road networks between and within settlements."
"Finally, a great merit of the report is that it emphasises the vital importance of cooperation between countries sharing river basins."
"It is not difficult to find the connection between the floods on the Tisza, and the illegal deforestation and timber theft committed with underworld methods in Ukraine, Romania, and recently in Hungary."
"I would like to call on the competent authorities of the affected countries to do everything in their power to combat the forest corruption that has reached such tragic proportions in Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his good report and his good work."
"The overall approach and many individual points have already been mentioned this evening."
"I would like to pick up on two of these, namely the rapporteur’s call, which we have also been making, for this directive to be closely linked with the Water Framework Directive, because we are convinced that effective flood prevention and management can only be achieved if the aims of this directive are consistent with those of the Water Framework Directive."
"At the same time, I warmly welcome the demand for enhanced natural flood prevention."
"The floods of recent years have shown that technical measures alone cannot prevent disasters and that the nature of streams and rivers must be taken into account."
"Rivers and streams must be given more space again."
"Moreover, the growing tendency to destroy soil through intensive agriculture must be combated."
"Greater emphasis must be placed on the role of farming and forestry in flood prevention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me to make some comments on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment and management of floods."
"This directive is the result of experience gained over many years in the Member States in relation to managing waterways."
"It places emphasis on the rational principles that are important to managing flood risks."
"People working in this field welcome the directive."
"Its introduction at a practical level will contribute to a reduction in the growing threat of floods."
"There should be no major problems either with adapting the laws of Member States or with the administrative requirements arising from the adopted directive."
"The Czech Republic has had experience over many years in the management of waterways."
"In 1975 it was one of the first states in Europe to approve a Guidance Plan for Water Management based on the management of individual river basins."
"The cross-border solidarity required in the directive under debate is naturally already observed today."
"One example of this would be the extraordinary operations on the River Morava in the Czech Republic during the latest floods in the spring of this year."
"Through these extraordinary operations, involving 230 million m3 of water outside the dammed reservoirs in the Czech Republic, the flow rate was reduced by more than 215 m3/s when it was peaking at 1500 m3/s, and the dikes on the Slovak and Austrian side are designed for a maximum flow of 1600 m3/s. In this way, successes were achieved in preventing loss of life and much worse flood damage."
"It can be seen from this example that we are certainly not defenceless in the face of floods."
"Through a rational and coordinated policy, we can achieve substantial results."
"Mr President, last year we saw huge floods all over Europe and we cannot forget those sad pictures of the endangered families, countryside and cities."
"Flood victims ask politicians, with good reason, to act at national and at European level to prevent disasters."
"Floods do not stop at borders."
"The flood prevention programme and flood risk maps should be set up not just for individual states, but for river basins."
"Large international river basin plans must be coordinated at sub-basin level and measures taken in one country should not raise the flood risk in other states."
"This should be a basic criterion for any cooperation inside and outside the EU."
"Floods are often followed by environmental pollution caused by industrial, agricultural and other facilities in the area, and sometimes the pollution is more dangerous than the flood itself."
"That is why flood risk management maps and plans need to take potential pollution sources into account."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first express my thanks to Mr Seeber for his commendable treatment of this draft directive."
"We all know how many reasons there are for these increasingly horrific flood disasters."
"Fortunately, not all of us have had to experience such disasters."
"Eighty per cent of our European rivers cross borders and are thus international watercourses, which means that we can all benefit from a set of European rules."
"At the same time, we have to emphasise that subsidiarity is a very basic principle and must not be infringed."
"I am therefore torn between these two positions."
"Flood prevention is a classic example of solidarity."
"I live by the lower stretches of a river, and I know what it means when there are no flood defences upstream, when there are no compensation areas, detention basins or the like, when the upper reaches are constantly being penned in, with the accompanying increase in the speed of flow."
"The draft directive guarantees a minimum level of protection of common interests and a degree of solidarity – through the Solidarity Fund, for example, which actually disbursed some 100 million euros to Romania, Bulgaria and the Tyrol in 2005."
"I believe that the draft takes subsidiarity into consideration, albeit insufficiently."
"It could go a bit further in this direction."
"Needless to say, subsidiarity does not mean that the Member States are released from their responsibilities."
"The three-step approach we have outlined is logical: assessment of cross-border risks, compiling of flood maps and preparation of contingency plans for effective risk management."
"Even if there were no revision clause, I should be happy to see us discuss after the first five years whether the European approach has actually delivered the desired benefits."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a case of ‘water, water everywhere’ this evening, with no end in sight!"
"I welcome the call for international coordination of flood-risk management measures, and I thank my honourable colleague Mr Seeber for his balanced report."
"Water knows no boundaries, not only groundwater but also, and especially, the water carried by rivers, and for many of these rivers there are already cross-border plans and, as a result, cross-border measures too."
"Anyone who looks at the Rhine and the Moselle, which flows through my native region, as international European rivers will be aware that flood problems can only be tackled through the joint action of all the riparian states."
"If you observed people’s responses to flooding in our area, you might think that the inhabitants of the Moselle area had mastered flood management, that they had, as it were, become well practised in the art."
"However, anyone whose family has ever had to clear out their cellar, barn or indeed their entire dwelling on hearing an announcement from Trier that the water level is set to rise within the next hour by a certain number of centimetres, knowing that this will bring it into the hallway of their home – and thank God we can obtain such accurate information these days – will know what it means to be on constant standby whenever there is heavy or prolonged rainfall and will know all about the physical effort, the cost and the time involved in coping with these trials and tribulations."
"No region ever gets used to floods."
"Now we have been struggling with these problems for many years and during that time have found cross-border allies too."
"There have been rewarding experiences upon which we can build."
"Prevention and management in areas prone to flooding must be the task of the competent local bodies operating on the basis of internationally harmonised rules."
"In line with the aim of cutting red tape, the obligations of all authorities and tiers of government to the Commission must be kept to a minimum."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the theme of flooding has recently become highly topical and damages caused by flooding have reached astronomical proportions, influencing the economic development of the individual countries affected."
"The damages are caused chiefly by a reduction in the natural ability of river basins to hold back water, and also by the careless intervention of man in the environment, for example by regulating flows, by placing buildings and businesses in flood-prone areas and by reducing the size of natural inundation areas."
"Climate changes are also playing a major role, with greater periods of drought and greater occurrence of intensive localised precipitation."
"I therefore welcome the proposal for a directive, which will enable improved cooperation in respect of flood prevention and the proposing and management of counter-flood measures, including the monitoring of individual areas across individual EU states and also neighbouring states."
"The reinforced principle of solidarity under Article 9(4), which sets out the rule that flood management in one state cannot be allowed to increase flood risk for neighbouring countries, must be understood in the sense that there has to be mutual preliminary consultation and subsequent coordination of individual counter-flood measures, with agreement on both the upper and lower flow levels of a given river, and with no risk of mutual negative impacts for any of the states that a given river flows through."
"I also appreciate the fact that the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, understands the key importance of local and regional authorities in this process, as can be seen from the wide range of amendments which engage local authorities in a positive way in the decision-making processes for the prevention, planning and management of the flood risks that affect them."
"I would like to thank Mr Seeber for delivering an excellent piece of work."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work."
"Flooding is becoming an increasingly common occurrence throughout the whole of Europe, resulting in huge economic losses and sometimes even loss of life."
"This law will therefore be important because it will facilitate the coordination of European efforts to reduce such occurrences."
"The original proposal had a shortcoming in that it only made reference to flooding from river basins."
"In so doing it omitted altogether other types of floods, such as floods caused by heavy rainfall, but not necessarily from rivers."
"As a result the directive would have had little or no relevance for a country such as my own – Malta – where we have no rivers but we do, none the less, have floods."
"Floods in my country are commonplace, but they are caused by heavy rainfall."
"Indeed only a few years ago my country benefited from substantial financial support from the European Union Solidarity Fund in the wake of substantial damage caused by floods, caused in turn by heavy rainfall."
"It is very important that whenever a new law is enacted at European level, it must be drafted in a way that makes it relevant and indeed applicable in all Member States, taking into account all their concerns and specificities."
"I am therefore grateful that the rapporteur, as well as the Committee on Regional Development, have accepted my proposal to widen the definition of floods to make it more comprehensive and to ensure that floods caused by heavy rainfall are also incorporated within the meaning of this new law."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a month ago, at the plenary part-session in May, against the backdrop of ever more frequent natural disasters, especially floods, we adopted at first reading the report on the new Solidarity Fund for the period from 2007 to 2013, for which I was the rapporteur."
"During that debate, as has been the case today, the desire for European solidarity emerged loud and clear."
"That fund, I firmly believe, will also make a vital contribution, in the event of direct damage, to ensuring that the Union can act in a more effective and targeted manner in areas in which the public expect the European Union to take action."
"In the spring of this year came further evidence that floods do not stop at national borders in Europe."
"At ever briefer intervals we have been paying the price for irresponsible building, inadequate precautions and a lack of overflow areas."
"On this occasion, such defects were most glaring on the lower reaches of the Danube."
"Yes, the problems are man-made to a great extent."
"What is lacking is a binding legal framework as well as a certain degree of management for flood prevention and the will to implement what has already been agreed."
"The report compiled by Mr Seeber provides a good basis for a European regulatory framework, provided – as you indeed re-emphasised, Commissioner – that the subsidiarity principle is strictly applied."
"Important decisions such as the level of protection and the right choice of safeguards can only be taken by the Member States themselves."
"To put it plainly, the Member States must be granted the right, even after the entry into force of this proposed directive, to continue presenting EU-relevant data and forwarding them to Brussels in the customary manner in order to avoid the creation of any new bureaucracy, which would serve no practical purpose."
"The report in its present form is good and should therefore be adopted by a large majority."
"."
"Mr President, allow me to briefly describe the Commission's views on certain important issues raised by Parliament."
"I should like to emphasise that most of the amendments approved by the European Parliament provide useful clarifications to the proposal and improve cohesion, especially in connection with the framework directive on water resources."
"I shall comment first of all on the amendments which the Commission can accept in full, in principle or in part."
"Floods and the risk management measures applied to address them have two sides: they can simultaneously be harmful and can help improve the environment."
"The Commission therefore agrees with the rapporteur that it is important to strike the right balance between flood risk management measures and environmental protection, while at the same time maintaining adequate references to the framework directive on water resources."
"Consequently, the Commission accepts the following amendments: Amendment 36 on the assessment of existing man-made flood defence infrastructures, Amendment 60 on the economic and environmental appraisal of flood management measures and Amendment 74 on the prioritisation of sustainable flood risk management measures."
"As regards the impact of climate change, the Commission agrees that this parameter must be taken into account, especially when reviewing flood risk assessments."
"Consequently, the Commission can accept Amendments 38 and 73, which strengthen the relevant provisions of the directive."
"The Commission does not wish to impose any needless administrative burden on the Member States and shares the opinion that the Member States must, during the first period of application of the directive, be in a position to use maps and diagrams which already exist and which comply with the requirements of the directive."
"This was emphasised by the Commission in recital 13 of the proposal, meaning that the Commission can accept in principle the relevant amendments proposed by Parliament, namely Amendments 37, 55 and 71."
"Material and effective application of the directive depends on cooperation and coordination between the main flood risk management agencies in catchment basins that cross the administrative and political borders of several countries."
"The Commission can therefore accept in full or in principle a series of amendments which further clarify these obligations, such as Amendment 62, which is accepted in full, and Amendment 61, which is accepted in principle."
"I should now like to mention the amendments which the Commission cannot accept."
"Firstly, the Commission considers that the citizens have the right to protection against floods of any origin. Consequently, certain types of floods cannot be exempted, which is why I accept Amendment 28."
"Nor can the necessary information be limited for the purpose of mapping it."
"Consequently, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 14, 27, 42, 43 or 47."
"Within this framework, Amendment 51 is also unacceptable, because it is not in keeping with the rest of the text of the directive."
"Secondly, certain amendments add superfluous references or overlap with other elements of Community legislation or create legal obscurity."
"I refer specifically to Amendments 53, 59 and 63. The Commission cannot accept them."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 23 deleting the recital referring to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Of the 20 new amendments, the Commission can accept 14 either in part or in full."
"However, I should like to refer to a specific amendment which cannot be accepted for particularly important reasons."
"I refer to Amendment 81, which proposes a derogation for national catchment basins on certain conditions."
"There are two reasons for this: firstly, the Commission proposal applies to all catchment basins, both national and international."
"Both citizens and businesses demand the same level of protection and flood risk management, irrespective of the type or geographical location of the catchment basin."
"Any attempt to limit the scope of the directive to national catchment basins would create discriminatory situations and would set an undesirable precedent in the environmental policy of the European Union."
"Secondly, from the point of view of legal clarity, as I said earlier, the Commission supports a number of amendments which lay down preconditions to ensure that, during the transitional period, existing rules will be used in a way that is in keeping with the directive."
"Amendment 81 contradicts this objective and creates legal uncertainty for the citizens."
"To conclude, I am pleased to announce that the Commission accepts 71 amendments, 16 of which are accepted in full and 55 of which are accepted in principle or in part."
"For the reasons I stated earlier, the Commission cannot accept 24 amendments."
"I shall file a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments with Parliament's secretariat.(1)"
"I should like once again to congratulate and thank Mr Seeber for his efforts and his exceptional work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"I am pleased to say that there are 71 amendments which the Commission can accept fully, in part, or in principle."
"It accepts 16 amendments in full: 1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 16, 18, 25, 28, 32, 39, 45, 54, 58, 62 and 66."
"It accepts 55 amendments in principle or in part: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 46, 48, 49, 52, 55, 56, 60, 61, 64, 67, 68, 69, 71, 73 , 74, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 90, 93 and 94."
"It cannot accept 24 amendments: 14, 23, 27, 42, 43, 44, 47, 50, 51, 53, 57, 59, 63, 65, 70, 72, 75, 76, 81, 85, 89, 91, 92 and 95."
"– The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission (O-0049/2006 – B6-0307/2006) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on measures to promote tourism."
"Commissioner Verheugen, the presentation in March this year of the Commission communication ‘A renewed EU tourism policy: towards a stronger partnership for European tourism’ could – and should – have been an opportunity to discuss the Community institutions’ next steps with a view to strengthening the tourist industry in Europe."
"Unfortunately, that was not the case."
"The world today is no longer the one we were living in 15 or 20 years ago, when a rapidly developing, vigorous economy was distributing wealth among Europe’s citizens."
"In today’s world, the global economy presents us with new difficulties, and yet also with new attractions."
"There is a different reality demanding different responses."
"Our development model is out of date and will be ineffective if we do not remedy it."
"Europe needs, then, to find development opportunities where it can be competitive and sustainable, where it has comparative advantages with economic potential."
"That is the case of tourism."
"We certainly cannot compete with exotic destinations, but we have history, heritage and an unparalleled, enormously varied potential for attracting visitors."
"We are all aware that the European tourist industry is one of the sectors that can best react to the challenges set by the global economy."
"Hard to relocate and readily adaptable, it is able to respond to demands for quality and environmental protection; it is in a position to meet the requirement of better training; it can overcome the problem of seasonality if it can adapt to new target groups; and it has the potential for growth."
"When the Commission presents a new communication on the subject, therefore, it could be expected to say something new and to respond to the challenges that this Parliament threw down in its resolution on the future of sustainable tourism in Europe, which was adopted in September 2005."
"In contrast, the Commission has produced an unimaginative document in which it very rarely takes up the initiatives put forward by Parliament."
"That is not good enough, Commissioner."
"The proposals to adopt specific measures aiming at the sustainable development of the tourist industry and at making good economic use of it have elicited no response from the Commission, or only an inadequate one."
"Let us look at the evidence: why has the Commission not followed up on our proposals to address the problem of seasonality, specifically by strengthening the mechanisms to develop senior tourism in the low season?"
"Is it because it does not agree?"
"Is it because it considers it pointless?"
"Or do schemes like Spain’s Inserso, for instance, not reap the benefits that all economic operators find in it?"
"Another example: the European Capitals of Culture are a successful model in promoting the cultural heritage of host cities and creating a greater sense of identity among European citizens."
"Well, then, what the Commission says about adapting this concept to the tourism advocated by this Parliament and by a number of economic operators is, and I quote, that it ‘will explore the opportunity to promote awareness of such good practices, possibly through a ‘European destinations of excellence award’."
"‘Explore the opportunity to promote awareness’?"
"As far as initiative and dynamism go, we have to recognise that that is not nearly good enough."
"The same could be said in relation to Parliament’s request to be involved in preparing Agenda 21 in the area of sustainable European tourism, or the need to set up mechanisms to protect European tourists caught up in crisis or disaster situations abroad."
"Once again, the Commission’s response has been silence."
"In a market economy, public institutions are not expected to plan the economy, organise investment or manage economic structures."
"In the European Union, it is not the Commission’s task to do what the Member States and private businesses do better."
"Tourism is a subsidiarity field ."
"Even so, one would expect greater vision, greater political willingness, and the ability to make decisions and, above all, to send out clear signals to private economic operators and the Member States themselves."
"That was the expectation that we had for this Commission communication on tourism."
"Commissioner, I have to tell you yet again that we have been disappointed."
"The Commission communication is not ambitious."
"It is more of an analysis document, which has its positive points, I grant you, but there is no great creativity, daring or vision in it."
"It is a document that does not even tie in with the Green Paper on an EU maritime policy, which has since been published, in which the tourism potential of the sea and the coastal countries is abundantly emphasised."
"To conclude, Commissioner, let me reformulate the question that prompted this debate."
"In simpler terms, I am asking what new ideas, significant proposals and useful suggestions the Commission has for the tourist industry or, in other words, how does the Commission propose to help make European tourism more dynamic?"
"In the end, Commissioner, the questions I am asking here are basically different ways of expressing one and the same concern: the need to make full use of this industry’s enormous economic potential for the sake of growth and employment in the European Union."
".Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fear that I can scarcely agree with Mr Queiró."
"I should love to do all the things you suggest, but unfortunately they do not fall within the competence of the European Commission."
"As you know, the Constitution, in which the European Union is given the power to legislate on tourism, has not entered into force."
"And all the fine proposals you have made may well be desirable, but they cannot be implemented since the Commission is not empowered to do so."
"I said that at the time, and what the Commission has done instead is something far more difficult, namely to persuade the Member States, in the very testing circumstances of the present time, that they should nevertheless set about developing a coordinated European policy on tourism."
"That cannot be achieved in the short term because, as I have said, we have no competence to regulate these matters."
"We presented this communication in March of this year, it has been discussed on several occasions with the ministers responsible for tourism in the Member States and has been well received by them, and it will provide numerous new opportunities, but I am not in a position to forecast when particular measures can actually be taken."
"That, sadly, is just the way things are."
"I propose that we continue to discuss this subject in depth, but in particular that we do our best to ensure that the European Constitution enters into force."
"Then we shall have an entirely new range of opportunities for action in this field, which – and here I agree with you wholeheartedly – is extremely important to the economic future of Europe."
"I am firmly convinced that tourism offers enormous potential for the economic development of Europe."
"If there is any area in which we can expect global economic development and our own population trends to generate vigorous growth, that area is certainly tourism."
"The Commission will endeavour to encourage the Member States and the relevant business sectors to take coordinated action in order to exploit this potential to the full."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of our debate is extremely topical, as we are very close in time to the most important and long tourist season, which is the summer season, and we can understand better what tourism means for economic development, regional convergence, jobs and the quality and security of life of European citizens."
"Tourism is a dynamic activity which, together with collateral activities, accounts for 11% of European gross domestic product; however, the Lisbon Strategy and our international competition require us to do even more and to develop this chapter."
"With this oral question, therefore, we want to highlight the potential which tourism has to contribute to the development goals of the European Union and to the challenges which we are addressing all together."
"We believe that, if there is the political will and commitment, many of the measures referred to in the European Parliament's motions for resolutions, which are also touched on in Mr Queiró's oral question, can be put into practice."
"European tourism can acquire greater visibility, coordinated advertising, identity in its products and its objectives and can become visible and distinguished both in the rest of the world and to European citizens."
"I therefore believe that, even if we do not have the Constitution, we can cooperate with the private sector and with government agencies, in order to promote some of these things."
"I am delighted that the Commissioner agrees with us and we trust that he will exploit all the possibilities which the European Commission has through working groups and fora so that we all become aware of these challenges."
"The fact that the Constitution refers to them and we have all accepted them as a positive competence in the direction of a coordinated policy is an element that allows us to start to put them intelligently into practice."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2005 Parliament adopted the Resolution on Sustainable Tourism."
"About one month later, on 21 October, I had the opportunity to listen to your speech in Malta, at an important but certainly informal meeting – I refer to the Forum of Workers and Professional Associations. Even though you did not refer to the Parliamentary debate, you adopted many of the observations that we had made in this House and in committee."
"On that occasion you had not drawn up any plan to annul a European policy on tourism because the Constitution had not yet been approved."
"Yet France and the Netherlands had already said ‘no’ in their referendums."
"Although the concept that a Community policy on tourism might replace the national policies seems to have been definitely ruled out, support from the EU remains a possibility."
"This could take the form of financial support, leading to administrative cooperation, pilot projects and guidance, so as to implement (as is demonstrated by the experience of the Structural Funds) a genuine policy for the tourism sector, guiding the decisions made by public bodies and economic operators."
"Furthermore, despite the impossibility of harmonising the laws and regulations of the Member States, the possibility remains open for the European institutions to work together when it is seen to be necessary for the functioning of the internal market or where there is a specific legal basis, as in the case of consumer protection, transport and the environment."
"In my opinion, therefore, there is no reason why this communication should have run into the sand or why there should be no European tourism policy."
"Commissioner, I think that a closer relationship with Parliament would be helpful to your role as well."
". — Mr President, I concur with the previous speaker, Mrs Vincenzi, and also believe that the Commission, given a large portion of good will, can do a fair bit of coordinating, even though the Constitution is not yet in force."
"I thank Mr Queiró for raising this issue."
"I would like to restrict myself to two points, namely the seasonal nature of the tourist trade, which has been put to one side, and the sustainability of the tourist industry as a whole."
"The fact that the seasonal nature of the tourist industry is a problem was emphasised at a meeting in Brussels last Thursday attended by prominent guest speakers and participants."
"The adverse effects of seasonal activity are felt primarily by those who work in the tourist industry, whether they are self-employed or wage-earners."
"During the high season they are overworked, and outside the tourist season they are unemployed."
"The same applies to tourist resorts, which are overrun with people for some of the time and then turn into deserted ghost towns."
"What am I trying to say?"
"That the Commission should address this imbalance as an urgent European problem and seek solutions together with the Member States and regions."
"Let me move on to sustainability, which is the main reason why I believe the Commission should adopt a more interventionist approach to tourism."
"We have enough examples of places where unbridled tourism has put such a strain on the natural environment that entire wild or cultivated landscapes have been destroyed, which has in turn eroded the essential economic basis of tourism itself."
"The most sustainable form of travel is the train."
"About 100 years ago, railways were the chief means of transport, but now they have almost disappeared into oblivion."
"It is vital to rediscover the role of the railways in tourism."
"I tell you that as someone who has spent eight hours travelling by train to come to Strasbourg today."
"."
"Mr President, tourism is an important social, cultural and economic phenomenon."
"It brings challenges that we have to face."
"The enlargement of the EU to include new Member States has meant drawing up a new policy on tourism to meet current and future requirements."
"It is therefore good that the European Commission has presented an appropriate communication on this, and that on 8 September 2005 Parliament passed a resolution on the new perspectives and new challenges for sustainable European tourism."
"Over nine months have gone by since then, but nothing has happened."
"Let us hope that Mr Queiró’s question will spur the European Commission into action."
"It is unacceptable to use the excuse that we have no constitution, because tourism existed before the idea of a constitution, and will continue to exist even if a constitution is not approved, and it requires care and development."
"I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that in addition to the problem raised in the question, there are other no less important issues, such as the development of tourism in the new Member States and in little-known regions with unspoiled landscapes and a natural balance, in which traditional culture is still very much alive."
"Particular attention should be paid to the ‘Eastern Wall’, or in other words the poorest regions of the EU, which however have the best opportunities for development."
"These regions require a special, carefully thought-out programme."
"For the old Member States, and particularly those regions that are generally regarded as attractive, the problem is too many tourists, with all the consequences this entails, including losses of natural resources and material culture."
"A major issue is saving historical wooden buildings, the exploitation of historical cities for tourism and the creation of an effective programme to implement agrotourism in rural areas."
"Let us remember that investments in tourism are recouped the fastest, that tourism has much to offer people, but that developing tourism without a plan and without controls can cause irredeemable damage."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while tourism undeniably contributes to growth and employment in the European Union, it has still to bridge the incomprehensible gulf between sensible proposals, intended to make tourism more dynamic and sustainable, and practical, rapid action."
"Are we to see this as the result of lack of interest on the part of the political authorities?"
"If, however, the proposals contained in the European Parliament resolution adopted a few months ago were actually implemented, they could act as a remarkable lever for the development of this sector."
"It is vital for us together to promote Europe as a destination and this has to be by means of coordination and cooperation between the public and the private actors."
"We have to mitigate, indeed reduce, the counter-productive consequences of seasonality, as Mr Queiró rightly pointed out."
"This has to be brought about through the development of new forms of sustainable tourism such as agritourism, rambling, cycling or horse-riding."
"It is also brought about by removing the obstacles encountered by some people who wish to travel but who have difficulty in doing so because of the lack of infrastructures and facilities, namely older people and handicapped people."
"The Commission has a duty to improve the coherence of its actions for tourism with other related Community policies."
"In this way any project that has an impact on the tourism sector should be identified from the time the Commission’s programme of work is implemented."
"By means of this transversal policy, particular attention should be focussed on regions that experience natural and structural handicaps, such as the outermost and other remote regions, as well as the new Member States."
"In the future I believe it will be highly desirable for the European Parliament to be more closely linked with the decisions that are adopted and finally to take into account the proposals of an assembly that represents European citizens."
"At a time when citizens have doubts about political power, hearing the recommendations of the European Parliament would certainly be the best means of restoring their confidence in their institutions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, greater involvement of the European institutions is essential if tourism is to be developed in a more sustainable fashion."
"I therefore share the concerns that prompted the question by my fellow Member Mr Queiró, particularly because I come from a country, Portugal, and more specifically from an outermost region, Madeira, where tourism is one of the most significant factors for its economic and social development."
"In addition, although tourism lies within the competence of the Member States, the Union has an important role to play in this field through political guidelines and actions at a European level."
"The Union’s action, in supporting, coordinating and supplementing the Member States’ actions – as indeed is laid down in the Treaty that has yet to be ratified – adds significant value to national policies and actions aiming at the sustainable development of the tourist industry."
"I shall mention two points in support of European action: the major economic and social significance of tourism, associated with the importance of the new information and communications technologies and with the innovation that it promotes, will make this one of the sectors that will contribute most to competitiveness and job creation, in line with the Lisbon Strategy."
"Secondly, the European Union is the principal world tourist destination, and EU citizens are the ones that most use tourism services and most visit the EU’s tourist destinations."
"Lastly, in view of the Union’s and the Member States’ competences in the tourism field, as mentioned before, and bearing in mind the need for greater integration and cohesion of the actions carried out by the Union, the Member States and the regions, I call for closer cooperation, coordination and the provision of information not only between the Union and the Member States and regions, but also among the institutions themselves: Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Hence the importance of this moral issue in drawing the necessary commitment from the Commission and the Council to follow up the relevant initiatives proposed by Parliament for sustainable development, particularly through the creation of Destination Europe, the European Union brand, and an assurance that tourists’ rights will be protected and safeguarded."
"Mr President, not only has tourism been somewhat forcibly tacked on to the Committee on Transport like a spare wheel, but on top of that we are discussing it so late at night."
"It is hard to associate tourism with the night."
"Some of the most interesting programmes, with great significance for tourism, are the ‘rural renewal’ programmes."
"They have a long tradition in Germany and Austria, and are slowly being introduced in other countries such as Poland."
"They are, however, exclusively local in nature, sometimes benefiting from regional support."
"However their acknowledged value means that they should become the focus of the European Union’s interest, and of course an object of financial interest."
"Hence my very specific question: could the European Commission not consider establishing a special programme of promotion and financial support for rural renewal?"
"Would it not be worth attending to such initiatives to a significantly larger extent than now?"
"In my view these are rhetorical questions, but I would like the Commission’s answer to be more than just rhetorical."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we have heard that it has been three years since the Commission communication and one year, in essence, since the approval by Parliament of the report proposing specific initiatives."
"We realise, however, that little progress has been made."
"Even though it comes under the action of the Member States, tourism is also significantly affected by Community policies and we must therefore exhaust the possibilities for promoting sustainable European tourism through regional and rural policy."
"Members have quite rightly spoken about regeneration issues and about Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, employment policy, education, training and transport and consumer protection policy."
"Measures which can be taken in order to strengthen tourism are the protection of alternative forms of tourism by developing the natural and the historically built-up landscape and strengthening it through existing programmes by tourist companies promoting thematic tourism (ecological tourism, rambling and so forth) in unsaturated tourist areas."
"Other such measures are the introduction of a special programme for the third age, mainly for peak periods, the introduction of a tourist destination sign and the introduction of rules for improving access for persons with disabilities."
"The European Commission can lend added value to tourism with such initiatives."
"Mr President, I would once again like to welcome these initiatives on tourism, to which our great friend Mr Queiró is drawing our attention."
"Tourism is one of our largest and most competitive industries with major growth potential."
"Tourism represents wealth in many regards."
"Tourism is an important generator of employment."
"Research shows that job creation in the tourism sector is one and half times greater and quicker than in any other industrial sector."
"Furthermore, it offers a great opportunity for development in rural areas, it inspires enormous investments in infrastructures and it improves the living conditions of local residents and, of course, those of the tourists."
"The environment and local culture are favoured when authorities restore monuments, open museums, create natural parks, etc. Most importantly, tourism has an effect on human beings, enriching them by means of culture and by increasing environmental and social awareness."
"It is therefore an important instrument for social and regional integration."
"For all of these reasons, I would ask the Commission to show imagination and, in cooperation with all of the parties involved and in partnership with the European Parliament, of course, to look into the possibility of some sort of provision whereby Member States with strong tourist industries might establish measures in their national strategic frameworks and in their operational programmes to allow regions to apply and fund projects that are consistent with the development of a sustainable form of tourism that is suited to local conditions and potentialities."
"If there is a genuine will to achieve the Lisbon objectives, then this initiative at least requires joint consideration."
"– Thank you Mr President."
"Commissioner, I shall not repeat what my colleagues have already said."
"I will only ask you some specific questions regarding things that you have said as well."
"Firstly, referring to the tourism forum which took place in Malta, where you had said that the streamlining of regulations regarding the tourism sector is about to begin."
"How far has this streamlining process come?"
"How far have we come from the two hundred and fifty different rules affecting the tourism sector?"
"Secondly, what can we do in order to exercise more pressure for the restaurant sector to be eligible for a reduced VAT rate?"
"We may talk and say many nice things, yet this sector is in need of practical help."
"At the end of the day, we need concrete measures to be taken."
"Thirdly, has there been a study of the impact which the increase in Visa payments for non-EU citizens to enter the EU will have on the tourism sector, on which many of the regions here represented depend?"
"Finally, we also need to take a look at our regulations, and see how these are affecting the competitivity of our ports as regards cruise liners and the business they bring with them."
"Thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"– The next item is the joint debate on:"
"1. the report by Jerzy Buzek (A6-0202/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the seventh framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013) (COM(2005)0119 – C6-0099/2005 – 2005/0043(COD)), and"
"2. the report by Jerzy Buzek (A6-0203/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the seventh framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for nuclear research and training activities (2007 to 2011) (COM(2005)0119 – C6-0112/2005 – 2005/0044(CNS))."
"."
"Mr President, today is an important day for science."
"With your support, we can look ahead to a EUR 54.5 billion research programme to be launched by the end of this year."
"EUR 54.5 billion in current prices is less than we had proposed, but it is a substantial increase on the current programme and we also have to thank Parliament for that."
"Together, we are making the Seventh Framework Programme a programme for boosting growth and jobs, for promoting a sustainable and healthy Europe."
"It is also a programme for a stronger Europe: research unites in diversity."
"For that to happen, we need cooperation, ideas, people and capacities and those are the titles of the four main axes in the Framework Programme."
"The cooperation programme will bring together our best talents from across Europe to research and develop and find answers on economic opportunities and societal challenges, for example in the areas of health and energy."
"The ideas programme will introduce a new mindset in supporting and conducting research in Europe."
"The people programme will attract and motivate the best scientists to work across Europe or beyond, for the benefit of European research."
"The capacities programme will ensure that Europe can rely on excellent capacities for conducting research in all parts of Europe."
"Our continuous efforts towards simplification will ensure that we attract the best participants, irrespective of size or origin, and that we get the best value for our investment."
"I am impressed by the consensus that has emerged in Parliament on Framework Programme that delivers on the ambition."
"I wholeheartedly thank Mr Chichester, chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the rapporteur, Mr Buzek, the shadow rapporteurs and all other Members of Parliament who made this possible."
"Your objective is to further improve the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission will be able to accept no less than two thirds of your amendments, either as a whole or in principle."
"Some other amendments are, in our assessment, too detailed for the Framework Programme, or they go beyond the remit of research and development."
"We will quickly come to an agreement on those."
"Some amendments create difficulties for the Commission."
"They concern topics for which we have a shared understanding of their importance and priority, but not yet on how to realise them."
"I do not think that they should become stumbling blocks."
"They relate, for example, to keeping space and security together as one priority, avoiding the definition of a quantitative target for SME participation, preventing the introduction of support in the people programme for interregional mobility within the same country and ensuring that technology platforms remain flexible, bottom-up and industry-driven in defining strategic research agendas and guiding their implementation."
"Let me spend a little time on two issues which have been the subject of your intense debate."
"I should like to start with the European Research Council."
"This is probably the most exciting new development in the European research landscape."
"Parliament’s strong support will help to make it a reality."
"We have to get the structure right, so that independence is guaranteed in support of scientific excellence and administrative capacity is available in support of efficiency."
"The Community method can guarantee this and it is for this reason that we have proposed to set up the ERC within the remit of the Community institutions."
"I am sure that we will be able to accommodate much of the substance of Parliament’s amendments in a way that will also help to create common ground with the Council."
"However, I am afraid that a review in 2008, after only one year of operation, will not be very meaningful."
"Much as I understand Parliament’s wish to be associated with the European Research Council’s success, I do not think we have the appropriate legal basis to decide on the follow-up to the review in codecision."
"I am most concerned, however, about proposals to predetermine the future structure of the European Research Council even at this stage."
"What message would we give out with such an automatic change of structure?"
"That we got it wrong in the first place?"
"That the ERC we set up will not be independent?"
"I simply cannot accept that logic."
"It would not help us in our joint aim to create a European Research Council of which we can all be proud."
"I believe that we are enabling the ERC to be independent and efficient."
"I have heard Professor Kafatos, chairman of the ERC Scientific Council, say on several occasions that the structure proposed by the Commission, as well as the stance taken by the Commission, ensures precisely that."
"We propose that an independent review should be carried out, with the full involvement of various parties, not least the Scientific Council, in time for the future structure of the ERC to be considered not later than 2010."
"The review should look explicitly at the advantages and the disadvantages of a structure based on an executive agency and a structure based on Article 171 of the Treaty."
"The ERC’s structures and mechanisms should be modified in accordance with its findings."
"This should be done in consultation with Parliament, but always with a view to maintaining the total independence of the ERC from any political influence."
"As regards the administrative and staffing costs of the ERC: yes, we want a lean and cost-effective implementation structure, but, no, at this stage we do not know enough to impose strict and specific limits for administrative costs that might risk undermining the functioning of the ERC at its outset."
"Let me turn to the issue of stem cell research."
"I know that this has been a matter of intense discussion amongst many of you and I should like to say at the outset that I have profound respect for each personal opinion."
"The Commission learned from the intense debate on this issue during the negotiations on the Sixth Framework Programme."
"We are convinced that, in view of the diversity of approaches existing in Europe, we can only propose a responsible, cautious and practical approach, evaluating and selecting this type of research on a case-by-case basis and excluding certain specific research areas."
"The procedure established for the Sixth Framework Programme ensures that some major health challenges and the hopes of the patients concerned are addressed through this research."
"At the same time, it guarantees respect for fundamental ethical principles in a way that it is unique for a research programme covering 25 countries or more."
"This procedure has proved to work and to be acceptable to Member States and to the scientists."
"What we propose is nothing less and nothing more than that the procedure be continued for the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The Commission acknowledges very positively the outcome of the vote on this issue by the ITRE Committee, which is entirely in line with the Commission’s proposal and provides even more useful clarification."
"It would be misleading to present a deviation from this approach as a true compromise between proponents and opponents of embryonic stem cell research."
"For example, introducing a so-called cut-off date that would make human embryonic stem cell lines eligible or not eligible for Community funds would have far-reaching consequences."
"Such a cut-off date has no scientific or objective basis."
"It might prevent the European researchers from using the lines they have created and force them to work with lines produced outside Europe."
"In addition, it might severely compromise access to the best quality lines which, in this very new field of research, are generally considered to be those most recently produced."
"It might unduly limit access to the specific stem cell lines which are indispensable for patients."
"In other words, it has to be clear that any date will compromise the label of scientific excellence in this sector which I am personally eager to attach to this Seventh Framework Programme, as long as ethical concerns are taken fully into consideration, which I believe is entirely the case with our proposal."
"One last word on subsidiarity: the current strict procedures and limitations on embryonic stem cell research entirely respect the subsidiarity principle."
"Relying on the ethical standards of either the most restrictive or the most liberal countries would simply be against the basic principles of the European Union."
"I cannot end this introduction without mentioning the very broad agreement on the Euratom programme, which includes the important international scientific project on ITER, and the Joint Research Centre, whose mission you considered very important."
"I am very curious to listen to the debate now and hope that it will be possible to add some short concluding remarks afterwards."
"This Parliament has truly made excellent progress."
"I hope we can maintain this momentum."
"Getting FP7 started in time will require an increased effort from all of us."
"Time matters! FP7 is a central part of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs."
"It is on that count that Europe can and should deliver on time."
"This will be an important signal to our partners in the world, to the whole of Europe and to our scientific community."
"I think that our three institutions have never been so close to each other in deciding a Framework Programme."
"With your support, we will be able to reach our current goals on time and mobilise our researchers to start participating, as from the end of this year, in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the realisation of the European research area that turns knowledge into true growth and true jobs."
"Together we can prove that Lisbon is back again."
"."
"Mr President, after over a year of intensive debate, the European Parliament will vote the day after tomorrow on the first reading of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The report is the result of the efforts of many people."
"I would like to express my warm thanks to these people today, namely the Luxembourg, UK and Finnish Presidencies and, above all, the Austrian Presidency, the European Commission, and Commissioner Potočnik in particular, the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and its chairmen, and in particular the shadow rapporteurs who are here today, who drafted the opinions of eight parliamentary committees."
"I would like to thank the coordinators of and advisors to the political groups and the advisors and officials of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"The debate in the European Parliament has been open and transparent."
"During certain periods, the working groups met every day for a number of hours."
"Everyone had the time and the opportunity to express their opinions and comments."
"I believe that our joint work has borne fruit in the form of a good report."
"I also took part in a large number of conferences, seminars and meetings outside the European Parliament, organised by the European Commission, the Member States, universities, regions and non-governmental organisations."
"A high level of interest in research and learning at European level was evident everywhere."
"We should take advantage of this enthusiasm and potential, as well as fulfilling expectations related to the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The debate was not easy, especially due to the absence of a financial perspective."
"The cooperation with Commissioner Potočnik and the Commission was a great help, however."
"The negotiated budget is not an ideal budget, but the earmarking of more than EUR 50 billion for research, learning and innovation is a step in the right direction for the European Union."
"It is the direction set by the Lisbon Strategy and a knowledge-based economy."
"The European Parliament strongly supports the structure and the main principles of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"This programme takes into account the guidelines featured in the Kok and Marimon reports and especially the Locatelli report, which was presented by the European Parliament at the start of 2005."
"The Seventh Framework Programme therefore contains completely new ideas and instruments, such as the European Research Council, which will be concerned with fundamental research, joint technology initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation between science and industry and at innovation, or initiatives such as investment in research infrastructure."
"We also have new thematic priorities, namely security and space, and also socio-economic research."
"The Seventh Framework Programme also ensures an appropriate continuation of the Sixth Programme with regard to the building of a European Research Area, begun by the previous Commissioner, Mr Busquin."
"The continuity of the programme affects current thematic priorities, and excellent experience is being built on with regard to the mobility and training of scientists, and especially the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Programme."
"The European Parliament has its own priorities within the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I will name the four most important ones."
"The first priority is excellence as a criterion for all projects and decisions within the scope of the programme."
"In order to achieve this, we also have to exploit the potential of each project in terms of experience, research infrastructure, recruiting the best scientists, achievements in various European Union countries and regions and the effective use of financial resources."
"The second priority is the chapter ‘People’ and all initiatives related to the full development of research personnel in Europe and preventing brain drain."
"Parliament’s third priority is fundamental research, described in the chapter on ‘Ideas’, and linked with the European Research Council."
"Scientists in the European Union have been waiting for such an initiative for many years."
"The fourth European Parliament priority is an emphasis on innovation, and overcoming the European paradox of good research but relatively weak innovation."
"We need to bring science closer to technology and universities closer to industry, and so we need to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and their role in research."
"We strongly support European technology platforms."
"Preparations for the Seventh Framework Programme in the European Parliament were linked with the ‘Competitiveness and Innovation’ programme."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur working on that programme, Mr Chatzimarkakis, for a particularly fruitful collaboration."
"Around 1 700 amendments were tabled, which reflects the enormous amount of interest in the programme."
"Each amendment was the result of talks and meetings in sometimes distant parts of Europe."
"Thanks to compromises we eventually managed to reduce the number of amendments to 315, and these will not affect either the structure or the basic principles of the programme."
"As far as the content of the amendments is concerned, I would like to highlight a few of the most important issues."
"Firstly, in Parliament’s view, the compromise amendments play a key role, and the greatest emphasis will be placed on these amendments during our negotiations with the Council and Commission."
"Secondly, the budget amendment is particularly important as it reflects the priorities of the European Parliament, namely people, the European Research Council, fundamental research, small and medium-sized enterprises, energy and health."
"Thirdly, there is no doubt as to the need to ensure the full independence and autonomy of the European Research Council."
"Fourthly, it is important to simplify procedures and to facilitate the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Framework Programme."
"Fifthly, emphasis needs to be placed on scientists in the development phase, as it is often the scientists who show the greatest creativity and inventiveness."
"We therefore must ensure the development of their scientific careers in Europe."
"In sixth place, the division of the thematic priorities security and space seems indispensable."
"Finally, as rapporteur I tried to reach as broad a compromise as possible concerning embryonic stem cell research."
"It has not been easy, and I hope that on Thursday we will be able to find a solution that a clear majority in Parliament will support."
"As far as EURATOM is concerned, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was happy to adopt the proposal of the European Commission by a significant majority."
"At this point, I would like to express my admiration for the work of the Joint European Research Centre."
"The research carried out by this centre forms part of the framework programmes and yields extremely valuable results."
"Finally, I would like to state that in its work on the Seventh Framework Programme, the European Parliament has acted quickly, effectively and decisively."
"It has shown great maturity and political responsibility."
"I hope that the momentum will be maintained and the Seventh Framework Programme will be launched on 1 January 2007."
"The European scientific community and industry are waiting for a favourable start to the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Everyone in the European Union awaits the success of the Lisbon Strategy."
". – Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Buzek, on his excellent work."
"Our debate today on the Seventh Framework Programme is particularly important."
"It relates to the potential for Europe to implement an effective strategy of sustainable development, by investing in knowledge and the future, a policy which will allow it to stand up to international competition not by reducing employment standards and abolishing the social state, but by investing in education, research, innovation and excellence."
"In this direction, we as the European Parliament support in principle the need for a significant increase in the appropriations for the seventh framework programme."
"Unfortunately, at the European Council in December the restrictive, accounting mentality prevailed, for the financial perspective as a whole and for research and technology in particular."
"It is, of course, a question of the governments' credibility, when they blithely set important objectives for the development and competitiveness of the European economy and then fail to express the political will to finance research and technology policies adequately."
"With persistent negotiation on the part of Parliament, we achieved a compromise of EUR 50 521 000, which marginally improves the programme's prospects but is a far cry from the real requirements that need to be covered."
"It is certainly positive that an additional EUR 100 000 000 has been secured for access for small and medium-sized businesses to innovation technologies, as we all recognise their contribution to development and employment."
"It is also important that the energy sector has received a further EUR 150 000 000, because the further spread of renewable sources of energy and the rational use of energy are of vital importance."
"I should also like to emphasise that it is important to safeguard the potential for all regions of the European Union to access and apply the programmes under the framework programme as a basic policy of long-term development, convergence and social cohesion, with the core objective of combating the digital divide, the research and innovation divide within Europe."
"."
"Mr President, research and the upscaling of Europe’s economy is Europe’s new narrative."
"Europe used to be about coal and steel, then it was about agriculture and fisheries."
"For the future, Europe is going to be about research and development, and where Europe adds value in coordinating the two."
"From a development perspective I would say that it should be regional development."
"There is a clear complementarity between the research and regional development agendas."
"The key partners in actually delivering the grand research agenda that we set at European level are the cities and the regions and the businesses within those cities and regions."
"That complementarity is vital for the coordination of the policies, in order to make sure that one part of the Commission is not setting one set of agendas while another part of the Commission is setting a different set, and that the complementarity is not necessarily what it could be."
"I think it is also worth stating that I and others want to see a lot more synergy in FP7 – and, indeed, FP8 – between structural funds and research funding."
"While the budget for FP7 is far from what we wanted, it is even more important that we maximise the benefit between the synergies of the two funding streams."
"That debate will continue into FP8, though for now I would add my own congratulations to our rapporteur for his Herculean efforts."
"We support this compromise."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Buzek on the hard work he has put in over a long period of time, and, of course, the committee as well."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is an enormous step forward for science in the European Union, with a vastly increased budget."
"For bio-economy, as it is termed in the report, or agronomic research to you and me, this represents a much bigger step, because this research will from now on be dealt with under a separate heading, which is essential for all agronomic research."
"This is an enormous improvement."
"This is just as well in view of the rapid change that agriculture is undergoing, not only technologically, from food to food combined with bio-energy and the replacement of fossil fuels and plastics, but also in terms of organisational structures."
"Room is needed for that type of research too, and that room is now being created."
"I have one negative comment to make."
"One amendment that was tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and that was approved, insists on us sharing our expertise with the world’s poor countries where agriculture is so important."
"I should like to have the Commission’s word that this will actually be done, including in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"This expertise must be shared, because only then will the Framework Programme help fulfil the EU’s function in the world, namely that of social and sustainable globalisation."
"."
"Mr President, the way the fisheries sector is treated in the Seventh Framework Programme clearly contradicts the statements of the Community’s highest authorities and of the Member States on the priorities for the implementation of the new CFP."
"It also contradicts the policy that has just been presented by the European Commission – and that is President Barroso's great priority: an integrated maritime policy, or common policy that takes a holistic view of the seas."
"In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to point out that we need greater investment in scientific research in order to provide us with knowledge of all of the potentialities of the marine environment and ecosystems, not just – and I would emphasise this – in relation to fisheries, but also in relation to other extremely important issues such as pollution, climate change, progress on health and pharmacology, human and animal food and coastal planning."
"I would like to say therefore, ladies and gentlemen, that we are going to support all of the amendments that advocate this integration of the fisheries policy into the Seventh Framework Programme."
". – The Committee on Legal Affairs has considered the ethical questions surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells."
"Embryonic stem cells differ from ordinary stem cells in that they are not yet differentiated, and therefore, any component of the human organism can be grown from them."
"In compiling the opinion of the committee, I have given two ethical positions:"
"1) to use embryonic stem cells to treat such incurable diseases as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, infarcted myocardium, etc. This would help prevent premature death in adults, but the embryo itself would die,"
"2) to protect the embryo, but take away last hope from people suffering from incurable diseases."
"A majority of the Committee voted in favour of the second position."
"I am personally pleased that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has found a compromise and has submitted appropriate amendments, which I propose that we approve."
"Mr President, I should like to make it clear once more that Mr Sakalas is expressing a personal opinion here."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs does not have two positions."
"It has a clear, unambiguous position rejecting this funding of embryonic stem cells."
"I should ..."
"– Mrs Breyer, I must point out that we cannot reopen the debate of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Mr Sakalas clearly speaks on his own behalf."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, inequality between men and women is very prevalent in the research world."
"It prevents the Lisbon objectives from being achieved, and it is a barrier to European competitiveness."
"The very fact that European women are still underrepresented in the research world shows that Europe has huge potential that is not being exploited."
"It is a fact that women find it difficult to obtain research posts, simply because they are women."
"Even though the number of female candidates is now larger than the number of male candidates in almost all European countries, women come up against major obstacles in the male-dominated market for jobs in science."
"That is a state of affairs we must do something about."
"It is therefore important that, in implementing the Seventh Framework Programme, the Commission take account of the gender issue and help bring about a situation in which young female candidates have the same opportunities as men in competing for research funds."
"The composition of the new European Research Council is quite simply nothing less than a scandal."
"Of the 22 researchers that have been appointed, only four are women."
"The EU has a list of general rules governing equality, and these should, of course, also apply to the European Research Council."
"We in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have proposed that there be a balance of genders in the Research Council, which should always consist of no less than 40% of each gender."
"Commissioner, I do hope you will consider what kind of a signal we are sending out to the European research world by having so unequal a representation of women and men."
"It does not, in any case, help put an end to the gender-divided labour market in the research world."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent handling of an extremely difficult task."
"We can see that representatives of new Member States, too – in this case Poland, of which the rapporteur was of course prime minister – are excellently placed to get to the heart of such difficult subjects."
"I am pleased that, having been a researcher in the course of his career, he has demonstrated here in Parliament how important it is, when getting to the heart of the issues, to take a professional, objective, political approach."
"We can all welcome the piece of work in front of us and be proud that Parliament and the people have tabled so many amendments."
"The objective is crystal clear: we all want to live long, healthy lives."
"We need to carry out a great deal more research in this regard and see what can be done in the way of prevention."
"We want to improve employment as part of the Lisbon objectives."
"Mr Pühringer, the Head of the Government of Upper Austria, hit the nail on the head when he said that if we want to live healthy lives we have to execute policy accordingly, and that research is the basis for a sound social policy."
"We must always bear this in mind if we wish to achieve our growth objectives with the research programme, particularly in the field of exports."
"I believe that the European export sector is also capable of affording protection against globalisation in this regard."
"We need the world markets, we need the opening-up of the markets, and to this end we need excellent products and services."
"For this reason, it would make sense to endeavour to ensure that this programme does indeed start on 1 January 2007."
"I would be in favour of our attempting to begin a trialogue following Thursday’s vote, and then we may really be able to launch this programme on 1 January 2007."
"That would be a good thing for research, a good thing for our 2009 elections, and a good thing for Europe."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Buzek for his excellent cooperation and for the spirit with which he presided over the preparation of this framework programme, and, like him, I would say that the compromise amendments are supported by all the groups and therefore demonstrate Parliament's desire to clarify certain points."
"With particular regard to the European Research Council, Commissioner, I should like to tell you that it is clear that this new institution is vital for the scientific community."
"We, like you, are therefore very keen to ensure that it works as well as possible as part of an autonomous scientific community."
"That is the direction taken by our amendments on the matter, even though, legally, we will need to discuss it during the trialogue."
"That said, we should like to assure you that we are very interested in the European Research Council and that we consider it to be very important."
"Turning to the framework programme in general, we are, like you, rather disappointed by the reduction in funding, because we are aware how important it is as an instrument for the Lisbon policy."
"We also know that it could have a considerable multiplier effect."
"In this regard, the joint technology platforms and technology initiatives will play a vital role, and it will not necessarily be a question of money, but rather of setting up an effective public/private partnership at European level on certain major subjects."
"Be that as it may, all of these programmes must be based on excellence."
"It is a key aspect in the selection of projects, be it within the framework of collaborative research or under the headings 'capacities', 'ideas' and, above all, 'people', in other words researchers, because the most important thing is to have researchers who feel happy."
"However, in Europe today, we do not always give researchers the social and moral status they deserve."
"That is why the European Union must give a good example, by awarding high-quality Marie Curie fellowships, which build bridges between countries and help to slow down the brain drain."
"On the issue of embryonic stem cells, to which you referred, Commissioner, it is true that this branch of research represents a tiny fraction of the budget – barely one thousandth."
"Like you, I think that the projects undertaken under the aegis of the Sixth Framework Programme offer every guarantee of ethical quality and of the will to create European-scale projects that are beacons of excellence."
"That is why the compromise amendment adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy at the initiative of Mrs Gutiérrez, an amendment that I cosigned and that you support, recommends that we carry on with what has been done with the Sixth Framework Programme, in other words a case-by-case analysis that is vital if we are to achieve a level of excellence in a field of research that shows great promise for the future."
"With regard to the budget, we are, as we have said, all a little disappointed."
"I personally will watch closely to ensure that, over the first few years, you make the effort to increase the relative portion a little."
"It is true that an increase is planned, but it will not really make its presence felt until after 2009."
"For the 2007 and 2008 budgets, therefore, I think that, within the Commission, you should be able, on the basis of the very good implementation rates, to increase the relative portion, at any rate the portion obtained by Parliament following the discussions on the financial perspective."
"Even though this portion is somewhat symbolic, as it amounts to only EUR 340 million, we want it to be allocated to priorities such as the European Research Council and Marie Curie fellowships, without forgetting the thematic priorities."
"Parliament is very concerned about the environment and energy, and those are therefore the thematic priorities to which we want to provide more support."
"In addition, allow me to draw your attention – I think you are already aware of this, but I was surprised to find that the Council is less so – to the interaction between science and society."
"It is absolutely vital for us to develop a positive relationship between society and science in Europe, and for us to ensure that young people do not lose the taste for science and research."
"In this regard, the 'science and society' element sets an example throughout Europe, and we will therefore pay close attention to ensure that its budget is not reduced as the Council intends."
"Finally, I should also like to add my voice to those who have said that the Joint Research Centre plays a vital role and that its activities in the nuclear sector help to harmonise, at European level, the security issues that we all need to address."
"To conclude, we must make rapid progress regarding the participation rules."
"The simplification of programmes is an essential point in achieving the best possible participation."
"On that subject, we will have to keep a close eye on the calendar, because, as you have stressed, 1 January 2007 is approaching rapidly."
"Parliament will make a positive contribution to finding solutions regarding the participation rules, as it is doing in connection with the Seventh Framework Programme that we are going to adopt."
"That said, the two other partners, the Commission – though I have no doubts as to your own goodwill, Commissioner – and the Council must take matters in hand to ensure that the scientific community is given every reassurance regarding the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Once again, my congratulations on your work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome Commissioner Potočnik and thank Mr Buzek for the work carried out with the working group of shadow rapporteurs, which I think achieved some important consensual results."
"First of all, I should like to highlight the political aspect of the seventh framework programme, which represents a search for excellence at a European level."
"This is an important aspect because, in the wake of the change in scale that globalisation has forced us to make, it is crucial that research too should be done on a European scale so that it does not run the risk of being erased from the world political and scientific map."
"The seventh framework programme contains important innovations, such as the European Research Council, which has already been mentioned."
"I should like also to refer to the technological platforms, which we wanted in committee so that our small, medium-sized and large industries could be fully involved in research, development and innovation efforts."
"If they all work together, companies should be able to create a favourable climate for development and consequently for their overall competitiveness."
"Technological platforms are also extremely important because local institutions, universities and research centres take part in them."
"They are also an appropriate incentive for small and medium-sized enterprises, subject to the participation rules."
"They may thus provide SMEs with the ability to make and to influence decisions in this context as well."
"Lastly, I should like to emphasise the importance of science and society."
"I believe that risk analysis and risk management are examples of the kind of education that we should give people, so that they can develop the ability to make decisions in an informed way."
"I too am disappointed at the available resources, which are in fact inadequate for the role that research and development ought to play in Europe."
"."
"Mr President, rapporteur, Mr Buzek, it has been a pleasure to work with you and also with the shadow rapporteurs."
"I believe that there has been good feeling, a positive relationship and a spirit of consensus, which we in my group thank you for."
"The Seventh Framework Programme reflects all of the European Union’s opportunities and weaknesses."
"These same contradictions and opportunities reflect the European Union’s current crisis: the crisis of a Europe that wants to do certain things, but is unable to do them."
"A Europe that has goals and objectives in terms of innovation, technology and the economy, which wants to be a world leader, but which has great problems providing the money and getting States to commit themselves beyond their own narrow national interests."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the Seventh Framework Programme offers a great opportunity to promote innovation, to promote a new Europe, based on clean technologies and the knowledge of thousands and thousands of small companies, laboratories and young people, and to promote a future that, at one and the same time, creates employment, social cohesion and sustainability."
"That is where the future lies."
"I do not know whether we will be able to achieve it."
"I do not know whether we will be able to leave behind a past dominated by a heavy and dirty industry, based on big interests and monopolies of big companies."
"It remains to be seen whether this Seventh Framework Programme responds to these challenges."
"The first challenge: basic and fundamental science."
"We have created the European Research Council, made up of twenty-two people of high prestige."
"We are delighted; that is an important challenge."
"We believe that fundamental and basic science must be one of the great priorities."
"Another priority is to open up the doors of research and science to small and medium-sized businesses throughout Europe."
"The situation in this area has been poor, since the participation in the current programmes by small and medium-sized businesses and small laboratories is less that 10%."
"We have proposed an amendment aimed at achieving a minimum participation of 15% in all programmes."
"Parliament has the opportunity to open up the programme to everybody."
"We have the challenge of innovation."
"Technological innovation means promoting the flow of information and sharing information."
"Important European and US daily newspapers recently said that, in Europe, new investments were being made in computer and technology companies, precisely because there was more flexibility in that field."
"More flexibility and fewer obstacles to the flow of information, fewer intellectual property barriers. We are going to promote this exchange of information."
"We are going to promote this flow of information."
"We are going to create thousands and thousands of clusters of small businesses and we are going to be up to the challenge of creating this social cohesion and fabric based on knowledge."
"One of the challenges has been to increase the participation of small businesses and to create this cohesion."
"Another challenge has been the environmental crisis."
"This also stems from our current energy crisis."
"We profoundly regret the current rejection and marginalisation of renewable energies and efficiency within the current programmes."
"We doubly regret not having been able to achieve a separate budget line for renewable sources of energy."
"There is currently no way for the European citizens to know how much money is spent on solar energy or wind power."
"We do know, however, that far more is spent on nuclear energy."
"That is a political problem, it is a real problem, because, in the short and medium term, in a few years’ time, we will have to deal with the energy crisis precisely by means of renewable energy and efficiency."
"It is also a transparency problem."
"There has been a serious transparency problem, because we have not been able to find out how the money has been spent, not just in the case of energy, but also in many other areas of the Sixth Framework Programme."
"That has very much restricted the political debate in this House."
"I hope that people will be able to know how much money is spent on preventive and public health and how much money is spent on many other sectors. That information has not been available so far."
"I hope that this can be sorted out in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while acknowledging the efforts made by the Commissioner to double the funding for the seventh framework programme, we have to accept that, with the miserly agreement on the financial perspective, Europe has wasted an historic opportunity to further the knowledge-based society that is all too often evoked in the Lisbon Strategy and which, if starved of cultural growth and social cohesion, runs the risk of becoming a purely mercantile objective."
"We have failed to meet Europe’s expectations for such growth."
"Once again, I welcome the Commission’s decision to revitalise basic research in Europe after years in which priority was almost exclusively given to supporting applied research for industry."
"To that end a special programme of funding has been introduced with new participation rules, and a new, independent body has been set up to evaluate scientific excellence."
"Among the positive points in the seventh framework programme is the measure to support and train European researchers."
"Research is one of the fields in which human potential perhaps counts for more than economic instruments and infrastructure."
"The conditions have to be created to encourage the movement of scientists within Europe, to reverse the brain drain out of Europe and to attract new researchers from non-European countries instead."
"Concerns remain about possible delays in implementing the seventh framework programme in January next year, given that we still have to go through the approval phase for the specific programmes and the participation rules."
"I should like to focus on the individual areas for intervention, starting with medical research."
"Greater attention needs to be given to this kind of research, prioritising prevention above all, for instance in the fields of occupational diseases and safety at work. I tried to do that with the amendment that I tabled, which I shall re-table in this House on behalf of my group."
"With regard to ethical issues in medical research, I believe that the text approved by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is well-balanced, as the Commissioner noted, in that it establishes that no funding shall be given to research aimed at human cloning, that induces heritable mutations in the human genome, or that serves to create human embryos."
"However, it recognises the need for public medical research in the field of stem cells, not aiming at profit but rather at advancing medical knowledge."
"I think this is a valuable area on which we should find agreement within Parliament."
"It is also important to give open-source software a further boost and to address the energy issue, since the programme does not pay sufficient attention to renewables."
"I personally believe that Europe’s efforts in fusion research are important to counterbalance nuclear energy from fission."
"To conclude, although the seventh framework programme has missed making a quality leap, it does represent a step forwards on the way to creating a genuinely European research area, and I therefore thank Mr Buzek and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have accomplished."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the seventh framework programme and rapporteur for the ‘People’ specific programme, it is my duty first of all to thank Mr Buzek and all the Members with whom we undertook this difficult work in the knowledge that it had to be done quickly and well, even without any prospect of agreement on the financial perspective."
"I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and its chairman, Mr Chichester, who timetabled the work wisely and with foresight in such a way that the delay by the Council would not harm the outcome."
"Last but not least, I have to thank the staff and assistants who surpassed themselves in the long, tiring job of preparing the work and in researching and analysing the points that might lead – as in fact they did – to significant and honourable compromises."
"Having said that, and before I address some significant points in the framework programme and particularly in the ‘People’ specific programme, I should like to focus on the philosophy of the legislative structure and on the political aspect."
"The philosophy was to create a European research area that was autonomous and at the same time able to attract new talent and to prevent talent born and bred in Europe from emigrating."
"The philosophy was also to involve industries and SMEs and to broaden the horizons for research funding and innovative technologies."
"The objective was achieved in terms of structure, but not at all in terms of resources."
"The political aspect is linked in practice to the financial aspect, and both are linked to the much abused and hackneyed Lisbon Strategy."
"At Lisbon, Europe set itself the target of becoming a world leader again by 2010."
"A rational, pessimistic view is that this target cannot be reached, since other experienced and powerful players are operating on the world stage, with a wealth of means and resources that make our efforts fade into insignificance. In terms of financial resources, our efforts have not been and are still not equal to the task."
"In that respect it has to be recognised that the Member States have been short-sighted, as they have sacrificed our general interests to the interests of their own national budgets."
"Nevertheless, while we may have regrets about what might have been done better or about what else could have been done, it is only fair to acknowledge the fact, with hopeful optimism, that much significant progress has been made."
"I refer to the creation of the European research area, the fact that implementation of the European Charter for Researchers is mandatory for the Member States, the inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises among those that can compete for and benefit from research projects – in that respect Amendment 334 is significant; it has been signed by several groups and I recommend that it be approved – the introduction of funding for research into renewable and alternative energies, the funding of projects for the preservation of our cultural heritage, and funding through a specific programme for original ideas."
"As for the ‘People’ specific programme, thanks to a shrewd synergy between the Commission’s competent directorate-general and the shadow rapporteurs, the researcher has become a recognised figure with his or her own dignity and principal attributes; research has become a genuine profession and, as such, it enjoys protection and safeguards."
"Researchers and women researchers, whose right to have children and a family is recognised, without it being a further hindrance to their careers, are the most important element in research."
"No researchers means no research, few researchers means little research, and many researchers means a great deal of research."
"The presence of researchers with economic protection and social assistance, who are mobile and have their own charter implemented at last by all the Member States, means a wealth of talent for Europe and consequently a leading position in the field of innovation, which is an essential step in building a knowledge-based society."
"I should like to make a final remark on the additional budget that has been granted to the ‘People’ programme at the request of Mr Prodi and by the unanimous decision of the shadow rapporteurs, to whom I am grateful."
"That is a clear sign that the philosophy whereby people are the driving force behind research is both correct and successful."
"Mr President, I should like to comment on Mr Buzek’s proposals on nuclear research."
"Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution Britain was able to rely predominantly on its own indigenous energy resources: coal and then natural gas."
"But Britain, like many European countries, now faces an impending energy crisis."
"Coal still meets 35% of our energy needs but it is environmentally unfriendly."
"North Sea gas, which met 37.5% of our needs, is rapidly running out and since 2003 we have been forced to import gas."
"We have already passed from a surplus to a shortage and we are heading for an ever-widening shortfall."
"Nuclear energy provides about 22.5% of our needs but that nuclear capability is now rapidly coming to the end of its life cycle and our nuclear power stations will have to be decommissioned, so that by 2014 we will have lost about 70% of our capacity."
"Britain faces losing a very large proportion of its energy supplies relatively quickly."
"Unless other provisions can be made, very soon we will be forced to rely on foreign, unreliable and not necessarily friendly suppliers, for example, the Russian Federation."
"Energy conservation measures are necessary and desirable, but cannot make the necessary impact."
"With the best will in the world, renewable sources of energy, such as wind and waves, simply will not supply the amounts of energy required for major industrialised societies."
"Wind turbines will only work when the wind blows, which is 30% of the time, and require conventional power stations to back them up when the wind does not blow."
"They are worse than useless."
"Wave power only works in specific geographic locations."
"Other alternative methods are equally ineffective."
"France has already tackled the problem and installed the latest range of modern nuclear reactors, to the extent that they now supply about 70% to 80% of its electricity needs."
"Therefore I found much to agree with in Mr Buzek’s report."
"He is quite right to think in terms of a 50-year plan for sustainable and secure nuclear energy supplies that are safe and environmentally friendly."
"The first stage of that plan is to build sufficient new-generation nuclear power stations for the next 30 to 50 years."
"Stage two of the plan must, as he rightly says, consist of the development of nuclear fusion to deliver viable fusion plants within two generations."
"Where I have to part company with him is on the notion that this project should be done under the auspices of the European Union."
"Britain could build ten new nuclear power stations for the equivalent of less than two years’ contributions to the European budget."
"That would be money much better spent."
"The development of nuclear fusion is precisely the kind of international cooperative project that could be undertaken by independent sovereign governments, without any need for the institutions of the European Union intended to promote political integration by economic means, as indeed Euratom has done since its creation."
"Mr President, we are in favour of the research programme proposed, because it puts the emphasis on research into fusion energy and on the safety and management of waste."
"Nevertheless, we still have some concerns."
"We do not think that the 'fourth generation' power stations completely solve the current safety and environmental problems, and they also pose the problem of the large-scale transport of radioactive materials."
"Firstly, the designs set out, such as sodium-cooled fast reactors, seem to respond primarily to industrial interests."
"Secondly, with regard to informing the general public, 'the benefits from a safe use of nuclear power', to quote, must not, in view of the interests in play, result in the public being misinformed or even brainwashed."
"Finally, our enthusiasm for the international scientific cooperation that is coming into place, both for the fourth generation and for ITER, must not result in us losing sight of the fact that this cooperation is not synonymous with a lack of competition, and that the latter is based not on the principles of freedom of competition but on a strategic battle."
"We must prepare for this by defining clear strategies and by allocating the necessary resources to ensure that we do not simply replace our dependence on oil with dependence on something else."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like firstly to thank the rapporteur for the tireless work he has done over the last year and which we are now about to conclude."
"I would describe the Seventh Framework Programme as a great opportunity."
"What we really have once again is a great opportunity to demonstrate that the Lisbon Agenda was correct, that it was rigorous and that, furthermore, it is alive."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is a great opportunity in a key area: with regard to one of the fundamental elements of the Lisbon Strategy, which is research and the resulting innovation."
"In this regard, the Seventh Framework Programme will not just improve the way in which research is carried out."
"It also has a significant symbolic dimension and value as a reference point."
"In reality it is a flagship programme."
"It is a European Union programme that acts as a reference for third countries, in terms of what Europe wants where research is concerned, and it also has an impact and serves as a reference within the European Union, in terms of what we want in our joint action on research, and it is also going to serve as a reference for national research programmes."
"Some of the elements of the Seventh Framework Programme offer continuity, while others are innovative."
"Despite the obvious limitations in terms, for example, of budget, it has all of the instruments for creating competitiveness, which is essential in terms of growth and, therefore, of employment."
"The Seventh Framework Programme has led to a new instrument, the European Research Council, which is going to provide a more complete framework for the European Research Area, and the Seventh Framework Programme also adopts a new approach to small and medium-sized businesses."
"It is entirely our responsibility to ensure that the Seventh Framework Programme is a success."
"The instruments are there, and whether or not the Seventh Framework Programme becomes a motor for competitiveness, development and growth in Europe depends entirely on us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need to increase investment in research is widely accepted throughout the European political classes."
"However, the Seventh Framework Programme is a perfect illustration of the current gulf between our ambitions and the reality in Europe."
"The Commission proposed appropriations amounting to EUR 72 billion, then the governments reduced the European effort to EUR 50 billion."
"Even though Parliament managed to release an additional EUR 340 million or so, it has to be said that national egos have got the upper hand over the ambitious strategy that aimed to make Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world."
"But the glass is only half empty – for the next seven years, the appropriations allocated to research will nonetheless constitute the EU's third budget."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament generally supports the proposals set out in Mr Buzek's report, and we particularly support the compromises negotiated by Mr Busquin, our expert on this subject."
"My group attaches considerable importance to freedom of research."
"In this regard, the creation of the European Research Council represents a major step forward."
"We must trust the real scientists to evaluate the research programmes and assess the priorities."
"In this context, we must be wary of so-called 'ethical' discussions."
"Ethics has never been an exact science: it has always evolved with the level of human knowledge."
"That is also true for embryonic and adult stem cells."
"Why do Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and adherents of other religions not have the same concerns as some Catholics regarding embryonic stem cell research?"
"It is because the Catholic ethical view dates from the First Vatican Council of 1869, which promulgated that all embryos had a soul."
"Whilst all religious beliefs deserve respect, science must not be ruled by religious interdictions."
"The vast majority of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in favour of basic research, including research using adult and embryonic stem cells."
"Europe owes it to itself to support all serious research in this field, even if it remains illegal in some countries."
"The EU also supports nuclear research, even though certain countries no longer want civilian nuclear power."
"Our only interdiction is against human cloning."
"Consequently, Mr President, my group encourages Commissioner Potočnik to forge ahead with his defence of the Europe of research in all its aspects, in the same frame of mind that he showed just now."
"Mr President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his presentation, but I am particularly obliged, of course, to our rapporteur, Mr Buzek, with whom not only the shadow rapporteurs, but also the rapporteurs for the innovation framework programme enjoyed very close cooperation of an excellent standard."
"This cooperation will also be important if it becomes apparent not only that Europe is still an inventive continent – a great many things in the world have originated here – but also that FP7 represents the correct response to global changes."
"Let us make one thing clear: power and powerlessness in the face of globalisation have less and less to do with military aspects and arms, and more and more to do with knowledge, with dominance in and the ability to control certain production processes."
"That is what we have to address, and for that FP7 is a very important building block."
"Yet it can bring Europe forward only if we manage to turn invention into innovation – and of course Mr Buzek has cooperated very closely with us in this regard, on ensuring that our research and innovation framework programmes overlap, and on ensuring that more products, more services and more licences originate in Europe."
"I am obliged to him for this."
"I should also like to address a direct question to the Commissioner, however, on behalf of myself and my colleague Mr Manders."
"As we know, there is a Eurobarometer survey that examines the ethical issue that Mr Goebbels has just mentioned, and ascertains the views of Europeans on embryonic stem cell research."
"We know that the survey has been completed, but we do not know the results, as it appears that the survey has not yet been published."
"Can you tell us why it has not been published, and what it reveals?"
"Since we are to vote on this sensitive issue this week, it would be very good – a helpful pointer – for us MEPs if we knew the thoughts of the citizens of this continent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow rapporteurs, Mr Buzek, I should like to comment in particular on the energy research on which Europe is now to decide for many years hence."
"Of course, this Parliament is not permitted to exert any real influence on the majority of the energy-research funds spent under the Euratom Treaty and may in fact influence only a minority of the funds spent under the Seventh Research Framework Programme."
"Since Mr Chatzimarkakis has mentioned public opinion on research, I must say that the imbalance being decided on is inexcusable particularly as regards the question of what the public thinks."
"It is certainly no longer in keeping with the times to spend the majority of energy-research funding on nuclear fusion, under Euratom, without democratic control."
"Nuclear fusion will make no contribution to the Lisbon objectives."
"I see Lisbon as our resolving to fight climate change efficiently and secure employment in the coming years."
"How is it possible to combat climate change using a technology that even leading scientists say will make no contribution to energy supply in the next 40–50 years?"
"Climate-protection objectives must be achieved by 2020 or we can forget Kyoto."
"Nor will employment benefit from a technology that is restricted to a few very large research centres."
"It is true that we are attempting to secure some of the funds under the Seventh Research Framework Programme for efficiency and renewable energy sources – there are some interesting amendments on this."
"Nevertheless, even this amendment on the bundling of funds for efficiency and renewable energy will do nothing to redress the irresponsible imbalance in favour of nuclear research."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a common research policy for the European Union should produce the sort of scientific and economic added value that is not achievable through the efforts and actions of individual Member States and private companies."
"An example of a good joint project is the financing of fusion energy research associated with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)."
"My view is therefore different from that of Mrs Harms before me."
"This is a project which individual Member States should not try and implement alone."
"It is one whose success will be by no means guaranteed within the next 50 years."
"The research needed, however, should be completed."
"Energy-guzzling humanity can ill afford not to examine this possibility."
"The research is also bound to mean making the sort of discoveries that in English is known as ‘serendipity’."
"Something will be discovered which one did not know one was looking for, but which was discovered as a by-product of fusion energy research proper."
"In that respect, money for research will not be wasted, even if we never succeed in taming the actual fusion process so that more energy is produced using it than is needed to get the process started."
"Third countries are also involved in ITER: the United States of America, Russia, Japan, and even China."
"It is quite right to use the funds in the EU’s Research Framework Programme for this truly international project."
"At the same time we need to do more research into renewable energy sources and make more use of them, and in this respect I am of the same opinion as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I congratulate the rapporteurs, because we welcome the seventh framework programme."
"At last, we have the first practical and effective instrument for revitalising European competitiveness at a global level and an important stimulus for investment in innovation to support European businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is a first step on the way to achieving the Lisbon objectives, about which there has been a lot of talk so far, but very little has been accomplished."
"Indeed, for the sake of Europe’s growth and development, it is crucial to finance programmes directed at technological development and scientific research."
"That is also why it is essential that the programme should aim at enhancing human resources and especially at encouraging young people to take up a career in research, thus preventing the brain drain."
"It must be made clear, however, that the seventh framework programme must under no circumstances fund research into human cloning, genetic mutations or the use of embryonic stem cells."
"We have therefore signed some amendments that clarify how the funds are to be spent, in accordance with national legislations."
"Research must certainly move ahead, but that must not occur at just any price."
"We have to take a clear, uncompromising stand against any funding of research involving manipulation of genetic or embryonic material, which not only goes against ethical values and respect for human life and dignity, but is also a threat to public health."
"The Seventh Framework Programme for research 2007-2013 contains a controversial component, that being research involving the use of stem cells from embryos."
"This type of research, in which human embryos are killed, is ethically and constitutionally problematic, and the text from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on which we are about to vote, does not take sufficient account of this."
"I urge the House to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by – among others – Mr Gargani, Mrs Záborská and myself, and also the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"These amendments force the framework programme to move away from embryo stem cell research and look for alternatives, which are certainly available in the form of research on adult stem cells and on stem cells from blood extracted from the umbilical cord."
"These offer excellent prospects for the development of new therapies against diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s."
"Moreover, embryo stem cell research is liable to punishment in certain Member States, which would then, through Community funds, be helping to subsidise research that is illegal in their own country."
"That is in contravention of the subsidiarity principle and does not do much in the way of promoting confidence in the European institutions among EU citizens."
"The funding of this research is a clear example of an area that should fall within the remit of the Member States."
"It is important that politicians do not, through the policies they make, acquiesce passively in the killing of embryos."
"Research of that kind should certainly not be promoted by the European Union."
"It is, in that respect, important to recognise that more and more efforts are being made to create no more embryos than are needed for each fertility treatment."
"This is something that new IVF technology makes easier."
"Finally, apart from funding embryo stem cell research, there is another unwanted aspect to the proposal by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and that is the review clause."
"The Committee on Industry would like to review the exclusions from the Commission proposal at the halfway stage of the framework programme’s term."
"Things that spring to mind are what are referred to as reproductive cloning and creating human embryos only for research purposes, which are not, at present, eligible for European funding."
"A review of such exclusions, as advocated by the Committee on Industry, would also call into question the otherwise minimal exclusions."
"We have to make the right choice now, though, the choice in favour of committing to alternative forms of research without any ethical problems, since the latter does not involve the killing of embryos."
"We must not compromise the truth that life is worthy of protection, for life is entrusted to us by God and we must not take it into our own hands."
"– Mr President, it is highly immoral to force Member States to provide funding for what they consider to be unethical."
"This includes the proposal for the funding of research into embryonic stem cells."
"So far, research into stem cells from adult tissue has yielded positive results."
"These results are useful for therapeutic purposes."
"However, research into embryonic stem cells has not yet yielded positive results."
"Meanwhile, at least 80% of funding for stem cell research is earmarked for embryonic stem cells."
"Why is that the case?"
"The reason is that the results of research into embryonic stem cells can be used to produce cell lines and therefore guarantee a profit for pharmaceutical companies."
"The results of research into adult stem cells deliver technology which uses the patient’s own tissue for therapeutic purposes after it is processed."
"This will not generate profits for pharmaceutical companies."
"The European Union should not fund research which raises moral questions, such as research into embryonic stem cells."
"We must support Mr Gargani’s amendments."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to mention health and energy."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety wishes to increase the share of the research budget relating to health."
"EU-funded research into health needs to emphasise those areas which the pharmaceutical industry ignores; for example, cures for neglected diseases."
"These are the diseases which the world’s poor suffer from, though these people are of no interest to the pharmaceutical firms."
"EU funding for research needs to stress the importance of the prevention of disease and the impact of the environment impact on health, something which is of no interest to the pharmaceutical business either, but which is crucial to our health and well-being."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would also like to increase the share relating to energy."
"Financing for energy must match our commitments to climate, because otherwise there is a danger that we will lag behind the United States of America and Japan in the development of new technologies."
"Research funding in this area should be on a massive scale."
"Money for research into energy should first and foremost go to technologies that will result in reduced emissions fast; in other words, energy efficiency and renewable energy."
"It is foolish for us to continue with the distorted policy that has gone on for decades whereby we allocate more funds to research into nuclear energy via Euratom than the total for EU funds for other areas of energy research."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety wants Euratom just to focus on nuclear safety and research into the treatment of nuclear waste."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the seventh framework programme is the creation of a Europe unfortunately in decline, despite its provision of EUR 50 524 million over seven years."
"If we do the sums, that amount corresponds to an average of EUR 7 217 million per year, which in my country is the equivalent of half a percentage point of GDP, in France an even smaller percentage, in the United Kingdom even less, and in Germany a quarter of a percentage point of GDP."
"Europe is weak."
"The only compromise that it has been possible to reach on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 is too little for the European Parliament, for the European Commission, and also for European research."
"Left over from a Europe still disoriented by the failure to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, the multiannual budget agreement reflects the difficulties of an uninspiring economic cycle, and it has therefore not allowed us to double our financial commitment for the immediate future of European research, as we had hoped, the Lisbon agenda."
"This framework programme, the first one in the Europe of 25, reflects a decision to maintain substantial continuity with the previous one."
"It recognises the importance that the last one accorded to research cooperation, which is a sign of European added value; it shows consideration for small and medium-sized enterprises, for which it facilitates the transfer of research content through technological platforms; and it is careful to budget for administrative costs."
"The programme, however, also intends to innovate by setting up the European Research Council, a new instrument that should distinguish itself through its ability to bring European research together, acting as a focus for excellence."
"A number of doubts have arisen as to the need to create this new body, and they should certainly not be ignored."
"These doubts still persist after the debate on its independence and autonomy, but they may vanish in view of the performance and results that the European Research Council will be able to achieve."
"I therefore wish them all every success in their work."
"We shall take the greatest care to ensure that the European Research Council does not become yet another European bureaucratic shambles."
"Our children would not forgive us if it did."
"There is just one matter that remains unsettled, and more than any other it stirs our conscience in a variety of ways: the question of ethics."
"It is not written down that the European Union wants to fund human cloning."
"Instead, it has the freedom to fund projects that successfully pass through a two-tier appraisal of the content of each individual project, based on the national laws currently in force."
"I think it is a good compromise that everyone can accept."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to greet Commissioner Potočnik, Mr Buzek and all the shadow rapporteurs and thank them for the climate of cooperation that they succeeded in creating while drawing up this seventh framework programme."
"Europe has to make considerable improvements to produce new knowledge through basic research, in disseminating it through education and training, and in applying it through innovation, not least in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"These are the conditions for achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"The seventh framework programme is a step in this direction."
"In relation to this new knowledge, the European Research Council has been set up to boost basic research."
"I welcome this revitalisation of basic research: research at the frontiers of knowledge, promoting dynamism, competitiveness and creativity at the highest level."
"This new body, which is a response to the pressing demands of the European scientific community, must feature independent scientific judgment, fast procedures and rapid decision-making."
"Parliament has clearly emphasised and again reiterates that excellence must be the sole criterion to guide selection."
"As for the legal structure of the European Research Council, I hope that it will be possible during the trialogue to eventually converge on a more widely accepted solution."
"It is appropriate to emphasise the great importance of human resources."
"Researchers are a vital link between new knowledge and its application in innovative technologies and processes."
"This link does not work very well in Europe, and a sign of this poor connection is that, although Europe produces twice as many PhDs as the United States, the United States has twice as many PhDs in industry as Europe has."
"It is no coincidence that a good 400 000 researchers who received their doctorates in science and technology in Europe are now in the United States."
"We need new researchers in order to reach the target of eight researchers for every 1 000 employees, both men and women."
"At this time, a large proportion will have to be women, since they make up only 29% of the scientific community, and measures need to be identified that can make it easier for them to enter this career, such as measures to reconcile work and family life for both men and women."
"The new Constitutional Treaty provided for the creation of the European research area."
"I reiterate the idea by talking about a ‘European area of researchers’, in other words a single job market that could be organised partly through the creation of a European researchers’ association or an umbrella organisation of researchers’ associations, which could be a useful body for enhancing their role in the European context."
"A final recommendation concerns embryonic stem cells."
"We should affirm the principle of research freedom, which must have scientific rigour as its basic tenet."
"Moreover, research must be given the opportunity to exercise control publicly in particularly sensitive areas of research."
"I therefore call for confirmation of the position adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which accommodates the opinions of those for and against embryonic stem cell research."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by joining with those who have thanked and congratulated our rapporteur, Mr Buzek, and by saying how disappointed I am at this budget of EUR 54 billion or so over seven years, which we had hoped would be more ambitious, much more ambitious, in the interests of the Europe of excellence of which we are all dreaming."
"In this regard, the creation of the European Research Council is absolutely essential."
"As others have dwelt upon it at length before me, including Mr Brunetta, I will not go into the details now."
"Another sensitive area for Europe is energy, and the various schemes thought up for moving on from the petroleum era, with a package of EUR 2 385 000 000, the budget retained by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which gives priority to renewable energy."
"Biofuels and biomass form part of the solution, which also needs to involve education to reduce consumption."
"In the opinion of the majority of my group, this European desire to look beyond the long term and to go down the path of scientific freedom to help those who most need it goes through the continuity of European funding for embryonic stem cell research."
"This research must be funded in the same way as research on stem cells from adults or from umbilical cord blood."
"That is what Amendment 66 proposes."
"The only real compromise from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which is supported by Mr Busquin, Mrs Gutiérrez, Mrs Locatelli and a whole series of speakers before me, as well as by myself and a large proportion of my group, relates to the danger of a deadline for the eligibility of lines, because it would be – as the Commissioner reminded us – a real bombshell for European researchers."
"It is this freedom of choice that I am defending, the choice of healing in the face of death, of the hope provided by research on embryos for patients suffering from one of 6 000 rare diseases."
"From time to time we need to dot the i's and cross the t's."
"What we are talking about here, what we care about, is research and compassion, not fantasies of cloning out of , which is the impression one gets sometimes."
"More than 70% of European citizens are asking us – are asking you, Commissioner – not to hinder such a promising area of research."
"That figure comes from the Eurobarometer of 2005, and I agree with Mr Chatzimarkakis regarding the failure to publish the figures from 2006, which I know is not down to you."
"What is the Presidency waiting for before it authorises the publication of these figures?"
"Mr President, this vote is also a litmus test of whether the EU is a community of values or whether human dignity and human rights are under threat."
"Regarding embryos as exploitable material risks opening the ethical floodgates."
"We have some very successful alternatives such as adult stem cells and research on umbilical-cord blood cells."
"It is incomprehensible why the EU is unnecessarily risking dividing the EU on this."
"The cloning scandal in South Korea has made it clear that a principle, too, is at stake, namely the ban on commercialising the human body – the female body in particular."
"Women are degraded to the level of suppliers of egg cells as raw materials."
"The proposal by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy even entails the risk of setting in motion human cloning, because the revision clause envisages exactly that."
"I would plead, therefore, that we not be responsible for opening the door to the acceptance of embryonic stem cell research in Member States in which this is prohibited – that would be questionable from the point of view of democratic politics – and certainly not be responsible for paving the way for human cloning."
"Mr President, if we think that access to safe and cheap energy is an inalienable right and if we want everyone to be able to consume the energy necessary to his or her development, we cannot but concur with the objectives stated in the report by our fellow MEP, Mr Buzek."
"We must give our full backing to ITER and to nuclear fusion."
"It is a solution for the future that will guarantee the independence of our energy supply, access for all to electricity and the development of skilled jobs in industry."
"Let us at the same time acknowledge that alternative sources of energy will not allow us to respond to demand and that fossil-based sources of energy just make pollution worse."
"Faced with this reality, I am, however, surprised that it is being proposed to us that we reduce the funds allocated to Euratom."
"We should, emphatically, be doing the opposite."
"Moreover, only public control, as distinct from the single energy market, will enable us in complete safety to achieve the objectives set by Euratom."
"If France has one of the least expensive energy supplies and is a developed nation, this is because of nuclear power and because the production and distribution of electricity has been a public monopoly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to start by giving my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Buzek, for his months of work and his efforts to arrive at workable compromises."
"I wish to take up two points in this debate."
"Firstly, I should like to speak about the European Research Council."
"As has been mentioned several times already, the establishment of this Council is the novelty in the Seventh Research Framework Programme."
"As the rapporteur for this Research Council, its success, which is also particularly dependent on its structure, is of course especially important to me."
"We need this Research Council. It will make Europe more attractive to top researchers."
"It is intended to strengthen basic research, a field that has been too long neglected in Europe in recent years, even though this field, in particular, has seen pioneering developments."
"I need only remind the House of inventions such as laser technology or X-rays or the MP3 player."
"All of these discoveries were made through basic research, of which we need to make much greater, more targeted use."
"Another important point with regard to the Research Council is that its work must be transparent."
"The Research Council has been given substantial resources – we are talking about an annual budget of approximately EUR 1 billion – and, in view of this, I believe that we need to set up a body to ensure transparency."
"The European Research Council must not be a closed shop."
"I should like to make it clear that it is not my intention that this Research Council be under any control."
"It goes without saying that it and its work must be independent, but its work must be comprehensible to the research community, politicians, decision-makers and the public alike."
"My second point concerns the issue of what is to benefit from European funds; after all, the budget is relatively small."
"That is why we must focus European research money on top-level research alone, and thus excellence should be the sole criterion for the selection of projects."
"In conclusion, we must not permit any research on embryos."
"We must not permit embryos to be produced for research."
"I have drawn up a compromise amendment for this field – Amendment 319 – which I do not have time to explain, but I would ask my fellow Members to support this amendment."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Buzek and Mr Busquin and thanking them, as well as the Commissioner, for the important work they have done, because the issue we are dealing with today, ladies and gentlemen, is key to the strategy being drawn up for the coming years."
"If, since Lisbon, our objective has been to achieve a dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, research, development and innovation are undoubtedly the main tools for promoting growth, employment and competitiveness, and the Seventh Framework Programme is going to determine the main elements of our scientific policy for the next seven years."
"Our main objective has been to respond to the great challenges faced by our science, technology and innovation in order to reduce the gap separating us from our competitors."
"These challenges were identified, studied and analysed exhaustively in the Locatelli report."
"Our work has not been without difficulties, particularly following the agreement on the financial perspective which reduced our initial economic horizon."
"Our work is not finished, but it is clear that everybody has the will to reach the best possible final agreement, and I believe that today, on the whole, we can feel satisfied with how far we have come."
"In its Cooperation programme, the Seventh Framework Programme includes powerful tools for stimulating private investment in research."
"The People programme provides for important measures to increase the human resources dedicated to research, in terms of both quantity and quality, in order to make Europe more attractive to researchers and in order to slow down their exodus and to promote the incorporation of women."
"Support for high-quality basic research also appears to be guaranteed with the creation of the European Research Council, which is still to be given its full shape."
"The objective of improving the links between the world of research and the business world – and I mean small and medium-sized businesses in particular – can also be achieved by means of the measures included in the Cooperation programme and the Capacities programme."
"Furthermore, through this work, our Parliament is confirming its commitment to the Lisbon Strategy, and important steps are being taken towards the achievement of the two great objectives set for 2010 to create the European Research Area and to achieve an overall spending on R+D of 3% of GDP, with just a third coming from the public sector and the remaining two-thirds from the private sector."
"Ladies and gentlemen, through the Seventh Framework Programme we can state that the Union's scientific programme has undoubtedly been strengthened and, as shadow rapporteur for the Seventh Framework Programme Euratom and in view of what happened at the last Council, I would like to emphasise the great importance of having the ITER programme in Europe – it means strengthening our leadership in fusion energy as an important way to achieve a mass, sustainable and safe energy supply – and how much it can promote the future of European industry."
"With regard to fission, I would like to re-state our commitment to renewable energy, although I accept that nuclear fission energy is now inevitable, given the high demand for energy and given that we still have few mass sources of energy available to us."
"I would emphasise the need to continue research into safety, the management of waste and …"
"We shall carry on working."
"Congratulations, Mr Potočnik."
"Mr President, my contribution to the debate on this Seventh Framework Programme on Research and Development will relate to two subjects: the stem cells issue and the budget."
"Research in the field of embryonic stem cells has enabled medicine to make a great leap forward."
"A lot of hope is pinned on this research, particularly in connection with the treatment not only of cancer but also of genetic diseases hitherto regarded as incurable, as well as in connection with the perfecting of medicines."
"The European Union needs to make cautious but definite progress in this area."
"That is why it has put in place the world’s most advanced monitoring and evaluation system, involving the agreement of the programming committee, analyses by independent experts and by national and European committees on ethics and, not least, the obligation to respect the legal frameworks of the Member States in which the research is carried out."
"It is vital to fund research on embryonic stem cells for a number of reasons: to monitor activities in this area, to ensure that our ethical values are respected, to facilitate and protect scientific advances made by European researchers and to enable us to go on competing with third countries."
"That is why it is the amendment adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy that should be voted in favour of next Thursday."
"With regard to the budget, I can only join the previous speakers in deploring how little it amounts to."
"I would nonetheless warn against the temptation to draw on funds from areas such as agriculture and energy, which are in need of money while other sectors appear to have been funded too generously."
"In this connection, I think it imperative to hold a debate on the funding of the Joint Research Centre."
"At the same time as commending our rapporteur for his excellent work, I very much wish, in conclusion, to emphasise how crucially important this programme is."
"By putting in place a European Research Area, we reduce the risk of those who develop innovative projects going and looking for their sources of funding elsewhere. It is a way of giving a dramatic boost to growth and competitiveness."
"The Seventh FPRD is one of the means that will enable Europe to move forward and our people to benefit in everyday life from the fruits of European research."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Buzek, all the more because we are facing a difficult decision on a report which I consider to be of key importance in the controversial discussions over continuing nuclear research and especially nuclear fusion research."
"I am wholly in favour of developing what is the greatest scientific partnership project in the world."
"I say that as someone who has had personal experience of cutting-edge science and technology, and also as an MEP with personal knowledge of the excellent results from the European nuclear fusion research centre in the United Kingdom."
"Yes, money is lacking in many areas and it is no easy matter to decide on such a costly research project as ITER."
"Yet we have to take vital steps for the future if we want to retain the unique position of European science in this area."
"I am in favour of maintaining the budget for thermonuclear fusion research without including the costs of ITER."
"We are taking a decision for the future energy independence of Europe."
"Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction over the fact that the Czech Republic has made and will continue to make a major contribution both to nuclear fusion research and to the ITER project."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme that we are debating have been well formulated."
"Being a farmer, I am pleased to observe that, compared to the Sixth Framework Programme, far more attention is now being paid in the draft to the broader implications of agriculture for society as a whole."
"However, I would like to point out some deficiencies regarding the participation of the new Member States in the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes."
"When we look at the map of excellence network participants in the Sixth Framework Programme, we find only blank spaces in the east."
"This is not, after all, how we have envisaged our common Europe."
"Ongoing studies also suggest that, relative to their size, the new Member States should have been awarded three times more projects and perhaps allocated as much as tenfold the amount of financial support."
"The Commission and relevant governments are therefore facing the pressing task of applying specific instruments in the work plans of the technical areas and challenges of the Framework Programme to promote greater involvement of the new Member States."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I consider that Parliament has done a very good job."
"My warmest congratulations to our rapporteur, Mr Buzek."
"I wish to comment on two amendments already approved by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy:"
"Amendment 273: this amendment refers to the chapter entitled 'Research infrastructures' and seeks to support excellence in the convergence regions and outermost regions."
"It quite simply suggests that, in the event of two equally excellent proposals for new research infrastructures, we need to consider which option will contribute more to the strengthening and expansion of the excellence of European research agencies."
"The fact that, over the period from 2000 to 2006, 50% of public and private money in research went to just 30 of the 254 regions of the European Union bears witness to the fact that excellence is trapped."
"Amendment 66 on embryonic stem cells."
"I consider that this amendment is correct both from a philosophical point of view and from the point of view of protecting human rights and respect for human life."
"In addition, I consider that it is the most correct of the four views on the table, because we cannot set restrictive dates."
"This is to the detriment of research itself, in that it restricts it to stem cells either of inferior quality or of limited potential and will force our researchers to go to other countries outside the European Union which have stocks of stem cells of these specific dates."
"We cannot cite subsidiarity and exclude the financing of leading edge research sectors on the grounds that one or some of the Member States prohibit it because, if we take that to its logical conclusion, I would say that it is unfair for countries which prohibit stem cell research to make use of the results from countries which allow it because, in the final analysis, it is certain that adult stem cell research does not suffice for all applications."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our Assembly is getting ready to vote in favour of the Seventh Framework Programme on Research and Development, which will thus be operational no later than by 1 January 2007."
"We wish to avoid the risk of a lost year for research, so strategically important is this area if we are to compete effectively with the United States, India and China."
"The gamble has almost paid off, and I warmly congratulate our Commissioner, Mr Potočnik, and our rapporteur, Mr Buzek."
"Research must help strengthen our unity, thanks to people and territories being integrated into the European Research Area, and at the same time favour an intelligent and lasting development model while also demanding excellence and efficiency."
"Shall we achieve this, however?"
"Where financial resources are concerned, these are inadequate, even if the budgetary agreement adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and proposed in plenary is satisfactory inasmuch as it seeks as best as possible to counter the weakness of the budget obtained within the framework of the Financial Perspective."
"I should like to reiterate my regrets on this matter and tell the Member States that they absolutely must recognise how important research is for growth and employment and, when the Financial Perspective is revised, prepare to supplement the financial resources allocated to this sector."
"Where content is concerned, the wording voted in favour of by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy presents a satisfactory balance, even if I regret that more support was not given to the international cooperation designed to enable development to take place and to stem the brain drain."
"It is a good thing that the emphasis has been placed on health, sustainable development and energy, as well as on ICTs, to which 40% of our growth is attributable."
"With regard to structures and the future, I am particularly pleased that the European Research Council will soon be in operation."
"The ERC, with its 22-member scientific committee, meets the expectations of the research community."
"It will thus be possible to fund vital basic research in a simple way via this body operated by and for the scientific community."
"Moreover, individual grants are to be awarded in recognition of excellence and on the basis of criteria defined by the scientists."
"The Council, which will give the European Union a genuine angle on the future and secure for it the trust of the world of research, will be characterised by independence and transparency."
